And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Hmm.\n\nSo, the input consists of two integers n and k. Then a sequence of n integers representing the sleep times for each day. We need to find the average of the sums of each consecutive k-day window, right?\n\nWait, let me think. For example, if n=3 and k=2, then there are 3-2+1 = 2 weeks. The weeks would be [a1,a2], [a2,a3]. So the sum for each week is a1+a2 and a2+a3. Then the average is (sum1 + sum2)/2.\n\nSo, the approach is to compute the sum of each window of size k, then sum all those sums and divide by the number of windows, which is n-k+1.\n\nBut wait, how do we efficiently calculate the sum for each window without doing O(nk) operations, which could be slow for large n and k?\n\nHmm, because n can be up to 2e5, so O(n) methods are needed. A naive approach would be O(n*k), which for 2e5*2e5 is 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a way to compute the sum for each window in O(1) per window after some pre-processing.\n\nYes! Using a sliding window technique. The idea is to compute the sum of the first window, then for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's leaving and add the new element entering.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n, k.\n2. Read the array a.\n3. Compute the initial window sum: sum of a[0] to a[k-1].\n4. Add this initial sum to a running total.\n5. Slide the window by one each time:\n   a. Subtract the element that's leaving the window (i.e., a[i - k]).\n   b. Add the new element entering the window (i.e., a[i]).\n   c. Add this new sum to the running total.\n6. After processing all windows, divide the running total by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n7. Output this average with sufficient precision.\n\nThat sounds manageable. Let's think about the data structures. Since the array can be up to 2e5 elements, using a list is fine.\n\nNow, handling the indexes correctly is crucial. For the initial window, from index 0 to k-1. Then, for each i starting from k to n-1, the window is from i - k + 1 to i.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, when i=k, the window starts at i -k +1 = 1, ends at i =k. So yes, the window is from 1 to k.\n\nEach time, we subtract a[i -k] and add a[i].\n\nSo the code structure would be something like:\n\ntotal = 0\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\ntotal += current_sum\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n    total += current_sum\n\nThen, average = total / (n -k +1)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nBut what about the data types? Since the numbers can be up to 1e5 and n up to 2e5, the maximum sum is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10. Adding that many times could lead to very large numbers, but in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nSo no issues with integer overflow, unlike in other languages.\n\nRegarding the output: it needs to be printed with at least six decimal places. So, we can format it as a floating-point number with 10 decimal digits, for example.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n and k.\n- Read the array.\n- Compute the initial sum.\n- Iterate through the rest of the elements, updating the current_sum and adding to the total.\n- Compute the average, then print it with enough decimal places.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample:\nInput:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nInitial sum: 3+4=7\nSecond window: 4+7=11\nTotal sum is 18. Average is 18/2 =9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\nInput:\n1 1\n10\n\nOnly one window, sum is 10. Average is 10. So output is 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample:\nn=8, k=2.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the third sample's input is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'\n\nWait n=8, k=2. So 8-2+1=7 windows.\n\nCompute each window's sum:\n\nDay 1-2: 1+2=3\n2-3:2+4=6\n3-4:4+100000=100004\n4-5:100000+123=100123\n5-6:123+456=579\n6-7:456+789=1245\n7-8:789+1=790\n\nSumming all these:\n\n3 +6=9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201,960; +790=202,750.\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\n3 +6 =9; 9+100004=100013; 100013+100123=200136; 200136+579=200715; 200715+1245=201,960; 201,960 +790=202,750.\n\nSo total is 202750.\n\nDivide by 7: 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich is the sample output.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- When k equals n: only one window, sum is the sum of all elements. Average is same as sum.\n\n- When k is 1: each day is a window. Sum is sum of all elements. Average is same as sum divided by n.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, k=1. Then two windows, each is a single element. Sum is a1 +a2, average is (a1 +a2)/2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing it.\n\nIn Python, reading the input: first line is n and k, then the second line is the list.\n\nWe can read the first line via input().split(), converting to integers.\n\nThe second line is another input().split(), converted to integers.\n\nOnce we have the list, proceed as above.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif len(a) !=n:\n    # shouldn't happen, but just in case\n    pass\n\nThen, compute the initial sum:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal = current_sum\n\nThen loop from i in range(k, n):\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\ntotal += current_sum\n\nThen, average = total / (n -k +1)\n\nPrint with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but what about when n=0 or k=0? But according to the problem statement, 1 ≤ k ≤n, so we don't have to worry about division by zero.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=2\n\na=[3,4,7]\n\ncurrent_sum=3+4=7, total=7.\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_sum =7 -3 +7 = 11. total becomes 7+11=18.\n\naverage 18/2=9.0 → printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=1, k=1.\n\ncurrent_sum=10. total=10.\n\nNo more loops. average 10/1=10.0.\n\nSample3:\n\nAs computed earlier, the code will sum all the windows correctly.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, k=2.\n\na = [1,2,3,4]\n\nWindows:\n\n1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7. Total 15, average 5.0.\n\nWhich the code would correctly compute.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, k=3.\n\na = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nWindows:\n\n1+2+3=6\n\n2+3+4=9\n\n3+4+5=12\n\nTotal 6+9+12=27. Average 9.\n\nSo code should output 9.0000000000.\n\nI think this covers all cases.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of k days, and we need to find the average of the sums of each of these windows.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Given a sequence of n days, each with a sleep time value, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive windows of size k. The number of such windows is (n - k + 1). The goal is to efficiently compute the sum of each window and then find the average.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, which would be inefficient, we use a sliding window approach. This allows us to compute the sum of each subsequent window in constant time by adjusting the sum from the previous window.\n\n3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first window of size k. This serves as the starting point for our sliding window technique.\n\n4. **Adjusting the Sum for Each New Window**: For each new window, subtract the element that is leaving the window and add the new element entering the window. This adjustment allows us to maintain the current sum efficiently.\n\n5. **Total Sum and Average Calculation**: Keep a running total of all window sums. After processing all windows, divide the total by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the values of n and k, followed by the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Window Sum**: The sum of the first window (from index 0 to k-1) is computed and stored in `current_sum`.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent day, the code adjusts `current_sum` by subtracting the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that has entered the window.\n4. **Accumulating Total Sum**: Each adjusted `current_sum` is added to the total sum.\n5. **Computing Average**: After processing all windows, the total sum is divided by the number of windows to compute the average sleep time, which is then printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively, providing the correct result within acceptable time limits.",
