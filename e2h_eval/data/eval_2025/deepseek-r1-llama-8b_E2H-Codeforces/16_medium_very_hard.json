Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) formed by roads in Crazy Town. Each road is an infinite line, and the roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to the university. A step is moving from one block to another if they share a common border segment with non-zero length.\n\nHmm. So each step requires crossing exactly one road. Because if two blocks share a border, that border is a segment of a single road. So, moving between adjacent blocks across a shared road boundary counts as one step.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is non-zero. So, if two blocks share a common boundary segment, which is part of a road, then you can move between them in one step. But each such movement is across a single road. Because if two blocks are on opposite sides of a road, then that's their only common border. So, each step corresponds to crossing one road.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and the university. That is, each such road that the straight line path between home and university crosses must be traversed, but wait, maybe not exactly that. Wait, perhaps each road that the home and university are on opposite sides of contributes one step. Because each such road acts as a barrier that you have to cross.\n\nSo, the approach would be: for each road, determine whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides. If they're on opposite sides, then that road must be crossed once, contributing to the step count.\n\nWait, yes! Because each time you cross a road, you switch blocks. So, if a road separates home and university, you must cross it an odd number of times (once). So the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting how many lines (roads) have the property that the home and university are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nThat's a key insight. So, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each road (line), compute whether the home and university lie on the same or different sides.\n\nIf they are on different sides, increment the count.\n\nThe total count is the answer.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this correctly.\n\nBut how do we determine the side of a point relative to a line?\n\nEach line is given by ax + by + c = 0.\n\nFor a point (x0, y0), plugging into the line equation gives ax0 + by0 + c. The sign of this value determines which side of the line the point is on.\n\nIf the value is positive, it's on one side; if negative, on the other; zero is on the line, but the problem states that neither home nor university is on any line, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo, for each road i:\n\nCompute s1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i\nCompute s2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i\n\nIf s1 and s2 have opposite signs, then the two points are on opposite sides of the line, so this road is a separator. So, count += 1.\n\nThus, the minimal steps needed is the number of such roads.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n2. Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n3. Read n, the number of roads.\n4. For each of the n roads:\n   a. Read a_i, b_i, c_i\n   b. Compute s1 = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i\n   c. Compute s2 = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i\n   d. If s1 and s2 have opposite signs (s1 * s2 < 0), increment the count.\n5. Output the count as the result.\n\nWait, but what about when a_i or b_i are zero? Does that affect anything? No, because the condition is just based on the sign of s1 and s2.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nHome: 1 1\nUniversity: -1 -1\nn=2\nRoad 1: 0 1 0 → equation is y = 0\nRoad 2: 1 0 0 → x=0\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the first road is 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0. So for home (1,1): 0*1+1*1+0=1>0. For university (-1,-1): 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 =-1<0. So opposite signs → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. Home is at x=1>0. University is x=-1<0. Opposite signs → count +=1. Total count is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample in the problem statement:\n\nThe second input is probably a different scenario.\n\nSo, the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut we have to read the inputs correctly.\n\nWait, the input is given as three lines in the example, but in the actual problem statement, the input is structured as follows:\n\nThe first line is home's x1 and y1.\n\nSecond line is university's x2 and y2.\n\nThird line is n.\n\nThen n lines, each with a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement, the input is:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nSo, in code, we can read the first line as x1, y1.\n\nSecond line as x2, y2.\n\nThird line as n.\n\nThen loop n times, reading each a, b, c.\n\nCompute s1 and s2 for each line.\n\nIf s1*s2 <0, increment count.\n\nFinally, print count.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nRead the first line: x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nSecond line: x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount =0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 <0:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, since the numbers can be up to 1e6, but in Python, integers are handled fine.\n\nAlso, note that a_i and b_i can be zero, but that's allowed as per the problem statement.\n\nWhat about cases where a_i and b_i are both zero? No, the problem says \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.\" Also, the third condition says \"each road is defined by a_i x +b_i y +c_i=0, where a_i and b_i are not both zero.\"\n\nSo, each line is a valid line.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0 → line y=0.\n\ns1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1\n\ns2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1 → product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nNext road: 1 0 0 → x=0.\n\ns1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1\n\ns2=1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nTotal count is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: suppose there are zero roads, then the home and university are in the same block, so steps needed is zero. But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1, so this case may not be present.\n\nWait, no: the problem says n≥1. So, no.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the third line says n≥1. So, code can assume n is at least 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose two lines, and the home and university are on the same side for both lines.\n\nThen, steps needed is zero.\n\nAnother case: three lines, each separating the points. So steps needed is 3.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step involves crossing a road that separates two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The town is divided into blocks by roads represented as lines. Each road can be defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\). To move from one block to another, you must cross a road. The goal is to find how many such roads separate the home and the university.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, determine if the home and university lie on opposite sides. If they do, crossing this road is necessary. Thus, the number of such roads directly gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of the home and university.\n   - For each road, compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates.\n   - Check if these values have opposite signs, indicating the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n   - Count the number of such roads and print the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input for home and university\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are used to evaluate the line equation at both the home and university points.\n3. **Determining Sides**: By checking the signs of the results from the line equation evaluations, we determine if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n4. **Counting Crossings**: Each road that separates the home and university is counted, and this count is the minimum number of steps required.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the required steps using simple arithmetic operations, ensuring it handles all edge cases within the problem constraints.",
