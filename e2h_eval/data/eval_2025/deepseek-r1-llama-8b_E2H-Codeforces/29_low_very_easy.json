Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a string of digits through several substitution queries and then computing the result modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo, Andrew has a string s. Eugene sends n queries, each of which is a replacement: replace all instances of digit di in s with ti. For example, if s is \"123123\", a query like \"2→00\" changes it to \"10031003\". Another query \"3→\" would remove all 3s, resulting in \"1212\".\n\nAfter all queries are processed, we need to compute the numeric value of s, ignoring leading zeros unless it's the only digit. Then take that number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string after replacement. So, for example, if after substitutions, the string starts with multiple zeros, those are kept. So when converting to a number, leading zeros are ignored, except when the entire string is zero, then it's considered as zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Process each query in order. Each query replaces every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n2. After all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros, then mod 1e9+7.\n\nThe challenge is to process the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 105 characters and there are up to 105 queries. But wait, the way substitutions work could cause the string to grow or shrink, depending on the ti.\n\nHmm, but for each query, replacing a digit with a string. So, for example, if di is '2' and ti is '00', each '2' becomes '00', effectively doubling the length.\n\nBut processing each query naively by iterating through the string and replacing each occurrence could be manageable given the constraints.\n\nBut wait, n is up to 105, and each query's ti can be up to 105 in total across all queries. So perhaps the maximum possible length of the string after all substitutions is 105 * 105 = around 10^4, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Keep track of the current string.\n- For each query, iterate through the current string and replace every occurrence of di with ti.\n- After all queries, process the resulting string to compute the number.\n\nBut wait, how do we handle the substitutions? Because each query replaces all occurrences of di at once. So for each query, we need to create a new string where every di is replaced by ti.\n\nSo for example, for each query, the current string is processed character by character, and whenever a character equals di, it's replaced by ti.\n\nBut doing this naively for each query would involve O(m * k) operations, where m is the current string length and k is the average ti length. Since m can be up to 1e4 and k up to say 100, that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for efficiency, perhaps we can represent the string as a list or just process it as a string each time.\n\nYes, because for each query, the substitution is straightforward: for each character in the current string, if it's di, append ti; else, append the character.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you process the string, each substitution may change the positions of other characters, but since each substitution is done in one pass, replacing all di's in the original string, it's correct.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the string is \"aabba\", and the query is to replace 'a' with 'x'. So the first two a's become 'xx', then the next two b's stay, then the last a becomes 'x'. So the result is 'xxb b x'? Wait, no, in the original string, the a's are at positions 0,1,4. So in one pass, you can't directly replace all a's in one iteration because when you replace one a, you might shift the indices of the others.\n\nSo the correct way to process substitutions is to build the new string by scanning each character, and for each character, if it's di, append ti, else append the character.\n\nBut wait, that approach would replace each di in the original string with ti, without overlapping. So yes, that's correct.\n\nFor example, original string is \"ababa\". Query is 'a' → 'x'.\n\nProcessing each character:\n- a → x\n- b → b\n- a → x\n- b → b\n- a → x\n\nResulting string: 'xbxbx'.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, for each query, the substitution is done by creating a new string where each occurrence of di is replaced by ti, in order.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize the current string as the input s.\n\nFor each query in order:\n   di is the first character of the query (before \"->\")\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a string through a series of substitution queries and then compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). The substitutions replace each occurrence of a specific digit with another string, potentially changing the length of the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Start by reading the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Process Queries:** For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring. This is done by iterating through each character of the current string and appending the appropriate replacement string or character to form the new string.\n3. **Compute Result:** After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a numeric value, ignoring leading zeros unless the string is empty. Compute this value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\ncurrent_s = s\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().split('->')\n    di = query[0]\n    ti = query[1] if len(query) > 1 else ''\n    \n    new_s = []\n    for c in current_s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    current_s = ''.join(new_s)\n\n# Now compute the numeric value modulo MOD\nif not current_s:\n    print(0 % MOD)\nelse:\n    # Convert current_s to integer, but since it can be very large, we'll compute mod as we go\n    result = 0\n    for c in current_s:\n        result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input.\n2. **Processing Each Query:** For each query, determine the digit to replace (`di`) and the replacement string (`ti`). Construct a new string by iterating through each character of the current string and replacing occurrences of `di` with `ti`.\n3. **Handling Large Numbers:** Instead of converting the entire string to an integer directly (which could be very large), we compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) incrementally. For each character in the resulting string, update the result by treating it as a digit in a number being built up.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the substitutions and compute the result without running into issues with very large numbers.",
