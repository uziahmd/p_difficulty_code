    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate that's divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We need to add k golden rings. Each ring is like a border around the plate, but each subsequent ring is 2 cells inward from the previous one. Each ring is 1 cell wide.\n\nWait, let me rephrase that. The first ring is along the edge of the entire plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, meaning it's inside the first ring. So each ring is a border, but they get smaller as we go inward.\n\nThe task is to compute the total number of cells that are gilded after adding k such rings.\n\nHmm, how do I model each ring?\n\nLet me think about how each ring contributes to the total count.\n\nFor a single ring, say the i-th ring, the size of the rectangle it's bordering is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, why 4*(i-1)? Because each ring reduces the width and height by 2 on each side. For example, the first ring is the outermost, so it's 1 cell away from the edge, but then for each ring inward, each dimension reduces by 2 per side, which is 4 in total.\n\nWait no, maybe not exactly. Let's see: each ring is 1 cell wide. So for the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. Then, the next ring is (w-2) x (h-2), but wait no— because the second ring is two cells away from the edge, which would mean that the inner rectangle is 2 less on each side. So, for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 2*(i-1)*2) x (h - 2*(i-1)*2). Or perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps for each ring i:\n\nThe dimensions of the rectangle that this ring is surrounding are (w - 2*i*2) and (h - 2*i*2). No, wait that doesn't make sense. Maybe another approach.\n\nEach ring i starts at a certain distance from the edge. The first ring (i=1) is the outermost. The second ring (i=2) is 2 cells away from the outer edge, so the rectangle for ring 2 is (w-4) x (h-4). Ring 3 would be 4 cells away, so (w-8) x (h-8), etc.\n\nWait, yes! Because each ring is 2 cells further inward than the previous one. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle it's based on is (w - 2*(i-1)*2) = w - 4*(i-1), same for h.\n\nBut wait, for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 2*(i)*2) ? Or perhaps I should model each ring as a border around a rectangle of size (w - 2*(i-1)*2) x (h - 2*(i-1)*2). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the i-th ring is the perimeter of a rectangle with width (w - 2*(i-1)*2) and height (h - 2*(i-1)*2).\n\nWait, no. Let's think of the first ring. It's the perimeter of the entire plate. The perimeter of a w x h rectangle is 2*(w + h - 2). So for the first ring, the number of cells is 2*(w + h - 2).\n\nThen, the second ring is the perimeter of a (w-2) x (h-2) rectangle. Wait, no. Because if we take two cells away from each edge, then the inner rectangle becomes (w-4) x (h-4), right? Because each side reduces by 2 cells. So the perimeter is 2*((w-4) + (h-4)) - 4, because when you subtract 2 from each side, the total perimeter decreases by 4 (since each corner is counted twice when just adding the sides).\n\nWait, the perimeter formula for a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because for a rectangle of width w and height h, the perimeter is 2w + 2h - 4 (since the four corners are counted once each, but without overcounting, it's 2*(w + h) - 4).\n\nSo for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 2*(i-1)*2) x (h - 2*(i-1)*2). Wait, no. Because each ring is 2 cells away from the previous. So for the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. The second ring's rectangle is (w-2*2) x (h-2*2) = w-4 x h-4. Third ring would be (w-6) x (h-6), etc. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 2*(i)*2) x (h - 2*i*2) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as for each ring i, the rectangle has width w - 2*(i-1)*2 and height h - 2*(i-1)*2. So for i=1, it's w x h. For i=2, it's w-4 x h-4, etc.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each ring from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)), and sum all these perimeters.\n\nBut wait, what if w or h is less than 4*(k-1) + 2? Like, what if for some i, the rectangle becomes too small? But according to the problem statement, k is chosen such that it's possible. So the input ensures that for all i up to k, the rectangle is valid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute the current width and height as w - 4*(i-1) and h -4*(i-1).\n   b. Compute the perimeter of this rectangle: 2*(width + height - 2)\n      - Because 2*(width + height) counts each side, but subtract 4 to account for the four corners being double-counted.\n   c. Add this perimeter to the total.\n\n2. Sum all these perimeters for each ring.\n\nNow, let's test this against the examples given.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 3 3 1\n\nRing 1: width=3, height=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*(4)=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput:7 9 1.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14)=28. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example:\n\nInput:7 9 2.\n\nRing 1: 7x9 → 2*(7+9-2)=28.\n\nRing 2: (7-4)*(9-4) → 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nGreat, so the logic seems correct.\n\nSo now, the task is to implement this in Python.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n- Read the input line, split into w, h, k as integers.\n\n- Initialize total =0.\n\n- For i in 1 to k:\n\n   - compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   - add perimeter to total.\n\n- Print total as an integer.\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h is less than or equal to zero? But according to the problem statement, k is within the allowed range, so this shouldn't happen.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nLet's write the code.\n\nRead the input: the input is a single line with three integers.\n\nIn Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nTesting this with the examples.\n\nFirst sample:\n\n3 3 1 → 8 → correct.\n\nSecond sample:7 9 1 → 28 → correct.\n\nThird sample:7 9 2 → 28+12=40 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if k=3?\n\nFor w=7, h=9, k=3.\n\nRing1:7x9 → perimeter 2*(7+9-2)=28.\n\nRing2:3x5 → 2*(3+5-2)=12.\n\nRing3: (7-8)= -1? Wait, no, because 4*(3-1)=8, so 7-8= -1. That's invalid. But according to the problem statement, k is within the allowed limits, so this won't happen.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases as per the constraints.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of golden rings. Each ring is a border around the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each ring is a perimeter of a rectangle that is progressively smaller as we move inward. The first ring is the outermost border, the second ring is two cells inside the first, and so on. The task is to compute the total number of cells covered by these rings.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the rectangle it forms has dimensions reduced by 4 cells (2 cells on each side) from the previous ring. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by `2 * (w + h - 2)`, which accounts for the four corners being counted once each.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: For each of the `k` rings, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the current dimensions of the rectangle it forms by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both `w` and `h`.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)` and add this to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all `k` rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases within the problem constraints.",
