She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Luba needs to close some tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving a cursor and closing tabs either to the left or right of it. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to close all tabs except those between l and r inclusive.\n\nThe initial setup is that there are n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. The target is to have only tabs l to r open.\n\nEach second, Luba can do one of two actions: move the cursor left or right (but within the current range of open tabs), or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nHmm. So, the strategy is to figure out the optimal way to move the cursor and perform the necessary closes.\n\nLet me think about the steps she needs to take.\n\nFirst, she might need to move to a certain position to close tabs either on the left or right. Then, after closing, the remaining tabs will change, which might affect how she moves next.\n\nWait, but when she closes tabs to the left or right, the a and b values change. For example, if she's at position i and closes to the right, then the new b becomes i, because all tabs after i are closed. Similarly for closing to the left, a becomes i.\n\nSo, the movement after each action depends on what she does.\n\nI think the key here is to model this as a state, where each state consists of the current position of the cursor, and the current a and b (the min and max of the open tabs). But since a and b are determined by the open tabs, perhaps it's better to track them as part of the state.\n\nBut considering that n is up to 100, maybe we can model this with BFS, where each state includes the current position, and the current a and b.\n\nWait, but what defines a state? Because a and b can be inferred from which tabs are open. However, tracking a and b directly could be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state can be the current cursor position and the current a and b. Because, the movement options depend on a and b.\n\nSo, let's model each state as (current_pos, a, b). From each state, we can perform several actions:\n\n1. Move left: current_pos' = max(current_pos - 1, a)\n   Time taken: 1 second.\n\n2. Move right: current_pos' = min(current_pos + 1, b)\n   Time taken: 1 second.\n\n3. Close left: this will set a to current_pos. So, the new a is current_pos.\n   But wait, no: closing the left of current_pos means all tabs to the left of current_pos are closed. So the new a is current_pos. So after this, the cursor is still at current_pos, but the new a is current_pos.\n   So, the new state would be (current_pos, current_pos, b).\n   Time taken: 1 second.\n\n4. Close right: similar, but new b is current_pos. State becomes (current_pos, a, current_pos).\n   Time taken: 1 second.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you close left, you close all tabs to the left of the cursor. So any tab less than current_pos is closed. So the new a is current_pos. Similarly, closing right makes all tabs greater than current_pos closed, so new b is current_pos.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, each action leads to a new state. Our goal is to reach a state where a >= l and b <= r, meaning all the desired tabs are open, and others are closed. Or more accurately, we need that after all actions, the only open tabs are l to r.\n\nWait, no. Because initially, all tabs are open. So when we perform the necessary actions, we need to close all tabs not in [l, r]. So the final state should have a >= l and b <= r, and the other tabs are closed.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: a is the minimum index of an open tab, and b is the maximum. So, if after some operations, a is l and b is r, then all the tabs from l to r are open, and all outside are closed.\n\nYes, that's the desired end state.\n\nSo our goal is to reach a state where a = l and b = r.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of steps to get from the initial state (pos, 1, n) to (any a and b where a = l, b = r).\n\nBut wait, how? Because the initial a is 1, and b is n.\n\nSo, the approach is to model this as a graph where each node is a state (current_pos, a, b), and edges represent the possible actions. We can perform BFS on",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given position in her browser. The solution involves modeling the problem as a state transition graph and using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path to the desired state.\n\n### Approach\n1. **State Representation**: Each state is represented by three parameters: the current position of the cursor, the minimum index of an open tab (a), and the maximum index of an open tab (b). This helps us track the current state of the browser and the possible actions.\n2. **Actions**: From each state, Luba can either move the cursor left or right, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Each action transitions the state to a new one.\n3. **BFS for Shortest Path**: We use BFS to explore all possible states starting from the initial state (pos, 1, n). BFS is suitable here because it guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which corresponds to the minimum number of seconds required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    pos = int(input[1])\n    l = int(input[2])\n    r = int(input[3])\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque()\n    queue.append((pos, 1, n, 0))\n    visited.add((pos, 1, n))\n    \n    target_a = l\n    target_b = r\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_pos, current_a, current_b, steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_a >= target_a and current_b <= target_b:\n            print(steps)\n            return\n        \n        # Move left\n        new_pos = max(current_pos - 1, current_a)\n        if (new_pos, current_a, current_b) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_pos, current_a, current_b))\n            queue.append((new_pos, current_a, current_b, steps + 1))\n        \n        # Move right\n        new_pos = min(current_pos + 1, current_b)\n        if (new_pos, current_a, current_b) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_pos, current_a, current_b))\n            queue.append((new_pos, current_a, current_b, steps + 1))\n        \n        # Close left\n        new_a = current_pos\n        if (current_pos, new_a, current_b) not in visited:\n            visited.add((current_pos, new_a, current_b))\n            queue.append((current_pos, new_a, current_b, steps + 1))\n        \n        # Close right\n        new_b = current_pos\n        if (current_pos, current_a, new_b) not in visited:\n            visited.add((current_pos, current_a, new_b))\n            queue.append((current_pos, current_a, new_b, steps + 1))\n    \n    print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the target segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no action is needed.\n2. **BFS Initialization**: The BFS starts from the initial state (pos, 1, n) with 0 steps.\n3. **State Exploration**: For each state, we explore all possible actions (move left, move right, close left, close right) and transition to new states.\n4. **Target Check**: If any state reaches the target (a=l and b=r), we print the number of steps taken and exit.\n5. **Visited States**: To avoid revisiting states, we maintain a set of visited states.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores the minimal steps needed to close the unnecessary tabs, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
