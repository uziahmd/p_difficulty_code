Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Feed the Golorp\". From what I understand, a golorp is like a small program in Befunge, and it consumes variables. Each variable can be a digit from 0-9. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that satisfies the golorp's requirements based on its name. If it's impossible, output \"false\".\n\nHmm, the input is a single string representing the golorp's name. The output should be a list of strings, each corresponding to a possible feeding. But wait, looking at the example, the output has four elements, which matches the four test cases in the example. Oh right, the problem says that given several valid sequences, the golorp picks the lex smallest. So my task is to find all possible valid sequences, choose the lex smallest one, or determine if none exists.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that for each golorp, given a choice of several valid sequences, it will choose the lex smallest. So perhaps the input is a name, and the output is the lex smallest possible feeding sequence for that name. Or wait, maybe the input is a name, and we need to find the lex smallest possible, but if there are multiple options, pick the lex smallest. Or perhaps, the input is a name, and the output is the lex smallest possible feeding if it exists, else \"false\".\n\nWait, the sample input shows an array with four elements, each possibly being a string or 'false'. So I think the input is a list of four names, and the output is a list of four outputs, each being a string or 'false'. So each element is processed independently.\n\nSo for each name in the input, we need to find the lex smallest possible sequence of variable values that can be fed to the golorp. If it's impossible, output 'false', else the lex smallest sequence.\n\nBut how do I model the golorp's behavior based on its name?\n\nLet me think about Befunge programs. In Befunge, the code is laid out on a grid. The program runs by executing instructions, starting from the top-left corner, moving right, down, etc., and wraps around as needed. The variables are stored in a dictionary, and when the program accesses a variable, it's treated as a pointer. So, for example, if the instruction is `?+>`, then when the current variable (initially 0) is accessed, it's incremented if it's not present, then added to, and then the pointer moves right.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9. So each variable can only hold a single digit. So the golorp's program must manipulate these variables correctly, ensuring that each variable is within 0-9 after each step.\n\nFurthermore, the number of variables used depends on the structure of the golorp's code. Variables can get into the stomach via the jaws. So each variable represents a digit that the golorp can consume.\n\nSo for the given name, which is a Befunge-like program, we need to simulate the execution and determine the constraints on the variables (the digits) such that the program doesn't produce any invalid operations (like trying to set a variable beyond 0-9 or accessing a non-existing variable, which would cause it to create a new one, possibly leading to more variables being used).\n\nWait, but the problem states that the name is guaranteed to be valid. So perhaps we don't have to handle invalid names, just process each character correctly.\n\nSo the approach is: For each character in the Befunge program, simulate its execution and track the variables used, making sure that each variable's value remains between 0 and 9, inclusive. Also, since variables can't have more than 10 possible values, each time a variable is accessed, we need to decide whether it's possible to assign a value to it without violating the constraints.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires us to find the lex smallest sequence of variable values. Lex order is determined by the order of variables as they are used in the program. So for example, if the variables used are A, B, C in that order, the lex smallest would be 000, 001, ..., up to 999.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Parse the input string as a Befunge program.\n2. Simulate the program's execution, keeping track of the variables used and their dependencies.\n3. Determine the constraints on the variables' values to ensure that each operation is valid.\n4. Find the lex smallest assignment of variables that satisfies all constraints.\n5. If no such assignment exists, output 'false'; otherwise, output the lex smallest sequence.\n\nBut simulating the program may not be straightforward. Because for each step, the program's behavior",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that can be fed to a golorp based on its name. The golorp's name is a valid Befunge program, and each variable can take values from 0 to 9. If it's impossible to feed the golorp, we should output \"false\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse the Input**: The input is a single string representing the golorp's name, which is a Befunge program.\n2. **Simulate Execution**: Simulate the execution of the Befunge program to track the variables used and their dependencies.\n3. **Track Variables and Constraints**: Keep track of each variable and the constraints imposed by the program's operations. Ensure each variable's value remains between 0 and 9.\n4. **Determine Lexicographically Smallest Sequence**: Generate the smallest sequence of variable values that satisfies all constraints. If no valid sequence exists, output \"false\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef parse_befunge(code):\n    stack = []\n    variables = {}\n    for c in code:\n        if c == '?':\n            stack.append(0)\n        elif c == '>':\n            if stack:\n                stack.pop()\n        elif c == '<':\n            if stack:\n                stack[-1] += 1\n        elif c == '+':\n            if stack:\n                stack[-1] += 1\n            else:\n                stack.append(1)\n        elif c == '-':\n            if stack:\n                stack[-1] -= 1\n            else:\n                stack.append(-1)\n        elif c == '*':\n            if stack:\n                stack[-1] *= stack.pop()\n            else:\n                stack.append(0)\n        elif c == '/':\n            if stack and stack[-1] != 0:\n                stack[-1] = stack[-1] // stack.pop()\n            else:\n                stack.append(0)\n        elif c == '_':\n            if stack:\n                stack.append(stack[-1])\n            else:\n                stack.append(0)\n        elif c == ':':\n            if stack:\n                variables[stack[-1]] = stack.copy()\n        elif c == '>':\n            pass\n        elif c == '<':\n            pass\n        elif c == '>':\n            pass\n        elif c == '<':\n            pass\n        elif c == '_':\n            pass\n        elif c == '+':\n            pass\n        elif c == '-':\n            pass\n        elif c == '*':\n            pass\n        elif c == '/':\n            pass\n        elif c == '?':\n            pass\n        elif c == ',':\n            pass\n        elif c == '\"':\n            pass\n        elif c == '(':\n            pass\n        elif c == ')':\n            pass\n        elif c == '#':\n            pass\n        elif c == '$':\n            pass\n        elif c == '%':\n            pass\n        elif c == '^':\n            pass\n        elif c == '&':\n            pass\n        elif c == '~':\n            pass\n        elif c == ' ':\n            pass\n        elif c == ':':\n            pass\n        elif c == '@':\n            pass\n        elif c == '!':\n            pass\n        elif c == '`':\n            pass\n        elif c == ' â€˜:\n            pass\n        else:\n            pass\n\n    return variables\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    output = []\n    for s in input:\n        code = s.strip(\"'\")\n        variables = {}\n        stack = []\n        for c in code:\n            if c == '?':\n                if '?' not in variables:\n                    variables['?'] = 0\n                else:\n                    variables['?'] = (variables['?'] + 1) % 10\n            elif c == '>':\n                if stack:\n                    stack.pop()\n            elif c == '<':\n                if stack:\n                    stack[-1] = (stack[-1] + 1) % 10\n            elif c == '+':\n                if stack:\n                    stack[-1] = (stack[-1] + 1) % 10\n                else:\n                    stack.append(0)\n            elif c == '-':\n                if stack:\n                    stack[-1] = (stack[-1] -
