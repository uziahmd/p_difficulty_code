There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The rule is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. I need to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in, given n players.\n\nHmm, let me think about how the tournament works. Since it's a knockout, each loss means a player is out. So for the winner to play as many games as possible, they need to face opponents such that each subsequent game follows the rule about the difference in the number of games played.\n\nLet's take the examples to understand better.\n\nIn the first example, when n=2, the winner plays once. That's straightforward.\n\nFor n=3, the output is 2. So the winner must have played two games. How? Maybe the structure is such that the winner beats someone, then faces another player. For example, in the first round, player 1 vs 2, and player 3 gets a bye. Then in the next round, player 1 vs 3. So player 1 has played two games.\n\nAnother example is n=10, output is 4. So the winner plays 4 games. How is that possible?\n\nWait, what's the pattern here? It seems like the maximum number of games the winner can play is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because each time, the opponent could have played a certain number of games, but the total adds up in a way similar to Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet me think: the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the sum of the first k Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps something along those lines.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in each step, the number of players required for the next game depends on the previous steps.\n\nLet's model this.\n\nSuppose the winner plays a series of games. Each game after the first requires that the opponent has played either the same number of games or one less than the winner.\n\nLet’s denote f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\nFor k=1: The winner plays one game. So we need at least two players. So f(1)=2.\n\nFor k=2: The winner must have played one game before. The opponent must have played either 0 or 1 game. But since it's the second game, the opponent must have at least one game. So, the opponent had one game before facing the winner. So the minimal players would be f(1)+f(2-1) = f(1)+f(1) = 2+2=4. Wait, no, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. To have the winner play k games, he must have beaten someone who has played k-1 games, and someone else who has played k-2 games, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of players required for the winner to have m games is the sum of the minimal players needed for the m-1 and m-2 games. Because in each step, the winner needs to have an opponent with m-1 games (so their path requires m-1 wins), and another opponent who is the next in line.\n\nWait, perhaps f(m) is the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have m games. Then:\n\nf(1) = 2\n\nf(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2)\n\nBecause, to have the winner play the m-th game, he must have beaten someone who has played m-1 games (which required f(m-1) players) and also beaten someone else who has played m-2 games (since the difference between their games can't be more than one). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly Fibonacci. Let's see.\n\nFor m=1: 2 players.\n\nm=2: The winner needs to have two games. The first game: he plays someone. Then in the next game, he plays someone who has played one game (so the winner has played 1, the opponent 1). Wait, but how does that add up?\n\nWait, maybe f(m) represents the minimal number of players required for the winner to have m wins (i.e., m games). Then:\n\nTo get m=1: f(1) = 2.\n\nFor m=2: The winner has to play two games. The first game is against someone (needs 1 more player). Then, in the second game, he must play someone who has either 1 or 0 games. But wait, the second game is the next step after the first. So the opponent in the second game must have played one game already. So that opponent must have come from a previous game. So the opponent's game count is 1, which implies that the opponent came from a bracket where they won one game. So that requires f(1) players.\n\nSo the total players needed is f(1) (for the initial game) plus f(1) (for the next game). So f(2) = f(1) + f(1) = 2+2=4.\n\nSimilarly, f(3) = f(2) + f(1) =4+2=6.\n\nf(4)=f(3)+f(2)=6+4=10.\n\nWhich matches the third example where n=10, the output is 4. Because 10 is equal to f(4), so the maximum m is 4.\n\nWait, so yes, this seems to fit. So the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest m where f(m) ≤ n.\n\nBut wait, let's test this.\n\nn=3: f(2)=4>3. So m is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nn=4: f(2)=4. So m is 2.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, when n=4, the output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about n=5? Then f(3)=6>5, so m is 2.\n\nWait, but can the winner play 3 games with 5 players?\n\nHmm, let's see. The winner needs to have 3 games.\n\nFirst game: he plays someone, so now he has 1 win.\n\nSecond game: he plays someone who has 1 game. So that someone must have won one game, which requires two players (including the winner).\n\nThird game: he needs to play someone who has 2 games. So that someone must have played two games.\n\nHow many players do we need for that?\n\nAfter three games:\n\nThe winner has played 3 games.\n\nOpponent in third game has played 2 games. So before that, he must have played 2 games.\n\nWhere does that opponent come from? He must have been the winner of a sub-bracket that required f(2) players.\n\nSo the minimal number of players for m=3 is f(3) = f(2)+f(1) =4+2=6.\n\nSo for n=5, since 6>5, the maximum m is 2.\n\nSo the winner can play 2 games.\n\nWait, but wait: can the winner play 3 games with 5 players?\n\nLet me think of a possible arrangement.\n\nSuppose n=5.\n\nWe can structure it as follows:\n\nRound 1: 5 players.\n\nWinners of Round 1: 2 winners (since 5 is odd, one gets a bye).\n\nWait, no, in a knockout tournament, each game eliminates one player. So for 5 players, the first round has 2 games (4 players), and one player gets a bye.\n\nWait, but the initial setup isn't fixed; the grid is being arranged as per the rule.\n\nBut the problem allows any arrangement as long as the rule is followed.\n\nSo for n=5, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nLet me try to construct the scenario.\n\nPlayer A is the winner.\n\nRound 1: A vs B. A wins. (A has 1 game.)\n\nRound 2: A vs C. C must have played 0 or 1 games.\n\nC comes from a different branch. So in the first round, C could have played D, and won. So in Round 2, A plays C, who has played 1 game.\n\nNow, A has 2 games.\n\nRound 3: A vs E. E must have played 1 or 0 games.\n\nE is in a separate branch. In Round 1, E didn't play because of a bye? Or perhaps E played F, but since there are only 5 players, maybe E was the bye.\n\nWait, perhaps the tournament structure is such that the winner can play 3 games.\n\nWait, but according to f(3)=6, which is more than 5, so n=5 is less than f(3). So according to our earlier logic, the maximum m is 2.\n\nBut maybe the actual maximum is higher.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the formula isn't exactly the sum of the previous two terms.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the problem.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less than the winner.\n\nSo for the winner to have m games, the last opponent must have played m-1 or m-2 games.\n\nWait, no, the condition is that the number of games the two players have played differ by at most one. So when the winner has played k games, the opponent must have played either k-1, k-2, ..., 0 games, as long as |k - opponent_games| ≤ 1.\n\nSo for the last game, the winner has played k games, the opponent has played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nWait, but to maximize the number of games, perhaps the opponent has played k-1 games.\n\nSo, for each step, the winner's next opponent must have played as many games as possible.\n\nBut this might not directly translate into a recursive formula.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of players required for the winner to have m games is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2). Because in order to have the next game, the winner needs to have beaten someone who has m-1 games, and someone else who has m-2 games.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let's see.\n\nSo f(1) = 2\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0). Wait, what's f(0)? That's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) is the minimal number of players needed to allow the winner to have m games.\n\nFor m=1, f(1)=2.\n\nFor m=2, the winner has two games. The first game requires one opponent. The second game requires someone who has either 1 or 0 games. But to maximize, the opponent would have 1 game. So that opponent came from a subtree where they had 1 game, which requires f(1) players. So f(2) = f(1) + 1 (the winner himself) + f(1) (opponent's subtree). Wait, no, perhaps the total is f(1) (opponent for the first game) plus f(1) (the opponent for the second game, who must have played one game). So f(2) = 2 + 2 =4.\n\nSimilarly, f(3) = f(2) + f(1) =4+2=6.\n\nf(4)=f(3)+f(2)=6+4=10.\n\nWhich fits the example for n=10, giving m=4.\n\nSo, for a general case, f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2), with f(1)=2, f(2)=4.\n\nWait, but wait, what about m=0? That's probably zero.\n\nSo the recurrence is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2), with base cases f(1)=2, f(2)=4.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to find the largest m such that f(m) <=n.\n\nIf n is exactly f(m), then the answer is m.\n\nOtherwise, find the largest m where f(m) <=n.\n\nSo the approach is to precompute f(m) until it exceeds n, then return m.\n\nBut for n up to 1018, how far will this go?\n\nLet's compute f(m):\n\nf(1) =2\n\nf(2)=4\n\nf(3)=6\n\nf(4)=10\n\nf(5)=16\n\nf(6)=26\n\nf(7)=42\n\nf(8)=68\n\nf(9)=110\n\nf(10)=178\n\nf(11)=288\n\nf(12)=464\n\nf(13)=754\n\nf(14)=1218\n\nf(15)=1960\n\nWait, so for n=1018, the maximum m is 14, because f(14)=1218>1018, and f(13)=754<=1018.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me compute f(14) correctly.\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nm | f(m)\n\n1:2\n\n2:4\n\n3:6 (4+2)\n\n4:10 (6+4)\n\n5:16 (10+6)\n\n6:26 (16+10)\n\n7:42 (26+16)\n\n8:68 (42+26)\n\n9:110 (68+42)\n\n10: 110+68=178\n\n11:178+110=288\n\n12:288+178=466\n\nWait, wait, 288+178 is 466? 288+178=466, yes.\n\n13:466+288=754\n\n14:754+466=1220.\n\nAh, okay, so f(14)=1220.\n\nSo for n=1018, the maximum m is 13, because f(13)=754 <=1018 < f(14)=1220.\n\nSo the winner can play 13 games.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute f(m) for m starting from 1 until f(m) exceeds n.\n\nThe maximum m is the largest such that f(m) <=n.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Compute f(m) until f(m) >n.\n\n3. The maximum is m-1 if f(m) >n.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nInitialize a list with f(1)=2, f(2)=4.\n\nThen for each m >=3, compute f(m) = f(m-1)+f(m-2).\n\nContinue until f(m) >n.\n\nOnce the loop ends, the maximum m is the largest where f(m) <=n.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n ==2:\n    print(1)\nelse:\n    a, b = 2,4\n    max_games =2\n    if n <4:\n        # check if m=1 or m=2\n        if n >=2:\n            print(1)\n        else:\n            pass\n    else:\n        while True:\n            c = a + b\n            if c >n:\n                break\n            max_games +=1\n            a, b = b, c\n        print(max_games)\n\nWait, wait, let's test for n=3.\n\nn=3.\n\nmax_games starts at 2.\n\na=2, b=4.\n\nc=6>3, so loop breaks.\n\nPrint max_games=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nc=6>4? Yes, loop doesn't run, so max_games remains 2.\n\nWait, but wait: for n=4, the maximum is 2, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, after a=2, b=4.\n\nc=6>4, so loop doesn't execute, max_games remains 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nloop: c=6>5, so loop doesn't run. So max_games is 2.\n\nWhich is correct as discussed earlier.\n\nWait, but for n=6:\n\nc=6 is not greater than 6, so enter loop, increment max_games to 3.\n\nSet a=4, b=6.\n\nNext c=4+6=10>6, so loop breaks.\n\nSo max_games is 3.\n\nWhich is correct because f(3)=6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nWait, but let me test for n=10.\n\nLoop:\n\na=2, b=4.\n\nc=6 <=10: yes. max_games becomes 3.\n\na=4, b=6.\n\nc=10 <=10: yes. max_games becomes4.\n\na=6, b=10.\n\nc=16>10: loop breaks.\n\nSo print 4. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=7.\n\nf(3)=6<=7.\n\nf(4)=10>7. So maximum is 3.\n\nWait, but can the winner play 3 games?\n\nYes.\n\nSo code returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: n=10, output is 4.\n\nYes.\n\nn=11: f(4)=10<=11, f(5)=16>11.\n\nSo maximum is4.\n\nWait, but according to earlier calculation, f(4)=10, which is <=11.\n\nSo the code returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nn=13: f(4)=10, f(5)=16>13.\n\nSo maximum is4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought f(3)=6, f(4)=10, f(5)=16.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nWait, but what about n=1? Well, according to the problem statement, n is >=2.\n\nSo the code can safely assume n>=2.\n\nSo in the code, perhaps the initial condition is not needed.\n\nWait, the code starts with a=2, b=4.\n\nIf n is 2, then a=2, which is <=2, but in the code, the initial 'if n==2' is handled.\n\nWait, no, in the code as I wrote earlier, the initial 'if n==2' handles it.\n\nWait, the code starts as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n ==2:\n\n    print(1)\n\nelse:\n\n    ... \n\nBut wait, for n=3, the code correctly returns 2.\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code returns 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut what about n=4?\n\nIn the code, after else clause, a=2, b=4.\n\nThen, c=6>4, so loop doesn't run.\n\nmax_games is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about n=4?\n\nThe maximum games is 2, which the code returns.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1000.\n\nCompute f(m) until it exceeds 1000.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nf(1)=2\n\nf(2)=4\n\nf(3)=6\n\nf(4)=10\n\nf(5)=16\n\nf(6)=26\n\nf(7)=42\n\nf(8)=68\n\nf(9)=110\n\nf(10)=178\n\nf(11)=288\n\nf(12)=466\n\nf(13)=754\n\nf(14)=1220>1000.\n\nSo the maximum m is13.\n\nThus, code will correctly return 13.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when n is exactly f(m), e.g., n=6.\n\nWhich is f(3)=6, so the code returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute f(m) until it exceeds n, and track the maximum m where f(m)<=n.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in. The tournament follows a specific rule where two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the number of players required for the winner to play `m` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `m` games can be computed using a recurrence relation:\n\n- Let `f(m)` represent the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play `m` games.\n- The recurrence relation is `f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2)` with base cases `f(1) = 2` and `f(2) = 4`.\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, we can compute the number of players required for each possible number of games until we exceed the given number of players `n`. The maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest value of `m` such that `f(m) <= n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 2:\n    print(1)\nelse:\n    a, b = 2, 4\n    max_games = 2\n    while True:\n        c = a + b\n        if c > n:\n            break\n        max_games += 1\n        a, b = b, c\n    print(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads the input value `n`, which represents the number of players.\n2. **Base Case Handling:** If `n` is 2, the output is directly 1 because only one game is needed.\n3. **Initialization:** For `n >= 3`, the initial values for the Fibonacci-like sequence are set with `a = 2` and `b = 4`.\n4. **Loop to Compute Maximum Games:** Using a loop, the code computes the next values in the sequence until the required number of players exceeds `n`. Each iteration updates the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n5. **Output Result:** Once the loop exits, the maximum number of games is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
