There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house contributes a squared value of its height to the total profit. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to assign heights to each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a dynamic programming problem because for each spot, the choice of height depends on the previous choices, especially considering overlapping restrictions.\n\nWait, but n and m are up to 50, which isn't too bad. So maybe a DP approach where we track the possible heights at each position, considering all the constraints up to that point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each state represents the current position and the height chosen, and edges represent transitions to the next position with the height chosen there. The constraints must be checked as we build the solution.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe another approach: for each position, determine the maximum possible height it can have, given all the applicable restrictions. Then choose the highest possible heights without violating any restriction.\n\nWait, but the restrictions can overlap in complex ways. For example, a single spot might be part of multiple restrictions. So just taking the minimum allowed height from all applicable restrictions for each spot might not work because some restrictions might not allow certain heights if other spots are constrained.\n\nWait no, actually, each restriction is a range [l_i, r_i], and the maximum height in that range must be <= x_i. So for a particular spot, say spot k, the maximum height it can take is the minimum of x_i for all restrictions where l_i <=k <=r_i. But wait, that's not exactly correct because the maximum in the range includes all spots in [l_i, r_i]. So for spot k, its height can't exceed any of the x_i for restrictions that include it, otherwise the maximum in that range would be higher than x_i.\n\nSo for each spot, the maximum possible height is the minimum of x_i across all restrictions that cover it. But wait, no, because each restriction is an upper bound on the maximum in its range. So for each spot, the maximum height it can take is the minimum of all x_i where the spot is within [l_i, r_i]. But also, the global maximum h might impose another constraint.\n\nWait, let's see. For each spot k, the maximum height it can take is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include k in their range. Because each of those restrictions requires that the maximum in their range is <=x_i, so if any of them has x_i < h, then the spot can't be higher than that x_i.\n\nSo for each spot, the maximum possible height is min(h, min{x_i for all restrictions where l_i <=k <=r_i}).\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case. Because, even if a spot k is covered by several restrictions, the overall maximum in the range is the maximum of all spots in that range, including k. So for example, if two restrictions have different x_i for the same range, the maximum in that range is the minimum of those x_i. Wait, no, the maximum in the range is the highest among all the spots in that range, but each restriction says the maximum must be <=x_i. So each restriction imposes an upper bound on the maximum in their range. Therefore, the maximum possible height for any spot in the range is the minimum of all x_i of the restrictions covering that range.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose a range [2,4] is covered by two restrictions: one with x=5 and another with x=3. The maximum height allowed for the entire range is the minimum of these x's, because the first restriction requires the max in the range to be <=5, and the second requires it to be <=3. So the maximum allowed is 3.\n\nSo for each spot, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include the spot.\n\nBut wait, what if a spot is included in multiple restrictions? For example, spot 3 is in two restrictions: one with x=4 and another with x=5. Then the maximum height for spot 3 is the minimum of 4 and 5, which is 4. But since h is 6, the maximum is 4.\n\nBut if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i that apply to it.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. For each spot k (from 1 to n), find all restrictions where l_i <=k <= r_i.\n2. Among those restrictions, find the minimum x_i. Let's call this min_x_k.\n3. The maximum height for spot k is the minimum between h and min_x_k.\n\nWait, but what about when a spot is not covered by any restriction? Then min_x_k is undefined. In that case, the maximum is h.\n\nSo for each spot, compute its maximum possible height as the minimum of h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include it. If no restrictions include it, then it's h.\n\nBut is that sufficient? Let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\nRestrictions:\n1 1 1 → affects spot 1\n2 2 3 → affects spot 2\n3 3 2 → affects spot 3\n\nCompute for each spot:\nspot 1: min(1) → 1\nspot 2: min(3) →3\nspot 3: min(2) →2\n\nSo the heights are [1,3,2], which gives sum 14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\nRestrictions:\n2-3 with x=8, 3-4 with x=7.\n\nSpot 1: no restrictions → h=10.\nSpot 2: min(8) →8\nSpot 3: min(8,7) →7\nSpot4: min(7) →7.\n\nHeights: [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 +64+49+49 =262, which matches.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nBut wait, what if there are overlapping restrictions that affect multiple spots? For example:\n\nSuppose n=2, h=5. Restrictions:\n\n1 2 3 → so spots 1 and 2 can have max 3.\n\nBut another restriction 1 1 4 → spot 1 can have max 4.\n\nSo for spot1, min(4,3) is 3.\n\nSpot2: min(3) is 3.\n\nSo the maximum heights are 3 and 3.\n\nBut what if there's another restriction 2 2 2?\n\nThen for spot2, min(3,2)=2.\n\nSo spot1 is 3, spot2 is 2.\n\nWhich satisfies all restrictions.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each spot, calculate the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include it. Then the maximum possible height is min(h, min_x). If there are no such restrictions, it's h.\n\nOnce we have the maximum possible heights, the sum of squares is maximized, because for each spot, the higher the better, given the constraints.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Like, could assigning a lower height to a spot allow higher heights elsewhere, leading to a larger total sum?\n\nNo, because the square function is increasing. So for each spot, the higher the better, given that it doesn't violate any constraints.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is to set each spot to its maximum possible height, as determined by the restrictions and h.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n1. For each spot from 1 to n, find all restrictions that include it.\n2. For each such restriction, collect x_i.\n3. Compute min_x for the spot as the minimum of these x_i. If no such x_i exists, min_x is infinity or something, so the spot can be h.\n4. The maximum allowed height for the spot is the minimum between h and min_x.\n5. Sum the squares of these heights.\n\nSo the steps are straightforward.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nWe can process each spot from 1 to n.\n\nFor each spot k:\n\nInitialize min_x as h. Because if no restrictions apply, min_x is h.\n\nThen, for each restriction in the list, check if l_i <=k <= r_i. If so, compare x_i with current min_x and keep the minimum.\n\nAfter processing all restrictions, the spot's height is min(min_x, h). Wait, no: initially, min_x is h, and for each applicable restriction, min_x is updated to the minimum of x_i and current min_x.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial min_x should be h, and for each applicable restriction, min_x becomes min(min_x, x_i). So for each spot, the maximum allowed height is min(h, min_x).\n\nWait, but if there are no applicable restrictions, min_x remains h, so the height is h.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute for each spot k:\n\nmax_height = h\n\nfor each restriction in restrictions:\n\n    if l_i <=k <= r_i:\n\n        if x_i < max_height:\n\n            max_height = x_i\n\nsum += max_height^2\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nread m restrictions, store as a list of tuples (l, r, x).\n\nfor each spot from 1 to n:\n\n    current_max = h\n\n    for each restriction in restrictions:\n\n        l, r, x = restriction\n\n        if l <= spot <= r:\n\n            if x < current_max:\n\n                current_max = x\n\n    add current_max^2 to the total.\n\nprint the total.\n\nWait, but that's it? That seems too simple.\n\nBut according to the sample inputs, this works.\n\nLet's test the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → for spot 1, current_max is 1.\n\n2 2 3 → for spot 2, current_max is 3.\n\n3 3 2 → for spot3, current_max is 2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestriction 1: 2-3 x=8.\n\nRestriction 2: 3-4 x=7.\n\nFor spot1: no restrictions, current_max is 10.\n\nSpot2: min(10, 8) →8.\n\nSpot3: min(10, 8,7) →7.\n\nSpot4: min(10,7) →7.\n\nSum is 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: overlapping restrictions.\n\nn=2, h=5.\n\nRestriction1: 1-2 x=3.\n\nRestriction2: 1-1 x=4.\n\nRestriction3: 2-2 x=2.\n\nFor spot1:\n\nCheck all restrictions. Restriction1 includes it, x=3. Restriction2 includes it, x=4. So min(3,4) is 3.\n\nFor spot2:\n\nRestriction1 includes it, x=3. Restriction3 includes it, x=2. So min(3,2) is 2.\n\nSum is 3² + 2²= 9+4=13.\n\nIs this correct? Yes.\n\nBecause spot1 can be 3, spot2 can be 2.\n\nAnother case: spot1 is covered by two restrictions with x=5 and x=4.\n\nSo the maximum is 4.\n\nWhat about spot2 covered by x=3 and x=5. So maximum is 3.\n\nSo the code correctly handles that.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute for each spot the minimum x_i among all applicable restrictions, and then take the minimum between that and h. Then sum the squares.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input:\n\nFirst line: n, h, m.\n\nThen m lines: l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nBut note that in the input description, the second example is given as a list of strings, but in the actual problem statement, the input is given as lines, each with three integers.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen, read m lines. For each line, split into l, r, x.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the first sample input is written as:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nWhich is a bit confusing. Oh, wait, probably it's a typo. The actual input would be:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nAnd then another test case:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo in code, we can read each line after the first as a separate restriction.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines, each line split into l, r, x.\n\nStore all the restrictions in a list.\n\nThen, for each spot in 1..n:\n\ncurrent_max = h\n\nfor each (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n    if spot >= l and spot <= r:\n\n        if x < current_max:\n\n            current_max = x\n\nsum += current_max ** 2\n\nFinally, print the sum.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nTesting this with the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nrestrictions:\n\n(1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2).\n\nEach spot:\n\n1: only (1,1,1) applies. current_max is min(3,1) →1.\n\n2: only (2,2,3) applies. current_max is 3.\n\n3: only (3,3,2) applies. current_max is 2.\n\nSum 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nrestrictions:\n\n(2,3,8), (3,4,7).\n\nSpot1: no restrictions →10.\n\nSpot2: in (2,3,8). current_max is min(10,8) →8.\n\nSpot3: in both restrictions. current_max is min(10,8,7) →7.\n\nSpot4: in (3,4,7). current_max is min(10,7) →7.\n\nSum 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: overlapping.\n\nn=2, h=5.\n\nrestrictions:\n\n(1,2,3), (1,1,4), (2,2,2).\n\nSpot1: min(3,4) →3.\n\nSpot2: min(3,2) →2.\n\nSum 9+4=13.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=0.\n\nNo restrictions, so spot1 is 5. Sum 25.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines, each split into l, r, x.\n\nWe can loop through each spot from 1 to n.\n\nFor each spot, iterate through all the restrictions and find the minimum x that applies.\n\nCompute the sum.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\ntotal = 0\nfor spot in range(1, n+1):\n    current_max = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= spot <= r:\n            if x < current_max:\n                current_max = x\n    total += current_max ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but the output expects the result as a string, right? Or in the sample, the outputs are printed as strings, but in the problem statement, it says to print the integer.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the sample shows the output as ['14', '262'], but that's probably a mistake. Looking back, in the problem statement, the output is supposed to print a single integer.\n\nSo the code should print the integer, not a list.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first example, the output is 14, which is an integer. So in code, we can just print(total).\n\nBut in the code above, the variables are read as integers, and total is an integer. So the code is correct.\n\nTesting the code with sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nOutput: 14.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput:262.\n\nAnother test case where spot is 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 10 0\n\nNo restrictions. Output is 100.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given height constraints. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared, and there are specific zoning restrictions that limit the maximum height in certain ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - We have `n` spots on a street where we can build houses.\n   - Each house can have a height between 0 and `h`.\n   - The profit from a house at a spot is the square of its height.\n   - There are `m` restrictions, each specifying a range `[l_i, r_i]` and a maximum height `x_i` for that range.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For each spot, the maximum height it can be built to must satisfy all applicable restrictions. Thus, the maximum height for each spot is the minimum value of `h` and the minimum of all `x_i` values from the restrictions that include the spot.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values and store the restrictions.\n   - For each spot, determine the maximum allowed height by considering all applicable restrictions.\n   - Calculate the total profit by summing the squares of these maximum heights.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The algorithm efficiently processes each spot and each restriction, resulting in a time complexity of O(n*m), which is feasible given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor spot in range(1, n + 1):\n    current_max = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= spot <= r:\n            if x < current_max:\n                current_max = x\n    total += current_max ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of spots, maximum height, and number of restrictions. It then reads each restriction and stores them.\n- **Processing Each Spot**: For each spot from 1 to `n`, the code checks all restrictions to determine the minimum height allowed by any restriction that includes the spot.\n- **Calculating Profit**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is used to compute the profit as the square of this height, which is accumulated into the total profit.\n- **Output**: The total profit is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit from building the houses.",
