    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to understand what affects the LCM when we add k to both a and b. Let's denote x = a + k and y = b + k. Then, since y - x = (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a, which is a constant. So y is always x plus (b - a). Wait, wait, but depending on whether a is larger than b or not, this difference could be positive or negative. But since k is non-negative, maybe the order doesn't matter. Or perhaps I should make sure to compute the absolute difference.\n\nWait, actually, let's see: suppose a is 6 and b is 10. Then for k=2, x=8, y=12. The LCM is 24. If k was 0, x=6, y=10, LCM is 30. So indeed, adding k can reduce the LCM.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding x and y where y = x + d, where d is the difference between b and a. Wait, no: wait, if a > b, then y = x + (b - a), which would be negative. But since y has to be positive, because a and b are given as at least 1, adding k can't make them zero or negative.\n\nWait, but regardless, the difference between y and x is fixed. Because y = (b +k) and x = (a +k), so y -x = b - a. So the difference is fixed as d = |b - a| or something like that? No, actually, it's exactly (b - a). So the difference is a constant based on a and b. So, for any k, x and y differ by (b -a). So the problem is: find two numbers x and y, such that y = x + (b -a), and x >= a, y >= b, and x and y are as close as possible in a certain way to minimize their LCM.\n\nWait, no. Because x = a +k, and y = b +k. So the difference between y and x is (b -a). So if a is less than b, then y is always bigger than x, and the difference is positive. If a is equal to b, then y =x, so the LCM is x.\n\nWait, that's a key insight. So when a equals b, adding any k won't change the fact that x and y are equal. So the LCM is x (since they are the same). So the minimal LCM is achieved when x is as small as possible, which is when k=0. So in that case, the answer is k=0.\n\nBut when a != b, then the difference is non-zero. Let's assume that a < b for now, so the difference is d = b -a. So y = x + d.\n\nWe need to find x and y such that y =x +d, and x >=a, y >=b (but since x =a +k, and y =b +k, and since a <b, x will be a +k >=a, and y will be b +k >=b, which is automatically satisfied as k is non-negative).\n\nNow, the LCM of x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). Since y =x +d, the LCM is (x*(x+d))/g, where g is gcd(x, x+d).\n\nWait, because x and x+d have a gcd of g. So the LCM is x*(x+d)/g.\n\nSo to minimize the LCM, we need to minimize x*(x+d)/g.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the variables here. Since x =a +k, and a is fixed, the minimal x is a, but perhaps choosing a larger x might lead to a smaller LCM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is as close as possible to d/2. Because when two numbers differ by d, their product is minimized when they are as close as possible to each other, given their sum. Wait, but wait: for fixed sum S, the product is maximized when the numbers are equal. For fixed difference d, the product is minimized when the numbers are as close as possible.\n\nWait, no. For example, say d is fixed. Let’s say x and x+d. Their product is x(x+d) = x² + dx. To find the minimum, take derivative with respect to x: 2x +d =0. So x=-d/(2). Which isn’t helpful since x must be positive.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider that for x and x+d, their LCM is x*(x+d)/g, where g is the gcd(x, x+d). So to minimize this, perhaps the best approach is to make x and x+d as co-prime as possible, because that would maximize the denominator.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since y =x +d, the gcd(x, y) is the same as gcd(x, d). Because:\n\ngcd(x, y) = gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d).\n\nSo yes, g = gcd(x, d).\n\nSo the LCM becomes x*(x+d)/g.\n\nOur goal is to find x >= a, x >= (since a can be less than or greater than b, but earlier analysis shows that when a <b, d is positive, when a> b, d is negative, but perhaps it's better to compute d as the absolute difference.)\n\nWait, let's clarify: d = |b -a|. Because when a is less than b, d is positive, else negative. But in any case, since y =x + (b -a), the actual difference is fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute d as the absolute difference between a and b, but I'm not entirely sure yet.\n\nSo, back to the problem. We have x = a +k, which must be >= a. But also, since y =b +k must be >=b. So x must be >= max(a, b -k?), but perhaps that's not necessary because k is non-negative. Hmm.\n\nWait, x =a +k, y =b +k. So if a is less than b, then y is x + (b -a), which is x +d, where d is positive.\n\nSo, for our current case, let's assume a <=b, so d =b -a is positive.\n\nThen, x >=a, y =x +d >=b.\n\nSo, the problem is to find x >=a, and x >= (b -k). Wait, no, because y =b +k, which is x +d =x + (b -a). So x must be >=a, and x +d >=b => x >=b -d. But since a <=b, b -d =a, so x >=a.\n\nSo x must be >=a.\n\nSo, for x >=a, we have y =x +d.\n\nWe need to minimize LCM(x, y) = x(y)/g, where g =gcd(x, d).\n\nWait, because gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d).\n\nSo, the LCM is x*(x +d)/g.\n\nBut x =a +k, so as k increases, x increases.\n\nWait, but we need to find the x >=a such that this expression is minimized.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about the function f(x) = x*(x +d)/(g), where g = gcd(x, d).\n\nOur goal is to minimize f(x) for x >=a.\n\nSo, how do I find the x that minimizes f(x)?\n\nIdea: For each possible divisor of d, perhaps the optimal x is around the point where x is a multiple of a divisor of d, and as close as possible to d/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor d into its prime factors and look for x that share some factors with d, thereby possibly reducing the denominator in the LCM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is a +k, where k is chosen such that x is a divisor of d, or something along those lines.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to think of some examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: a=6, b=10. So d=4.\n\nWe need to find x>=6, y =x+4.\n\nCompute for x=6: y=10. LCM(6,10)=30.\n\nx=7: y=11. LCM=77.\n\nx=8: y=12. LCM=24.\n\nx=9: y=13. LCM=117.\n\nx=10: y=14. LCM=140.\n\nSo the minimal is 24, achieved at x=8, k=2.\n\nSo in this case, x=8 is 6+2, and 8 is a multiple of 4's divisor, but perhaps more importantly, 8 and 4 have a gcd of 4, so the LCM is (8*12)/4= 24.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=10. So d=5.\n\nPossible x starts at 5.\n\nx=5: y=10. LCM=10.\n\nx=6: y=11. LCM=66.\n\nx=7: y=12. LCM=84.\n\nx=8: y=13. LCM=104.\n\nx=9: y=14. LCM=126.\n\nx=10: y=15. LCM=150.\n\nWait, but the sample output for this case is 0. So why is that?\n\nBecause when a=5 and b=10, setting k=0 gives x=5 and y=10, LCM is 10. That's the smallest possible. So why is that the case?\n\nBecause when x=5, which is a, the LCM is 10, which is already the minimal possible.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is achieved at x=a, which is 5.\n\nHmm, so sometimes adding k may not help, but starting at x=a is the optimal.\n\nSo what's the pattern here? It seems that when d is a divisor of a, then the minimal is achieved at x=a.\n\nWait, in the first example, a=6, d=4. 6 is not a multiple of 4. So adding k to get x=8, which is 6+2=8, which is a multiple of 4, but 8 is 2*4. So perhaps making x a multiple of a divisor of d could help.\n\nIn the second example, a=5, d=5. So x=5, which is a multiple of 5, the LCM is 10.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal x is the minimal x >=a such that x is a multiple of g, where g is a divisor of d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is the minimal x >=a such that x is a multiple of a divisor of d, and x is as small as possible.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother example: suppose a=3, b=7, d=4.\n\nSo x can be 3,4, etc.\n\nx=3: y=7. LCM is 21.\n\nx=4: y=8. GCD is 4, so LCM is (4*8)/4=8.\n\nThat's better.\n\nx=5: y=9. LCM is 45.\n\nx=6: y=10. LCM is 30.\n\nx=7: y=11. LCM is 77.\n\nx=8: y=12. LCM is 24.\n\nSo the minimal is 8, achieved at x=4. So k=1.\n\nWait, but wait: x=4 is less than a=3? No, a=3, x=4 is larger than a.\n\nSo in this case, the optimal x is 4, which is larger than a=3, but it's a multiple of d=4.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal x is the smallest x >=a such that x is a multiple of a divisor of d, and x is as small as possible.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find all the divisors of d, and for each divisor g, compute the minimal x >=a such that x is a multiple of g, and then evaluate the LCM for each such x.\n\nThen, among all these possibilities, pick the x that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBut wait, d could be up to 1e9, so the number of divisors could be up to about 1e5 or so, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Compute d = |b -a|. If d is zero, return k=0.\n\n2. Else, collect all the divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g, compute the minimal x >=a such that x is a multiple of g.\n\n   The minimal x is the smallest multiple of g that is >=a. That would be x = a + ((g - a % g) % g).\n\n   Wait, no: for example, if a=6, g=4, then 6 mod4 is 2, so the next multiple is 6 + (4-2)=8.\n\n   So x = a + ((g - (a %g)) %g). But if a is already a multiple of g, then x is a.\n\n4. For each such x, compute the LCM as x*(x +d)/gcd(x, d).\n\nWait, but wait: since d is fixed, and g is a divisor of d, then the gcd(x, d) is g, because x is a multiple of g, and g divides d.\n\nBecause x is a multiple of g, so x = g * m. Since g divides d, d = g * k for some integer k. So x and d have a gcd of g.\n\nSo the LCM is x*(x +d) / g.\n\nSo for each g (divisor of d), compute x as the smallest multiple of g >=a, and then compute the LCM as (x*(x +d))/g.\n\nThen, among all these possible x's, select the one that gives the minimal LCM. If there are multiple x's with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x (since k is x -a, and smaller x gives smaller k).\n\nWait, but what about other x's that are not multiples of any divisor of d? Could they possibly give a better LCM?\n\nFor example, suppose d=4, a=7. Then, the divisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=1: x is 7.\n\ng=2: x is 7 + (2 -7%2)=7+1=8.\n\ng=4: x is 8.\n\nSo for each x, compute the LCM.\n\nx=7: y=11. LCM=77.\n\nx=8: y=12. LCM is 24.\n\nx=8: same as before.\n\nBut what if I choose x=9, which is not a multiple of any of d's divisors except 1.\n\nThen, y=13. LCM is 117.\n\nWhich is worse than 24.\n\nSo perhaps considering all multiples of d's divisors is sufficient.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find all the divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute the minimal x >=a which is a multiple of g.\n\n- For each such x, compute the LCM and track the minimal value.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps consider x =a, and x =a + (d/2) rounded up or down.\n\nWait, because sometimes the minimal could be achieved not by any of the divisors, but by a nearby x.\n\nBut in the previous examples, that wasn't the case. So perhaps considering all the multiples of the divisors is sufficient.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d = |b -a|.\n\n2. If d ==0, return k=0.\n\n3. Else, find all divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g, compute the minimal x >=a which is a multiple of g.\n\n5. Compute the LCM for each x, and keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\n6. Also, perhaps consider x values near a, like a, a+1, a+2, etc., but that might be too slow for large d.\n\nBut since d can be up to 1e9, enumerating all divisors is manageable, but for each divisor, computing x is O(1). So it's feasible.\n\nWait, but for d=1e9, the number of divisors can be up to 100 (for example, if d is 2^30, it has 31 divisors). So even with 1e5 divisors, it's manageable.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nFirst, write a function to find all the divisors of d.\n\nThen, for each g in the divisors:\n\n   compute x = a + ((g - (a %g)) %g). Wait, but if a modg is zero, then x is a.\n\n   but wait, if a is already a multiple of g, then x is a.\n\n   else, x is a + (g - (a modg)).\n\n   compute y =x +d.\n\n   compute the LCM: x * y // g.\n\nThen, compare all these LCMs and find the minimal.\n\nBut also, perhaps include the x =a in the consideration, in case a is a multiple of some g.\n\nWait, but in step 4, we are considering all g's, including 1. So x=a will be considered when g=1.\n\nSo perhaps, the steps are correct.\n\nWait, but another thing: the minimal x may not be a multiple of any of the d's divisors, but perhaps it's a multiple of a number that is a divisor of some other number, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering only the multiples of the divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nSo, after generating all possible x's from the divisors, we can collect all the possible x's, compute their LCM, and select the minimal.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps we should also consider x = a, x = a +d, etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the first example, a=6, d=4. The divisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1, x=6.\n\nFor g=2, x=8.\n\nFor g=4, x=8.\n\nSo the x's considered are 6,8,8.\n\nCompute their LCMs:\n\nx=6: LCM is 6*10 / 2=30.\n\nx=8: LCM is 8*12 /4=24.\n\nSo 24 is better.\n\nBut what about x=7? Is it a multiple of any of the divisors? No, except for 1. So for g=1, x=6, but 7 is another x. But since x=7 is not a multiple of any of d's divisors except 1, but in that case, x=7 is included in the consideration for g=1, because 7 is a multiple of 1.\n\nWait, but for g=1, the minimal x is a if a is a multiple of 1, which it is. So x=6 is the minimal.\n\nWait, but in the first example, when g=1, x=6. When g=2, x=8. When g=4, x=8.\n\nSo all x's considered are 6,8,8.\n\nBut in reality, x=7 is also a possibility, but it's not a multiple of any of the divisors except 1. So for g=1, x=6 is the minimal. So x=7 is larger than 6, but for g=1, the x is 6. So in the list, x=7 is not considered as a separate candidate.\n\nWait, no. Because for g=1, the x is the minimal multiple of 1 >=a, which is a=6.\n\nSo x=6 is considered, but x=7 is not considered, unless it is a multiple of some other g.\n\nBut since 7 is a multiple of 1, but for g=1, the minimal x is 6, which is smaller than 7. So in the code, the x=7 is not considered, because for g=1, the x is 6.\n\nSo in that case, the code misses x=7, which could potentially have a lower LCM.\n\nWait, but in the first example, x=7 gives y=11, which has an LCM of 77, which is higher than 24, so it's not a problem.\n\nBut what about cases where x is not a multiple of any of the divisors, but still could give a better LCM?\n\nIs that possible?\n\nHmm, perhaps. For example, suppose d=6.\n\nDivisors are 1,2,3,6.\n\nSuppose a=5.\n\nSo for g=1, x=5.\n\ng=2, x=6.\n\ng=3, x=6.\n\ng=6, x=6.\n\nCompute LCM for x=5: y=11. LCM=55.\n\nx=6: y=12. LCM=12.\n\nBut wait, what about x=7, which is not a multiple of any of the divisors except 1.\n\nx=7: y=13. LCM=91.\n\nWhich is worse than 12.\n\nAnother case: d=6, a=4.\n\ndivisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\nfor g=1: x=4.\n\ng=2: x=4.\n\ng=3: x=6.\n\ng=6: x=6.\n\nCompute for x=4: y=10. LCM=20.\n\nx=4: same.\n\nx=6: y=12. LCM=12.\n\nWhat if x=5: y=11. LCM=55.\n\nWhich is worse.\n\nAnother case: d=6, a=2.\n\ng=1: x=2.\n\ng=2: x=2.\n\ng=3: x=3.\n\ng=6: x=6.\n\nCompute for x=2: y=8. LCM=8.\n\nx=3: y=9. LCM=9.\n\nx=6: y=12. LCM=12.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is 8, achieved at x=2.\n\nSo in this case, considering the x's generated by the divisors works.\n\nBut what if d=6, a=7.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,3,6.\n\ng=1: x=7.\n\ng=2: x=8.\n\ng=3: x=9.\n\ng=6: x=12.\n\nCompute x=7: y=13. LCM=91.\n\nx=8: y=14. LCM=56.\n\nx=9: y=15. LCM=45.\n\nx=12: y=18. LCM=36.\n\nSo the minimal is 36, achieved at x=12.\n\nBut what about x=10: y=16. LCM is 80.\n\nWhich is higher than 36.\n\nSo again, considering the x's derived from the divisors gives the correct result.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=7, d=4.\n\ndivisors: 1,2,4.\n\ng=1: x=3.\n\ng=2: x=4.\n\ng=4: x=4.\n\nSo for x=3: y=7. LCM=21.\n\nx=4: y=8. LCM=8.\n\nWhich is better.\n\nSo the minimal is 8.\n\nSo far, all the examples seem to be covered by considering the x's derived from the divisors.\n\nBut let's think of another scenario.\n\nSuppose d=5, a=2.\n\ndivisors:1,5.\n\ng=1: x=2.\n\ng=5: x=5.\n\nCompute x=2: y=7. LCM=14.\n\nx=5: y=10. LCM=10.\n\nSo minimal is 10.\n\nBut what about x=3: y=8. LCM=24.\n\nx=4: y=9. LCM=36.\n\nx=5: LCM=10.\n\nSo the minimal is achieved at x=5, which is considered.\n\nAnother case: d=3, a=1.\n\ndivisors:1,3.\n\ng=1: x=1.\n\ng=3: x=3.\n\nCompute x=1: y=4. LCM=4.\n\nx=3: y=6. LCM=6.\n\nSo minimal is 4.\n\nBut what about x=2: y=5. LCM=10.\n\nWhich is worse.\n\nSo the code would correctly pick x=1.\n\nSo, it seems that considering the x's generated by the divisors covers all possible cases.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\n- Compute d = |b - a|.\n\n- If d is 0, return 0.\n\n- Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute x as the smallest multiple of g >=a.\n\n- Compute the LCM for each x.\n\n- Among all these x's, find the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple x's have the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x.\n\n- The k is x -a.\n\nBut wait, what about when d is zero? Then a and b are equal, so adding any k won't change x and y; they remain equal, so LCM is x, which is a +k. To minimize, k is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps for the code are:\n\n1. Read a and b.\n\n2. Compute d = abs(b -a).\n\n3. If d ==0, print 0.\n\n4. Else:\n\n   a. Find all divisors of d.\n\n   b. For each divisor g in the divisors, compute x as the smallest multiple of g >=a.\n\n   c. For each x, compute y =x +d.\n\n   d. Compute the LCM as (x * y) // gcd(x, y).\n\n   e. Keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding x.\n\n   f. Among all x's that give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x.\n\n5. Output k =x -a.\n\nBut wait, how to find all the divisors of d?\n\nWe can write a function to find all the divisors of a number.\n\nThe function can be as follows:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n        if n %i ==0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut for n=0, it's undefined, but in our case, d is non-zero.\n\nWait, but in our code, d is |b -a|, which is >=0. But when d=0, we return early.\n\nSo, the code is safe.\n\nWait, but what about when d is 1? Then, the divisors are 1.\n\nSo for a=5, d=1.\n\nx is 5.\n\ny=6.\n\nLCM is 30.\n\nBut what if a=5, d=1, and x=5. What if x=6: y=7. LCM is 42. Worse.\n\nSo the code picks x=5, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=2, d=1.\n\nx=2: y=3. LCM=6.\n\nx=3: y=4. LCM=12.\n\nSo minimal is 6.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, d=1.\n\nx=1: y=2. LCM=2.\n\nx=2: y=3. LCM=6.\n\nSo minimal is 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf a ==b:\n\n   print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   d = abs(b -a).\n\n   Find all divisors of d.\n\n   For each g in divisors:\n\n       x = a + ((g - (a %g)) %g).\n\n       if x <a: x +=g.\n\n       y =x +d.\n\n       current_gcd = math.gcd(x, d).\n\n       current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd.\n\n       keep track of minimal lcm and x.\n\n   After processing all g's, also consider x =a and x =a +d.\n\nWait, why? Because perhaps the minimal is achieved at x =a, which is not covered by any of the divisors except 1.\n\nWait, but for g=1, x is a if a is a multiple of 1, which it is. So x=a is considered.\n\nSimilarly, x =a +d is considered when g=d, since x would be a +d.\n\nWait, but for g=d, x is a + (d - (a %d)) %d.\n\nWhich is a +d - (a mod d). Since a modd is less than d.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 6 and d is4, a modd is 2, so x=6 + (4-2)=8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo x =a +d is considered when g=d.\n\nSo, the code doesn't need to consider x =a +d separately.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as described.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the same x can be generated by different g's, but that's okay.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nImplement the function to get all divisors.\n\nIterate through each g in the divisors.\n\nCompute x.\n\nCompute the LCM.\n\nTrack the minimal.\n\nFinally, output the k.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the case when d=0? So, in code:\n\nif a == b:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    d = abs(b -a)\n\n    # find all divisors\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = infinity\n\n    best_x = None\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        x = a + ((g - (a %g)) %g)\n\n        # ensure x is >=a\n\n        # compute y =x +d\n\n        y =x +d\n\n        # compute gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, d)\n\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, d)\n\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n        # compare with min_lcm\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_x =x\n\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n            if x < best_x:\n\n                best_x =x\n\n    # Now, after all divisors, the best_x is known.\n\n    k = best_x -a\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but what about when d is 0? Well, the code handles it.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10 → d=4.\n\ndivisors: 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: x=6.\n\nCompute y=10.\n\ncurrent_gcd = gcd(6,4)=2.\n\nlcm=6*10/2=30.\n\ng=2: x=6 + (2-6%2)=6+0=6? Wait, 6 mod 2 is 0, so x=6.\n\nWait, wait, no.\n\nWait, a=6, g=2.\n\na modg is 6%2=0.\n\nso (g - (a%g)) %g → (2 -0) mod2 → 0.\n\nso x=6 +0=6.\n\ny=6+4=10.\n\ncurrent_gcd= gcd(6,4)=2.\n\nlcm=6*10/2=30.\n\ng=4:\n\na modg =6 mod4=2.\n\n(g -2) mod4= (4-2)=2 mod4=2.\n\nx=6+2=8.\n\ny=12.\n\ncurrent_gcd= gcd(8,4)=4.\n\nlcm=8*12/4=24.\n\nSo the minimal is 24, achieved at x=8. So k=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:21 31 →d=10.\n\ndivisors: 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=1: x=21.\n\ny=21+10=31.\n\ngcd(21,10)=1.\n\nlcm=21*31=651.\n\ng=2: x=22.\n\ny=32.\n\ngcd(22,10)=2.\n\nlcm=22*32/2=352.\n\ng=5: x=21 + (5 -21%5) →21 mod5 is 1 →5-1=4 →x=25.\n\ny=35.\n\ngcd(25,10)=5.\n\nlcm=25*35/5=175.\n\ng=10: x=21 + (10 -21%10)=21 + (10-1)=30.\n\ny=40.\n\ngcd(30,10)=10.\n\nlcm=30*40/10=120.\n\nSo among all these, the minimal is 120, achieved at x=30.\n\nSo k=30-21=9. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input:5 10 →d=5.\n\ndivisors:1,5.\n\ng=1: x=5.\n\ny=10.\n\ngcd(5,5)=5.\n\nlcm=5*10/5=10.\n\ng=5: x=5 + (5 -5%5)=5+0=5.\n\ny=10.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo minimal is 10, achieved at x=5, k=0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=7 →d=4.\n\ndivisors:1,2,4.\n\ng=1: x=3.\n\ny=7.\n\nlcm=21.\n\ng=2: x=4.\n\ny=8.\n\nlcm=8.\n\ng=4: x=4.\n\nsame as above.\n\nSo minimal is 8, achieved at x=4. k=1.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=6 →d=4.\n\ndivisors:1,2,4.\n\ng=1: x=2.\n\ny=6.\n\nlcm=6.\n\ng=2: x=2.\n\ny=6.\n\nsame as above.\n\ng=4: x=6.\n\ny=10.\n\ngcd(6,4)=2.\n\nlcm=6*10/2=30.\n\nSo minimal is 6, achieved at x=2, k=0.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo, the code should be written as:\n\nImport math.\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf a ==b: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute d=abs(b-a).\n\nfind all divisors of d.\n\ninitialize min_lcm to a very big number.\n\nbest_x to None.\n\nfor each g in divisors:\n\n   x = a + ((g - (a %g)) %g).\n\n   y =x +d.\n\n   current_gcd = math.gcd(x, d).\n\n   current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd.\n\n   if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n       min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n       best_x =x\n\n   elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n       if x < best_x:\n\n           best_x =x\n\nk = best_x -a.\n\nprint(k).\n\nNow, implement the function to get the divisors.\n\nWait, but in Python, for n=0, but in our code, d is non-zero.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n\n        if n %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but for n=0, but in our case, n is d=|b-a|, which is non-zero.\n\nSo the function is safe.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nThe code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n        if n % i ==0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a == b:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    d = abs(b - a)\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_x = None\n    for g in divisors:\n        x = a + ((g - (a % g)) % g)\n        y = x + d\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, d)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_x = x\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if x < best_x:\n                best_x = x\n    k = best_x - a\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait: when a is not a multiple of g, x is computed as a + (g - (a%g)). But if a is already a multiple of g, then (g - (a%g)) is 0, so x remains a.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\na=6, d=4.\n\ndivisors:1,2,4.\n\nfor g=1: x=6.\n\ncurrent_gcd = gcd(6,4)=2.\n\ncurrent_l",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is constant, specifically \\( |b - a| \\). Let's denote this difference as \\( d \\). Our goal is to minimize the LCM of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) where \\( y = x + d \\) and \\( x = a + k \\).\n\n2. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: To minimize the LCM, we consider the divisors of \\( d \\). For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), we compute the smallest multiple of \\( g \\) that is greater than or equal to \\( a \\). This gives us potential candidates for \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Compute LCM for Each Candidate**: For each candidate \\( x \\), compute the corresponding \\( y \\) as \\( y = x + d \\). The LCM of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is then calculated using their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n4. **Track Minimum LCM**: Among all candidates, track the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( x \\). If multiple candidates yield the same minimum LCM, choose the smallest \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Edge Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is trivially \\( k = 0 \\) since \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) will always be the same.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a == b:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    d = abs(b - a)\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_x = None\n    for g in divisors:\n        x = a + ((g - (a % g)) % g)\n        y = x + d\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, d)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_x = x\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if x < best_x:\n                best_x = x\n    k = best_x - a\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Divisors Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all divisors of a given number \\( n \\) by iterating up to the square root of \\( n \\) and adding both the divisor and its complement.\n- **Main Logic**: After reading the input values \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), we compute \\( d \\) as the absolute difference. Using the divisors of \\( d \\), we generate potential values for \\( x \\) and compute the corresponding LCM.\n- **Tracking Minimum LCM**: We keep track of the minimum LCM encountered and update the best candidate \\( x \\) accordingly. Finally, we compute \\( k \\) as the difference between the best \\( x \\) and \\( a \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.",
