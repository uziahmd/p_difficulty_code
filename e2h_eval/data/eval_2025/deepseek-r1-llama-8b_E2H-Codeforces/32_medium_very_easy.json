    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Array Stabilization. We are given an array of integers. The instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array. Our task is to remove exactly one element from the array such that the resulting instability is minimized. We need to find this minimum possible instability.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I think is, what's the approach here? Well, let's see.\n\nLet me think about the sample input. For example, in the first case, the array is [1,3,3,7]. If we remove 7, the array becomes [1,3,3], so max is 3, min is 1, instability is 2. That's the best we can do.\n\nIn the second sample, the array is [1,100000]. Removing either gives a single element array, so the instability is zero.\n\nSo the key idea is to consider each possible element to remove and compute the instability for the resulting array, then pick the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 1e5, iterating through each element and computing the max and min each time would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but what's the effect of removing each element? Let's think about the initial array: after removing any element, the new array's max could be either the same as the original max (if that element wasn't the max) or the next highest. Similarly, the new min could be the same as the original min (if that element wasn't the min) or the next lowest.\n\nSo, perhaps precomputing the possible candidates for max and min after each removal is the way to go.\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. Find the current max and min of the array.\n2. For each element, determine whether it's the max, min, or neither.\n3. When we remove an element, the new max and min will depend on whether we removed the max, the min, or another element.\n4. For each element, compute the potential new instability and track the minimum.\n\nSo, let's think about the cases:\n\nCase 1: The element being removed is the current max.\nThen, the new max will be the second maximum. The min remains the same unless all elements except the max are removed, which isn't the case here because we're only removing one element.\n\nCase 2: The element being removed is the current min.\nSimilarly, the new min will be the second minimum.\n\nCase 3: The element is neither max nor min. Then, the new max is the same as before unless the element was the second max. Wait no—no, if the element is not the max or min, then removing it doesn't affect the max or min. Because the max and min are determined by other elements.\n\nWait, that's correct. So when the element is not the current max or min, removing it doesn't change the max or min. So the instability remains the same as the original (max - min).\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because suppose the array has multiple instances of max or min. For example, if the array is [3,3,3], removing any element leaves the same array, so the instability remains the same.\n\nBut more importantly, for elements that are neither max nor min, their removal doesn't change the max or min. So the new instability is the same as the original.\n\nSo, the only time the instability changes is when we remove the current max or current min.\n\nSo, to find the minimal possible instability, we need to consider two possibilities:\n\n- Remove the max element, compute the new max (second max) and min (original min), so the instability is (new_max - min).\n- Remove the min element, compute the new min (second min) and max (original max), so the instability is (max - new_min).\n- Additionally, for all other elements, the instability remains the same as the original (max - min). So the minimal instability would be the minimum between the original instability, the result of removing the max, and the result of removing the min.\n\nWait, but wait. What if the array has multiple maxima or minima? Like, for instance, if the array is [5,5,5,3]. The current max is 5, and there are multiple 5s. So if you remove one 5, the new max is still 5. So the new instability would be 5-3=2. Which is same as the original max - min, which was also 2.\n\nSo in this case, removing the max doesn't change the instability.\n\nSo in this scenario, the minimal instability is the same as the original.\n\nSo, to compute the minimal instability, we can precompute:\n\n- The original instability (max - min).\n- The instability when the max is removed, which is (second_max - min).\n- The instability when the min is removed, which is (max - second_min).\n- The minimal among these three options.\n\nWait, but why three options? Because removing the max, removing the min, or any other element.\n\nBut since removing any other element doesn't change the max or min (assuming that the array has at least one other max or min), then the instability remains the same as the original.\n\nSo the minimal possible instability would be the minimum between the original instability, the instability when removing the max, and the instability when removing the min.\n\nWait, but perhaps in some cases, removing a non-max, non-min element could lead to a lower instability. Is that possible?\n\nWait, no. Because the max and min are determined by the entire array. So if you remove an element that's not max or min, the max and min remain the same. So the instability remains the same as the original.\n\nThus, the minimal instability is the minimum between the original, the result when removing the max, and the result when removing the min.\n\nSo our approach is:\n\n1. Compute the current max and min.\n2. Compute the second max and second min.\n   - To find the second max, iterate through the array and find the maximum value less than the current max.\n   - Similarly for the second min.\n3. Calculate the instability for each case:\n   a. Remove the max: (second_max - min)\n   b. Remove the min: (max - second_min)\n   c. Keep everything else: (max - min)\n4. The minimal instability is the smallest among the three.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently compute the second max and second min.\n\nYes, that's the crux. So for that, we can scan the array once to find the max and min, and then another scan to find the second max and second min.\n\nAlternatively, for the second max, we can keep track of the top two values while scanning. Same for the second min.\n\nLet me think about how to implement that.\n\nFor the second max:\n\nInitialize second_max as negative infinity.\n\nThen, for each number in the array:\n\nIf the number is greater than current_max, then set second_max = current_max, and current_max = number.\n\nElse if the number is greater than second_max, then update second_max.\n\nThis way, after processing all elements, second_max holds the second highest value.\n\nSimilarly for the second min:\n\nInitialize second_min as positive infinity.\n\nFor each number:\n\nIf the number is less than current_min, then second_min = current_min, current_min = number.\n\nElse if the number is less than second_min, then update second_min.\n\nSo yes, that can work.\n\nOnce we have current_max, current_min, second_max, second_min.\n\nNow, the possible instabilities are:\n\n- original_instability = current_max - current_min\n\n- remove_max_instability = (second_max >= current_min ? second_max - current_min : ???). Wait, but second_max is always less than or equal to current_max.\n\nWait, no, because when you remove the max, the new max is the second_max. So the new array's max is second_max, and the min is current_min.\n\nSo the new instability is second_max - current_min.\n\nSimilarly, when you remove the min, the new min is second_min, and the max remains current_max. So the new instability is current_max - second_min.\n\nSo, for the cases where the array has only one max or min, like in the second sample where the array is [1, 100000], then:\n\ncurrent_max is 100000, current_min is 1.\n\nsecond_max is 1, second_min is 1.\n\nWhen you remove the max (100000), the new array is [1], so max is 1, min is 1. Instability is 0.\n\nSimilarly, when you remove the min, the new array is [100000], same.\n\nSo the code needs to handle the cases when the array has only one occurrence of max or min.\n\nWait, but in the code logic above, if current_max is the only occurrence, then when we remove it, the new max is the second_max, which in that case is the same as current_min. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read the input array.\n\n2. Compute current_max, current_min.\n\n3. Compute second_max and second_min.\n\n4. Compute the three possible instabilities:\n\n   a. original_instability = current_max - current_min.\n\n   b. remove_max: second_max - current_min.\n\n   c. remove_min: current_max - second_min.\n\n5. The minimal instability is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but wait. What if the array has only one element? No, the constraints say n >= 2.\n\nSo, for n=2, the array is of size 2. Let's take the sample where it's [1, 100000].\n\ncurrent_max is 1e5, current_min is 1.\n\nsecond_max is 1, second_min is 1.\n\nThen, the three options are:\n\noriginal: 99999.\n\nremove_max: 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nremove_min: 1e5 - 1 = 99999.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: the first sample.\n\narray is [1,3,3,7]\n\ncurrent_max is 7, current_min is 1.\n\nsecond_max is 3, second_min is 3.\n\nThen:\n\nremove_max: 3 -1 = 2.\n\nremove_min:7-3=4.\n\nso the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [5,5,5,3].\n\ncurrent_max is 5, current_min is 3.\n\nsecond_max is 5, second_min is 5.\n\nSo:\n\nremove_max: 5 -3 =2.\n\nremove_min:5-3=2.\n\noriginal instability is 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nSo, the code would correctly choose 2.\n\nAnother example: [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\ncurrent_max is 5, current_min is 1.\n\nsecond_max is 4, second_min is 2.\n\nRemove max: 4-1=3.\n\nRemove min:5-2=3.\n\nOriginal is 4.\n\nSo minimal is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nImplement the code as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list of a.\n\nCompute current_max = max(a).\n\nCompute current_min = min(a).\n\nCompute second_max and second_min.\n\nTo compute second_max:\n\nInitialize second_max to -infinity.\n\nFor each num in a:\n\n   if num > second_max:\n\n       second_max = num\n\nWait, no. Wait, because if num is the current_max, then second_max should be updated. But in this approach, if a num is larger than second_max, which may include the current_max, then it would overwrite.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to find the two largest numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps using a single pass.\n\nAlternative approach for second_max:\n\nWe can track the two largest numbers.\n\nInitialize first_max and second_max.\n\nInitially, first_max is the maximum, second_max is the second maximum.\n\nBut to find them, perhaps loop through the array and for each number, compare with first_max and second_max.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nInitialize first_max = -infinity, second_max = -infinity.\n\nfor num in a:\n\n   if num > first_max:\n\n       second_max = first_max\n\n       first_max = num\n\n   elif num > second_max:\n\n       second_max = num\n\nThis way, after processing all numbers, first_max is the maximum, second_max is the second maximum.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code for computing second_max:\n\nfirst_max = -inf\n\nsecond_max = -inf\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num > first_max:\n\n        second_max = first_max\n\n        first_max = num\n\n    elif num > second_max:\n\n        second_max = num\n\nSame for second_min:\n\nfirst_min = inf\n\nsecond_min = inf\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num < first_min:\n\n        second_min = first_min\n\n        first_min = num\n\n    elif num < second_min:\n\n        second_min = num\n\nSo, with that, we can get first_max, second_max, first_min, second_min.\n\nWait, but what if the array has all elements the same? Like [5,5,5,5]. Then, first_max is 5, second_max is 5. Similarly for min.\n\nSo, in that case, when you remove any element, the instability is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, now, the code:\n\nCompute the three possible instabilities:\n\noption1 = current_max - current_min\n\noption2 = second_max - current_min\n\noption3 = current_max - second_min\n\nthe minimal is min(option1, option2, option3)\n\nWait, but what if the array has all elements same except one?\n\nLike [5,5,5,3].\n\nThen current_max is 5, current_min is 3.\n\nsecond_max is 5, second_min is 5.\n\nSo, option2 is 5-3=2.\n\noption3 is 5-5=0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct because if you remove the min (3), the array becomes [5,5,5], instability 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle that.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_max = max(a)\n\ncurrent_min = min(a)\n\n# compute second_max\n\nfirst_max = -float('inf')\n\nsecond_max = -float('inf')\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num > first_max:\n\n        second_max = first_max\n\n        first_max = num\n\n    elif num > second_max:\n\n        second_max = num\n\n# compute second_min\n\nfirst_min = float('inf')\n\nsecond_min = float('inf')\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num < first_min:\n\n        second_min = first_min\n\n        first_min = num\n\n    elif num < second_min:\n\n        second_min = num\n\noption1 = current_max - current_min\n\noption2 = second_max - current_min\n\noption3 = current_max - second_min\n\nmin_instability = min(option1, option2, option3)\n\nprint(min_instability)\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any edge cases where this might not work?\n\nWhat about when n=2? Let's see.\n\nCase 1: [1, 3]\n\ncurrent_max is 3, current_min is 1.\n\nsecond_max is 1, second_min is 1.\n\noption1: 3-1=2.\n\noption2: 1-1=0.\n\noption3:3-1=2.\n\nSo the minimal is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: [3,1]\n\nSame as above.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother case: [5,5,5].\n\ncurrent_max=5, current_min=5.\n\nsecond_max=5, second_min=5.\n\noptions: 0, 0,0.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nAnother case: [4,4,3,3].\n\ncurrent_max=4, current_min=3.\n\nsecond_max=4, second_min=3.\n\noption1:1.\n\noption2:4-3=1.\n\noption3:4-3=1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has more than two elements, and the second_max is equal to current_max? Like in the case where the array is [5,5,3].\n\nThen, when you remove a max (5), the new max is still 5, so the instability is 5-3=2.\n\nWhich is option2: second_max is 5, so 5-3=2.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nSo, the code handles that.\n\nSo, I think this approach should work.\n\nNow, the only thing left is to write the code accordingly.\n\nWait, but in Python, for handling very large n (like 1e5), this approach is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should work within the time constraints.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput is '4\\n1 3 3 7'\n\na = [1,3,3,7]\n\ncurrent_max =7, current_min=1.\n\nsecond_max:\n\nLoop:\n\nnum=1: since 1> -inf, first_max=1, second_max=-inf.\n\nnum=3: 3>1 → first_max=3, second_max=1.\n\nnum=3: 3>3? No. 3>1 → yes. So second_max=3.\n\nnum=7: 7>3 → first_max=7, second_max=3.\n\nSo second_max is 3.\n\nsecond_min:\n\nLoop:\n\nnum=1: 1< inf → first_min=1, second_min=inf.\n\nnum=3: 3<1? No. 3 < inf → yes. So second_min=3.\n\nnum=3: same as before. No change.\n\nnum=7: 7>1, no. So nothing.\n\nSo second_min is 3.\n\nOptions:\n\noption1:7-1=6.\n\noption2:3-1=2.\n\noption3:7-3=4.\n\nmin is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\ninput is '2\\n1 100000'\n\na=[1,100000]\n\ncurrent_max=1e5, current_min=1.\n\nsecond_max: process 1 → first_max=1, second_max=-inf.\n\nThen 1e5: 1e5>1 → first_max=1e5, second_max=1.\n\nSo second_max=1.\n\nsecond_min:\n\nprocess 1 → first_min=1, second_min=inf.\n\nthen 1e5: 1e5>1, so no change.\n\nSo second_min=1.\n\noptions:\n\noption1: 99999.\n\noption2:1-1=0.\n\noption3:1e5-1=99999.\n\nmin is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [5,5,5]. All same.\n\ncurrent_max=5, current_min=5.\n\nsecond_max=5, second_min=5.\n\noption1=0, option2=0, option3=0.\n\nmin is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [4,3,5].\n\ncurrent_max=5, current_min=3.\n\nsecond_max is 4, second_min is 3.\n\noption1=2.\n\noption2:4-3=1.\n\noption3:5-3=2.\n\nso min is 1.\n\nWhich is achieved by removing the max (5), leaving [3,4], which has instability 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element.
