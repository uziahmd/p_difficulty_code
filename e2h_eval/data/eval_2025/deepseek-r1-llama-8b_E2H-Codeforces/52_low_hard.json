Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But he's smart because he can take 'b' of these burnt candles and make a new one. And the question is, how many hours in total can he keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, let me think about the example they gave. The first sample input is 4 and 2. So he starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burnt ones. Since b is 2, he can make 4/2 = 2 new candles. He burns those, adding 2 more hours. Now he has 2 burnt candles again. He makes another one, which gives him another hour. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 =7.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. He burns 6, gets 6 burnt. 6/3=2 new candles. Burn them, 2 more. Now he has 2 burnt. He can't make any more since b is 3. So total is 6+2=8.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours, and also the number of burnt candles that can be converted into new ones.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of candles, 'a'. These will burn for 'a' hours.\n2. After burning, we get 'a' burnt candles.\n3. Then, while the number of burnt candles is >= b, we can convert them into new candles. For every batch of 'b' burnt candles, we make one new candle. Each new candle adds one hour, and when burned, contributes to the next round of making new candles.\n4. So the process is:\n   - total_hours = a\n   - remaining_burnt = a\n   - while remaining_burnt >= b:\n       - new_candles = remaining_burnt // b\n       - total_hours += new_candles\n       - remaining_burnt = (remaining_burnt % b) + new_candles\n   - return total_hours\n\nWait, wait. Because after creating new_candles, each of those new ones will add one hour and produce one burnt candle. So yes, the new burnt is new_candles.\n\nSo the loop continues until the remaining_burnt is less than b.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total=4, remaining=4.\n\nLoop:\n4 >=2 → new=2, total becomes 6. remaining is (4%2)=0 +2=2.\n\nNext loop: 2>=2 → new=1, total=7. remaining is 0+1=1. Now 1<2, loop ends.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\nTotal=6, rem=6.\n\n6 >=3: new=2 → total 8. rem=0+2=2. 2<3, loop ends.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where a=1 and b=2? Well, he can't make any new candles. So total is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5.\n\nHe burns 5 → 5 hours. rem=5. 5>=5 → new=1, total 6. rem becomes 0+1=1. 1 <5, done. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\n10 → rem=10. 10//3=3, so add 3. total=13. rem=10%3=1 +3=4.\n\n4 >=3 → new=1, total 14. rem=4%3=1 +1=2. Now 2<3. Done. So total is 14.\n\nLet me compute manually:\n\nBurn 10 →10h. Rem=10.\n\nMake 3 new, burn them →3h. Now rem is 3.\n\nNow rem is 3, make 1 new, burn →1h. Rem is 1+1=2. So yes, 10+3+1=14.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe need to read two integers from input.\n\nIn Python, I can read a line, split into a and b, then convert to integers.\n\nThen, compute as per the algorithm.\n\nSo code structure:\n\nRead a, b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nrem = a\n\nwhile rem >= b:\n\n    new = rem // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    rem = (rem % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting:\n\nFor a=4, b=2: 4 →",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can convert a certain number of burnt candles back into new ones to keep the process going.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`. These will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Burnt Candles Conversion**: After burning all initial candles, we have `a` burnt candles. Using these, we can create new candles by converting every `b` burnt candles into one new candle.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Continue converting burnt candles into new ones as long as there are enough burnt candles (at least `b`). For each conversion, add the number of new candles created to the total hours and update the count of burnt candles.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The process stops when the number of burnt candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nrem = a\n\nwhile rem >= b:\n    new = rem // b\n    total += new\n    rem = (rem % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burnt candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` gives us `a` hours of light.\n3. **Conversion Loop**: While there are enough burnt candles (`rem`) to make at least one new candle (`b`), we:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made.\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the count of burnt candles to reflect the remainder after conversion plus the newly burned candles.\n4. **Output Result**: Once the loop terminates, print the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iteratively converting burnt candles into new ones, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
