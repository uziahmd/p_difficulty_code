Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. Hmm. So the idea is that Vasily has some initial number of candles, 'a'. Each candle burns for exactly one hour and then goes out. But here's the twist: he can take 'b' of these burned-out candles and make a new one. So each time he collects enough gone candles, he can create more to burn.\n\nMy task is to calculate the total hours he can keep the room lit by using these candles optimally.\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. For input 4 2, the output is 7. How does that work?\n\nSo initially, he has 4 candles. He burns all 4, which gives him 4 hours. Then, those 4 become 4 used candles. He can convert 4 into 2 new ones (since 4 divided by 2 is 2). He burns those 2, adding 2 more hours. Now he has 2 used candles left. Since 2 is equal to b (which is 2), he can make one more candle. Burn that, adding another hour. Now he has 1 used candle left, which isn't enough to make another. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 hours.\n\nAnother example: 6 3. So 6 initial. Burn them for 6 hours. Then, 6 used makes 6/3=2 new candles. Burn those for 2, total 8. Then he has 2 used. 2 is less than 3, so can't make more. So total is 6+2=8.\n\nSo the approach seems to be:\n\n1. Start with 'a' candles, add to the total.\n2. Calculate how many new candles can be made from the used ones. Subtract those used to make new ones from the count of used.\n3. Repeat until no more can be made.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? It's a loop where in each step, we collect the used candles, make as many new ones as possible, and add to the total.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Initialize total_hours = a\n- used_candles = a\n- while used_candles >= b:\n    new_candles = used_candles // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    used_candles = (used_candles % b) + new_candles\nSo each time, after creating new candles, the used_candles are the remainder plus the new ones.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Let's see if this works with the examples.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal =4, used=4.\n\n4 >=2: new=2. total becomes 6. used becomes 0 +2=2.\n\nNow 2 >=2: new=1. total=7. used=0 +1=1. Now 1 <2, loop ends. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, used=6.\n\n6>=3: new=2. total=8. used=0 +2=2. Now 2<3, loop ends. Correct.\n\nWhat about other test cases?\n\nAnother case: say a=5, b=5.\n\nInitial: total=5, used=5.\n\n5 >=5: new=1. total=6. used=0 +1=1. 1<5. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial 10 → total=10, used=10.\n\n10/3 is 3, remainder 1. So new=3. total=13. used=1 +3=4.\n\n4 <3? No, wait 4 is larger than 3. So 4/3 is 1, rem 1. New=1. total=14. used=1+1=2.\n\n2 <3: done. So total is 10+3+1=14.\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nInitial: 10, used=10.\n\nLoop:\nnew =10//3=3. total +=3 →13. used =10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nNext iteration: 4 >=3 → new=1. total 14. used=4%3=1 +1=2.\n\nNow 2 <3. Done. So yes, total is 14.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nCompute the total as per the loop.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as a single line, split into two integers.\n\nInitialize total = a\n\nused = a\n\nloop while used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can convert a certain number of these burned-out candles into new ones to continue burning.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a` and calculate the initial hours they will burn.\n2. **Conversion Loop**: After each set of candles burns out, convert the used candles into new ones. This is done by dividing the count of used candles by `b` (the number needed to make a new candle).\n3. **Update Counters**: Add the new candles to the total hours and update the count of used candles to include both the remainder from the conversion and the newly made candles.\n4. **Termination Condition**: Continue this process until there are not enough used candles left to make another new candle.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total hours by iteratively converting used candles into new ones and summing up the total burn time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = (used % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`.\n- **Initialization**: We start with `total` hours as `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n- **Loop Through Used Candles**: While there are enough used candles to make at least one new candle, we calculate how many new candles can be made, add this to the total hours, and update the count of used candles.\n- **Update Used Candles**: After making new candles, the remaining used candles plus the new ones are carried over for the next iteration.\n- **Output Result**: Once the loop terminates, print the total hours.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the conversion and counting process, ensuring that we maximize the hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated.",
