The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate that's divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We need to add k golden rings. Each ring is like a border around the plate, but each subsequent ring is two cells inward from the previous one. So, the first ring is along the very edge, the second is two cells in, and so on.\n\nWait, no, wait. The i-th ring is made by considering an inner rectangle whose dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side, which is 2*2=4 subtracted per dimension.\n\nThe task is to compute the total number of cells that are gilded, meaning all the cells in these rings.\n\nHmm. So for each ring from 1 to k, we need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all up.\n\nWait, because each ring is the perimeter of a rectangle. So for each i-th ring, the rectangle is (w -4*(i-1)) by (h-4*(i-1)), but only if that rectangle is valid. Because, for example, if after subtracting 4*(i-1), either dimension becomes less than 3, then maybe we can't form a ring. But according to the input constraints, k is such that it won't go beyond the possible rings. So we don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w', h') where w' = w - 4*(i-1) and h' = h -4*(i-1). Then sum all perimeters.\n\nWait, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(w + h - 2). Because the perimeter is the sum of all four sides: top row has h cells, bottom row h, left and right have (w-2) each. So total is 2*(w + h - 2).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Initialize a total count to 0.\n2. For each i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current width as w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current height as h -4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute the perimeter: 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n   d. Add this to the total.\n3. After processing all k rings, output the total.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1.\n\nFor i=1:\ncurrent_w =3, current_h=3\nperimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input:7 9 1.\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=9.\nperimeter is 2*(7+9-2)= 2*14=28. Which is correct.\n\nThird example input:7 9 2.\n\ni=1: perimeter 28.\ni=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5.\nPerimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40, which matches the output.\n\nSo yes, the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nWe'll read the input as three integers: w, h, k.\n\nThen loop from 1 to k inclusive, for each step compute the current dimensions and add the perimeter.\n\nSo code-wise:\n\nRead the input line, split into w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? For example, if w is 3, h is 3, and k is 1. Then current_w is 3, current_h is 3, which is fine. If k were larger, say 2, but then current_w would be 3 -4= -1, which is impossible. But according to the problem statement, k is constrained such that it won't cause that. So we don't need to handle such cases.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting another case: suppose w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\ni=1: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16.\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. Wait, 1x1? But then the perimeter would be 2*(1+1-2) = 0. Hmm, but according to the problem statement, the rings are formed as long as they fit. But perhaps when the dimensions are too small, the perimeter is zero.\n\nBut the problem says that k is limited to floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). Let's see, for w=5, h=5, min is 5, (5+1)/4 is 6/4=1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2 here.\n\nSo in our code, since k is within the allowed range, we don't have to worry about negative or zero dimensions.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother test case: w=7, h=9, k=2 → 28+12=40, as in the sample.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate that has been divided into `w` rows and `h` columns. The plate has `k` gilded rings, each forming a border around the plate, with each subsequent ring being two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Rings**: Each ring is a border around a rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring reduces the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle it forms. The perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions `width` and `height` is given by `2 * (width + height - 2)`.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: For each of the `k` rings, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height of the rectangle formed by that ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)` and add this to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all `k` rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
