You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vitaly and a graph. We need to find the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length, more than one vertex, and each vertex in the cycle occurs at most once. Also, we need to find the number of ways to do this.\n\nHmm. So, the input is an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected, no loops or parallel edges.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a valid cycle here. A cycle is a path where you start and end at the same vertex without repeating any other vertices. And the length must be odd, like 3,5, etc. Also, the cycle should consist of more than one vertex, so the smallest allowed is a triangle (length 3).\n\nSo, the goal is to find the minimal t edges to add to create such a cycle, and w is the number of ways to do that.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think.\n\nWhat's the approach here?\n\nI remember that for a graph to have a cycle, it must be possible to have at least one cycle. But since the graph is undirected and has no loops or multiple edges, cycles can exist in its components.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to form a simple cycle of odd length. So, perhaps the first thing is to check whether the graph already has such a cycle. If it does, then t is 0, because no edges need to be added.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create such a cycle.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nCase 1: The graph already contains an odd-length cycle. Then t=0, w=1.\n\nCase 2: The graph doesn't have any odd-length cycles. Then, we need to find the minimal edges to add.\n\nWait, but when can a graph not have any odd-length cycles? For example, if all cycles are even-length, which requires the graph to be bipartite. Because in a bipartite graph, all cycles are of even length. So, if the graph is bipartite, then adding edges might be needed.\n\nWait, but maybe the graph is not bipartite, but doesn't have any odd-length cycles. Hmm, no, I think that's not possible. Because if a graph has any cycle, it's either even or odd. So if the graph has a cycle, it's either bipartite (so all cycles even) or non-bipartite (has odd cycles). So, if the graph is bipartite, then it has no odd cycles.\n\nSo, for the case where the graph is not bipartite, there exists some odd cycle. So, in that case, t=0.\n\nWait, no. Because the graph could be non-bipartite, but perhaps not contain any cycles. Like, a tree is bipartite, but trees don't have cycles. Wait, no: a tree is acyclic, so it doesn't have any cycles. So, if the graph is a tree, then it's bipartite and has no cycles.\n\nSo, let's outline:\n\n- If the graph has an odd cycle (i.e., it's not bipartite and has at least one cycle), then t=0 and w=1.\n\nElse, the graph is bipartite. Then, to form an odd cycle, we need to add edges in such a way that the graph becomes non-bipartite, and forms an odd cycle.\n\nBut wait, the problem is not just to make the graph non-bipartite. We also need to form a specific cycle of odd length, consisting of more than one vertex, and each vertex appears at most once.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the minimal t is the minimal number of edges required to connect two parts of a bipartition in a certain way.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's think differently.\n\nWe need to form a cycle of odd length. Since the initial graph may not have any such cycles, we have to find the minimal number of edges to add to create such a cycle.\n\nSo, when the graph is bipartite, adding edges can create an odd cycle.\n\nIn a bipartite graph, any edge that connects two nodes in the same partition would create an odd cycle if added. Because the bipartition is such that all cycles are even. Adding an edge within a partition would make a cycle of odd length.\n\nFor example, suppose the graph is bipartitioned into A and B. An edge between two nodes in A would create a cycle that starts and ends in A, making the cycle length odd.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1, provided that there exists at least one node in each partition with degree less than the maximum possible.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: in a bipartite graph, any edge that connects two nodes in the same partition would create an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1, as long as the graph is bipartite and has at least two nodes in each partition. Or wait, no: the bipartition may have only one node in one of the partitions. Like, a star graph with one center node connected to many others.\n\nWait, for example, consider a bipartite graph where partition A has 1 node and partition B has k nodes. So, all edges are from the center to the leaves. Any new edge added between two leaves would create a cycle of length 3, which is odd.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal t is 1.\n\nBut wait, suppose the bipartition is A has size 1, B has size 1. Then, the graph is just a single edge. Adding another edge is impossible because it's a loop, which is not allowed. So, in this case, the graph can't form a cycle.\n\nWait, so in the general case, for a bipartite graph:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, then it's possible that adding one edge within a partition will create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the graph is a tree? For example, a chain of three nodes: 1-2-3. It's bipartitioned as {1,3}, {2}. So, adding an edge between 1 and 3 would create a cycle of length 2, but that's even. Wait, no—wait, the existing edges are 1-2 and 2-3. Adding 1-3 creates a cycle 1-2-3-1, which is length 3. That's odd. So, yes.\n\nSo, in this case, adding one edge is sufficient.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1 for a bipartite graph that is not a single edge (which can't form a cycle anyway).\n\nWait, but what if the bipartition is A has size 1, and B has size greater than 1?\n\nLike, node 1 is connected to 2, 3, 4.\n\nIn this case, adding an edge between 2 and 3 would create a cycle 1-2-3-1, which is length 3.\n\nSo, again, t=1.\n\nSo, the conclusion is:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite and has at least two nodes in each partition, or in any partition, then adding one edge within a partition will create an odd cycle.\n\nThus, t=1.\n\nBut wait, what if the bipartition is such that one partition has zero nodes? No, because a graph can't be bipartitioned into empty set and non-empty set; the bipartition must have both sets non-empty.\n\nWait, no. For a graph to be bipartite, it must be possible to divide the vertices into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. So, each partition must have at least one node.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1 if the graph is bipartite.\n\nWait, but what if the graph is already a cycle of even length? Then, it's bipartite, and adding one edge can create an odd cycle.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFirst, check if the graph has any odd-length cycle. If yes, then t=0, w=1.\n\nElse, the graph is bipartite. Then, we need to compute the minimal t, which is 1, and count the number of ways to add edges to create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but in the case where the graph is bipartite, adding one edge within a partition will create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1.\n\nNow, the question is: how many ways are there to add edges to achieve this?\n\nIn other words, how many edges can we add that connect two nodes in the same partition, thus forming an odd cycle.\n\nEach such edge will create exactly one new odd cycle.\n\nSo, for each possible edge (u, v) where u and v are in the same partition, adding this edge will create an odd cycle.\n\nThus, the number of ways is equal to the number of possible edges that can be added between nodes in the same partition.\n\nWait, but what if adding such an edge creates multiple cycles? No, because the edge is being added between two nodes that are not connected via a path of even length. Wait, no, perhaps adding an edge could create multiple cycles, but each such addition contributes to exactly one way.\n\nNo, perhaps each added edge creates exactly one new odd cycle.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the graph is a tree, and adding an edge creates a unique cycle. So, each added edge corresponds to exactly one way.\n\nSo, the number of possible edges that can be added is the number of edges between nodes in the same partition.\n\nWait, but in a bipartition, the two partitions are X and Y. Any edge that connects a node in X to another node in X is invalid because the graph is bipartite and such edges don't exist. So, in the given graph, all edges are between X and Y.\n\nSo, for the current graph, the number of possible edges to add that connect two nodes in the same partition is the sum over each partition of the number of possible pairs in that partition.\n\nSo, for partition X, the number of possible edges is C(|X| choose 2), similarly for Y.\n\nWait, but in the given graph, those edges don't exist yet.\n\nSo, the number of possible edges that can be added is the sum of C(x, 2) + C(y, 2), where x is the size of X and y is the size of Y.\n\nSo, the total w is the sum of these combinations.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the original graph may have some edges that can contribute.\n\nWait, no. Because the graph is bipartite, so any existing edges are between X and Y. So, the existing edges don't affect the number of possible edges to add within X or Y.\n\nSo, the number of possible edges that can be added within X is C(x,2), and within Y is C(y,2). So, total possible edges is C(x,2) + C(y,2).\n\nEach of these edges, when added, will create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the number of ways is the number of such edges.\n\nThus, the answer is t=1, w= (C(x,2) + C(y,2)).\n\nWait, but what if the graph has no cycles to begin with? Like, it's a forest.\n\nThen, adding one edge would create exactly one cycle. That cycle's length depends on the structure.\n\nWait, for example, a forest with two trees. Adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition will create a cycle.\n\nBut in a forest, the bipartition is such that each tree is bipartitioned accordingly.\n\nSo, the same logic applies.\n\nSo, in all cases where the graph is bipartite, adding any edge between two nodes in the same partition will create an odd cycle.\n\nThus, the number of ways is the number of such possible edges.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the graph is bipartite. If it's not, then it contains an odd cycle, so output t=0 and w=1.\n\n2. If the graph is bipartite, then check if it's possible to add an edge within a partition. That is, if either X has at least two nodes or Y has at least two nodes.\n\n   a. If X has at least two nodes OR Y has at least two nodes, then t=1 and w is the sum of C(x,2) + C(y,2), where x is |X|, y is |Y|.\n\n   b. Else, the graph can't form a cycle of odd length because you can't add an edge within a partition. So, t is infinity, but according to the problem statement, the graph must have a cycle of odd length after adding edges. But wait, if the graph is bipartite and has only one node in each partition, then adding an edge is not possible. So, the graph is just a single edge. In that case, it's impossible to form a cycle because the graph has only two nodes connected by one edge. So, the answer is t= impossible, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the input graph doesn't have loops or parallel edges, but it's possible that the graph is disconnected and each component is a single edge.\n\nWait, but in that case, how can we form a cycle? Well, the graph would have to have a cycle in one of its components. So, for example, if the graph is a single edge, it's impossible to create a cycle by adding edges because adding another edge would create a multi-edge or a loop, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the answer would be that it's impossible to form such a cycle, so t would be something like infinity, but according to the problem statement, the output is required to print t and w, which are the minimal number of edges and the number of ways. But if it's impossible, perhaps the output is -1 or something, but looking back at the problem statement, the sample inputs include a case where the graph has 3 nodes and 0 edges, which is a tree.\n\nWait, in the sample input, for the third test case:\n\nInput:\n3 0\n\nSo, the graph is three nodes, no edges. It's bipartite, as any tree is bipartite. So, to form a cycle, we need to add edges.\n\nSince it's a complete bipartition of 1 and 2 nodes? Wait, no, wait. Wait, for three nodes, a bipartition would be X with one node, Y with two. So, adding an edge between the two nodes in Y would create a triangle, which is an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the number of possible edges to add is C(2,2)=1. So, t=1, w=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the third case is 3 0, which outputs '3 1'? Wait, no, the sample output shows the third line as '3 1'. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\nThe sample output is:\n\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\nWait, the third case is 3 nodes, 0 edges. So, it's a bipartition of X=1, Y=2.\n\nSo, adding an edge between the two nodes in Y. How many such edges are possible? Only one edge: between the two nodes in Y.\n\nSo, the number of ways is 1. So, why does the sample output say '3 1' for the third case?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the sample input.\n\nWait, the third input line is '3 0', so n=3, m=0. So, the graph is three isolated nodes.\n\nSo, the bipartition is X with 1 node, Y with 2 nodes.\n\nSo, the possible edges to add are between any two nodes in Y.\n\nIn Y, the two nodes are not connected. So, there's only one possible edge to add.\n\nSo, why does the sample output for the third case show '3 1'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps the third case's output is '3 1' because the minimal t is 3 edges. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm reading the sample wrong.\n\nWait, looking at the sample output:\n\nThe output lines are:\n\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\nSo, the first line corresponds to the first input case, second to the second, third to the third.\n\nWait, the first input is 4 4, which is a graph with four nodes and four edges. The output is 1 2.\n\nThe second input is 3 3, which is a triangle. So, it's a cycle of length 3, which is odd. So, t=0, w=1.\n\nThe third input is 3 0: a graph with three nodes, no edges. The output is 3 1.\n\nWait, that seems off. Because earlier reasoning suggests that adding one edge is sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the problem understanding.\n\nWait, the problem requires the cycle to consist of more than one vertex. So, the cycle's length must be at least 3.\n\nSo, for the third case, adding one edge between two nodes creates a cycle of length 3.\n\nSo, why is the output t=3, w=1?\n\nThat doesn't fit. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the graph is a collection of components, and the cycle must be formed within a single component.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal t is the minimal edges to add such that at least one component becomes a cycle of odd length.\n\nAh! Oh right, that's an important point.\n\nSo, the problem is not just to find any cycle, but to form a cycle in the graph. So, if the graph is disconnected, and adding edges to one component creates a cycle, while other components remain without cycles, it's still acceptable.\n\nBut the problem requires that the entire graph has a cycle of odd length.\n\nWait, no. The problem says: form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. So, any such cycle in the graph is sufficient.\n\nSo, for the third case, adding one edge between two nodes creates a cycle of length 3. So, t=1, w=1.\n\nBut the sample output says 3 1. So, why?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement. Let me re-read it.\n\nProblem statement: We need to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, each vertex in the cycle occurs at most once.\n\nSo, in the third case, the graph has three nodes, no edges. So, adding one edge between two nodes, say 1-2. Now, the graph has edges 1-2. The nodes are 1,2,3. There is no cycle yet. Adding another edge, say 2-3. Now, nodes 1,2,3 form a path 1-2-3. Adding another edge, say 3-1, now we have a cycle of length 3.\n\nWait, but that requires adding three edges. So, in that case, the minimal t is 3, and there is only one way to add them (the triangle).\n\nSo, perhaps that's why the sample output for the third case is '3 1'.\n\nAh! That makes sense.\n\nSo, my earlier reasoning was incorrect because I thought that adding one edge creates a cycle. But in reality, the graph must have at least one cycle. So, the initial graph is three nodes, no edges. To form a cycle, you need to connect all three nodes in a way that forms a cycle.\n\nSo, adding three edges in a triangle.\n\nSo, that explains the sample.\n\nSo, the earlier approach was incorrect.\n\nThis changes everything.\n\nSo, the problem is not just about making the graph non-bipartite, but also ensuring that a cycle exists. So, the minimal t is determined based on the structure of the graph.\n\nSo, I need to rethink the approach.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal number of edges to add such that the resulting graph contains at least one simple cycle of odd length, with more than one vertex, and each vertex in the cycle appears exactly once.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Find all possible ways to add edges to the graph such that the result contains a simple cycle of odd length.\n\n2. Among these, find the minimal t, and count the number of ways (w) to achieve this.\n\nSo, the first step is to determine whether the graph already has such a cycle.\n\nIf yes, then t=0, w=1.\n\nElse, we need to find the minimal t.\n\nSo, the key is to find the minimal number of edges to add to create such a cycle.\n\nSo, how?\n\nLet me think of the possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: The graph has a cycle of odd length. Then, t=0, w=1.\n\nCase 2: The graph is bipartite and has no cycles. Then, adding edges to create a cycle.\n\nBut in this case, we need to create a cycle of odd length.\n\nSo, in the case of a bipartite graph, adding an edge within a partition will create an odd cycle. However, the minimal number of edges to add is 1.\n\nWait, but in the third sample, adding one edge didn't create a cycle. Because the graph is three nodes, no edges, adding one edge between two nodes creates a single edge, which is not a cycle.\n\nWait, so perhaps my earlier understanding was wrong.\n\nSo, the problem is that adding an edge alone is insufficient to form a cycle. It requires that the added edges form a closed path.\n\nSo, the problem is not just about making the graph non-bipartite, but also ensuring that the graph has a cycle.\n\nSo, in the case of a bipartite graph with no cycles, adding one edge is insufficient to form a cycle. Thus, the minimal t is higher.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nSo, in the third sample, the graph is three nodes, no edges. So, it's bipartitioned into X={1}, Y={2,3}.\n\nAdding one edge between 2 and 3: now, the graph has edges 2-3. No cycles yet.\n\nAdding another edge, say 1-2: now, the graph has edges 1-2 and 2-3. Still no cycle.\n\nAdding another edge, say 1-3: now, the graph has edges 1-2, 2-3, 1-3. This forms a cycle 1-2-3-1, which is of length 3, which is odd.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 3, and the number of ways is 1 (since the only way is to add all three edges forming a triangle).\n\nHence, the sample output is '3 1'.\n\nSo, this indicates that the approach needs to change.\n\nSo, the problem is more complex than initially thought.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check if the graph already has an odd-length cycle. If yes, t=0, w=1.\n\n2. Else, the graph is bipartite, and has no cycles (since if it had cycles, they are even-length).\n\n   a. Now, in this case, we need to find the minimal number of edges to add so that the graph has at least one odd-length cycle.\n\n   b. Additionally, the added edges must form a cycle.\n\nSo, how?\n\nWell, in the case where the graph is a forest (no cycles), adding edges to form a single cycle may require a certain number of edges.\n\nWait, for a forest, the number of edges to add to form a single cycle is (number of trees - 1). Because to connect k trees into one, you need k-1 edges. But that's for a spanning tree. Wait, no.\n\nWait, no, because adding edges can create cycles.\n\nWait, but for a forest, adding edges until the number of edges equals the number of vertices in a component would create a cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of connected components.\n\nFor each connected component in the graph, which is a tree, the number of edges is (number of nodes - 1). So, adding one edge to a tree creates a cycle.\n\nBut for a tree, adding one edge creates exactly one cycle.\n\nSo, if the graph is a forest, adding one edge per tree (but not necessarily) can create cycles.\n\nWait, for example, a graph with two trees. Each is a separate component. Adding one edge between them creates a single cycle, but the cycle's length depends on the distance between the nodes in the two trees.\n\nHmm, but the cycle's length is even or odd? Not sure.\n\nWait, but for the purposes of this problem, we need to form any odd-length cycle.\n\nSo, perhaps adding edges across different components can create cycles of various lengths.\n\nBut the minimal t is the minimal number of edges needed to create at least one odd-length cycle.\n\nSo, for a graph with c connected components, each a tree, the minimal t is 1 if any of the components can be turned into a cycle that is odd.\n\nWait, no, because adding one edge to a tree creates a cycle. The length of that cycle is even or odd depends on the distance between the two nodes.\n\nWait, for a tree, the path between any two nodes is unique. So, adding an edge between two nodes u and v that are at an even distance apart in their tree would create a cycle of even length. If they're at an odd distance, the cycle would be odd.\n\nSo, for a tree, adding an edge between two nodes at an odd distance would create an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo, in a bipartite graph (forest), each tree is bipartitioned into X and Y.\n\nThe distance between two nodes in a tree is the number of edges on the path between them.\n\nIf the distance is even, adding an edge between them creates a cycle of even length.\n\nIf the distance is odd, adding the edge creates a cycle of odd length.\n\nSo, in a tree, the minimal t is 1 if there exists at least one pair of nodes at an odd distance.\n\nThus, for a forest, if any tree has two nodes at an odd distance, adding an edge between them creates an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1.\n\nBut wait, in the third sample, the graph is three nodes, no edges. So, each node is its own component.\n\nSo, adding one edge between any two nodes creates a tree with two nodes connected. Adding another edge between the third node and either of them would create a cycle. Wait, but the third sample requires adding three edges to form a triangle.\n\nWait, no. The third sample is a graph with three nodes, no edges. So, it's three separate components (each node is a component). So, adding edges:\n\nOption 1: Add edges between all three nodes in a cycle. So, 3 edges.\n\nOption 2: Alternatively, add edges in a way that forms a cycle. For example, add edges 1-2, 2-3, 1-3. This creates a triangle.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to form a cycle with fewer edges.\n\nWait, adding just two edges: 1-2 and 2-3. Now, the graph has edges 1-2 and 2-3. This forms a path 1-2-3, but no cycle. So, adding another edge, say 3-1, creates a cycle of length 3.\n\nSo, t=3, w=1.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to create a cycle with two edges?\n\nWait, no, because two edges can't form a cycle unless they connect the same nodes in a way that creates a loop, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 3.\n\nSo, for the third sample, the minimal t is 3, and w=1.\n\nSo, the previous approach of considering bipartition and adding one edge is insufficient.\n\nThus, I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the minimal number of edges to add to create at least one odd cycle, and the number of ways to do that.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the graph already has an odd cycle. If yes, output t=0, w=1.\n\n2. Else, the graph is bipartite and has no odd cycles. So, the graph is bipartite and is a forest (since if it's not a forest, it has cycles, but they are even).\n\n   a. So, the graph is a bipartite forest.\n\n   b. Now, we need to find the minimal number of edges to add so that the graph contains an odd cycle.\n\n   c. The minimal t is the minimal number of edges that can be added to create an odd cycle.\n\n   d. The number of ways is the number of ways to choose such edges.\n\nSo, the challenge is to find for a bipartite forest, the minimal t.\n\nSo, for each connected component in the forest, which is a tree, we can analyze the possibility of adding edges to create an odd cycle.\n\nIn a tree, adding an edge between two nodes u and v will create a cycle whose length is equal to the distance between u and v plus one.\n\nBecause the path from u to v in the tree is of length d. When adding the edge u-v, the cycle is u -> ... -> v -> u, which has length d+1.\n\nSo, the parity of the cycle's length depends on d: if d is even, the cycle is odd (d+1 is odd). If d is odd, the cycle is even.\n\nSo, to create an odd cycle, we need to add an edge between two nodes in a tree where the distance between them is even.\n\nSo, in each tree, the minimal number of edges to add is 1, but only if there exists at least two nodes with even distance.\n\nWait, but in a tree, any two nodes have a unique path. So, for a given tree, the distances between nodes vary.\n\nSo, for each tree, we can precompute the distances between all pairs of nodes. Then, for each pair, if the distance is even, adding the edge creates an odd cycle.\n\nThus, for each tree, the number of possible edges that can be added to create an odd cycle is equal to the number of pairs of nodes at even distance.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1, provided that at least one tree has such a pair.\n\nSo, the overall approach for the bipartite forest case is:\n\n- For each connected component (tree) in the graph:\n\n   i. Compute the distances between all pairs of nodes.\n\n   ii. Count the number of pairs of nodes with even distance.\n\n   iii. If the component has at least one such pair, then adding an edge between them would create an odd cycle.\n\n- If any component has such a pair, then the minimal t is 1. Otherwise, the minimal t is larger.\n\nWait, but what if none of the components have such a pair? Is that possible?\n\nWait, for example, consider a star-shaped tree with center node connected to several leaves. The distance from the center to any leaf is 1 (odd). So, adding an edge between any two leaves would have a distance of 2 (even) in the tree. Thus, adding that edge would create a cycle of length 3 (odd).\n\nSo, in this case, the component has pairs of nodes at even distance, so t=1.\n\nAnother example: a tree that is a straight line of 4 nodes: 1-2-3-4.\n\nDistances between nodes:\n\nBetween 1 and 2: 1 (odd)\n\n1 and 3: 2 (even)\n\n1 and 4: 3 (odd)\n\n2 and 3: 1 (odd)\n\n2 and 4: 2 (even)\n\n3 and 4: 1 (odd)\n\nSo, the pairs (1,3), (2,4) have even distances. So, adding edges between them creates odd cycles.\n\nThus, t=1.\n\nBut wait, what about a tree that is a straight line of 5 nodes: 1-2-3-4-5.\n\nIn this case, distances between nodes:\n\n1-3: 2 (even) → adding edge creates a cycle of length 3.\n\n1-4: 3 (odd) → adding edge creates even cycle.\n\n2-4: 2 (even) → adding edge creates odd cycle.\n\nSo, again, t=1.\n\nIs there a tree where no two nodes have even distance between them?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in a tree, there must be at least two nodes with even distance.\n\nWait, for a tree with two nodes: distance is 1 (odd). No edges, so adding one edge creates a cycle of length 2, which is even. So, no.\n\nBut for a tree with three nodes: 1-2-3.\n\nDistance between 1 and 3 is 2 (even). So, adding edge 1-3 creates a cycle of length 3 (odd).\n\nSo, for a tree with at least three nodes, there exists at least one pair of nodes at even distance.\n\nBut for a tree with two nodes, adding an edge creates a cycle of length 2 (even), which doesn't satisfy the problem's requirement.\n\nSo, for a graph that is a forest of trees, each tree must have at least three nodes to contribute to creating an odd cycle when adding an edge.\n\nWait, but in the case where the graph is a single tree with two nodes, adding an edge creates a cycle of length 2, which is even. So, no.\n\nThus, for the graph to be able to form an odd cycle, it must have at least one tree with more than two nodes, and that tree must have a pair of nodes at even distance.\n\nSo, in the case where all trees are of size one, the graph is a set of isolated nodes. So, adding edges between any two nodes creates a cycle of length 2 (even), which is not allowed. Thus, it's impossible to form an odd cycle.\n\nSo, in this case, the answer would be that it's impossible. But according to the problem statement, the output is required to print t and w. So, perhaps in such cases, t is impossible, but according to the sample, the third case is a graph of three nodes, no edges, which can form a cycle by adding three edges.\n\nWait, but in that case, the graph is three isolated nodes. So, adding edges:\n\nWe can add edges 1-2, 2-3, 3-1. This forms a cycle of length 3.\n\nBut the minimal t is 3.\n\nSo, perhaps when the graph is a set of isolated nodes, the minimal t is the number of nodes minus 1, but arranged in a cycle.\n\nWait, but that's only one way.\n\nSo, for the third sample, the graph is three nodes, no edges. So, to form a cycle, you need to connect all three in a cycle. Thus, adding three edges.\n\nBut wait, what about adding edges 1-2, 1-3, 2-3. That's the same as before.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 3.\n\nThus, in the case where the graph is a set of isolated nodes, the minimal t is (n-1) edges to form a cycle, but that's only possible if n >=3.\n\nWait, but for n=2, it's impossible.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\nFor a bipartite forest:\n\n- If any tree has a pair of nodes at even distance, then t=1, and w is the sum of the number of such pairs in all trees.\n\n- Else, if all trees have no such pairs, then the graph is a set of trees, each with two nodes (edges between them). So, in this case, adding edges cannot create an odd cycle. So, the minimal t is (n - number_of_trees) edges, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps in this case, the graph is a set of trees, each of which is a single edge (two nodes). So, for each such tree, adding edges can't create an odd cycle.\n\nThus, in this case, the minimal t is the number of edges required to form a cycle.\n\nBut for a graph of three isolated nodes, the minimal t is 3, as in the third sample.\n\nSo, in general, when the graph is a set of isolated nodes, the minimal t is (k), where k is the number of edges required to form a cycle. Which is (n-1) edges, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, for n=3, you need 3 edges to form a triangle. For n=4, you need 4 edges, but that's a cycle of length 4, which is even. So, that's not acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal t is the number of edges required to form a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nBut for a graph of four nodes, the minimal t is 4 edges (a square), but that's even, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, in that case, it's impossible to form an odd cycle with four nodes.\n\nWait, but if the four nodes are connected in a way that forms an odd cycle, but that would require adding edges in a particular way.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into two cases:\n\n1. The graph already has an odd cycle. Then, t=0, w=1.\n\n2. Else, the graph is bipartite and a forest.\n\n   a. For each connected component (tree) in the graph:\n\n      i. Check if the tree has a pair of nodes at even distance.\n\n      ii. If any tree has such a pair, then the minimal t is 1, and w is the sum of the counts of such pairs across all trees.\n\n   b. Else, all trees are of size two (i.e., each tree is a single edge). So, adding edges to connect them into a cycle.\n\n      i.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a graph so that it contains a simple cycle of odd length, and also count the number of ways to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Odd Cycle**: First, we check if the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If it does, the answer is `t=0` and `w=1`.\n\n2. **Bipartite Graph Check**: If the graph is bipartite, it means all cycles in the graph are of even length. In this case, we need to find the minimum number of edges to add to form an odd cycle.\n\n3. **Forest Analysis**: For a bipartite graph that is a forest (i.e., a collection of trees), we analyze each tree to see if adding an edge between two nodes can create an odd cycle. Specifically, we look for pairs of nodes at an even distance apart in each tree.\n\n4. **Handle Special Cases**: If the graph consists of isolated nodes, we need to form a cycle by connecting them appropriately, which requires adding edges to form a cycle of odd length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_bipartite(n, adj):\n    color = [-1] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if color[i] == -1:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(i)\n            color[i] = 0\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if color[v] == -1:\n                        color[v] = color[u] ^ 1\n                        queue.append(v)\n                    elif color[v] == color[u]:\n                        return False, None\n    return True, color\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n\n    # Check if the graph has an odd cycle\n    is_bip, color = is_bipartite(n, adj)\n    if not is_bip:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n\n    # The graph is bipartite; now check if it's a forest\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    components = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            stack = [(i, -1)]\n            component = []\n            visited[i] = True\n            while stack:\n                u, parent = stack.pop()\n                component.append(u)\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if not visited[v] and v != parent:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        stack.append((v, u))\n            components.append(component)\n\n    # Now, for each component, check if there exists any pair with even distance\n    total_pairs = 0\n    has_possible = False\n    for comp in components:\n        if len(comp) < 3:\n            continue\n        dist = {}\n        for u in comp:\n            dist[u] = {}\n            for v in comp:\n                if u == v:\n                    dist[u][v] = 0\n                else:\n                    visited_nodes = set()\n                    path = []\n                    stack = [(u, v, 0)]\n                    found = False\n                    while stack:\n                        current, target, d = stack.pop()\n                        if current == target:\n                            dist[u][v] = d\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                        if current in visited_nodes:\n                            continue\n                        visited_nodes.add(current)\n                        for neighbor in adj[current]:\n                            if neighbor != target and neighbor not in visited_nodes:\n                                stack.append((neighbor, target, d+1))\n                    if not found:\n                        dist[u][v] = 0  # This shouldn't happen as it's a tree\n        for u in comp:\n            for v in comp:\n                if u < v:\n                    d = dist[u][v]\n                    if d % 2 == 0:\n                        total_pairs += 1\n                        has_possible = True\n\n    if has_possible:\n        print(\"1\", total_pairs)\n    else:\n        # All components are either single node or have only one edge (two nodes)\n        if len(components) == 1 and len(components[0]) == 2:\n            # Only two nodes connected by one edge\n            # Need to form a cycle of odd length, which is impossible\n            print(\"-1 0\")\n        else:\n            # Need to form a cycle by connecting all nodes\n            # For a graph of k nodes, forming a cycle requires k edges\n            # But to make it odd, the number of nodes must be >=3\n            # Also, the way to connect them is unique (like a triangle for 3 nodes)\n            if n < 3:\n                print(\"-1 0\")\n            else:\n                # The minimal t is n, but wait, no: for 3 nodes, you need 3 edges\n                # So, it's (number_of_edges_needed_to_form_a_cycle) - existing_edges\n                # Which is (n-1) - m\n                # Wait, but in this case, m=0, so t=n-1?
