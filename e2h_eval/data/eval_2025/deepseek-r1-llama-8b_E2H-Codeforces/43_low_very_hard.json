He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A starts with a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So after this step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C then appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's added must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before C adds the 'c's. Or it could be equal to both.\n\nOur task is to determine for a given string whether it could have been produced through this process.\n\nHmm, so the string must first consist of a bunch of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the structure must be aaaabbbbc ccc... but more precisely, all 'a's come first, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nSo the first thing I need to check is that the string is in the form of all 'a's followed by all 'b's followed by all 'c's. No interleaving allowed.\n\nOnce we've confirmed the structure, we can proceed to check the counts.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check that the string is composed of three consecutive blocks: all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. So, any other order (like 'a', then 'c', then 'b') would be invalid.\n\n2. If the structure is correct, count the number of 'a's (count_a), 'b's (count_b), and 'c's (count_c).\n\n3. Then, check two conditions:\n   a. count_c must be equal to count_a OR count_c must be equal to count_b.\n   b. Also, after appending the 'c's, the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. But wait, because the initial steps already ensure that. So the only condition is on the counts.\n\nWait, no. Because when B appends the 'b's, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So when C appends the 'c's, the count_c can't be zero, but the problem statement says that C appends \"some\" number, which I think means at least one? Or is it possible for C to add zero? Wait, no, because in the note, the third example has 'aabc' which becomes 'aa' followed by 'b', then 'c's. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\nSince both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.\n\nSo, after B's step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nThen, C appends some number of 'c's, which is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before adding 'c's.\n\nBut what if the count of 'a's is zero? Well, no, because the initial step of A ensures that there are some 'a's. So count_a >=1 after A's step, and then B appends 'b's, making count_b >=1.\n\nThus, the string must have count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, the following must hold:\n\n- The string is in the form a^+ b^+ c^+, i.e., all a's first, then b's, then c's.\n\n- count_c == count_a OR count_c == count_b.\n\nAdditionally, count_a and count_b must be at least 1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, after B's step, the string has at least one a and one b. So, in the given string, count_a and count_b must be >=1.\n\nWait, but suppose after B appends, the string has a's and b's. Then C appends c's such that the count of c's is equal to a or b. So in the final string, count_c can be any value as long as it's equal to a or b.\n\nSo, let's think about the steps again.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nA: produces s_a = 'a'^k, where k >=1.\n\nB: appends s_b = 'b'^m, m >=1. So the string is s_a + s_b.\n\nC: appends s_c which is 'c'^n, where n equals the number of a's in s_a+s_b or the number of b's in s_a+s_b. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of appending operations. The string must be structured such that it consists of consecutive blocks of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Structure**: Verify that the string is composed of three consecutive blocks: all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, and ending with all 'c's. Any other order of characters would make the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Additionally, ensure that both 'a's and 'b's are present in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is in the form a+ b+ c+\ndef check_structure(s):\n    parts = []\n    for c in s:\n        if not parts:\n            parts.append(c)\n        else:\n            if parts[-1] != c:\n                return False\n    if len(parts) < 3:\n        return False\n    return True\n\nif not check_structure(s):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\n# Check conditions\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif (count_c == count_a) or (count_c == count_b):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The function `check_structure` ensures that the string starts with 'a's, followed by 'b's, and ends with 'c's without any interleaving or out-of-order characters.\n2. **Character Counting**: We count the occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', 'c') to determine their respective counts.\n3. **Validation**: We check if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's. If both conditions are met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions using simple string operations and counting, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
