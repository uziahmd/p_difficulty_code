Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) in Crazy Town. The town has n infinite line roads, each defined by an equation aix + biy + ci = 0. These roads divide the plane into regions or blocks. My home and the university are in some of these blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to university. Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a border of non-zero length.\n\nHmm, so the key here is to model the blocks as a graph where edges represent the possibility to move between blocks in one step. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between the two points (home and university).\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because the blocks are connected based on their adjacency via road segments. So each time a new road is added, it can split existing regions into more regions, creating new adjacencies.\n\nBut considering that, perhaps each point (home and university) can be classified into which side of each road they are on. Then, two points are in the same block if they are on the same side for every road. Wait, no, that's not exactly right because roads can intersect, creating multiple regions. But maybe for the purposes of determining adjacency, it's enough to know for each road whether a point is on one side or the other.\n\nWait, think differently: For each road, the plane is divided into two half-planes. Points on one side will be in one region, and points on the other side in another. So, two points that are on the same side of all roads are in the same block. But wait, what about when roads cross each other? Because then, the same side condition might still hold for two points, but they could be in different blocks if other roads separate them.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is correct: two points are in the same block if and only if for every road, both points lie on the same side. Because if any road separates them, they are in different blocks. So the minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university points, i.e., the number of roads for which one point is on one side and the other is on the other side.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each such separating road would require crossing it, which would take one step. Because each road contributes to the partitioning, and the minimal steps would correspond to the number of such roads that separate the two points.\n\nWait, let me test this idea with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nHome: (1,1)\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\nn=2\nRoads:\n0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0\n1x + 0y + 0 = 0 → x=0\n\nSo, for each road, check which side the home and university are on.\n\nFor the first road y=0: Home (1,1) is above, University (-1,-1) is below. So they are on opposite sides. So this road contributes 1 to the count.\n\nSecond road x=0: Home is on the right (positive x), University on the left (negative x). Again, opposite sides. So count is 2.\n\nThus, the minimal steps needed are 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: suppose there's a single road. If the two points are on opposite sides, you need 1 step. If on the same side, 0 steps.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each of the n roads, determine whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of roads where they are on opposite sides. That's the minimal number of steps.\n\nWait, that's a straightforward solution. So the problem reduces to, for each road, compute the value of a*x + b*y + c for home and university. Then, see if the signs are the same or different.\n\nBecause the road is a line a*x + b*y + c = 0. For a point (x,y), plugging into the equation gives a value s = a*x + b*y + c. If s is positive, the point is on one side; if negative, on the other. If zero, it's on the line, but the problem states that neither home nor university is on any road.\n\nSo for each road, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If s1 and s2 have the same sign (both positive or both negative), then the points are on the same side for this road. Otherwise, they are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the number of roads where s1 and s2 have opposite signs is the answer.\n\nThat's a much simpler approach than trying to model the entire block structure.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n- Read the home coordinates (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2).\n- Read n roads, each as (a, b, c).\n- For each road, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n- Check if s1 and s2 have the same sign. If not, increment the count.\n- The count is the minimal number of steps.\n\nThis approach is O(n) time, which is efficient even for n=300.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize a counter to 0.\n\nLoop over each of the n roads:\n\n   Read a, b, c.\n\n   Compute s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c.\n\n   Compute s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c.\n\n   If (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0) or (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0), increment counter.\n\nAt the end, print the counter as a string.\n\nWait, but wait—what about the case when a road is something like 0x + 0y + c = 0? Well, the problem statement says that ai and bi are not both zero, so each road is a valid line.\n\nAlso, since neither home nor university is on any road, s1 and s2 can't be zero. So no issues there.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nHome: (1,1)\n\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\n\nn=2\n\nRoads:\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\nCompute s1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1.\n\ns2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1.\n\ns1 and s2 have opposite signs. So count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → x=0.\n\ns1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1.\n\ns2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1. Signs differ. Count becomes 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are on the same side for all roads. Then the answer is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, roads all have home and university on same side. Answer is 0.\n\nWhat if home and university are separated by exactly two roads, but those two roads are redundant? Like, two parallel roads. Would the count be 2?\n\nYes, because each contributes a step.\n\nWait, but if two roads are the same line, but the problem says no two roads are the same. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nWe can proceed as follows:\n\nRead the home coordinates as integers.\n\nRead the university coordinates as integers.\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each of the next n lines:\n\n   Read a, b, c as integers.\n\n   Compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\n   Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\n   If (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0) or (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0):\n\n       count +=1\n\nPrint(count as a string.)\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, handling very large numbers? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem with overflow.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- Both points are on the same side for all roads. Output is 0.\n\n- All roads separate them. Output is n.\n\n- Roads that are vertical, horizontal, diagonal, etc.—the code doesn't care, as it just computes the sign.\n\nAnother edge case: when a road is something like x + y + 1 =0. For a point (2,3), s=5>0. For ( -4,-5), s= -9<0. So they are separated.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle everything correctly.\n\nI think this approach is correct and efficient.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount =0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a,b,c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 +c\n\n    s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 +c\n\n    if (s1 >0 and s2 <0) or (s1 <0 and s2>0):\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input provided, the input was given as a list of strings, but I think in the actual problem, the input is read as standard input, which for programming competition problems is typically read via input() function.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line: x2, y2.\n\nThird line: n.\n\nThen n lines, each with three integers.\n\nSo the code needs to read the inputs correctly.\n\nIn Python, that's straightforward.\n\nSo the code is as I wrote above.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the input is given as ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', ...], but in reality, the code will read the inputs line by line.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving between blocks that share a border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road (line) in Crazy Town divides the plane into two half-planes. Points on one side of the line are in one block, and points on the other side are in another block. Therefore, if two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides of a road, they are in different blocks and require crossing that road.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Reading the coordinates of the home and university.\n2. For each road, checking whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides.\n3. Counting the number of roads where the home and university lie on opposite sides. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0) or (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads.\n2. **Checking Each Road:** For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), we compute the value of the equation for both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Determining Sides:** If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road (i.e., their computed values have opposite signs), we increment the count.\n4. **Result:** The count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps needed to travel from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the required steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines dividing the plane, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n).",
