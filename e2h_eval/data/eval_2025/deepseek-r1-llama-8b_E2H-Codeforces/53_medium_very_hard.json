    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible substring, I need to check if it appears more than once, and find the maximum length among those.\n\nBut wait, how do I approach this efficiently? Because the string can be up to 100 characters long, maybe a brute-force approach is manageable here.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible substring lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1. That way, as soon as I find a length where there's a repeated substring, I can return it as the answer.\n\n2. For each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible), generate all possible substrings of length L.\n\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears more than once in the string.\n\n4. If yes, then return L as the answer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n   - Generate all substrings of length L.\n   - Use a set to track seen substrings.\n   - For each substring, add it to the set. If it's already present, then return L.\n   - If after checking all substrings of length L no duplicates are found, continue to L-1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So let's outline this.\n\nFirst, the string s has length n. We'll loop L from n down to 1.\n\nFor each L:\n\n   create a set called seen.\n\n   for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n       current_sub = s[i:i+L]\n       if current_sub in seen:\n           return L\n       else:\n           add to seen.\n\nIf we go through all i's without finding a duplicate, proceed to L-1.\n\nWait, but what about when L is 1? Like, if all characters are the same, like 'zzz', then the answer is 2 because 'z' appears three times, but the maximum substring appearing at least twice is of length 2: 'zz' occurs twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2). Oh wait, no, in 'zzz', the substrings of length 2 are 'zz' at positions 0-1 and 1-2. So yes, that would be the maximum.\n\nSo in the sample input, 'zzz' gives output 2.\n\nSo in our code, for each L, we generate all possible substrings of that length, and check for duplicates.\n\nNow, considering the code structure.\n\nIn Python, the steps would be:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nSo, as soon as a duplicate is found for a certain L, we print L and stop.\n\nIf no such L is found for L >=1, then the minimum possible is 0? Wait, no. Because the problem says \"non-empty\", so the minimum substring is length 1. But wait, the problem statement says, the string is non-empty, but the substring could be of length 0? Or wait, no. The substring must appear at least twice. So if the string is 'a', then it can't have any substring longer than 1 that appears twice. So the maximum is 0, but according to the sample input, when the string is 'abcd' which is unique, the output is 0. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → Output is 0.\n\nBecause there are no two occurrences of any substring. So for L=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'—no duplicates. For L=2, 'ab','bc','cd'—no duplicates. L=1: 'a','b','c','d'—each appears once. So no duplicates anywhere. Hence, the output is 0.\n\nWait, but the problem says, the output is the length of the substring that appears at least twice. So if no such substring exists, we should output 0.\n\nSo in the code, after checking all L from n down to 1, if none found, output 0.\n\nSo the code should be something like:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but wait. For the case where the entire string is considered. For example, in the second sample input 'ababa', the code would first check L=5. The substring is 'ababa'—only one occurrence. Then L=4: check all substrings of length 4. 'abab' and 'baba'—no duplicates. L=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So when i=0, substr is 'aba'; add to seen. i=1: substr 'bab' added. i=2: substr 'aba' is in seen, so return 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → for L=5, only one substring. L=4: substrings 'aaaa', 'aaaa' → so returns 4.\n\nWait, but let's see: for L=4, in 'aaaaa' the substrings are s[0:4] = 'aaaa' and s[1:5] = 'aaaa'. So they are the same. So the code will detect that on L=4, and return 4.\n\nBut wait, what about when L is larger than 1, but the same substring appears multiple times?\n\nYes, the code correctly handles that.\n\nWhat about the edge cases:\n\nCase 1: 'a' → output 0.\n\nCase 2: 'aa' → output 1.\n\nBecause substrings of length 1: 'a' appears twice.\n\nCase 3: 'aaa' → substrings of length 2: 'aa' appears at positions 0-1 and 1-2. So when L=2, it's detected.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is about efficiency. Since the maximum string length is 100, even for L=50, the number of substrings is 51 (since 100-50+1=51). For each L, the code checks O(n) substrings, each of length up to n. So the time complexity is O(n^3), which for n=100 is 1e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting another example:\n\nInput: 'abcab'\n\nPossible substrings:\n\nCheck L=5: only one substring.\n\nL=4: 'abca', 'bcab'—no duplicates.\n\nL=3: 'abc', 'cab', 'aba', 'bab'.\n\nWait, no. Let's compute all substrings of L=3:\n\ni=0: 'abc'\n\ni=1: 'bca'\n\ni=2: 'cab'\n\ni=3: 'aba' (from position 3: s[3], s[4], s[5]? Wait, no, indices are 0-based. So for L=3, the last possible i is len(s)-L = 5-3=2. Wait, len(s) is 5, so 5-3+1=3 i's: 0,1,2.\n\nWait, s = 'abcab' → indexes 0:a,1:b,2:c,3:a,4:b.\n\nSo substrings of L=3:\n\ni=0: a b c → 'abc'\n\ni=1: b c a → 'bca'\n\ni=2: c a b → 'cab'\n\nSo no duplicates. Then L=2:\n\nSubstrings:\n\ni=0: 'ab'\n\ni=1: 'bc'\n\ni=2: 'ca'\n\ni=3: 'ab'\n\nSo when i=0: 'ab' added.\n\ni=3: 'ab' is in seen. So return 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo now, the code:\n\nRead the string.\n\nLoop L from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   create a set.\n\n   for each starting index i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in set: return L.\n\n       else add to set.\n\nIf no L found, return 0.\n\nThat's the code.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the outputs are given as a list. Oh, but the problem says to output one number. So perhaps the sample was written with [ ] brackets for clarity, but the actual input is a single string, and the output is a single integer.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\nWait, but the output is supposed to be a single number per test case. So perhaps the way it's presented is just for explanation.\n\nIn the first case, 'abcd' → no repeated substrings except single characters, but since all are unique, the output is 0.\n\nSecond case: 'ababa' → output 3.\n\nThird case: 'zzz' → output 2.\n\nWhich the code correctly handles.\n\nAnother test case: 'abab' → L=4: 'abab' is the only substring. L=3: 'aba' and 'bab' → no. L=2: 'ab' and 'ba' and 'ab' again. So when i=0: 'ab' added. i=2: 'ab' is in seen → return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abacaba' → the entire string is 'abacaba', which is 7 letters.\n\nCheck L=7: only one substring.\n\nL=6: substrings are 'abacab' and 'bacaba' → no.\n\nL=5: substrings are 'abaca', 'bacab', 'acaba' → no.\n\nL=4: 'abac', 'bacab' no. Wait, 'abac' at i=0, 'baca' at i=1, 'acab' at i=2, 'caba' at i=3.\n\nNo duplicates.\n\nL=3: many possibilities. For example, 'aba' appears at i=0 and i=4.\n\nSo when L=3, the code will find 'aba' again, so return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nI think that's all. So the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking all possible substrings of the given string starting from the longest possible length down to 1. For each length, we generate all substrings and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return the length of that substring as the result. If no such substring is found for any length, we return 0.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the length of the string and decrement down to 1.\n2. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n3. **Track Seen Substrings**: Use a set to keep track of substrings we have seen. If a substring is already in the set, it means we have seen it before, and we return the current length.\n4. **Return Result**: If no duplicate substring is found for any length, return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeated substring by leveraging a set for quick lookups, making the solution both effective and efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the length of the string down to 1 to check for the longest possible repeated substring.\n- **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and check if they have been seen before using a set.\n- **Check for Duplicates**: If a substring is found in the set, print the current length and exit. If no duplicates are found after all lengths are checked, print 0.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the solution by leveraging the properties of sets for quick membership testing, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
