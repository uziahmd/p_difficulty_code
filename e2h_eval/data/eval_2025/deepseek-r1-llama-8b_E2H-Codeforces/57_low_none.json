His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasya's Olympiad results. The teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points in total from both tours. But the results are given for each participant in two separate lists—first tour points and second tour points. But they're not linked, meaning we don't know which participant is which.\n\nOur task is to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten based on these results. The best place is when he's ranked as high as possible, and the worst is as low as possible.\n\nHmm. So, how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the steps needed.\n\nFirst, we need to consider all possible pairs of a_i and b_j where i and j can be any indices, but each participant can only have one a and one b. Wait, no—because the way the input is given, each participant's a and b are part of the same list. Oh wait, no: the problem says that the a's and b's are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their a and b are somewhere in the two lists, but we don't know which a corresponds to which b.\n\nSo to model this correctly, perhaps we can think that for each possible pair (a, b), that's a possible participant. But since each a and b must be used exactly once across all participants, it's more like pairing them in such a way that each a is matched with a unique b, and all n pairs form the participants.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each participant participated in both tours. So for each participant, there's an a and a b, and all a's and b's are used exactly once each.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n is the number of participants, and each participant has an a and a b. So the a's and b's are each of length n. So for all i, a_i is the first tour score of participant i, and b_i is the second tour score.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the second line is the a's, which are in arbitrary order. Similarly for the third line, the b's are in arbitrary order.\n\nAh, so each participant's a and b are some elements from the a list and b list, but we don't know which a corresponds to which b. So when combining, we need to pair each a with a b, but all a's and b's must be used exactly once.\n\nSo the problem is similar to rearranging the a's and b's into pairs, such that for each participant, their sum is a_i + b_j, where each a and each b is used exactly once.\n\nSo our goal is to find the best and worst possible rankings of Vasya based on his a + b sum, given that the sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but Vasya is one of the participants. So when considering all possible pairings, Vasya's a and b are fixed in one of the pairings, and the other participants' a and b are paired accordingly.\n\nWait, no. Because the a and b lists are given in arbitrary order. So in the problem, the a's and b's are just two separate lists, but each list contains all the first-tour and second-tour points respectively. So for each participant, their a is in the a list, and their b is in the b list. But the order is arbitrary.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Each participant has one a and one b. So the a list is the first tour scores of all participants, and the b list is the second tour scores. So each participant has a specific a and b. But the a and b lists are in arbitrary order. So for example, the first a in the a list may correspond to the second b in the b list.\n\nSo when we have to compute the sum for each participant, we have to pair each a with a b such that every a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all possible permutations of the b list where each permutation is a pairing with the a list, and then for each possible pairing, compute the sum for each participant, sort them, and see what rank Vasya would have in that scenario.\n\nBut since n is up to 105, trying all possible permutations isn't feasible because 105! is way too big.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem allows us to model this differently. Maybe instead of considering all possible pairings, we can find the minimal and maximal possible ranks for Vasya's sum s, given that s >= x.\n\nSo how can we compute the best possible rank for Vasya? Well, the best case is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and as many others as possible have lower sums.\n\nSimilarly, the worst case is when Vasya's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given in arbitrary order, and each participant's total score is the sum of their scores from both tours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: Each participant has a score from the first tour and a score from the second tour. The scores are given in arbitrary order, so we need to consider all possible pairings of these scores to determine Vasya's rank.\n2. **Constraints**: The number of participants `n` can be up to 105, making brute force approaches infeasible due to the factorial complexity of permutations.\n3. **Optimal Strategy**:\n   - **Best Rank**: To find the best possible rank, assume that Vasya's total score is as high as possible, and arrange other participants' scores such that their sums are as low as possible.\n   - **Worst Rank**: Conversely, for the worst rank, assume that Vasya's total score is just enough to meet the minimum requirement, and arrange other participants' scores to maximize their sums relative to Vasya's.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of generating all permutations, we can sort the scores and use combinatorial logic to compute the best and worst ranks directly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Find all possible s where s >= x\n    # Vasya's possible scores are a[i] + b[j], but he must be one of the pairs.\n    # So for each possible i, j where a[i]+b[j] >=x, compute the minimal and maximal ranks.\n    \n    # Precompute all possible (a_i + b_j) and track which ones are >=x\n    possible_sums = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            s = a[i] + b[j]\n            if s >= x:\n                possible_sums.append(s)\n    \n    # Now, for each possible sum s (where s >=x), compute how many participants can have sum <= s and others >= s.\n    # But since we need to find the minimal and maximal possible ranks, we have to model the best and worst case scenarios.\n    \n    # Best rank: find the maximum possible s where s is as large as possible, then count how many participants can have sum <= s.\n    # To get the best rank, make sure as few people as possible have sum >= s.\n    # So choose the largest possible s, then count how many others have sum <= s.\n    # But wait, perhaps choosing a slightly lower s allows more others to have higher sums.\n    # Alternatively, perhaps the best rank is when Vasya's sum is maximum possible, and others are arranged to have as few as possible higher sums.\n    \n    # Let's try to find the maximum possible s that can be achieved by any participant.\n    max_total = max(a) + max(b)\n    # Then, to compute the best rank, assume that Vasya has max_total, and others are arranged such that their sums are as low as possible.\n    # Wait, no. Because in reality, the other participants' sums are determined by how the a and b are paired.\n    # So perhaps another approach is needed.\n    \n    # Alternative approach: To find the minimal possible rank, we can think about what is the minimal number of participants who could have a higher sum than Vasya's sum.\n    # Similarly, for the maximal rank, it's the maximal number of participants with higher or equal sums.\n    \n    # To compute this, we can sort the a and b arrays and find the best and worst possible pairings.\n    \n    a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Best case: Pair the largest a with largest b, next largest a with next largest b, etc.\n    best_participants = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        best_participants.append(a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[i])\n    # In this pairing, the first participant has the highest sum, and so on.\n    # So Vasya's sum needs to be at least x, and to find the best rank, we can find the position where his sum fits into this sorted list.\n    \n    # Similarly, for the worst case, we can pair the largest a with smallest b, etc., to minimize Vasya's rank.\n    \n    # Compute for best rank:\n    # We need to find the minimal number of participants with sum > Vasya's sum.\n    # To maximize Vasya's rank, we need to minimize the number of participants with higher sums.\n    \n    # Let's try all possible Vasya's sum s where s >=x, and for each s, compute the minimal and maximal possible ranks.\n    \n    # However, considering all possible s is O(n^2), which is acceptable for n=105.\n    \n    # So let's generate all possible s that can be achieved by any a[i] + b[j], and for each s >=x, compute:\n    # - The number of participants that can have sum > s, assuming that all others have as low as possible sums.\n    # For best rank: we want to minimize the number of participants with sum > s.\n    # So to find the best possible rank, we need to find the minimal number of participants that can have sum > s, for s >=x.\n    \n    # Similarly, for the worst rank, find the maximal number of participants that can have sum > s, for s >=x.\n    \n    # So let's precompute all possible s and for each s >=x, compute the minimal and maximal possible ranks.\n    \n    # Precompute all possible s:\n    possible_s = set()\n    for ai in a:\n        for bj in b:\n            possible_s.add(ai + bj)\n    possible_s = sorted(possible_s)\n    \n    # Now, for each s in possible_s where s >=x, compute:\n    \n    # Best rank: minimal possible number of participants with sum > s.\n    # To minimize the count, we need to pair the remaining a and b such that as few as possible have sum > s.\n    # How?\n    # Sort a and b in non-decreasing order.\n    a_sorted_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted_asc = sorted(b)\n    \n    # For best rank:\n    # We can pair the smallest a's with the largest possible b's that don't make the sum exceed s.\n    # Or perhaps the opposite.\n    # Wait, perhaps the best way to minimize the number of participants with sum > s is to pair the largest a's with the smallest possible b's.\n    # Hmm, not sure.
