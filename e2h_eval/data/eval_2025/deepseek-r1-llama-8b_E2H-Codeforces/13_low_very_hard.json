For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given triad (a set of three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The definition of major and minor chords is based on the distances between the notes in a certain order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. These are arranged cyclically, meaning after H comes C again. The distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. So, each step from one note to the next adds a semitone.\n\nA major triad has three notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and from Y to Z is 3. So overall, X to Z is 7 semitones. A minor triad has X-Y as 3 semitones and Y-Z as 4, making X-Z 7 as well.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the triad is an unordered set, so we can arrange the notes in any order to check for major or minor. We need to check all possible orderings to see if any of them satisfy the conditions for major or minor.\n\nSo the steps I need to follow are:\n\n1. Read the three input notes.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes to consider every possible ordering.\n3. For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes.\n4. Check if any permutation forms a major or minor chord.\n5. Based on which condition is satisfied (if any), classify the chord.\n6. If neither condition is met, classify it as strange.\n\nBut how do I represent the notes? Maybe assign each note a numerical value representing its position in the scale. That way, calculating the distance becomes straightforward using modulo arithmetic.\n\nLet me think about the order of the notes. Let's list them in order:\n\nIndices:\n0: C\n1: C#\n2: D\n3: D#\n4: E\n5: F\n6: F#\n7: G\n8: G#\n9: A\n10: B\n11: H\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the problem statement says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, no, in the problem statement it's written as \"C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\" So after B comes H, then C again.\n\nWait, wait, let's count:\n\n- C is 0\n- C# is 1\n- D is 2\n- D# is 3\n- E is 4\n- F is 5\n- F# is 6\n- G is 7\n- G# is 8\n- A is 9\n- B is 10\n- H is 11\n\nYes, that's correct. So each note can be assigned an index from 0 to 11.\n\nSo, the first thing I'll do is create a dictionary mapping each note to its index. Like:\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nWait, but wait—what about case sensitivity? The problem says the input is in the given notation, which seems to use uppercase letters. So assuming the input is given correctly, we can proceed.\n\nOnce the notes are mapped to their indices, we can compute the distances.\n\nBut the distance between two notes X and Y is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but wait—since the scale is cyclic, right? Because after H comes C.\n\nWait, the distance from X to Y is the number of semitones going up from X to Y. So for example, C to E is 4 semitones because C (0) to C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4): four steps.\n\nSimilarly, E to C would be a larger distance. How?\n\nE is 4, C is 0. So the distance from E to C is (0 -4 +12) %12 = 8 semitones. But the problem says that the distance is always from the lower to the higher note. Wait, no: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one.\" So for any two notes, the distance is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The classification is based on the distances between the notes when ordered in a specific way.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is assigned a numerical index based on its position in the musical scale. This allows us to calculate distances using modular arithmetic.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since the order of notes matters for determining major or minor triads, we generate all possible permutations of the three notes.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes. The distances are calculated as the difference modulo 12, considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Check Conditions**: For each permutation, check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad. A major triad requires distances of 4 and 3 semitones, while a minor triad requires distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n5. **Classify the Triad**: Based on the checks, classify the triad as major, minor, or strange if neither condition is met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef get_distances(notes):\n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n    return [ (indices[i+1] - indices[i]) % 12 for i in range(2)]\n\ndef is_major(triad):\n    distances = get_distances(triad)\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(triad):\n        d1, d2 = distances[0], distances[1]\n        if (d1 == 4 and d2 == 3) or (d2 == 4 and d1 == 3):\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_minor(triad):\n    distances = get_distances(triad)\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(triad):\n        d1, d2 = distances[0], distances[1]\n        if (d1 == 3 and d2 == 4) or (d2 == 3 and d1 == 4):\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Read input\ninput_notes = input().split()\ntriad = input_notes\n\n# Check conditions\nif is_major(triad):\n    print(\"major\")\nelif is_minor(triad):\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: Each note is converted into an index from 0 to 11, which simplifies distance calculations.\n2. **Permutations**: By generating all permutations of the notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is considered.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Using modular arithmetic, we compute the distances between consecutive notes, wrapping around the scale as needed.\n4. **Condition Checking**: For each permutation, we check if the distances match the criteria for major or minor chords. If any permutation satisfies the conditions, we classify the chord accordingly.\n5. **Output**: Based on the checks, the result is printed as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all possible cases and ensures accurate classification of the given triad.",
