He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's. Then C appends some 'c's equal to the count of 'a's or 'b's. Also, the order must be strictly a's first, then b's, then c's. So the string must be in the form aaa...bbb...ccc... without any other characters in between.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the conditions the string must satisfy:\n\n1. The string should consist of three non-empty parts: all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So the string should not have any a after a b, or any b after a c.\n\n2. The counts of a's, b's, and c's must satisfy certain conditions:\n   - The count of c's (let's call it c_count) must be equal to either a_count or b_count, or both.\n   - Additionally, the string must have at least one a and one b before C adds the c's. Because when C appends, the string already has at least one a and one b.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that after A and B, the string has at least one a and one b. So when C appends, the number of c's can be equal to the a's or b's at that point.\n\nBut for the string to be valid, the c's must come after all the a's and b's. So the string structure is a^+ b^+ c^+.\n\nSo, step by step, how do I check this?\n\nFirst, I can split the string into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's. If any part is missing, then it's invalid.\n\nFor example, if the string starts with a 'b', it's invalid because A gives only a's. Similarly, if it has a 'c' before any 'b's, that's invalid because B appends after A.\n\nSo the first check is to see that the string is composed of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's, with each section being non-empty.\n\nHow to check this? One approach is to iterate through the string and ensure that once we move past a character type, we don't go back. For instance:\n\n- All the characters before the first 'b' must be 'a's.\n- All the characters between the first 'b' and the first 'c' must be 'b's.\n- All the characters after the first 'c' must be 'c's.\n\nAlternatively, the string can be checked by finding the positions where the transitions from a->b and b->c happen. These transitions must occur only once and in the correct order.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the indices where the string changes from 'a' to 'b' and from 'b' to 'c'. If these transitions don't occur exactly once, the string is invalid.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nWe can loop through the string and track the current allowed characters. Once a transition occurs, the allowed characters change and cannot revert.\n\nAnother approach is to split the string into runs of same characters. For example, 'aaabbbcc' would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'], each run having lengths 3,3,2.\n\nIf there are more than three runs, it's invalid. If there are exactly three runs, they must be in the order a, b, c, and each run must be non-empty.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Check that the string consists of exactly three runs, each run is a single character, and the order is a, then b, then c.\n\n   How to split into runs:\n\n   - Iterate through the string, keep track of the current character and the start index of the current run.\n\n   - When the current character changes, record the run. If the next character is not the next expected (like a after b), it's invalid.\n\n   Alternatively, let's create a list of tuples, each tuple is (char, count). So for 'aaabbbcc', it's [('a',3), ('b',3), ('c',2)].\n\n   Then, check if this list has exactly three elements, and their chars are in the order 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n   If it's less than three, like two runs, then it's invalid (no c's, but wait, in the problem statement, after C appends, the string must have c's. So the entire string must have all three parts.)\n\n   Wait, the problem says that the string will consist of some a's, then some b's, then some c's. So the string must have all three.\n\n   So, if the string doesn't have all three runs, it's invalid.\n\n2. Once the runs are confirmed as a, then b, then c, each non-empty, proceed to check the counts.\n\n   Let a_count = length of first run.\n\n   b_count = length of second run.\n\n   c_count = length of third run.\n\n   Now, check whether c_count is equal to a_count or b_count, or both.\n\n   Because C appends c's equal to the number of a's or b's in the string before adding c's. So the c_count must be equal to either a_count or b_count.\n\n   So, condition: c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count.\n\n   But wait, what about cases where a_count equals b_count and c_count equals both? That's allowed.\n\n   So, the condition is satisfied as long as c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\n   Also, since A and B have added at least one a and one b, a_count >=1, b_count >=1, c_count >=1.\n\n   So, for example:\n\n   Example 1: 'aaabccc' → a=3, b=0? Wait wait, no.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input says 'aaabccc' which is a run of 3 a's, then 0 b's? No, wait, the string is 'aaa' followed by 'bccc'? Or is the string 'aaa' followed by 'b' and then 'ccc'?\n\nWait, 'aaabccc' is 'aaa' (3 a's) followed by 'b' (1 b) followed by 'ccc' (3 c's). So a_count=3, b_count=1, c_count=3.\n\nSo c_count is equal to a_count (3), so it's valid.\n\nAnother example: 'aabc' → a=2, b=1, c=1. So c_count is 1, which equals b_count (1). So it's valid.\n\nThird example: 'bbacc' → the runs are 'b', 'a', 'c', which is invalid because the runs are not in a->b->c order. So it's rejected.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe string must:\n\n- Have exactly three runs, each consisting of a's, then b's, then c's.\n\n- Each run must be non-empty.\n\n- The count of c's must be equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nAdditionally, during the run checks, the first run must be a's, the second b's, the third c's.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, I can process the string into runs.\n\nI can write a helper function to get the runs.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nCheck if the first character is 'a'; if not, return NO.\n\nThen, iterate through the string, tracking the current run's character.\n\nEach time the current character changes, add a new run.\n\nAfter processing the entire string, check:\n\n- The runs list has exactly three elements.\n\n- The first run is 'a', second is 'b', third is 'c'.\n\nIf any of these are not met, output NO.\n\nElse, check if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nIf yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but what about when the string has all three runs but the c_count is not equal to a_count or b_count?\n\nLike 'aabbbc' → a=2, b=3, c=1. So c_count is 1, which is neither 2 nor 3. So it's invalid.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Split S into runs.\n\n- Check if the runs are in order a, b, c, with each run non-empty.\n\n- Compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\n- Check if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nIf all conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase 1: minimal string.\n\nThe minimal string is 'abbc' → a=1, b=2, c=1.\n\nHere, c_count is 1, which is equal to a_count (1). So it's valid.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → a=2, b=2, c=2. c_count is 2, which equals a_count and b_count.\n\nValid.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbc' → a=3, b=3, c=1. So c_count is 1, which is not equal to a or b. Invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → a=1, b=3, c=1. Valid.\n\nWhat about a string with more than three runs? Like 'aabbaaccc'? It has a, then b, then a, then c. So runs are ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c']. Since the runs are not a, b, c in order, it's invalid.\n\nWhat about a string that is 'aabbbcc' → a=2, b=3, c=2. c_count is 2, which is equal to a_count. So valid.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → the runs are a, b. Only two runs. So invalid.\n\nWhat about 'abc' → runs are a, b, c. a_count=1, b_count=1, c_count=1. c_count equals both a and b. So valid.\n\nWhat about 'acb'? The runs are a, c, b. So the order is wrong. Invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → a=3, b=3, c=3. c_count is 3, which equals a and b. So valid.\n\nWhat about a string that has only a's? Like 'aaaaa'? No, because B appends b's, making the string have at least one a and one b.\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. Then C appends, so the final string has c's. So the final string must have a's, b's, and c's.\n\nThus, any string that doesn't have all three runs is invalid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead S.\n\nCheck if S is empty → invalid.\n\nCheck if S[0] is 'a' → else, invalid.\n\nCompute runs.\n\nIf len(runs) !=3 → invalid.\n\nElse, check the sequence is a, b, c.\n\nIf not, invalid.\n\nElse, compute a, b, c counts.\n\nCheck if c == a or c == b.\n\nIf yes, output YES.\n\nElse, NO.\n\nNow, implementing the runs.\n\nHow to compute runs:\n\nInitialize runs as empty list.\n\ncurrent_char = S[0]\n\ncurrent_count = 1\n\nfor i from 1 to len(S)-1:\n\n    if S[i] == current_char:\n\n        current_count +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        add (current_char, current_count) to runs.\n\n        current_char = S[i]\n\n        current_count =1\n\nAdd the last run.\n\nWait, yes, but for S='a', runs would be [('a',1)].\n\nSo, after the loop, we need to add the last run.\n\nBut in our case, since len(runs) must be 3, the initial runs would be built correctly.\n\nOnce runs are built, check:\n\nruns[0][0] == 'a' ?\n\nruns[1][0] == 'b' ?\n\nruns[2][0] == 'c' ?\n\nAnd all three runs must be present.\n\nAlso, a_count = runs[0][1], etc.\n\nSo, now, code-wise.\n\nImplementing this.\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\n- S starts with 'a', then switches to 'b', then 'c', but the c count is not a or b.\n\nLike 'aabbcc' → a=2, b=2, c=2. So c_count is 2, which is equal to a and b. So valid.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbbc' → a=2, b=3, c=1. c_count is 1, which isn't 2 or 3. So invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → a=3, b=3, c=3. Valid.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → len(runs)=2. So invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abcde' → but the problem says the string consists only of a, b, c. So no such case.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaacc' → runs are a, b, a, c. So invalid.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nRuns: a(3), b(1), c(3). So a=3, b=1, c=3.\n\nc_count is 3, which is equal to a_count. So valid → YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc'\n\nFirst character is 'b' → invalid. So output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc'\n\nWait, the string is 'aabc' → 'aa' (a=2), 'b' (b=1), 'c' (c=1). So runs are a, b, c.\n\nc_count is 1, which equals b_count (1). So valid → YES.\n\nSo the sample outputs match.\n\nNow, another test case: 'abba' → runs are a, b, a. So len(runs)=3 but the third run is a, which is invalid. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabba' → runs are a, b, a. So invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → a=1, b=3, c=1 → c_count is 1 which equals a. So YES.\n\nWhat about 'a' → len(runs)=1 → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → len(runs)=2 → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → a=1, b=1, c=1 → c_count is 1, which equals a and b. So YES.\n\nAnother case: 'acb' → runs are a, c, b → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abba' → as before.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe code structure:\n\nRead S.\n\nCheck if S is empty → probably not, since 1<=|S|.\n\nCheck if the first character is not 'a' → invalid.\n\nCompute the runs.\n\nIf runs is not of length 3 → invalid.\n\nCheck the runs are a, then b, then c.\n\nIf not, invalid.\n\nElse, compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\nCheck if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nImplementing the runs:\n\nIn Python, code:\n\ndef get_runs(s):\n\n    if not s:\n\n        return []\n\n    runs = []\n\n    current_char = s[0]\n\n    count = 1\n\n    for c in s[1:]:\n\n        if c == current_char:\n\n            count +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n\n            current_char = c\n\n            count = 1\n\n    runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n\n    return runs\n\nSo, for 'aaabccc', this returns [('a',3), ('b',1), ('c',3)].\n\nNow, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif not s:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    exit()\n\n# Check first character is 'a'\n\nif s[0] != 'a':\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    exit()\n\nruns = get_runs(s)\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    exit()\n\nexpected_chars = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\nfor i in range(3):\n\n    if runs[i][0] != expected_chars[i]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\na_count = runs[0][1]\n\nb_count = runs[1][1]\n\nc_count = runs[2][1]\n\nif c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's the code.\n\nWait, but what about the case where a_count is zero or b_count is zero? According to the problem statement, after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. So a_count >=1, b_count >=1.\n\nBut in our code, since the first run is a, a_count is runs[0][1] which is >=1.\n\nSimilarly for b_count, since the second run is b, which is >=1.\n\nSo, in the code, we don't need to check for a_count >=1 or b_count >=1, because the runs are correctly structured.\n\nWait, but what about when the second run is empty? Like 'aaaabbbccc' → runs are [a, b, c]. But wait, no. Because in the code, each run is non-zero.\n\nWait, in the code, each run is built by the get_runs function, which requires that the string is non-empty, and each run has at least one character.\n\nBecause the get_runs function appends each run only when the current character changes, and for the last character, it adds the run.\n\nSo for example, 'a' → runs = [('a',1)].\n\nSo in the code, the runs will always have non-zero counts.\n\nThus, in the code, a_count, b_count, c_count are at least 1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → runs are [('a',3), ('b',1), ('c',3)]. a=3, b=1, c=3. c_count is 3 which equals a_count. So output YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → first character is 'b' → code prints NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → runs are [('a',2), ('b',1), ('c',1)]. c_count is 1, which equals b_count. So output YES.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → runs are [('a',1), ('b',1)]. len(runs)=2 → code exits with NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → runs are [('a',2), ('b',2), ('a',2), ('c',2)]. len(runs) is 4 → code exits with NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'a' → runs has length 1 → code exits with NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → runs are [a, b, c]. a=1, b=1, c=1. c_count=1 which equals a and b. Output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabbbccc' → a=3, b=3, c=3. c_count=3 equals a and b. Output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbbc' → a=2, b=3, c=1. c_count=1 !=2 or 3. So output NO.\n\nI think this covers the cases.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific process involving three steps: appending 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's in a way that the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Initial Character**: The string must start with 'a'. If it does not, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Identify Runs**: Convert the string into runs of consecutive identical characters. For example, 'aaabbbcc' would be split into runs [('a', 3), ('b', 3), ('c', 2)].\n3. **Validate Runs Structure**: Ensure there are exactly three runs, each consisting of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's.\n4. **Count Validation**: Verify that the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef get_runs(s):\n    if not s:\n        return []\n    runs = []\n    current_char = s[0]\n    count = 1\n    for c in s[1:]:\n        if c == current_char:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            runs.append((current_char, count))\n            current_char = c\n            count = 1\n    runs.append((current_char, count))\n    return runs\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif not s:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif s[0] != 'a':\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nruns = get_runs(s)\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nexpected_chars = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nfor i in range(3):\n    if runs[i][0] != expected_chars[i]:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\na_count = runs[0][1]\nb_count = runs[1][1]\nc_count = runs[2][1]\n\nif c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The string must start with 'a' because A appends only 'a's first.\n2. **Runs Conversion**: The function `get_runs` processes the string into segments of consecutive characters, which helps in checking the order and structure.\n3. **Run Structure Validation**: Ensures the string has exactly three runs in the order 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n4. **Count Check**: Confirms that the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's, ensuring the final step of appending 'c's is valid as per the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the string meets the problem's requirements.",
