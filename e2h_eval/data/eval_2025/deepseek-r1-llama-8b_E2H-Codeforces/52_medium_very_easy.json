Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. Hmm. So the idea is that Vasily has some initial number of candles, 'a'. Each candle burns for exactly one hour and then goes out. But here's the twist: he can take 'b' of these burned-out candles and make a new one. So each time he collects enough gone candles, he can create more to burn.\n\nMy task is to calculate the total hours he can keep the room lit by using these candles optimally.\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. For input 4 2, the output is 7. How does that work?\n\nSo initially, he has 4 candles. He burns all 4, which gives him 4 hours. Then, those 4 can be turned into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He burns those 2, adding 2 hours, making the total 6. Now he has 2 burned candles again. He can make another 1 new candle (since 2/2=1), burn it for an hour, bringing the total to 7. Now he has 1 candle left, but since 1 is less than b (which is 2), he can't make any more. So total 7 hours.\n\nAnother example is 6 3. Output is 8. Let's see: 6 candles give 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new ones, burning them gives 2 hours (total 8). Then, he has 2 candles, which is less than 3, so no more. So yeah, 8.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours and the number of leftover burned candles after each step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of candles, 'a'.\n2. Burn all of them, add 'a' hours to the total.\n3. Collect 'a' burned candles.\n4. While the collected burned candles are >= b:\n   a. Make as many new candles as possible (divided by b).\n   b. Add the number of new candles to the total hours.\n   c. The leftover is the remainder when dividing by b. This becomes the new collection of burned candles.\n5. Repeat until the leftovers are less than b.\n\nWait, no. Because when you make new candles from the burned ones, you also get their leftovers. Wait, no—when you make a new candle, it's from 'b' burned ones, right? So for every group of 'b' in the current count, you can make one new candle. After that, you add that new candle to the total, and its burned remains contribute to the next batch.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nEach time, the number of new candles is current / b. The new_candles variable is added to the total. Then, the new_candles are burned, adding their count to the leftovers.\n\nBut wait, no: the process is that whenever you have enough burned candles, you exchange them for new ones. So the process is:\n\n- Total = a\n- leftovers = a\n- while leftovers >= b:\n    new_candles = leftovers // b\n    total += new_candles\n    leftovers = new_candles + (leftovers % b)\nBecause the new_candles are burned, adding to the leftovers.\n\nWait, no. Because when you make new_candles, each contributes one burned candle. So yes, after exchanging, you have new_candles added as the new burned ones.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total = a\n\ncurrent_left = a\n\nwhile current_left >= b:\n\n    new_candles = current_left // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    current_left = new_candles + (current_left % b)\n\nOnce the loop ends, return the total.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first example: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total=4, current_left=4.\n\nLoop: 4 >=2.\n\nnew_candles=2. total becomes 6. current_left=2 +0=2.\n\nAgain, 2>=2.\n\nnew_candles=1. total=7. current_left=1+0=1.\n\nNow loop ends. So correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, current_left=6.\n\n6 >=3:\n\nnew_candles=2. total=8. current_left=2+0=2.\n\n2 <3. Loop ends. So correct.\n\nWhat about another case, say a=5, b=5.\n\nTotal=5. current_left=5.\n\n5 >=5: new_candles=1. total=6. current_left=1+0=1. Loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother test: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial total=10. current_left=10.\n\n10//3=3. So new_candles=3. total=13. current_left=3 +1=4.\n\n4 >=3: new_candles=1. total=14. current_left=1+1=2.\n\n2<3: done. So total is 14.\n\nYes, because 10 +3 +1=14.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead a and b from input. Since the input is given as a single line with two integers, we can split the input line into a and b.\n\nCompute the total as per the above steps.\n\nHandle cases where a is zero? No, because the constraints say a >=1.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute as follows:\n\ntotal = a\n\ncurrent_left = a\n\nwhile current_left >= b:\n\n    new_c = current_left // b\n\n    total += new_c\n\n    current_left = new_c + (current_left % b)\n\nPrint total.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFor 4 2:\n\nLoop:\n\ncurrent_left=4 >=2.\n\nnew_c=2, total=6.\n\ncurrent_left=2+0=2.\n\nLoop again.\n\nnew_c=1, total=7.\n\ncurrent_left=1+0=1. Exit.\n\nOutput 7.\n\nFor 6 3:\n\ncurrent_left=6 >=3.\n\nnew_c=2, total=8.\n\ncurrent_left=2+0=2. Exit.\n\nOutput 8.\n\nLooks good.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, write the Python code.\n\nWe need to read from stdin, compute, and print.\n\nIn Python, the input can be read via input().split().\n\nSo:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as per the algorithm.\n\nFinally, print(total).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent_left = a\nwhile current_left >= b:\n    new_c = current_left // b\n    total += new_c\n    current_left = new_c + (current_left % b)\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nLet me test with a=0, but according to constraints, a is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=5.\n\nInitial total=7.\n\ncurrent_left=7.\n\n7//5=1, new_c=1. total=8. current_left=1 +2=3.\n\n3<5. Done. So total is 8.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: a=8, b=5.\n\nFirst, 8//5=1, total=9. current_left=1+3=4.\n\n4<5. Done. So 9.\n\nWait, but 8+1=9.\n\nWait, another way: 8 -> burn 8, make 1 from 5, burn 1, total 9. Then 1+3=4, can't make more.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nI think this should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for exactly one hour, and after burning out, it can be reused to make new candles by combining a certain number of burned-out candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Burn Candles**: After burning all initial candles, collect the burned-out candles.\n3. **Recycle Burned Candles**: Use the collected burned-out candles to create new ones. For every `b` burned-out candles, we can make one new candle. This process continues until we have fewer than `b` burned-out candles left.\n4. **Track Total Hours**: Keep a running total of the hours the room is illuminated, including the hours from the initial burn and the subsequent recycled candles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent_left = a\nwhile current_left >= b:\n    new_c = current_left // b\n    total += new_c\n    current_left = new_c + (current_left % b)\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of burned-out candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles, `a`, burns for `a` hours.\n3. **Recycling Process**: While there are enough burned-out candles (`current_left`) to make new ones, calculate how many new candles can be made. Add these new candles to the total hours and update the count of burned-out candles, including both the newly made ones and any leftovers from the previous recycling step.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the number of burned-out candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iterating and reusing the burned-out candles optimally, ensuring that each step contributes to extending the illumination time as much as possible.",
