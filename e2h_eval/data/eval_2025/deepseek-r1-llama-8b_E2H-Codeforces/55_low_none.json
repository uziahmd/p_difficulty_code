    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing certain swap operations. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', or '1' and '2'. So, for example, you can swap '01' to get '10', but you can't swap '02' or '20' directly because those are not adjacent in the allowed swaps.\n\nHmm. So the goal is to rearrange the string as much as possible using these swaps to make the lex smallest string.\n\nLet me think about what's possible here. Since the allowed swaps only allow moving '0's past '1's and '2's past '1's, but '0's cannot move past '2's directly. Wait, no, wait: the allowed swaps are '0' and '1' can be swapped, and '1' and '2' can be swapped. So, '0's can move relative to '1's, and '2's can move relative to '1's, but '0's and '2's can't swap directly. But perhaps through a '1' acting as an intermediary.\n\nWait, let me see: if I have a '0' followed by a '1', then by swapping them, I can move the '0' to the right of the '1'. Similarly, a '2' can be moved to the left by swapping with a '1'.\n\nSo, for example, if I have a '0' followed by a '2', can I get them to swap positions? Like, '02' → can't swap. But maybe via a '1' somewhere else. Let me see:\n\nConsider the string \"021\". To get '20', I would need to swap '0' and '2' somehow. But since they're not adjacent and the allowed swaps don't include '0' and '2', I don't think that's possible. So in this case, the '0' comes before '2' and can't be moved after without a '1' involved.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the allowed swaps are any two adjacent '0' and '1' or adjacent '1' and '2'. So, in the string \"021\", the '0' and '2' are adjacent, but they can't be swapped. So the order remains as is.\n\nSo, the key observation here is that '0's can only be moved past '1's, and '2's can only be moved past '1's. But '0's and '2's can't pass each other unless there's a '1' in between, which allows their relative ordering to change.\n\nWait, no. Because if you have '0' and '2' separated by a '1', can you arrange them in any order? Let's see.\n\nFor example, consider \"012\". The '0' is before '1', which is before '2'. Can we swap '0' and '2'? Well, the '0' can move past the '1' to get to the position after '1', but that doesn't help. Or maybe the '2' can move past the '1' to get to the front, but then it's '201', but '0' and '2' are still adjacent and can't be swapped.\n\nSo, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed unless there's a way to swap via '1's in between. Hmm.\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be broken down into considering the positions of '0's, '1's, and '2's, and determining how their relative order can be changed based on the allowed swaps.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as a graph where each character can be moved to certain positions, but given the size of the input (up to 1e5), that's not feasible.\n\nAnother idea is to consider that the '0's can be arranged among themselves only if there are '1's to allow them to swap. Wait, no—because '0's can only swap with '1's, so their movement is limited to passing '1's. So, for example, a '0' can move to the left if there's a '1' to its right, allowing the '0' to swap past the '1's one by one. Similarly, a '2' can move to the left by swapping past '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think about the order of the characters when all possible swaps are done. For '0's, they can be moved past '1's, but not past '2's. Similarly, '2's can be moved past '1's, but not past '0's. So the relative order between '0's and '2's is fixed unless there's a '1' in between that allows their movement.\n\nWait,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1' or adjacent '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that '0's can only be moved past '1's, and '2's can only be moved past '1's. This means that while '0's and '2's cannot swap directly, their relative order can be influenced by the presence of '1's. \n\nTo achieve the smallest lexicographical order:\n1. **Arrange '0's as left as possible**: Since '0' is the smallest character, we want it as far left as possible. However, '0's can only move past '1's, so we need to process '0's from left to right, moving each '0' past any '1's to its right.\n2. **Arrange '1's in their relative order**: '1's can be moved past each other by swapping with '2's, but since '1's are in the middle of '0's and '2's, their relative order can be adjusted by moving '2's past them.\n3. **Arrange '2's as right as possible**: After handling '0's, the remaining characters will be '1's and '2's. We process '2's from right to left, moving each '2' past any '1's to its left.\n\nThis approach ensures that each character is moved as far as possible within the constraints of the allowed swaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    s = list(s)\n    \n    # Process 0s: move them as far left as possible by swapping with 1s on their right\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '0':\n            while i < len(s) - 1 and s[i+1] == '1':\n                s[i], s[i+1] = s[i+1], s[i]\n                i += 1\n    \n    # Process 2s: move them as far right as possible by swapping with 1s on their left\n    for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == '2':\n            while i > 0 and s[i-1] == '1':\n                s[i], s[i-1] = s[i-1], s[i]\n                i -= 1\n    \n    return ''.join(s)\n\n# Read input\ns = input().strip()\nprint(min_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Processing '0's**: Iterate through the string from left to right. For each '0', swap it with the next '1' until there are no more '1's to its right. This ensures '0's are moved as far left as possible.\n2. **Processing '2's**: Iterate through the string from right to left. For each '2', swap it with the previous '1' until there are no more '1's to its left. This ensures '2's are moved as far right as possible.\n3. **Result**: After processing both '0's and '2's, the string is rearranged to its lexicographically smallest form based on the allowed swaps.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the constraints and ensures optimal placement of each character type, resulting in the smallest possible string.",
