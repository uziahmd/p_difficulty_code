The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about the Number Games in Panel. Each district has a contestant, and the number of fans is 2^i for district i. The president wants to remove k contestants such that all remaining districts form a connected component. He also wants to maximize the total fans left. So, I need to find which k districts to remove.\n\nHmm, the key points are:\n\n1. The districts form a tree because there's exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. After removing k districts, the remaining must form a connected subtree.\n3. The goal is to maximize the sum of 2^i for each remaining district.\n\nWait, but how do I choose which districts to remove? Because removing certain ones would split the tree into parts, but we want the largest possible sum.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Since 2^i grows exponentially, the higher-numbered districts contribute more to the sum. So, to maximize the sum, perhaps we should keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nBut the problem is that the tree's structure might require some lower-numbered districts to be kept to keep the higher ones connected. So the idea is to find a subtree where as many high-numbered nodes as possible are included, while ensuring connectivity without needing too many low-numbered nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution is to find a subtree that includes as many high nodes as possible and excludes some low nodes, but the way the tree is structured might force us to include some lower nodes if they are on the paths to the high nodes.\n\nSo, maybe the approach is to find a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes and exclude the lowest possible nodes, subject to the constraints of the tree.\n\nAlternatively, think about it as selecting a set of nodes that forms a connected subtree and has exactly n - k nodes. Among all such possible sets, choose the one with the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThis seems challenging, especially since n can be up to 1e6.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find the subtree that consists of all the nodes except those in the k smallest possible \"branches\" that are not needed for connectivity.\n\nWait, another angle: For each node, determine how many nodes are in its subtree. If a node's subtree has size s, then removing all nodes except the root and its necessary children could allow us to keep only the larger subtrees.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to maximize the sum is to select a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, possibly by keeping their parent nodes.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by finding the minimal set of nodes that, when removed, leaves a connected component containing the maximum possible sum of 2^i.\n\nSince 2^i is exponential, the higher the node number, the better. So, perhaps the optimal connected component is the one that includes all the highest-numbered nodes possible.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nAnother thought: For any node u, the sum of its subtree is the sum of 2^u plus the sum of all its children. But since the tree is connected, the subtree must be rooted somewhere.\n\nWait, but in the tree, the connected component after removing some nodes will form a subtree. So, the problem reduces to selecting a subtree T of the original tree such that the number of nodes in T is (n - k), and the sum of 2^i for nodes in T is maximized.\n\nSo, the question is: find a subtree T with exactly m = n -k nodes, which has maximum possible sum of 2^i.\n\nGiven that, the problem becomes similar to selecting a subtree of size m that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo, how to find such a subtree.\n\nAn efficient way is needed, given that n can be up to 1e6.\n\nIdea: Perform a post-order traversal of the tree, keeping track of the size of each subtree. We can then decide whether to keep or cut certain subtrees based on their sizes.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, let's think about the sum. Each node contributes 2^i. So, higher nodes contribute much more than lower ones. So, for example, including a node with i=10 is better than including ten nodes with i=9.\n\nThus, it's better to have a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, even if that means cutting off some lower ones.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is to find the minimal number of lower nodes that must be kept to connect the higher nodes.\n\nWait, but how to model that.\n\nAlternative approach: We can model this as selecting a subtree that starts from the highest node and includes as much as possible. Then, if the required size is met, that's our answer. Otherwise, we need to cut some branches.\n\nWait, perhaps we can process the tree in a way that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component with the maximum possible total number of fans. The number of fans for a district `i` is `2^i`, so higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more to the total.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure Insight**: The districts form a tree, meaning there's exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since higher-numbered districts have more fans, we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n3. **Subtree Selection**: We need to select a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes and excludes the lowest necessary nodes to form a connected component with exactly `n - k` nodes.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Performing a post-order traversal to compute the size of each subtree.\n2. Starting from the highest node and including as many nodes as possible within the allowed size.\n3. If the size is not met, selectively remove branches starting from the smallest subtrees.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # Build parent and children structure, rooted at 1\n    parent = [0]*(n+1)\n    children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    visited = [False]*(n+1)\n    stack = [1]\n    visited[1] = True\n    while stack:\n        u = stack.pop()\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                parent[v] = u\n                children[u].append(v)\n                stack.append(v)\n    \n    # Now, compute subtree sizes using post-order traversal\n    size = [1]*(n+1)\n    post_order = []\n    stack = [(1, False)]\n    while stack:\n        node, processed = stack.pop()\n        if processed:\n            post_order.append(node)\n            for child in children[node]:\n                size[node] += size[child]\n        else:\n            stack.append((node, True))\n            for child in reversed(children[node]):\n                stack.append((child, False))\n    \n    # Now, process the nodes in reverse order (highest to lowest)\n    result = []\n    m = n - k\n    current_size = 0\n    removed = set()\n    \n    for u in reversed(range(1, n+1)):\n        if u in removed:\n            continue\n        if current_size + size[u] <= m:\n            current_size += size[u]\n            continue\n        else:\n            # Need to cut some branches\n            # Find the smallest possible subtree to remove\n            min_sub_size = float('inf')\n            for v in children[u]:\n                if v not in removed:\n                    candidate = size[v]\n                    if candidate < min_sub_size:\n                        min_sub_size = candidate\n            # Remove the subtree with the smallest size\n            for v in children[u]:\n                if v not in removed and size[v] == min_sub_size:\n                    removed.add(v)\n                    break\n            current_size -= min_sub_size\n            # Now, include u\n            current_size += 1\n            result.append(u)\n    \n    # Collect the result, sort them\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Construction**: We build the tree structure using adjacency lists and determine the parent-child relationships.\n2. **Subtree Size Calculation**: Using post-order traversal, we compute the size of each subtree.\n3. **Select Subtree**: Starting from the highest node, we try to include as many nodes as possible. If the required size is not met, we remove the smallest possible subtree branch by branch until the size constraint is satisfied.\n4. **Result Compilation**: The nodes to be removed are collected, sorted, and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the total number of fans while keeping the remaining districts connected.",
