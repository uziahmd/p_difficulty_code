Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Guard Duty. The task is to determine whether it's possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to B bases in such a way that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Also, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect any other such paths. So, the key constraints are: it's a perfect matching between the two sets, and the corresponding line segments (from each base to its assigned ship) must not cross each other.\n\nHmm. So, the input gives us R ships and B bases. We need to check if there's a way to match them without any crossing lines.\n\nFirst, let me think about the approach. Since both R and B can be up to 10, it's manageable with some kind of brute-force approach.\n\nWait, but wait—what's the condition for the lines not to cross? So, for any two matched pairs (base A to ship X, base B to ship Y), the line segments AX and BY should not intersect.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not exactly right. It's any two paths. So for all i and j, the lines from base_i to ship_j and base_k to ship_l shouldn't cross, regardless of whether they are part of the same matching or not? Or does it only matter between matched pairs?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\". So, yes, it's any two such paths, even from different bases and ships. Wait, no, because each base is assigned exactly one ship. So the paths we're considering are exactly the ones between each base and their assigned ship. So, the condition is that none of these paths (i.e., the line segments from each base to its assigned ship) intersect any other path.\n\nSo, for example, suppose we have base1 → ship1 and base2 → ship2. If their connecting line segments cross, that's a problem.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a perfect bipartite matching where all the edges (lines between matched base and ship) form non-crossing segments.\n\nNow, how do we model this?\n\nI think the steps are as follows:\n\n1. Read all the points for the ships and the bases.\n2. Check all possible perfect matchings between ships and bases.\n3. For each matching, check if the corresponding line segments don't cross any others in the matching.\n4. If any such matching exists, output \"Yes\"; otherwise, \"No\".\n\nBut wait, the number of possible matchings could be quite large. For R=10 and B=10, the number of perfect matchings is 10! which is 3,628,800. But since 10 is small, this is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is to generate all possible permutations of assigning ships to bases, then for each permutation, check if the line segments don't cross.\n\nBut wait, no: the assignment is a bijection, so each base is assigned exactly one ship and vice versa. So, it's a bipartite graph, and we need a perfect matching.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's a perfect matching, meaning each base is assigned to exactly one ship, and each ship is assigned to exactly one base. So the problem is equivalent to finding a bijection f from bases to ships such that for all i, j, the line segment from base_i to f(base_i) doesn't cross any line segment from base_k to f(base_k) when k != i.\n\nSo, for each possible permutation (since each base is assigned exactly one ship), we need to check if the corresponding line segments are non-crossing.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Enumerate all possible bijections (permutations) between bases and ships.\n- For each permutation, compute the line segments between each base and its assigned ship.\n- Check if any two such segments intersect.\n- If a permutation exists where no segments intersect, output \"Yes\".\n- Otherwise, output \"No\".\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely correct. Because the order in which the bases are processed may vary, but perhaps the same for the ships. So, the problem is to find a matching where the lines do not cross each other.\n\nSo, the first step is to generate all possible permutations of the ships for the bases. Each permutation represents a possible assignment.\n\nThen, for each permutation, check if the line segments between each base and its assigned ship do not cross any other such segments.\n\nBut how do we check if any two segments cross?\n\nWe need a function that, given a set of line segments, determines whether any two of them intersect.\n\nSo, for each permutation, collect all the line segments (each base to its assigned ship). Then, for every pair of segments in this collection, check if they cross. If any pair does, this permutation is invalid. If none do, then this permutation is acceptable.\n\nSo, the core is to implement this function.\n\nNow, how to represent the line segments and check for intersection.\n\nEach line segment is between two points: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). We need to determine if two such segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nTo check if two line segments AB and CD intersect, we can use the standard computational geometry approach.\n\nThe algorithm goes like this:\n\nGiven two line segments AB and CD, with endpoints A, B and C, D respectively.\n\nCheck if AB and CD intersect.\n\nWe can use the following method:\n\nCompute the orientation of various points. Orientation(p, q, r) returns:\n- 0 if p, q, r are colinear and r is on the segment pq.\n- 1 if p, q, r make a counter-clockwise turn.\n- 2 if p, q, r make a clockwise turn.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Compute the four orientations: o1 = orientation(A, B, C), o2 = orientation(A, B, D), o3 = orientation(C, D, A), o4 = orientation(C, D, B).\n\n2. If one of the segments is entirely on the other, return true (but in our case, since no three points are colinear, we can ignore that for now).\n\n3. Otherwise, check if the general case applies: the segments intersect if and only if:\n\n   - o1 and o2 have opposite signs (so A-B crosses C-D), and\n   - o3 and o4 have opposite signs.\n\nBut wait, I think the exact condition is:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- Points A and B are on opposite sides of CD, and points C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think is using the standard cross product-based approach.\n\nLet me try to write a helper function for this.\n\nAnother approach is to represent each line segment as two points and then compute the intersection.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the orientation-based method.\n\nSo, the helper function will take two line segments (each represented by two endpoints) and return True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nImplementing this correctly is crucial.\n\nOnce we have that, for each permutation of assignments, we can collect the line segments, then for every pair of segments in that collection, check if any pair intersects. If any pair does, the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, considering that R and B can be up to 10, the maximum number of segments in a permutation is 10. The number of pairs is 10*9/2 = 45, so for each permutation, checking all 45 pairs is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read all R ship points into a list, say ships.\n- Read all B base points into a list, say bases.\n- Generate all possible permutations of length B from the R ships. Wait, no: since R and B must be equal for a perfect matching (as per the problem statement, it's a perfect matching, so R = B). So, in the problem, R equals B, as per the input constraints? Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the first line contains R and B, and the sample input shows R=3 and B=3, and another sample where R=2 and B=2.\n\nWait, no: the problem statement says R and B can be up to 10, but doesn't specify that they are equal. Oh, wait, the problem says, \"the assignment is a perfect matching\", which implies that R = B, because a perfect matching requires that the two sets have the same size.\n\nSo, the first thing to check is whether R == B. Because otherwise, a perfect matching is impossible.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, it says that it's possible to assign R to B. So, for example, if R is 3 and B is 3, it's allowed. But if R is 2 and B is 3, it's impossible.\n\nSo, the first thing the code should do is check whether R == B. If not, output 'No'.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: It says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" The input is first two integers R and B (1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). So, R and B can be different.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the assignment is a perfect matching, which requires R = B. So, if R != B, the answer is automatically 'No'.\n\nSo, in the code, first, check if R != B. If so, output 'No' immediately.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read R and B.\n\n2. If R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n\n3. Read R ship coordinates.\n\n4. Read B base coordinates.\n\n5. Check all possible permutations of B elements from R elements (since R = B, this would be all possible bijections).\n\nWait, no: since the assignment is a bijection, each base is assigned to a unique ship. So, it's a permutation of the ships' indices.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can treat the ships as a list and the bases as a list, and generate all possible permutations of the bases' assignment to ships.\n\nWait, for example, if we have ships [s1, s2, s3], and bases [b1, b2, b3], then a permutation could assign s1 to b1, s2 to b2, s3 to b3. Another permutation assigns s3 to b1, s1 to b2, s2 to b3, etc.\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(ships, B), which is of length B, each element is a ship.\n\nWait, but the ships are in a list; the permutation selects B distinct elements in all possible orders.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(ships):\n\n   create a list of line segments, where each segment is from base[i] to ship[i].\n\n   for each pair of segments in this list, check if they intersect.\n\n   if any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid.\n\n   else, this permutation is valid. So, return 'Yes'.\n\nSo, the code can loop through all permutations, and for each permutation, check all possible pairs of segments.\n\nIf any permutation passes all checks, output 'Yes'; else, after checking all, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the main parts are:\n\n- Implementing the orientation function.\n\n- Implementing the segment intersection check.\n\nLet me think about the orientation function.\n\nThe orientation function takes three points: p, q, r.\n\nIt computes the cross product of vectors qp and qr. If the result is zero, the points are colinear. Else, if positive, it's counter-clockwise (left turn), if negative, it's clockwise (right turn).\n\nBut for the problem, the points are guaranteed not to have three on the same line. So, in our case, the cross product won't be zero except when all three are colinear, but that's not allowed.\n\nWait, the problem states that \"no three points are on the same line,\" which includes the bases and the ships. So, for any three distinct points (two from ships, one from bases or vice versa?), no three are colinear. So, in our case, for any three distinct points, their cross product is either positive or negative, but never zero.\n\nSo, the orientation function can safely return 1 or -1, never 0.\n\nSo, implementing the orientation function as:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val > 0:\n        return 1  # CCW\n    elif val < 0:\n        return 2  # CW\n    else:\n        return 0  # colinear, but this shouldn't happen\n\nBut since in the problem, no three are colinear, the third case is impossible.\n\nSo, for our purposes, the function will return 1 or 2.\n\nNow, the function to check if two segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nImplementing the line segment intersection check.\n\nFunction signature: segments_intersect(a, b, c, d) -> bool\n\nWhere a, b are endpoints of segment 1, c, d are endpoints of segment 2.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nThe standard approach is:\n\nCompute the four orientations.\n\nCase 1: General case.\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n- Point C is on the opposite side of AB from D, and point D is on the opposite side of CD from C.\n\nWait, no. The correct condition is:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- The orientation of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and\n\n- The orientation of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different.\n\nSo, if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4), then the segments intersect.\n\nBut wait, that's not sufficient. What about when one segment is entirely inside another? Like, when AB is a vertical line and CD is a horizontal line passing through the middle.\n\nBut in that case, the above condition would catch it.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think: for example, A=(0,0), B=(2,0), C=(1,1), D=(1,-1). So, AB is a horizontal line from (0,0) to (2,0). CD is a vertical line through (1,1) and (1,-1). These two lines intersect at (1,0). So, the segments AB and CD do intersect at (1,0).\n\nIn this case:\n\no1 = orientation(A,B,C) = (2,0) cross (1,1): (2*(1) - 0*(1)) - (0*(1) - 0*(1)) = 2*1 - 0 = 2. So, o1 is 1 (since 2>0).\n\no2 = orientation(A,B,D) = (2,0) cross (1,-1): (2*(-1) - 0*(-1)) = -2. So, o2 is 2.\n\nSo, o1 and o2 are different.\n\no3 = orientation(C,D,A): (1,1) to (1,-1) to (0,0). The cross product is (1*(-1) - (-1)*0) - (1*0 - (-1)*1) = (-1) - (1) = -2. So, o3 is 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the orientation is for points C, D, A.\n\nWait, point C is (1,1), D is (1,-1), and A is (0,0).\n\nVector CD is (0, -2).\n\nVector CA is (-1, -1).\n\nCross product is (0)(-1) - (-2)(-1) = 0 - 2 = -2. So, since it's negative, orientation is 2.\n\nSimilarly, o4 = orientation(C,D,B) is (1,1) to (1,-1) to (2,0). Vector CB is (1, -1). Cross product is (0)*(-1) - (-2)*(1) = 0 +2=2>0, so orientation is 1.\n\nSo, o3=2 and o4=1, which are different.\n\nThus, the condition (o1 != o2 and o3 != o4) is satisfied, so the function returns True.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: two parallel lines that do not intersect.\n\nSay, AB is from (0,0) to (2,0), CD is from (3,0) to (5,0). These lines are parallel and don't intersect.\n\nCompute o1 = orientation(A,B,C) = (2,0) cross (3,0) => 2*0 - 0*0 = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the cross product for (A,B,C) is (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x). So, (2-0)(0-0) - (0-0)(3-0) = 0. But in the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so this situation isn't possible.\n\nWait, but in our case, for the segments AB and CD being parallel, the cross products may not satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, let's take AB from (0,0) to (1,0), CD from (2,0) to (3,0). So, both are horizontal lines on the x-axis.\n\nFor AB and CD, since all points are on the same line, but the problem states that no three points are colinear, so this is not possible.\n\nSo, perhaps in our problem, any two segments either cross or don't, and the condition holds.\n\nSo, the function can be implemented as:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # a, b are endpoints of segment 1\n    # c, d are endpoints of segment 2\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: collinear points\n    # But in our problem, no three points are colinear, so we don't need to handle this.\n    return False\n\nWait, but wait: what about when the segments are overlapping but not crossing? Like, AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), and CD is from (1,1) to (3,3). They are colinear and overlapping. But since in the problem, no three points are colinear, this can't happen. So, our function can safely assume that any two segments either cross or don't, and the general case covers all possibilities.\n\nSo, the function should correctly return True if the segments cross, False otherwise.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe code outline:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No' and exit.\n\nRead R ship points.\n\nRead B base points.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the ships, taken B at a time.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   Create a list of line segments: for i in 0..B-1, segment is (base[i], ship[i]).\n\n   For all pairs of segments in this list, check if any pair intersects.\n\n   If no pairs intersect, then return 'Yes'.\n\nIf after all permutations, none satisfy, return 'No'.\n\nSo, the code will look something like this.\n\nBut in Python, generating all permutations is done with itertools.permutations.\n\nWait, but the ships are a list of points. So, each permutation is a tuple of B points, each from the ships.\n\nBut wait, the permutation is of the ships' indices, not the points themselves. So, for example, if the ships are s0, s1, s2, and the permutation is (1, 2, 0), then the assignment is base0 → s1, base1 → s2, base2 → s0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the permutation is of the ships, so each index in the permutation corresponds to the base index. So, for base0, it is assigned to the 0-th element of the permutation.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nbases = [b0, b1, b2]\n\nships = [s0, s1, s2]\n\npermutation = (s1, s2, s0)\n\nThen, the assignment is:\n\nbase0 → s1\n\nbase1 → s2\n\nbase2 → s0\n\nSo, the line segments are:\n\n(b0, s1), (b1, s2), (b2, s0)\n\nNow, for each permutation, we create a list of segments as [ (bases[i], perm[i]) for i in range(B) ]\n\nThen, for each pair of segments in this list, check for intersection.\n\nIf any pair intersects, the permutation is invalid.\n\nElse, it's a valid assignment.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nimport itertools\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\nships = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    ships.append( (x, y) )\n\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append( (x, y) )\n\n# Function definitions...\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val > 0:\n        return 1\n    elif val < 0:\n        return 2\n    else:\n        return 0  # colinear, but problem says no three are colinear\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # a and b are endpoints of segment 1\n    # c and d are endpoints of segment 2\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nfound = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(ships):\n    segments = []\n    for i in range(B):\n        segments.append( (bases[i], perm[i]) )\n    # Now, check all pairs of segments\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n            a, b = segments[i]\n            c, d = segments[j]\n            if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        found = True\n        break\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nWait, but in the code, the permutation is of the ships. So, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n2 1\n1 0\n0 3\n2 2\n\nWait, the ships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)], bases are [(2,1), (1,0), (0,3)].\n\nWait, no, wait: the first part of the input is R=3 and B=3. Then, the next 3 lines are the ships. Then, the next 3 lines are the bases.\n\nWait, no: the input is structured as:\n\nThe first line is R and B.\n\nThen R lines for the ships.\n\nThen B lines for the bases.\n\nSo, in the sample input provided, the first line is '3 3\\n...' followed by 3 ship lines, then 3 base lines.\n\nSo, in the code, the way the ships and bases are read is correct.\n\nBut in the sample, the ships are:\n\nship 1: 0 0\n\nship 2: 2 0\n\nship 3: 3 1\n\nbases:\n\nbase1: 2 1\n\nbase2: 1 0\n\nbase3: 0 3\n\nWait, but in the code, the permutation is of the ships, so for each permutation of 3 ships, the code creates segments between each base and the permuted ship.\n\nWait, but wait: the bases are in a list, bases = [base1, base2, base3]. And the permutation is a tuple of three ships, in the order of the permutation.\n\nSo, for a permutation (ship0, ship1, ship2), the segments are:\n\nbase0 → ship0\n\nbase1 → ship1\n\nbase2 → ship2\n\nSo, the code correctly constructs the segments.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nIn the first sample, the output is 'Yes' because one possible matching is:\n\nbase0 (2,1) → ship0 (0,0)\n\nbase1 (1,0) → ship1 (2,0)\n\nbase2 (0,3) → ship2 (3,1)\n\nNow, checking the segments:\n\nbase0 to ship0: line from (2,1) to (0,0).\n\nbase1 to ship1: (1,0) to (2,0).\n\nbase2 to ship2: (0,3) to (3,1).\n\nDo any of these segments cross?\n\nBetween base0 and ship0: the line goes from (2,1) to (0,0). This is a diagonal line going down to the left.\n\nBase1 to ship1: (1,0) to (2,0). This is a horizontal line to the right.\n\nThese two segments don't cross.\n\nBase2 to ship2: (0,3) to (3,1). Line goes down to the right.\n\nDoes this line cross any of the other two?\n\nThe base0-ship0 line and base2-ship2 line:\n\nLet's compute the orientation.\n\nCheck if the two segments intersect.\n\nSegment 1: a=(2,1), b=(0,0).\n\nSegment 2: c=(0,3), d=(3,1).\n\nCompute o1 = orientation(a, b, c).\n\na is (2,1), b is (0,0), c is (0,3).\n\nVectors ab is (-2, -1).\n\nac is (-2, 2).\n\nThe cross product is (-2)(2) - (-1)(-2) = -4 - 2 = -6 <0 → o1 is 2.\n\no2 = orientation(a,b,d): d is (3,1).\n\nad is (1,0).\n\nCross product: (-2)(1) - (-1)(3) = -2 +3 = 1>0 → o2 is 1.\n\nSo, o1 != o2.\n\nCompute o3 = orientation(c, d, a): c is (0,3), d is (3,1), a is (2,1).\n\nVectors cd is (3, -2).\n\nca is (2, -2).\n\nCross product: 3*(-2) - (-2)*2 = -6 +4 = -2 <0 → o3 is 2.\n\no4 = orientation(c, d, b): b is (0,0).\n\ncb is (0, -3).\n\nCross product: 3*(-3) - (-2)*0 = -9 <0 → o4 is 2.\n\nSo, o3 is 2, o4 is 2 → same sign.\n\nThus, the condition (o1 != o2 and o3 != o4) is satisfied, so segments_intersect returns True.\n\nWait, that suggests that the two segments cross. But according to the sample, it's a valid assignment.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's recompute.\n\nWait, the segment a-b is from (2,1) to (0,0).\n\nThe segment c-d is from (0,3) to (3,1).\n\nThese two lines:\n\nLine 1: starts at (2,1), ends at (0,0).\n\nLine 2: starts at (0,3), ends at (3,1).\n\nDo they cross?\n\nLet me plot them mentally.\n\nLine 1: from (2,1) to (0,0) is a line sloping downward.\n\nLine 2: from (0,3) to (3,1) is a line sloping downward.\n\nThey both go from higher y to lower y as x increases.\n\nDo they cross?\n\nWait, perhaps yes.\n\nBut according to the sample, the assignment is possible.\n\nSo, perhaps my function is incorrect.\n\nWait, but according to the sample explanation, the assignment is possible.\n\nSo, perhaps my function is returning True for an intersection that actually doesn't exist.\n\nHmm, perhaps I have a bug in the function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering all possible pairs, including those within the same segment.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each permutation, the segments are built as [ (base0, ship0), (base1, ship1), (base2, ship2) ].\n\nSo, the segments are between each base and its assigned ship. So, for each pair of segments in this list, we check if they intersect.\n\nIn the sample, the two segments (base0 to ship0) and (base2 to ship2) are the ones being considered.\n\nDo these two segments cross?\n\nLet me calculate.\n\nParametrize line 1: a(2,1) → b(0,0). The parametric equations are x = 2 - 2t, y = 1 - t, for t in [0,1].\n\nLine 2: c(0,3) → d(3,1). Parametric equations: x = 0 + 3s, y = 3 - 2s, for s in [0,1].\n\nFind t and s such that:\n\n2 - 2t = 3s\n\n1 - t = 3 - 2s\n\nFrom the second equation: 1 - t = 3 - 2s → t = 3 - 2s -1 = 2 - 2s.\n\nSubstitute into first equation:\n\n2 - 2*(2 - 2s) = 3s → 2 -4 +4s =3s → (-2) +4s=3s → s=2.\n\nBut s must be in [0,1], so no solution.\n\nSo, the lines do not cross.\n\nBut according to the function, the segments do cross.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the function is incorrect.\n\nWhat's the issue here.\n\nWait, in the function, when the two lines are parallel but not overlapping, do they count as intersecting?\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so two lines cannot be parallel and not overlapping. So, in our problem, two lines either cross once or not at all.\n\nWait, no: two lines can be parallel and not overlap, but in our case, since no three points are colinear, two lines can't be parallel.\n\nWait, no. Two lines can have the same slope but different intercepts, thus being parallel and not overlapping. But in our case, no three points are colinear, but two lines could still be parallel.\n\nSo, the function needs to handle this case.\n\nSo, perhaps the current function is not handling this case.\n\nLet me think again about the two lines in the sample.\n\nLine 1: from (2,1) to (0,0). Its slope is (0-1)/(0-2) = (-1)/(-2) = 0.5.\n\nLine 2: from (0,3) to (3,1). Slope is (1-3)/(3-0) = (-2)/3 ≈ -0.666.\n\nSo, different slopes. So, they must cross once.\n\nBut according to the parametrization, they don't cross between t and s in [0,1].\n\nSo, why does the function return True?\n\nWait, perhaps the function is considering the lines beyond the segments, but in reality, the segments do not cross.\n\nSo, the function is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the function is incorrectly determining that the segments intersect, but in reality, they don't.\n\nSo, the function is flawed.\n\nSo, what's wrong with the function?\n\nAh, perhaps the function is considering the general case, but not checking if the intersection is within the segments.\n\nSo, the function returns True if the two lines cross anywhere, but the segments may not intersect if the crossing is outside the segments.\n\nSo, the function is correct in terms of whether two lines cross, but not considering whether the crossing is within the segments.\n\nThus, the function may return True for segments that don't actually cross.\n\nSo, we need to adjust the function to account for whether the intersection is within the segments.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nSo, the function needs to:\n\n- Determine if two segments intersect, considering whether the intersection point lies within both segments.\n\nSo, how to do that.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the intersection point, if it exists, and then check if it's within both segments.\n\nBut since the function may be used with floating points, we can avoid precision issues by using parametric forms.\n\nLet me think of the parametric approach.\n\nFor segment AB: A + t*(B - A), t ∈ [0, 1]\n\nFor segment CD: C + s*(D - C), s ∈ [0, 1]\n\nWe solve for t and s:\n\nA.x + t*(B.x - A.x) = C.x + s*(D.x - C.x)\n\nA.y + t*(B.y - A.y) = C.y + s*(D.y - C.y)\n\nIf there's a solution with t and s in [0,1], then the segments intersect.\n\nSo, in code, we can compute t and s, and see if they lie within [0,1].\n\nBut solving this system of equations may require handling division.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can implement this.\n\nSo, the function can be rewritten to compute t and s.\n\nLet me attempt to implement this.\n\nThe function will compute whether the two segments intersect, considering whether the intersection is within the segments.\n\nSo, the function will:\n\n- For segments AB and CD:\n\n   Calculate the denominator for t and s.\n\n   If denominator is zero, the lines are parallel.\n\n      Then, check if AB and CD are colinear and overlapping. But in our problem, no three points are colinear, so this case is impossible.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Compute t and s.\n\n      If t and s are between 0 and 1, return True.\n\n      Else, return False.\n\nWait, but solving for t and s can be tricky.\n\nSo, let's formalize:\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n(A.x + t*(B.x - A.x)) = C.x + s*(D.x - C.x) --> equation 1\n\n(A.y + t*(B.y - A.y)) = C.y + s*(D.y - C.y) --> equation 2\n\nWe can rearrange equation 1 to express s in terms of t, or equation 2 to express s in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate s.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to express both equations in terms of t and s.\n\nAlternatively, let's denote dx1 = B.x - A.x, dy1 = B.y - A.y.\n\ndx2 = D.x - C.x, dy2 = D.y - C.y.\n\nWe can express equation 1 as:\n\nt*dx1 = (C.x - A.x) + s*dx2\n\nequation 2:\n\nt*dy1 = (C.y - A.y) + s*dy2\n\nWe can solve for t and s.\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nt*dx1 - s*dx2 = (C.x - A.x)\n\nt*dy1 - s*dy2 = (C.y - A.y)\n\nWe can represent this as a linear system:\n\n[ dx1  -dx2 ] [t]   = [C.x - A.x]\n\n[ dy1  -dy2 ] [s]     [C.y - A.y]\n\nTo solve for t and s, compute the determinant of the matrix:\n\ndet = dx1*(-dy2) - (-dx2)*dy1 = -dx1*dy2 + dx2*dy1.\n\nIf det is zero, the lines are parallel. Otherwise, we can compute t and s.\n\nSo, t = [ (C.x - A.x)*(-dy2) - (-dx2)*(C.y - A.y) ] / det\n\ns = [ dx1*(C.y - A.y) - dy1*(C.x - A.x) ] / det\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.\n\nThe system is:\n\na*t + b*s = e\n\nc*t + d*s = f\n\nWhere:\n\na = dx1, b = -dx2\n\nc = dy1, d = -dy2\n\ne = C.x - A.x\n\nf = C.y - A.y\n\nThe determinant is (a*d - b*c).\n\nSo, if determinant is zero, no solution.\n\nElse:\n\nt = (e*d - b*f) / det\n\ns = (a*f - e*c) / det\n\nThen, check if t is in [0,1] and s is in [0,1].\n\nIf yes, then the segments intersect.\n\nSo, implementing this in code.\n\nLet me write a helper function that, given two segments, returns whether they intersect within their segments.\n\nThus, the function will be:\n\ndef segments_intersect_in_segment(a, b, c, d):\n    # a and b are endpoints of segment 1\n    # c and d are endpoints of segment 2\n\n    # Compute denominators\n    dx1 = b[0] - a[0]\n    dy1 = b[1] - a[1]\n    dx2 = d[0] - c[0]\n    dy2 = d[1] - c[1]\n\n    # Compute denominator for t and s\n    det = dx1 * (-dy2) + dx2 * dy1  # det = dx1*(-dy",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect any other such paths.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is essentially to find a perfect matching between the Rebel spaceships and the bases. The key constraint is that the line segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect any other such segments.\n2. **Check for Perfect Matching**: Since both R and B can be up to 10, we can use a brute-force approach to check all possible permutations of assignments.\n3. **Check for Segment Intersection**: For each permutation, we need to check if any two line segments (from a base to its assigned spaceship) intersect. This involves using computational geometry techniques to determine if two line segments intersect and if the intersection lies within the segments.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val > 0:\n        return 1  # CCW\n    elif val < 0:\n        return 2  # CW\n    else:\n        return 0  # colinear, though problem states no three are colinear\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n    \n    d1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    d2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    d3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    d4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n    \n    if d1 * d2 < 0 and d3 * d4 < 0:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\nships = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    ships.append((x, y))\n\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append((x, y))\n\nfound = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(ships):\n    segments = []\n    for i in range(B):\n        segments.append((bases[i], perm[i]))\n    \n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n        a, b = segments[i]\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(segments)):\n            c, d = segments[j]\n            if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    \n    if valid:\n        found = True\n        break\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R is not equal to B, it immediately outputs \"No\".\n2. **Generating Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, the code generates all possible ways to assign spaceships to bases.\n3. **Checking Segments**: For each permutation, it constructs the corresponding line segments and checks if any two segments intersect using a helper function `segments_intersect`.\n4. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `orientation`: Determines the orientation of three points (colinear, clockwise, or counter-clockwise).\n   - `segments_intersect`: Uses orientation to check if two line segments intersect by ensuring the points are on opposite sides of each segment.\n\nThis approach ensures that we check all possible assignments and efficiently determine if a valid non-intersecting assignment exists.",
