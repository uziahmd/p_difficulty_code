The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the loser gets a red spot. I need to calculate how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm, the key here is to figure out for each round whether Nikephoros loses or wins, and similarly for Polycarpus. Then, count the losses for each.\n\nWait, but both players are following a cyclic strategy. So their moves cycle through their respective sequences A and B. For each round i (from 1 to n), I need to determine what each player plays, then decide who wins, and tally the loser's red spots accordingly.\n\nSo first, let me think about how to model the sequences.\n\nEach sequence is a string of 'R', 'S', 'P' characters. For each round, the current move for each player is the next character in their sequence, cycling as needed.\n\nFor example, if A is \"RPS\" (length 3), then the sequence for A would be R, P, S, R, P, S, etc. Similarly for B.\n\nSo for each round i (starting from 0?), I can compute the ith move for each by taking i mod len(A) for A and i mod len(B) for B.\n\nWait, but in programming, indices usually start at 0, but the problem statement doesn't specify. But since the problem says they show the items in the order of the sequence, starting from the first one, that suggests that for round 1, they use the first elements, then second, etc.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that ...\". So for the first round, it's a1, then a2, etc., then a1 again.\n\nSo for each round i (1-based?), the move for A is A[(i-1) % m], assuming that the sequence is 0-based in the code. Because for the first round, i=1: (1-1)=0, so index 0 is used.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the input, the second line is the sequence A as a string. So for example, if the input is \"RPS\", the moves are R, P, S, R, P, S, etc. So for the first round, it's R, second P, third S, fourth R, and so on.\n\nYes. So for each round number (starting from 1), the move for A is A[(round_number - 1) % m], where m is the length of A.\n\nSame for B.\n\nSo now, for each round from 1 to n:\n\n1. Get a_move = A[ (i-1) % m ] where i is the current round (from 1 to n)\n2. Get b_move = B[ (i-1) % k ]\n3. Determine who wins this round.\n\nThen, increment the red spot count for the loser.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n.\n- Read A and B strings.\n- Initialize counters: nike_red = 0, poly_red = 0.\n- For each round from 1 to n:\n   a. Compute a_move and b_move as per above.\n   b. Compare the two moves to see who loses.\n   c. Increment the respective counter.\n\nBut wait, the problem is when n is up to 2e5, which is manageable because 2e5 iterations are okay in Python.\n\nSo the main steps are straightforward. Now, how to implement the comparison.\n\nLet's think about the rules:\n\nRock (R) beats Scissors (S)\nScissors (S) beat Paper (P)\nPaper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\nIf both choose same, it's a draw.\n\nSo for a given a_move and b_move, we can compute who wins.\n\nWe can create a function that returns 0 for a draw, 1 if a wins, and 2 if b wins.\n\nWait, perhaps better to precompute for each possible pair which one wins.\n\nAlternatively, for each a_move and b_move:\n\nif a beats b, then a wins, so b (Poly) gets a spot.\nelse if b beats a, then Poly wins, so a (Nike) gets a spot.\nelse, no one gets a spot.\n\nSo for each pair, check if a_move beats b_move, else check if b_move beats a_move.\n\nHow to represent this? Maybe using a dictionary that for each possible (a, b) pair tells us the outcome.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nfor each round:\n    a_move = A[ (i-1) % m ]\n    b_move = B[ (i-1) % k ]\n\n    if a_move == b_move:\n        continue\n    elif (a_move, b_move) in [(R, S), (S, P), (P, R)]:\n        # a_move beats b_move\n        poly_red +=1\n    else:\n        # b_move beats a_move\n        nike_red +=1\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, R beats S. So if a is R and b is S, then a wins, Poly gets a spot.\n\nSimilarly, S beats P: a is S, b is P: a wins, Poly's spot.\n\nP beats R: a is P, b is R: a wins, Poly's spot.\n\nElse, if a is, say, S and b is R: then b beats a, so a (Nike) gets a spot.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif a_move == b_move: nothing.\nelse:\n   if (a_move, b_move) is in [(R, S), (S, P), (P, R)] → a wins → Poly's spot.\n   else → b wins → Nike's spot.\n\nWait, but let's think about all possibilities.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nA Move | B Move | Who Wins?\nR      | R      → Draw\nR      | S      → R (A) wins → Poly's spot\nR      | P      → P (B) wins → Nike's spot\nS      | R      → R (B) wins → Nike's spot\nS      | S      → Draw\nS      | P      → S (A) wins → Poly's spot\nP      | R      → R (B) wins → Nike's spot\nP      | S      → S (B) wins → Nike's spot\nP      | P      → Draw\n\nSo yes, the logic is correct.\n\nSo in code, for each round:\n\nif a_move == b_move: do nothing.\n\nelse:\n\ncheck if a_move beats b_move.\n\nIf yes → Poly loses (so Poly's count increases by 1).\n\nElse → A loses, so Nike's count increases by 1.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows.\n\nNow, for handling the sequences, since the strings are given as, for example, 'RPS', which is a string of 3 characters, and for each round, we take the (i-1) mod len(A) index.\n\nIn Python, for a string s, s[i] gives the ith character.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nInitialize nike = 0, poly = 0.\n\nLoop over i from 1 to n:\n\n   idx_a = (i-1) % m\n\n   a_char = A[idx_a]\n\n   idx_b = (i-1) % k\n\n   b_char = B[idx_b]\n\n   if a_char == b_char:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       if (a_char, b_char) in ['RS', 'SP', 'PR']:\n\n           poly +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           nike +=1\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSample Output: 3 2.\n\nLet me simulate the rounds.\n\nRound 1:\n\nA: R (since i=1, idx_a=0 → 'R')\n\nB: R (idx_b=0 → 'R')\n\nDraw. No change.\n\nRound 2:\n\nA: idx_a=1 → 'P'\n\nB: idx_b=1 → 'S'\n\nCompare P vs S: S beats P. So B wins. So Poly gets a spot. So Poly becomes 1.\n\nRound 3:\n\nA: idx_a=2 → 'S'\n\nB: idx_b=2 → 'P'\n\nS vs P: S beats P. Poly gains another, now 2.\n\nRound4:\n\nA: idx_a=3%3=0 → R\n\nB: idx_b=3%4=3 → 'P'\n\nR vs P: P beats R. So B wins, so Nike gains 1.\n\nRound5:\n\nA: idx_a=4%3=1 → P\n\nB: idx_b=4%4=0 → R.\n\nP vs R: P beats R. So B wins. So Nike gains another, now 2.\n\nRound6:\n\nA: idx_a=5%3=2 → S\n\nB: idx_b=5%4=1 → S.\n\nBoth S: draw. No change.\n\nRound7:\n\nA: idx_a=6%3=0 → R\n\nB: idx_b=6%4=2 → P.\n\nR vs P: P beats R. So B wins. So Nike gains 1, total 3.\n\nSo after 7 rounds:\n\nNike has 3, Poly has 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should handle this correctly.\n\nAnother test case: if all rounds are draws, output is 0 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='R', B='S'. Then R beats S → Poly gets a spot.\n\nWait, no: if A is 'R' and B is 'S' for i=1.\n\nA is R, B is S.\n\nR beats S → Poly loses → Poly's count is 1.\n\nSo output is 0 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nRead the input:\n\nWait, the input is given as three lines, perhaps? Or perhaps it's two lines. Looking back:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is sequence A.\n\nThird line is sequence B.\n\nWait, the sample input shows ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'], but that's probably a representation of input lines.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first line is 7, the second is 'RPS', the third is 'RSPP'.\n\nSo in the code, I'll read n as an integer.\n\nThen read A as the next line, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nSame for B.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nnike = 0\n\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    idx_a = (i-1) % m\n\n    a_char = A[idx_a]\n\n    idx_b = (i-1) % k\n\n    b_char = B[idx_b]\n\n    if a_char == b_char:\n\n        continue\n\n    if (a_char, b_char) in {'RS', 'SP', 'PR'}:\n\n        poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        nike +=1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output was '3 2', which is printed as two integers with a space in between.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the way of checking (a, b) in the set is correct?\n\nYes, because RS means a is R and b is S → a wins.\n\nSimilarly, SP: a is S, b is P → a wins.\n\nPR: a is P, b is R → a wins.\n\nAll other cases where a doesn't equal b, and not in these pairs, then b wins.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='R', B='R' → output 0 0.\n\nn=1, A='R', B='S' → output 0 1.\n\nn=1, A='S', B='R' → output 1 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should pass all test cases.\n\nI think that's all.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors games. Each player follows a cyclic strategy for their moves, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences of moves for both players.\n2. **Initialize Counters:** Set up counters to keep track of the red spots for each player.\n3. **Simulate Each Round:** For each round, determine the move for each player based on their respective cyclic sequences. Use modulo operation to cycle through the sequences.\n4. **Determine the Winner:** Check if the current moves result in a win for one of the players. Update the counters accordingly.\n5. **Output the Results:** After simulating all rounds, print the counts of red spots for both players.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    idx_a = (i - 1) % m\n    a_char = A[idx_a]\n    idx_b = (i - 1) % k\n    b_char = B[idx_b]\n    \n    if a_char == b_char:\n        continue\n    \n    if (a_char, b_char) in {'RS', 'SP', 'PR'}:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The first line gives the number of rounds `n`. The next two lines provide the sequences of moves for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n- **Cyclic Moves:** For each round, the move for each player is determined using modulo operations to cycle through their respective sequences.\n- **Winning Conditions:** Using a set of tuples representing winning conditions, we check if the current moves result in a win for either player. If Nikephoros wins, his counter is incremented; otherwise, Polycarpus's counter is incremented.\n- **Efficiency:** The solution efficiently handles up to the maximum constraint of 200,000 rounds with a time complexity of O(n), ensuring it runs quickly even for large inputs.",
