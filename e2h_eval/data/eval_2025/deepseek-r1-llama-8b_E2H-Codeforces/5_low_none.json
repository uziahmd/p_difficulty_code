Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about matching left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. Each boot has a color which is a lowercase letter or '?'. Two boots are compatible if they are the same specific color, or one is '?'.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible. Also, each boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about what makes two boots compatible. For a left boot l_i and right boot r_j:\n\n- If l_i is not '?' and r_j is not '?', then they must be the same.\n- If either is '?', then it's compatible.\n\nWait, no. Wait: The problem says an indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color. So:\n\n- If l_i is 'a' and r_j is 'a' → compatible.\n- If l_i is 'a' and r_j is '? → compatible.\n- If l_i is '?' and r_j is 'a' → compatible.\n- If both are '?' → compatible.\n\nSo, for each possible pair (l_i, r_j), we need to check if they are compatible.\n\nBut since n can be up to 150,000, checking all possible pairs directly would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nMaybe, for each possible color (including '?'), count the number of left boots and right boots that can contribute to a pair when matched with that color.\n\nWait, but it's more complicated because a left boot can match with multiple right boots, and vice versa. But since each can be used only once, it's a bipartite matching problem.\n\nYes! So it's similar to finding a maximum bipartite matching where edges exist between left and right boots if they are compatible.\n\nBut for n=150,000, standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp would be O(E√N), which might be acceptable, but E could be up to 150,000^2 = 2e10, which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a better approach.\n\nAlternative idea: group the left and right boots by their color (and consider '?') and then for each possible color, compute how many pairs can be formed.\n\nWait, perhaps using frequency counts.\n\nLet me think: For each color c in left boots, count how many lefts have c. Similarly, for each color d in right boots, count how many rights have d.\n\nThen, for each pair of c and d, if c and d are compatible, the number of possible pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[d]).\n\nBut wait, no. Because a left can pair with a right of any compatible color, but each can only be used once.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c (including '?'), collect all left and right boots that can potentially match with c.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a bipartite graph where the left nodes are grouped by their color, and the right nodes are grouped similarly. Then, for each color c, the left group can connect to right groups where the right's color is compatible with c.\n\nBut then, the maximum matching would involve selecting pairs from these groups without overlapping.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Preprocess the left and right arrays into frequency tables.\n\nFor left:\n- For each color c, count how many times it appears. Let's call this L[c].\n\nSimilarly for right:\n- For each color c, count R[c].\n\nAlso, create a list of all left indices and their colors, and same for right.\n\n2. Now, for each color c (including '?'), determine which right colors d are compatible with c.\n\nA right color d is compatible with c if:\n- d == c, or\n- d is '?'\n\nOr, wait, no: the definition is that two colors are compatible if they are exactly the same, or one is '?'.\n\nSo, for a left color l and right color r, they are compatible if:\n(l == r) OR (l == '?') OR (r == '?').\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Because, for example, if l is 'a' and r is 'b', they are not compatible. But if l is 'a' and r is '?', then yes.\n\nWait, no, the question says that an indefinite color is compatible with any other. So, for any pair (l, r), they are compatible if:\n\n(l is not '?') and (r is not '?') and (l == r) → compatible.\n\nOR\n\nAt least one of them is '?'. Because in that case, it's compatible regardless of the other.\n\nSo, the condition is:\n\n(l_i,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots such that each pair consists of one left and one right boot with compatible colors. Each boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each boot has a color represented by a lowercase letter or '?'. Two boots are compatible if they have the same color or one is '?'. The goal is to maximize the number of pairs while ensuring each boot is used at most once.\n\n2. **Intuition**: We can model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right boots if they are compatible. However, given the constraints, a direct approach is infeasible due to the large size of the input.\n\n3. **Optimized Strategy**: Instead of checking each pair directly, we count the frequency of each color (including '?') in both left and right boots. For each color, determine how many compatible pairs can be formed with other colors.\n\n4. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Count the frequency of each color in the left and right arrays.\n   - Use a greedy approach to match each left boot with the earliest possible right boot that it can pair with, ensuring maximum utilization of compatible pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Preprocess left and right into lists of colors\n    left = list(l)\n    right = list(r)\n\n    # Create a list of indices for left and right\n    left_indices = [i+1 for i in range(n)]\n    right_indices = [i+1 for i in range(n)]\n\n    # Count frequencies for left and right\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    left_count = defaultdict(int)\n    right_count = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in left:\n        left_count[c] += 1\n    for c in right:\n        right_count[c] += 1\n\n    # Prepare a list of all left and right colors\n    left_colors = [(c, i+1) for i, c in enumerate(left)]\n    right_colors = [(c, i+1) for i, c in enumerate(right)]\n\n    # Sort the left and right by their color, then by their index\n    left_colors.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    right_colors.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n    # Now, try to pair them greedily\n    # We'll use pointers for left and right\n    left_ptr = 0\n    right_ptr = 0\n    matches = []\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n\n    while left_ptr < n and right_ptr < n:\n        current_left = left_colors[left_ptr]\n        current_right = right_colors[right_ptr]\n\n        # Check if compatible\n        l_char, l_idx = current_left\n        r_char, r_idx = current_right\n        compatible = False\n        if l_char == '?' or r_char == '?':\n            compatible = True\n        else:\n            if l_char == r_char:\n                compatible = True\n\n        if compatible:\n            # Mark as used\n            matches.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n            used_left.add(l_idx)\n            used_right.add(r_idx)\n            left_ptr += 1\n            right_ptr += 1\n        else:\n            # Move the pointer which has the smaller character\n            if l_char < r_char:\n                left_ptr += 1\n            else:\n                right_ptr += 1\n\n    print(len(matches))\n    for pair in matches:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of boots and their respective colors.\n2. **Frequency Counting**: It counts the occurrences of each color in both left and right boot arrays.\n3. **Sorting**: The left and right boot colors are sorted to facilitate a greedy matching approach.\n4. **Greedy Matching**: Using two pointers, the code tries to match each left boot with the earliest possible right boot that is compatible, ensuring maximum utilization of each boot.\n5. **Output**: The number of pairs and the pairs themselves are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the maximum number of compatible pairs using a greedy strategy, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
