And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Hmm.\n\nSo, the input consists of two integers n and k. Then a sequence of n integers representing the sleep times for each day. We need to find the average of the sums of each consecutive k-day window, right?\n\nWait, let me think. For example, if n=3 and k=2, then there are 2 windows: [a1,a2] and [a2,a3]. We sum each, get their total, and divide by the number of weeks, which is n-k+1. So the average is (a1+a2 + a2+a3) / 2 in that case.\n\nBut when n is large, like up to 2e5, we can't just compute each window naively because that would be O(n*k), which might be too slow. Oh right, because 2e5 squared is 4e10 operations—way too much.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to compute the sum of all sliding windows quickly.\n\nHmm, how can we do this? Oh right, using a sliding window approach with a prefix sum array or a current sum that we update as we go.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this to the total sum.\n3. Then, for each next element from k to n-1:\n   a. Subtract the element leaving the window (the one at i -k)\n   b. Add the new element entering the window (i)\n   c. Add this new sum to the total.\n4. After processing all windows, divide the total sum by (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each step adds the sum of the current window, which is O(1) per step after the initial setup.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and k.\n- Read the array a.\n- Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n- Initialize total_sum with this initial sum.\n- Loop from index k to n-1 (since Python is zero-based, but wait, no—the problem says the second line is a1 to an. Wait, in code, the array will be zero-based, so the first window is a[0...k-1], then a[1...k], etc. So the loop starts at i = k, and ends at i = n-1. For each i, we subtract a[i -k], add a[i], and add the sum to total_sum.\n- Then, the average is total_sum / (n -k +1). But since it's a floating point division, we need to handle that correctly.\n\nWait, but in Python, integer division can cause issues. So better to perform floating point division.\n\nNow, about handling large numbers: since n can be up to 2e5, and each a_i up to 1e5, the total sum could be up to 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10, which fits in Python's integer type without any problem.\n\nRegarding precision: the output requires at least six decimal digits, and the relative or absolute error must be within 1e-6. So we need to print the result with enough decimal places, say 10, to ensure that.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n and k. Then read the list of a's.\n\nCompute the initial sum.\n\nThen iterate and update the sum.\n\nCompute the average.\n\nPrint it with 10 decimal digits, ensuring that it's formatted correctly.\n\nLet's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nInitial sum is 3+4=7. Then, next window is 4+7=11. So total is 7+11=18. Number of weeks is 2. 18/2=9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n1 1\n10\n\nOnly one week, sum is 10. Output is 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample input:\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nWait, n=8, k=2. So n-k+1=7 weeks.\n\nCompute each window:\n\n[1,2] sum 3\n\n[2,4] sum 6\n\n[4, 100000] sum 100004\n\n[100000,123] sum 100123\n\n[123,456] sum 579\n\n[456,789] sum 1245\n\n[789,1] sum 790\n\nTotal sum: 3 +6=9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201960; +790=202750.\n\nWait, adding all these:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n+100004 → 100013\n\n+100123 → 200136\n\n+579 → 200715\n\n+1245 → 201960\n\n+790 → 202750.\n\nWait, but what about the other windows? Like 789 and 1 sum to 790, yes.\n\nSo total is 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790.\n\nWait let's calculate:\n\n3 +6=9\n\n9 +100004=100013\n\n100013 +100123=200136\n\n200136 +579=200715\n\n200715 +1245=201960\n\n201960 +790=202750.\n\nSo total is 202750. Divided by 7: 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo our approach works.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nWe'll read n, k from the first line.\n\nThen read the list.\n\nCompute initial sum: sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal = initial_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n\n    total += a[i] - a[i -k]\n\nThen average = total / (n -k +1)\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, but in Python, the print statement needs to format the number correctly.\n\nFor example, using something like \"{:.10f}\".format(average).\n\nBut sometimes, when the number has more than 10 decimals, it may round or truncate. But the problem allows any format as long as it has at least 6 digits and meets the precision condition.\n\nWait, the note says: \"output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\"\n\nBut the sample outputs show 10 decimal digits. So perhaps the solution should output at least 6, but more is acceptable, but maybe we can format it to 10 to avoid any issues.\n\nSo, in code, the formatting string will be .10f.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase when k equals n. Then, only one window. So average is sum(a)/1.\n\nCase when k=1, n=2e5: then each element is a window, so average is sum(a)/n.\n\nAnother edge case: when n=k=1.\n\nWhat about when all a_i are 1? Or when some are zero.\n\nAll should be handled.\n\nNow, considering that the code must handle large n and k, but the approach is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the first line as n, k.\n\nRead the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the initial sum.\n\nLoop from i=k to n-1 (but in Python, indices are 0-based, so the loop variable i runs from k to len(a)-1, inclusive.\n\nWait, for the list a, which is 0-based:\n\nThe initial window is a[0] to a[k-1].\n\nThen, for i in range(k, len(a)):\n\ncurrent window is a[i -k +1 ... i], but wait, no—wait, the window is moving by one each time. So when i is k, the window is a[k] and a[k-1], but that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the loop variable.\n\nWait, the initial sum is sum(a[0:k]).\n\nThen, for each i starting from k (in 0-based), the new element is a[i], and the old element is a[i -k]. So the new sum is previous_sum - a[i -k] + a[i].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for i in range(k, len(a)):\n\nsum += a[i] - a[i -k]\n\nAdd this to the total.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif k == 0:\n    # but k is >=1 according to constraints, so no need.\n    pass\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but wait: no, in the initial code, the current_sum is the sum of the window, and we add that to the total. But wait, initial_sum is added once, then for each i, we add the current_sum again.\n\nWait no: initially, current_sum is sum of the first window. Then, for each next i, current_sum is updated by adding a[i] and subtracting a[i-k], and then this new current_sum is added to total. So for the first iteration (i=k), current_sum becomes the sum of the second window, and added to total.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\ninitial current_sum = 3+4=7. total =7.\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_sum += a[2] - a[0] → 7 +7-3=11. Then total +=11 → total=7+11=18.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, 'range(k, n)' is for i from k to n-1, inclusive.\n\nBecause in Python, range is up to but not including the end. So when n is 3, the range is k=2, up to 3 (so i=2 only).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n=1, k=1. The code will compute sum(a[0:1])=a[0], add to total, then the loop doesn't run. So average is a[0]/1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, k=2. Only one window. So initial sum is sum(a[0:2]), total is that sum. Average is sum/(2-2+1) = sum/1.\n\nAll seems correct.\n\nNow, let's consider the third sample input:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\na = [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nCompute initial sum: 1+2=3.\n\ntotal =3.\n\nThen for i=2 (a[2]=4): current_sum =3 +4 -1=6. total +=6 →9.\n\ni=3: a[3]=100000. current_sum =6 +100000 -2=100004. total +=100004 →100013.\n\ni=4: a[4]=123. current_sum =100004 +123 -4=100123. total +=100123 →200136.\n\ni=5: a[5]=456. current_sum =100123 +456 -100000= 579. total +=579 →200715.\n\ni=6: a[6]=789. current_sum =579 +789 -123= 1245. total +=1245 →201960.\n\ni=7: a[7]=1. current_sum =1245 +1 -456=790. total +=790 →202750.\n\nSo total is 202750. Divided by 7 gives approximately 28964.2857142857, which is what the sample shows.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, about the data types: in Python, all variables are handled as integers, but when dividing, it becomes a float. So the average is computed as a float.\n\nIn terms of outputting, we need to print it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: when the average is an integer, like 9, it should print 9.0000000000.\n\nTesting this in Python: print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(9)) gives '9.0000000000'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nI think that's all.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of k days, and we need to find the average of these sums over all weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a sequence of n integers representing sleep times for each day. We need to find the average of the sums of each consecutive k-day window. The number of such windows is n - k + 1.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: To efficiently compute the sum of each window, we use a sliding window approach. This allows us to update the sum in constant time after the initial setup.\n3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first k elements to initialize our current window sum.\n4. **Iterative Update**: For each subsequent element, update the current window sum by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the new element entering the window. Add each updated sum to the total sum.\n5. **Average Calculation**: After processing all windows, compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows (n - k + 1).\n6. **Precision Handling**: Ensure the result is printed with at least 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values for n, k, and the sequence of sleep times.\n- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first k elements is computed to initialize the sliding window.\n- **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent element, the current window sum is updated by adding the new element and subtracting the element that is leaving the window.
