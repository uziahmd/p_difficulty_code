His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Vasya's teacher needs to find his best and worst possible ranks based on the sum of points from two tours. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the input gives me n participants and a minimum x that Vasya got. Then two lists: the first tour points for each participant and the second tour points. But these are given in arbitrary order, so I don't know which is which. My task is to figure out what's the best possible rank Vasya could have and the worst possible.\n\nHmm. The key is that each participant has a sum of their first and second tour points. The ranking is based on this sum, but if sums are equal, the jury can assign places as they like. So for the best case, we want as few people as possible having a higher sum than Vasya. For the worst case, as many as possible.\n\nWait, but how do I model this? Because the first and second tour points are given without names, so I don't know which a_i and b_j belong to the same person. Oh right! Because each participant participated in both tours. So for each participant, their total is a_p + b_q, but a and b are not ordered.\n\nWait no, actually, the a list and b list are the points of all participants for the first and second tour, respectively. So each participant has one a and one b. So for example, if a is [1,2], b is [3,4], then the two participants have a1=1, b1=3 (sum 4) and a2=2, b2=4 (sum 6). So the way to pair them correctly is important.\n\nBut the problem is that the a and b are given in arbitrary order, so the pairing isn't known. So for each possible pairing, we can compute the sum for each participant, then compute the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya.\n\nBut wait, since the a and b are given in any order, the actual pairings can vary. So the approach is to find, among all possible valid pairings, the best and worst possible positions Vasya can achieve.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 105, which is manageable. But trying all possible pairings would be O(n!) which is impossible for n=105. So that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, so I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what determines the sum for each participant. Each participant's a and b are fixed, but in some order. So for each participant i, their a is from the a list, and their b is from the b list. But the lists are not ordered, so each a can be paired with any b, but each must be used exactly once.\n\nSo the problem is similar to matching two arrays into pairs such that each element from a is matched to one from b, and then each participant's sum is a_i + b_j, where each i and j are used exactly once.\n\nThe goal is, for each possible such pairing, determine the minimal and maximal possible rank of Vasya's sum, given that his sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists a pairing where the sum is >=x, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible valid pairings of a and b elements (each a and b used once).\n\n2. For each such pairing, compute the sum for each participant.\n\n3. Then, determine what is the best and worst possible rank of Vasya's sum in this scenario.\n\nWait, but step 1 is impossible for n=105. It's computationally infeasible. So we need another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each participant, the sum is a_p + b_q, where p and q are indices in a and b, but each index is used once.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each a and each b is used exactly once. So for each i in 0..n-1, a[i] is paired with b[j], and each j is used once.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to finding a permutation σ of 0..n-1, such that the sum for each i is a[i] + b[σ(i)]. Then, for each such σ, compute the possible ranks of Vasya's sum.\n\nBut enumerating all possible permutations is impossible.\n\nSo we need a way to find, across all possible permutations σ, the minimal and maximal possible ranks for Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, but maybe instead of considering all possible pairings, we can model the problem differently.\n\nLet me think about the sum S_v for Vasya. He has a sum s = a_v + b_v, but in reality, the a and b are permuted. So in any pairing, s is a particular a plus a particular b, but how does that affect others?\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to consider that for each possible v (the participant who has sum >=x), what is the minimal and maximal number of people who can have a sum higher than s, or equal to s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: To find the best possible rank for Vasya, we can arrange the pairings such that as few other participants as possible have a sum higher than s. Similarly, for the worst case, arrange it so that as many as possible have a sum higher than s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for the best case, we want to maximize the number of participants whose sum is less than s, and minimize those equal or higher.\n\nWait, but the pairing is fixed. So perhaps, for each possible participant, we can calculate what their sum could be, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nWait, perhaps let's think about Vasya's sum as a certain value, and then for each possible pairing, see how many participants have a sum higher than s, which determines his rank.\n\nBut again, how to find this without enumerating all pairings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible candidate for Vasya's sum s, which is a_i + b_j, find the minimal and maximal possible rank when choosing s as the sum.\n\nWait, but Vasya's sum s can be any of the possible a_i + b_j, but the pairing is such that each a and b is used exactly once. So s is fixed once the pairing is chosen.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution is to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and then as many participants as possible have lower sums, or as low as possible.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently.\n\nEach participant's sum is a_i + b_{σ(i)}, where σ is a permutation.\n\nFor each possible σ, compute the sum for each participant, then determine Vasya's rank.\n\nBut since σ can be any permutation, it's impossible to try all of them.\n\nSo perhaps, the way to approach this is to find, for each possible a_i and b_j pair, whether including that as Vasya's sum would allow for a certain arrangement of the other sums to maximize/minimize his rank.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe need to find, for all possible pairings σ, the minimal and maximal possible rank of Vasya's sum in that pairing.\n\nBut since we can't iterate through all σ, perhaps we can model the constraints for the best and worst cases.\n\nSo for the best case:\n\nWe need to arrange the pairing such that Vasya's sum is as large as possible, and as many participants as possible have smaller sums.\n\nWait, but how to arrange that.\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can make Vasya's sum as large as possible, and as many other participants' sums as small as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst rank, we can make his sum as small as possible, and as many others as large as possible.\n\nWait, but the sum is fixed by the pairing.\n\nSo perhaps, for the best possible rank:\n\nWe can choose Vasya's sum to be the maximum possible, then arrange the rest to have as few as possible higher sums.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible sum is when a_i and b_j are the largest possible.\n\nSo perhaps, for the best case, choose Vasya's sum as the maximum possible (i.e., a_max + b_max). Then, the rest of the participants will have sums as small as possible.\n\nWait, but that may not always work because sometimes other combinations could yield better arrangements.\n\nWait, for example, suppose that a = [5, 5], b = [5,5]. So each pair sums to 10. Then, regardless of the pairing, all participants have sum 10, so Vasya can be first or last.\n\nWhich brings me back to the sample input.\n\nSo, perhaps for the best case, we need to choose Vasya's sum as the maximum possible, and then arrange the other sums in such a way that as few as possible are higher than or equal to his sum.\n\nWait, but for the best case, we want to have as few participants as possible with sum >= Vasya's sum.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case, as many as possible.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nPerhaps the approach is:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\n- Choose Vasya's sum to be as high as possible. Then, for the remaining participants, pair the a's and b's in a way that their sums are as low as possible, thus minimizing the number of participants with sum >= Vasya's sum.\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible sum for Vasya.\n\nWait, the maximum possible sum he can have is when he takes the maximum a and maximum b. Because a_i + b_j is maximized when both are as big as possible.\n\nSimilarly, the minimal possible sum he can have is when he takes the smallest a and b.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, Vasya's sum is a_i + b_j, and it must be >=x.\n\nSo, for the best case, perhaps we should choose Vasya's sum as the maximum possible, which is a_max + b_max.\n\nThen, in the best case, the rest of the participants are arranged to have as few as possible sums >= Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, but if someone else also has a_max + b_max, then Vasya's sum is tied with them, so the jury could place him higher or lower.\n\nBut for the best case, we want the minimal possible rank, so we'd want as few participants as possible to have sum >= Vasya's sum.\n\nSo, perhaps the best case is when Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and no one else has a sum higher than his.\n\nWait, but how can that be achieved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is 1, but that depends on the data.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=6, x=2\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo all participants have sum 2. So regardless of the pairing, everyone has sum 2. So the best rank is 1 (if placed first), worst is 6.\n\nSo in that case, the answer is 1 and 6.\n\nSo for the best case, perhaps the minimal possible rank is 1, but only if it's possible to arrange the pairing so that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and no one else has a higher sum.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible number of participants that have sum < s, where s is Vasya's sum.\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the best case can be found as follows:\n\nFind the maximum possible sum s that Vasya can have (s = a_i + b_j, for some i,j, and s >=x). Then, for this s, count how many participants can have sum <= s -1. The minimal number of participants with sum >=s is the number of a's and b's that cannot form a sum < s.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the approach.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case, find the minimal possible sum s that Vasya can have (s >=x), and then count how many participants can have sum > s. The worst rank would be 1 plus that count.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe want s to be as large as possible. So the best possible s is the maximum of all possible a_i + b_j, provided that s >=x. Then, for this s, we want as few participants as possible to have a sum >=s.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nWait, for s being the maximum possible, the number of participants with sum >=s is 1 (only Vasya) because no one else can have a sum larger than s.\n\nWait, but what if someone else also has a sum equal to s.\n\nIn that case, the best possible rank is 1 if Vasya can be placed first. But if others have the same sum, the jury can place him anywhere among them.\n\nWait, but for the best possible rank, we can assume that he is placed first.\n\nSo, the minimal possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when all sums are 2, the best rank is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps for the best case, the minimal possible rank is 1, but only if s is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple ways to reach s.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed as follows:\n\nCompute for all possible s (possible sums) that are >=x.\n\nFor each s, compute the minimal number of participants that must have a sum >=s.\n\nThen, the best possible rank is 1 + (number of participants who cannot have sum < s).\n\nWait, no. Or perhaps, for each s, the minimal number of participants that can have sum >=s is determined, and thus the best possible rank is that number.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to find for each s the minimal number of participants that can have sum >=s.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to compute the best rank is:\n\nFor each possible s (>=x), the best possible rank is the number of participants that have a sum strictly greater than s, plus 1.\n\nBecause in the best case arrangement, Vasya's sum is s, and all others have sum <=s, so his rank is 1 plus the number of participants with sum >s.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible s, and then find the minimal possible rank.\n\nWait, but perhaps the best possible rank is 1, but only if s is the maximum possible, and no one else has a sum equal to s.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: To find the best possible rank, we can choose s as the maximum possible, and then arrange the pairings so that as few as possible participants have sum >=s. Since s is the maximum possible, no one else can have sum greater than s. But if others have sum equal to s, then the rank can be 1 if we're placed first.\n\nSo for the best case:\n\nCompute the maximum possible s (max(a_i + b_j) for all i,j), and ensure that s >=x. Then, the best rank is 1, because we can arrange the others to have sum <=s, but if others also have s, the jury can place Vasya first.\n\nWait, but that depends on how many participants have sum equal to s.\n\nWait, for example, if after choosing s as the maximum, there are k participants (including Vasya) with sum s. Then, the best possible rank is 1, because in the jury's choice, Vasya can be placed first.\n\nSo for the best case, the best possible rank is 1 if s is the maximum possible.\n\nBut wait, what if another participant also has s as their sum. Then, even in the best case, the rank can't be 1; it's 1, but in the case of ties, the jury can choose to place Vasya first.\n\nYes, according to the note in the problem statement: if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can assign places as they like. So in the best case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, for the best case, the answer is 1, provided that Vasya can have a sum equal to the maximum possible sum.\n\nWait, but what if there's a higher sum possible for others? No, because we're taking the maximum possible s.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1 if the maximum possible s is >=x.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that it's guaranteed that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is >=x. So, as long as the maximum possible sum is >=x, the best rank is 1.\n\nSo, in code, for the best case, it's always 1 if the maximum possible sum is >=x. Otherwise, it's impossible, but the problem statement says it's guaranteed.\n\nSo, the best case is 1.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Let's think of another example.\n\nSuppose n=2, x=3.\n\na = [3, 3]\n\nb = [3, 3]\n\nSo, each possible pairing gives sum 6 for both participants. So, the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can choose to put Vasya first.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=3, x=5.\n\na = [5, 5, 0]\n\nb = [5, 0, 5]\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nIf Vasya has a1=5, b1=5: sum 10.\n\nOthers: a2=5 + b2=0=5, a3=0 + b3=5=5.\n\nIn this case, three participants: Vasya has 10, others have 5. So best rank is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=3, x=5.\n\na = [5, 5, 5]\n\nb = [5, 5,5]\n\nAll possible pairings give each participant sum 10. So best rank is 1.\n\nAnother example: n=3, x=4.\n\na = [2, 2, 2]\n\nb = [2, 2, 2]\n\nEach sum is 4. So best rank is 1.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, what if there's another participant who has a higher sum than Vasya's s. Then, the best rank is not 1.\n\nWait, but how can that happen? Because s was chosen as the maximum possible.\n\nNo, because if s is the maximum possible, then no one else can have a sum higher than s. So, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nThus, for the best case, the answer is always 1.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is 1 and 5.\n\nWait, but in that sample, the a and b are such that all participants have sum 2, so the best is 1, worst is 5.\n\nYes, so the initial reasoning seems correct.\n\nSo, now for the worst case.\n\nThe worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible, but still >=x.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nIn the worst case, we want as many participants as possible to have a sum higher than s.\n\nSo, for the worst possible rank, we need to choose s as small as possible (but >=x), and arrange the pairings such that as many participants as possible have sum >s.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is the number of participants who have sum > s, plus 1.\n\nBut how to find s and the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFind the minimal possible s that Vasya can have (s >=x), and then find the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s.\n\nThe worst rank is 1 + that maximum number.\n\nSo, how to find s and that maximum.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAn alternative idea: For each possible s (>=x), compute the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >s when paired appropriately. Then, the worst rank is 1 + that maximum.\n\nBut how to compute this for each s.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given s, the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s is determined by how many a_i and b_j pairs can sum to more than s.\n\nWait, but the pairing has to be such that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nWait, for a given s, the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s is the maximum possible over all possible pairings of the number of participants with a_i + b_j > s.\n\nSo, for each s, compute the maximum number of pairs (i,j) where a_i + b_j >s, and each a and b is used once.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum.\n\nThis sounds similar to a bipartite matching problem. We can model the problem as a bipartite graph where edges connect a_i to b_j if a_i + b_j > s. Then, the maximum number of edges we can select is the maximum matching in this graph.\n\nWait, yes. Because each a and b can be used only once, so it's a bipartite graph where each a and b can be matched once. The maximum number of edges (i,j) where a_i +b_j> s is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s.\n\nSo, for a given s, the maximum number of participants with sum>s is the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nBut how to choose s.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each possible s (all possible a_i + b_j >=x), compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum> s.\n\n2. The worst possible rank is 1 + maximum number from step 1.\n\nBut how to iterate over all possible s.\n\nWait, but s can be any a_i + b_j, but it must be >=x.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Enumerate all possible s values that can be formed by a_i + b_j, and are >=x.\n\n- For each such s, compute the maximum number of pairs (i,j) where a_i + b_j >s. This is done via maximum bipartite matching.\n\n- Take the maximum of these numbers across all s.\n\n- The worst rank is 1 plus this maximum.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is 1 plus the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >s, for s in all possible a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nBut wait, for each s, we can compute the maximum possible number of participants with sum>s. The worst case is when this maximum is as large as possible.\n\nSo, to find the worst case, we need to find the s that minimizes the number of participants with sum>s, but wait no. Wait, no, we need to find the s that allows for the maximum number of participants to have sum>s.\n\nWait, no, because for each s, the maximum number of participants that can have sum>s is the maximum possible for that s. So, we need to find the maximum of these maximums across all possible s.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is 1 plus the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum>s, across all s.\n\nSo, the algorithm becomes:\n\n- Compute all possible s values (a_i + b_j) that are >=x.\n\n- For each s in this list:\n\n   - Create a bipartite graph where an edge exists between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j >s.\n\n   - Compute the maximum matching in this graph. The size is the maximum number of participants that can have sum>s.\n\n- Find the maximum of these sizes across all s.\n\n- The worst possible rank is this maximum plus 1.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible s candidates.\n\n2. For each s, compute the maximum possible number of participants with sum>s.\n\n3. The worst rank is 1 plus the maximum from step 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nNow, the question is, how to efficiently generate s and compute the maximum matching for each s.\n\nBut for n up to 105, and s up to 210, this is manageable.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, read n, x.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nRead b as list of integers.\n\nGenerate all possible s = a[i] + b[j], for i, j in 0..n-1.\n\nFilter s to be >=x.\n\nCollect unique s values.\n\nSort them in increasing order.\n\nFor each s in this list:\n\n   create a bipartite graph where edge between a[i] and b[j] exists iff a[i]+b[j] > s.\n\n   compute the maximum bipartite matching.\n\n   record the maximum size.\n\nThen, the worst_rank is 1 + maximum size.\n\nWait, but in the code, how to represent the bipartite graph.\n\nEach a[i] is on the left, each b[j] is on the right.\n\nWe need to find the maximum matching where a[i] + b[j] > s.\n\nWait, but for each a[i], which b[j] can be connected.\n\nSo, for each a_i, we can collect all b_j where a_i + b_j > s.\n\nThis forms the adjacency list for the bipartite graph.\n\nThe maximum bipartite matching is the maximum number of edges we can select, such that each a and b is used once.\n\nThe maximum matching can be found using standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp, which is efficient for bipartite graphs.\n\nBut for n=105, Hopcroft-Karp is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each s in the sorted list of s_candidates:\n\n   create a bipartite graph as described.\n\n   compute the maximum matching.\n\n   track the maximum matching size.\n\nFinally, the worst rank is 1 + maximum matching.\n\nBut wait, how to handle multiple s candidates.\n\nWait, perhaps to find the maximum possible number of participants with sum>s, we need to consider all possible s, including all possible a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nBut for each s, the maximum possible is different.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n6 2\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nWait, no, the sample input in the problem description is:\n\nIn the second test case, the a array is [4,3,5,6,4,4], and the b array is [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\nThe second line contains '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4'.\n\nWait, no, the original sample input is:\n\nIn the first sample, the input is:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nAnd output is 1 5.\n\nIn the second sample, the input is:\n\n['6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\nWait, perhaps the a is [4,3,5,6,4,4] and b is [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nBut in any case, for each s in the possible sums >=x=2, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s.\n\nIn the sample, the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5.\n\nWait, but according to our approach, the worst case is computed as follows.\n\nWe need to find the s that allows the maximum number of participants to have sum >s.\n\nSo, perhaps for s=6, which is the minimal possible s >=x=2, what is the maximum number of participants that can have sum>6.\n\nWait, perhaps for s=6, a_i +b_j>6.\n\nLooking at a and b:\n\na has elements 4,3,5,6,4,4.\n\nb has 8,6,0,4,3,4.\n\nFor s=6, a_i +b_j>6.\n\nCheck all possible pairs.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each a_i and b_j, check if a_i +b_j>6.\n\nThen, the bipartition is a and b, and edges are between a_i and b_j where a_i +b_j>6.\n\nWe need to find the maximum matching in this bipartition.\n\nOnce we have the maximum matching, that is the maximum number of participants that can have sum>6.\n\nThen, for each s, we compute this, and take the maximum.\n\nSo, for example, when s=6, the maximum matching is 5.\n\nSo the worst rank is 6.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 5.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, the sample input in the problem is:\n\nThe second test case:\n\nInput:\n6 7\n4 3 5 6 4 4\n8 6 0 4 3 4\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement's example.\n\nIn the second test case:\n\nAfter the first tour, the a array is [4,3,5,6,4,4], and the second tour b array is [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nThe participants are all possible pairs, but the pairing is done such that each a is matched with a b.\n\nIn the best case, Vasya can have sum 12 (8+4), and others have lower sums.\n\nIn the worst case, Vasya has sum 4+3=7, and others have higher sums.\n\nWait, but in the worst case, how many participants have sum >7.\n\nSo, let's compute for s=7.\n\nWhich participants can have sum>7.\n\na_i + b_j>7.\n\nLooking at a and b:\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nPossible pairs:\n\na=4 can be paired with b=8: 12>7 → yes.\n\na=4 can be paired with 6: 10>7 → yes.\n\na=4 can be paired with 0:4→ no.\n\na=4 can be paired with 4:8>7 → yes.\n\na=3 can be paired with 8:11>7 → yes.\n\na=3 paired with 6:9>7 → yes.\n\na=3 paired with 0:3→ no.\n\na=3 paired with 4:7→ no.\n\na=5 paired with 8:13>7 → yes.\n\na=5 paired with 6:11>7 → yes.\n\na=5 paired with 0:5→ no.\n\na=5 paired with4:9>7 → yes.\n\na=6 paired with8:14>7 → yes.\n\na=6 paired with6:12>7 → yes.\n\na=6 paired with0:6→ no.\n\na=6 paired with4:10>7 → yes.\n\nSo, for each a_i, the possible b_j's that can form a sum>7:\n\na=4: b=8,6,4 → 3 options.\n\na=3: b=8,6 → 2 options.\n\na=5: b=8,6,4 →3 options.\n\na=6: b=8,6,4 →3 options.\n\nSo, the bipartition graph is as follows:\n\nLeft nodes (a): 4,3,5,6,4,4.\n\nRight nodes (b):8,6,0,4,3,4.\n\nEdges:\n\na=4 connects to b=8,6,4.\n\na=3 connects to b=8,6.\n\na=5 connects to b=8,6,4.\n\na=6 connects to b=8,6,4.\n\na=4 (second occurrence) connects to b=8,6,4.\n\na=4 (third occurrence) connects to b=8,6,4.\n\nNow, the maximum bipartite matching here.\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of edges that can be selected without overlapping.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible?\n\nLet's see.\n\nEach a can be matched to a unique b.\n\nSo:\n\na1 (4) →8.\n\na2 (3) →6.\n\na3 (5) →4.\n\na4 (6) →4 is already taken, so maybe 4 is used.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should model this properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum matching is 5.\n\nBecause, perhaps, it's possible to match 5 a's to 5 b's.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum matching is 5, which would mean that 5 participants can have sum>7, so the worst rank is 6.\n\nBut the sample output says 5.\n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's worst case is when Vasya has sum 7, and five participants have sum>7, leading to a rank of 6. But the sample output is 5.\n\nWait, the sample output for the second test case is '1 5', meaning best is 1, worst is 5.\n\nSo perhaps, in the worst case, the maximum number of participants with sum>7 is 4.\n\nSo, the worst rank is 5.\n\nHmm, perhaps my earlier analysis was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nLet me try to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum>7.\n\nWe can model this as a bipartite graph.\n\nEach a_i can be connected to b_j if a_i + b_j >7.\n\nThe maximum matching in this graph is the maximum number of participants that can have sum>7.\n\nSo, let's list all possible a_i and b_j:\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nSo, for each a_i:\n\na=4 can connect to b=8,6,4 → indexes 0,1,3.\n\na=3 can connect to b=8,6 → indexes 0,1.\n\na=5 can connect to b=8,6,4 → indexes 0,1,3.\n\na=6 can connect to b=8,6,4 → indexes 0,1,3.\n\na=4 (second) → same as first a=4.\n\na=4 (third) → same.\n\nSo, the bipartition graph is as follows:\n\nLeft nodes: 4,3,5,6,4,4.\n\nRight nodes:8,6,0,4,3,4.\n\nEdges:\n\n4 →8,6,4.\n\n3 →8,6.\n\n5 →8,6,4.\n\n6 →8,6,4.\n\n4 →8,6,4.\n\n4 →8,6,4.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum matching.\n\nWe can use the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for this.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of possible matches.\n\nLet's see:\n\nWe can match:\n\na1 (4) →8.\n\na2 (3) →6.\n\na3 (5) →4.\n\na4 (6) →4.\n\na5 (4) → ?\n\nWait, but a5 (4) can connect to 8,6,4.\n\nBut 8 is already matched to a1.\n\n6 is matched to a2.\n\n4 is matched to a3 and a4.\n\nSo, a5 can only connect to 4, but it's already taken by a4.\n\nSo, a5 can't connect to anything else.\n\nSame with a6 (4) can't connect to 8,6,4, as they are already taken.\n\nSo, the maximum matching is 4.\n\nThus, the maximum number of participants that can have sum>7 is 4.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute all possible s >=x.\n\nFor each s, compute the maximum bipartite matching where a_i +b_j> s.\n\nThe worst rank is 1 + the maximum of these maximum matchings.\n\nThus, the code steps are:\n\n1. Read n, x.\n\n2. Read a and b.\n\n3. Compute all possible s = a[i] + b[j], for i in 0..n-1, j in 0..n-1.\n\n4. Collect all unique s that are >=x, and sort them in increasing order.\n\n5. For each s in this list:\n\n   a. For each a_i, collect all b_j where a_i + b_j > s.\n\n   b. Build the bipartite graph.\n\n   c. Compute the maximum bipartite matching.\n\n   d. Record the maximum matching size.\n\n6. The worst rank is 1 + the maximum of these sizes.\n\n7. The best rank is always 1.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the main challenge is implementing the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for bipartite matching.\n\nSo, in Python, we can represent the bipartition as a dictionary where each a_i (left node) is connected to the right nodes (b_j) that satisfy a_i +b_j> s.\n\nThen, for each s, build this graph, compute the maximum matching, and keep track of the maximum.\n\nNow, let's proceed to write the code.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, read a and b.\n\nThen, generate all possible s.\n\nBut wait, for n=105, the number of possible s is 105*105= 11025, which is manageable.\n\nBut to avoid duplicates, we can collect them in a set.\n\nOnce s_candidates are generated, sorted in increasing order.\n\nThen, for each s in s_candidates:\n\n   create the bipartition graph.\n\n   compute the maximum matching.\n\n   update the maximum_matching.\n\nFinally, the worst rank is 1 + max_matching.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement Hopcroft-Karp.\n\nBut for each s, the graph is built as per the condition.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nHere's the code outline",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves calculating the maximum and minimum possible ranks by considering all possible pairings of participants' scores from the two tours.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Each participant's score is given for both tours, but the scores are provided in arbitrary order.\n   - We need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve based on the sum of his scores from both tours.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Best Rank**: This is determined by finding the maximum possible sum Vasya can have, which will always be 1 if it is the highest sum.\n   - **Worst Rank**: This is determined by finding the smallest possible sum Vasya can have (still meeting the minimum requirement) and then calculating how many participants can have a higher sum than this.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - **Generate Possible Sums**: Compute all possible sums of scores from the two tours.\n   - **Bipartite Graph Matching**: For each possible sum, use a bipartite graph to model the problem of finding the maximum number of participants who can have a higher sum than Vasya's current sum.\n   - **Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm**: Use this algorithm to find the maximum matching in the bipartite graph, which helps determine the maximum number of participants with higher sums.\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations**:\n   - The approach efficiently handles the problem constraints using bipartite graph matching, ensuring that the solution is feasible even for the upper limits of the input size.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Generate all possible s values (a[i] + b[j]) >= x\n    s_candidates = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            s = a[i] + b[j]\n            if s >= x:\n                s_candidates.add(s)\n    s_list = sorted(s_candidates)\n    \n    # Hopcroft-Karp implementation for bipartite matching\n    def hopcroft_karp(graph, U, V):\n        pair_U = [-1] * U\n        pair_V = [-1] * V\n        dist = [0] * U\n        \n        def bfs():\n            queue = deque()\n            for u in range(U):\n                if pair_U[u] == -1:\n                    dist[u] = 0\n                    queue.append(u)\n                else:\n                    dist[u] = float('inf')\n            dist_null = float('inf')\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                if dist[u] < dist_null:\n                    for v in graph[u]:\n                        if pair_V[v] == -1:\n                            dist_null = dist[u] + 1\n                        elif dist[pair_V[v]] == float('inf'):\n                            dist[pair_V[v]] = dist[u] + 1\n                            queue.append(pair_V[v])\n            return dist_null != float('inf')\n        \n        def dfs(u):\n            for v in graph[u]:\n                if pair_V[v] == -1 or (dist[pair_V[v]] == dist[u] + 1 and dfs(pair_V[v])):\n                    pair_U[u] = v\n                    pair_V[v] = u\n                    return True\n            dist[u] = float('inf')\n            return False\n        \n        result = 0\n        while bfs():\n            for u in range(U):\n                if pair_U[u] == -1:\n                    if dfs(u):\n                        result += 1\n        return result\n    \n    max_matching = 0\n    for s in s_list:\n        # Create bipartite graph: left nodes are a indices, right nodes are b indices\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            ai = a[i]\n            for j in range(n):\n                bj = b[j]\n                if ai + bj > s:\n                    graph[i].append(j)\n        \n        # Number of left nodes (all a) is n, right nodes (all b) is n\n        # Since each node is unique, we can represent them as 0..n-1\n        # Using Hopcroft-Karp for maximum matching\n        U = n\n        V = n\n        result = hopcroft_karp(graph, U, V)\n        if result > max_matching:\n            max_matching = result\n    \n    best_rank = 1\n    worst_rank = max_matching + 1\n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of participants, the minimum score Vasya achieved, and the scores from both tours.\n2. **Generating Possible Sums**: It generates all possible sums of scores from the two tours that meet or exceed the minimum score requirement.\n3. **Bipartite Graph Construction**: For each possible sum, it constructs a bipartite graph where edges connect participants whose scores sum to more than the current sum being considered.\n4. **Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to find the maximum matching in the bipartite graph, which helps determine the maximum number of participants who can have a higher sum than Vasya's current sum.\n5. **Calculating Ranks**: The best rank is always 1, and the worst rank is determined by the maximum number of participants found in the bipartite matching plus one.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the best and worst possible ranks by leveraging bipartite graph matching and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm.",
