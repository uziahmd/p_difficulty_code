Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. But since we're trying to minimize the number, we want each new card to contribute as much as possible towards balancing the sum.\n\nLet me think: the initial sum is S = sum of the found cards. The target is 0, so the required sum from the additional cards is -S.\n\nEach additional card can add a value between -x and x. To reach the required sum with as few cards as possible, we should maximize each card's contribution. That means using the largest possible values in absolute terms.\n\nSo, for example, if the required sum is 5 and x is 3, then the minimal number of cards would be 2: 3 + 2.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, no, because each card can only be up to x. So the maximum per card is x, but also the minimum is -x. So to cover a positive deficit, we can use x each time until we reach or exceed the required sum.\n\nBut first, let's calculate the current sum S of the found cards.\n\nThen, the required additional sum is T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero, then no more cards are needed.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the minimal k such that k * x >= |T|.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because each card can contribute up to x towards the deficit. So the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because if T is positive, each new card can add up to x. So the minimal k is ceil(T / x), but only if T is positive. Similarly, if T is negative, each new card can subtract at most x, so the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nWait, no. Let's see: suppose T is 4 and x is 3. Then 3 + 1 is not allowed because each new card can't exceed x. Wait no, each card can be any value between -x and x, but to maximize the contribution towards T, we can choose x each time.\n\nWait, wait. No, the new cards can be any value in the range. So for the required sum T, the minimal number of cards is the minimal k such that T can be achieved by adding k numbers each between -x and x.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S.\n3. If T is zero, return 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal k where k is the smallest integer such that k * x >= |T|. Because each card can contribute up to x (or as little as needed, but to minimize k, we take the maximum possible per step).\n   Wait, no. Because each card can be any value, but to minimize the number of cards, you need to make each one contribute as much as possible. So for T positive, each card contributes x as much as possible. For T negative, each card contributes -x as much as possible.\n\nSo, for T=5 and x=3: 3+2 is not allowed because 2 is less than 3. Oh wait, no—each new card can be any number, including fractions? Wait no, no. Each card's number is an integer. So for T=5 and x=3, the maximum per card is 3, so two cards (3+2 isn't allowed because 2 is less than 3; but wait, 3+2 is okay because each card can be 2, but 2 is <=x. Wait, but 2 is less than x, which is 3. So why not take 3+2? Or wait, no, because 2 is allowed as a card.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently: to get the minimal k, regardless of whether T is positive or negative, the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| divided by x. Because each card can contribute up to x towards the deficit. So for T=5 and x=3: 5/3 is ~1.666, so we need 2 cards. Because 3*1=3 <5, so 2 cards: 3+2=5, but wait, 2 is within x.\n\nAlternatively, for T=6 and x=3: 2 cards of 3 each.\n\nFor T=7 and x=3: 3 cards (3+3+1=7, but 1 is within x, so that's allowed.)\n\nWait, but in that case, why not 3 cards? Because 3*3=9 >=7.\n\nSo, in general, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, but wait, what about when T is negative?\n\nLike T = -4, x=3.\n\nWe can have two cards: -3 and -1. But that's two cards. Or perhaps one card of -3 is enough, but wait, T is -4. So, -3 is insufficient. So to get T=-4, you need two cards: -3 + (-1) =-4, but each card can be up to x in absolute value. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the absolute value.\n\nSo, the minimal k is the ceiling of (|T|) / x.\n\nYes, because each card can contribute up to x towards the deficit, whether positive or negative.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute the sum S of the found cards.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute absolute_T = abs(T)\n\nCompute minimal k = ceil(absolute_T / x)\n\nOutput k.\n\nWait, but let's test with examples.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S is (-1)+1+2=2.\n\nT = -2.\n\nAbsolute T is 2.\n\nx is 2.\n\nSo k= 2/2=1, so output 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4.\n\nT is 4.\n\nx is 3.\n\n4/3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2.\n\nSo output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nWhat if T is 0? Then output 0.\n\nWhat if T is 5, x is 3: 5/3 is ~1.666, so 2.\n\nAnother test: T=3, x=3: 1.\n\nT=4, x=3: 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: T=0, output 0.\n\nAnother case: T=1, x=1: 1.\n\nSo yes, seems correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n\n2. Read the list of n integers.\n\n3. Compute sum S.\n\n4. T = -S.\n\n5. If T is 0: print 0.\n\n6. Else:\n\n   a. Compute absolute_T = abs(T)\n\n   b. Compute k = (absolute_T + x -1 ) // x   --> this is equivalent to ceiling division.\n\n   c. Print k.\n\nSo, now the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the first line: n and x.\n\nThen read the second line: list of n integers.\n\nSum them.\n\nCompute T = -sum.\n\nIf T is zero: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nabs_t = abs(T)\n\nk = (abs_t + x -1) // x\n\nPrint(k)\n\nWait, but wait: in the second sample:\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3\n\nCards: -2, -2 → sum is -4 → T=4.\n\nabs_t =4.\n\n(4 +3-1) //3 → (6)//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: T=5, x=3: (5+3-1)/3=7//3=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, handle the input correctly.\n\nWait, the input is given as two lines: the first is two integers, n and x.\n\nThe second is a line with n space-separated integers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_cards = sum(cards)\n\nt = -sum_cards\n\nif t ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    k = (abs_t + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but what about when x is zero?\n\nWait, in the problem statement, x is given as ≥1.\n\nSo x can't be zero.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, x=2\n\ncards: -1,1,2 → sum is 2 → T=-2 → abs_t=2.\n\n(2 +2-1)//2 →3//2=1. Output 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3\n\ncards: -2,-2 → sum is -4 → T=4.\n\n(4+3-1)/3=6//3=2.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother test case: T=0 → output 0.\n\nAnother case: T=7, x=3 → 7/3 is 2.333 → ceil is 3.\n\n(7 +3-1)/3=9//3=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Like T=-5, x=3.\n\nabs_t is 5.\n\n(5+3-1)/3=7//3=2.\n\nSo 2 cards: each can be -3 → sum is -6, which is larger than -5. But that's acceptable because the required sum is -5, and the cards can have values up to x, so perhaps 3 and -2? But wait, no—each card can be any value between -x and x. So with two cards, can we achieve -5?\n\nYes: for example, -3 and -2, sum is -5. So two cards.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute the sum, find T, and then compute the minimal k as the ceiling of |T|/x.\n",
