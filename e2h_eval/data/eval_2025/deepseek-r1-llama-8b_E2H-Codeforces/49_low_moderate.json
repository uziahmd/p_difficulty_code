They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about restoring the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the information from some roads. Each road gives two numbers: the GCD and LCM of the two lawns it connects. My task is to determine if there's a possible arrangement of mushrooms that satisfies all these constraints and output it, or say it's impossible.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to model this. It seems like a graph problem where each node (lawn) has a value, and edges impose constraints between pairs of nodes. So, for each edge, the GCD of the two nodes' values must equal the given GCD, and the LCM must equal the given LCM.\n\nWait, but wait. The GCD and LCM are related in a specific way. For any two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So for each edge, the product of the given GCD and LCM must equal the product of the two nodes' values.\n\nSo for each edge, the equation is:\nGCD(e) * LCM(e) = x_u * x_v\n\nWhere x_u and x_v are the values at the two ends of the edge.\n\nThis looks like a system of equations with variables being the x_i's. But solving such a system can be tricky because the equations are multiplicative.\n\nWhat's the approach here? Maybe model each variable as its prime factors, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps represent the variables in terms of their divisors, considering that each equation imposes certain constraints.\n\nAnother thought: since the product of the two variables equals the product of the edge's GCD and LCM, maybe we can express each variable in terms of others.\n\nWait, but with multiple edges and variables, this could get complex. So perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is a multiple of some base variables, and then find a consistent assignment.\n\nLet me think about building a system where each variable is a multiple of some initial variables. Maybe using a Union-Find data structure with additional information, like keeping track of the relationships between the variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model each node's value as a product of primes raised to certain exponents, but that might be too involved.\n\nWait, another idea: each x_i can be represented as a product of primes. The constraints from the edges would then give us equations on the exponents of each prime in the two connected nodes.\n\nBut that's probably not feasible for arbitrary numbers, especially since the input can have up to 106, which isn't too big, but handling all possible primes in the factorization of each number could get complicated.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to model each x_i as a number, and for each edge, enforce that x_u * x_v = g * l, where g is the GCD and l is the LCM.\n\nWait, but when you have multiple edges involving the same nodes, these constraints must all be satisfied. So, for example, if node A is connected to B with a certain g1, l1, and also connected to C with g2, l2, then x_A * x_B = g1 * l1, x_A * x_C = g2 * l2, etc.\n\nThis forms a system of equations where the variables are the x_i's. Solving such a system requires that all the equations are compatible.\n\nBut how do we handle this in code?\n\nI think this is similar to systems of equations where variables are multiplied together, which can be tricky. One way to handle it is to represent each variable in terms of a base variable. Like, for each connected component, choose a root node and express all other variables in terms of the root's value.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we pick a root, say node R, then all other nodes can be expressed as multiples or factors based on the edges. Then, we can assign a value to R and compute the others accordingly, checking for consistency.\n\nSo, let's formalize this. For each connected component:\n\n- Choose a root node.\n- Express each other node's value as a function of the root's value.\n- Then, substitute into all the edges and see if they hold true. If any substitution leads to a contradiction, the system is impossible.\n\nBut how to represent the expressions for each node in terms of the root?\n\nWell, for each node u, let's say x_u = k_u * x_r, where x_r is the root's value. Then, for an edge (u, v), the equation becomes:\n\nk_u * x_r * k_v * x_r = g * l\n=> k_u * k_v * x_r^2 = g * l\n\nSo, k_u * k_v = (g * l) / x_r^2\n\nBut x_r is a variable, so perhaps we can",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to restore the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the given roads and their respective GCD and LCM values. If possible, we should output the arrangement; otherwise, we should indicate that it is impossible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Treat the lawns as nodes and the roads as edges in a graph. Each edge has constraints given by the GCD and LCM of the two nodes it connects.\n2. **Constraints Analysis**: For each edge (u, v), the product of the values at u and v must equal the product of the given GCD and LCM. This can be expressed as `x_u * x_v = gcd(u, v) * lcm(u, v)`.\n3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use this structure to manage connected components. For each component, we will determine if the constraints can be satisfied.\n4. **Component-Wise Constraints Check**: For each connected component, choose a root node and express other nodes' values in terms of the root's value. Check if all constraints within the component are satisfied.\n5. **Cycle Detection**: Ensure there are no cycles that violate the constraints. If any inconsistency is found, the arrangement is impossible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n
