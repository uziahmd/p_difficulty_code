Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if the pile of letters found in the morning can be used to exactly form both the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters left. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines: guest, host, and pile.\n2. Check if the combined letters of guest and host equal exactly the letters in the pile.\n3. If yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nHmm. So how to approach this? Well, I think the way is to count the frequency of each character in the guest and host names, combine those counts, and then check if the pile's counts match exactly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Concatenate guest and host strings into one.\n- Count the occurrences of each character in this concatenated string.\n- Do the same for the pile string.\n- Compare the two counts. If they are identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nBut wait, what about case sensitivity? Oh, the problem states that all lines are uppercase letters, so no issues there.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python. I can use the collections.Counter class for counting characters. But since the input lines are read as strings, I'll need to process them correctly.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nRead guest = input().strip()\nRead host = input().strip()\nRead pile = input().strip()\n\nThen, concatenate guest and host into a single string, say combined = guest + host.\n\nThen create a Counter for combined and a Counter for pile.\n\nIf the two Counters are equal, print \"YES\"; else, \"NO\".\n\nWait, but what about empty strings? The problem says that each line is not empty, so we don't have to handle that case.\n\nWhat about when the lengths don't match? For example, if the combined length is different from pile's length, we can immediately return NO.\n\nSo first, check len(combined) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n\nThat's an optimization because creating the Counters would be unnecessary otherwise.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead the three lines.\n\nCheck if (guest + host) has the same length as pile. If not, print NO.\n\nElse, create Counters for guest+host and pile.\n\nCompare the Counters. If equal, print YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but in Python, the order of the keys in Counter doesn't matter when comparing. So using Counter's equality should work.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined_length = len(guest) + len(host)\npile_length = len(pile)\n\nif combined_length != pile_length:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    from collections import Counter\n    combined_count = Counter(guest + host)\n    pile_count = Counter(pile)\n    if combined_count == pile_count:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but importing inside the else clause might not be allowed. Or perhaps better to import at the top. Let me adjust.\n\nYes, it's better to import at the top. So, the code structure would be:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but is it possible that the combined length equals the pile's length but the counts differ? Yes, for example, if the total number of letters is the same but some letters are missing and others are extra.\n\nSo, the code correctly checks the counts.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined guest and host: 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' ?\n\nWait, let's compute the lengths.\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS is 9 letters.\nHost: DEDMOROZ is 8 letters. So combined is 17 letters.\n\nPile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'? Let me count: the third line is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" which is 17 letters.\n\nSo their lengths match.\n\nThen, the combined is guest + host: 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'\n\nWait, actually, guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', so combined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' which is 9 +8=17 letters. Pile is 17 letters as well.\n\nSo the counts must match.\n\nIn the sample, the output is YES.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nInput:\n['P",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be used to exactly form both the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters left.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Concatenation Check**: Combine the guest's name and the host's name into a single string and check if its length matches the length of the pile. If not, print \"NO\".\n3. **Character Counting**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each character in the combined guest and host string and compare it with the counter of the pile string. If both counters match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact permutation possibility by leveraging character frequency counts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines of input representing the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Length Check**: It first checks if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. This is an initial check to quickly determine if it's impossible to form the names from the pile.\n- **Character Count Comparison**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, the code counts the occurrences of each character in both the combined guest-host string and the pile. If these counts match, it confirms that the pile can be rearranged to form both names exactly.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by ensuring all characters are accounted for exactly once, making it both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
