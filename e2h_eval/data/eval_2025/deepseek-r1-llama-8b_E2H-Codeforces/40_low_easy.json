The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) that satisfy two conditions: p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than in q. We need to compute this modulo mod, which can be up to 1e9.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to understand what a permutation pair is. A permutation is just an arrangement of all numbers from 1 to n in some order. For each pair (p, q), both are permutations, and we have two conditions.\n\nLet me break down the conditions:\n\n1. Lexicographical order: p < q. So when comparing element by element, the first position where they differ must have p's element smaller than q's.\n2. Inversion count: inv(p) > inv(q). An inversion is a pair (i,j) where i<j and p_i > p_j. So p has more such pairs than q.\n\nWait, but how do these two conditions interact? It's not immediately obvious. Maybe I can model this as counting all pairs (p, q) where both conditions are true.\n\nBut for n=4, the sample output is 17. So let's see how that happens. The note lists some valid pairs, but there are 17 in total. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, the approach is to find a way to calculate this efficiently. For n up to 500, O(n^4) algorithms might be too slow, but perhaps something smarter is needed.\n\nI think the key here is to precompute certain things. Let's think about the possible permutations and their properties.\n\nFirst, for each permutation p, we can compute its inversion count. Then, for each possible pair (p, q), check if p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Sum all such pairs.\n\nBut for n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is way too big. So enumerating all permutations is impossible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nHmm. Let's think about dynamic programming. Maybe we can model the state based on some properties that allow us to build p and q step by step, keeping track of the necessary conditions.\n\nAnother angle: Since p is lex smaller than q, maybe we can find a way to represent the constraints that p and q must satisfy at each position. For example, at the first differing position, p's element is less than q's.\n\nBut even with that, combining it with the inversion condition is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a problem where for each possible permutation p, we count the number of permutations q that are larger than p (lex order) and have fewer inversions than p.\n\nThen the total sum would be the sum over all p of the number of q's satisfying the above.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each permutation p:\n   - inv(p)\n   - For all q where q > p (lex order), count how many have inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nBut again, for n=500, this approach is computationally impossible because there are too many permutations.\n\nSo, I need a mathematical approach or a way to model this using combinatorial properties.\n\nLet me think about the structure of permutations. Maybe the inversion count can be expressed in terms of the permutation's structure, like the number of descents or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem using generating functions or inclusion-exclusion principles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem involving the number of inversions between p and q.\n\nWait, another thought: For a fixed permutation p, what is the number of permutations q that are lex order larger than p and have inv(q) < inv(p)?\n\nSo, for each p, compute the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have fewer inversions.\n\nIf we can compute this for each p, then summing over all p gives the answer.\n\nBut again, for n=500, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be split into considering the parity of the number of inversions. But no, because the condition is inv(p) > inv(q), not based on parity.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a combination of two separate criteria: lex order and inversion count. So, perhaps the number of such pairs is equal to the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex-wise, minus those pairs where p < q and inv(q) >= inv(p).\n\nWait, no, because the two conditions are independent. It's possible that p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q), but also that p < q lex and inv(p) <= inv(q), etc. So, perhaps inclusion-exclusion isn't directly applicable here.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the lex order condition and inversion condition can be considered together. Like, for two permutations p and q, if p is lex",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. The result should be computed modulo a given value.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Inversions**: An inversion in a permutation is a pair of indices (i, j) where i < j and the element at position i is greater than the element at position j. The number of inversions is a measure of the disorder in a permutation.\n\n2. **Lexicographical Order**: Two permutations are compared lexicographically by examining their elements from left to right. The first position where they differ determines which permutation is smaller.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: For each permutation p, we need to count how many permutations q exist such that q is lexicographically larger than p and has fewer inversions than p. This is done using dynamic programming to efficiently explore all possible permutations.\n\n4. **State Representation**: Use a 3-dimensional DP array `dp[i][j][k]` where:\n   - `i` is the current position being considered.\n   - `j` is the number of elements used so far.\n   - `k` is the number of inversions accumulated so far.\n   - The value stored represents the number of ways to achieve this state.\n\n5. **Transition Between States**: For each state, consider adding the next element (from the remaining elements) and update the inversion count accordingly. Track whether the new permutation is lexicographically smaller or not.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, compute the result modulo the given value to ensure it fits within standard data types.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    n, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # dp[i][j][k] = number of permutations of length i using first j elements with k inversions\n    # and the last element is <= current element (to maintain lex order)\n    # Alternatively, we can model it as follows:\n    # Let's think of building permutations step by step, keeping track of whether the next element is added in a way that maintains the lex order.\n    # Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model dp[i][j][k], representing the number of permutations of the first i elements, using the first j elements, with k inversions, and ending with some value.\n    # Hmm, perhaps we need to split into two cases: whether the last element is fixed or not.
