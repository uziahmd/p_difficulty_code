The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a way that a_i + b_j is odd. So, for a key j and chest i, if one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd.\n\nHmm, wait, because adding two evens gives even, two odds give even too. Only even and odd sums are odd. So, the condition a_i + b_j ≡ 1 mod 2 means that one must be even and the other odd.\n\nSo, for each key, it can only unlock chests of the opposite parity. That is, a key with an even number can only unlock chests with odd numbers, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the first thing I think is that we need to count how many even and odd keys there are, and similarly for the chests.\n\nWait, no. Because the keys determine which chests they can open. So, for example, if a key is even (b_j is even), then it can only be used on chests where a_i is odd. Similarly, an odd key can only be used on even a_i.\n\nSo, the approach is to:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i (chest numbers).\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j (key numbers).\n3. Then, decide how to match them optimally.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once.\n\nLet me think: the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between the total possible based on the keys and the available chests.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i.\n- Similarly, separate the keys into even and odd.\n- Then, for the even a_i group, use as many even or odd keys as needed.\n- Wait, no. For even a_i, we can use either even or odd keys? No, wait: because a_i is even, to satisfy a_i + b_j is odd, b_j must be odd. So, any even a_i can be unlocked only by odd keys.\n\nSimilarly, for odd a_i, they can be unlocked by even keys.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Even a_i chests can be unlocked by using odd keys.\n- Odd a_i chests can be unlocked by using even keys.\n\nSo, the number of even a_i is E_a, and the number of odd a_i is O_a.\n\nThe number of even b_j is E_b, and the number of odd b_j is O_b.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests is determined by the following:\n\nWe can assign E_b keys to O_a chests, and O_b keys to E_a chests.\n\nWait, but also, the total number of keys used can't exceed m.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the keys used is the min of the required for each category.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of chests is the minimum of:\n\nmin( (E_b + O_b) , n ) ?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Let's think differently.\n\nEach even a_i requires an odd key. So, the number of such chests we can open is the minimum between the number of even a_i and the number of odd keys.\n\nSimilarly, the number of odd a_i chests that can be opened is the minimum between the number of odd a_i and the number of even keys.\n\nSo, the total is the sum of these two minima, but we cannot exceed the total number of keys used, since each key is used once.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum could be more than the total number of keys. Because each key is used once, the sum of the two minima must not exceed m.\n\nWait, no. Because each key is used exactly once. So, the sum of the two minima cannot exceed m, because each of those minima represents the number of keys used for each type.\n\nWait, let's formalize this:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nE_a = number of chests with even a_i.\n\nO_a = number of chests with odd a_i.\n\nE_b = number of keys with even b_j.\n\nO_b = number of keys with odd b_j.\n\nNow, the maximum number of chests we can open is:\n\nthe maximum of all possible ways to assign E_b and O_b keys to E_a and O_a chests, respectively.\n\nBut each key can be used only once.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nnumber of keys used for E_a chests (which must be O_b) plus the number used for O_a chests (E_b) <= m.\n\nAnd the number of E_a chests opened is the minimum of E_a and O_b.\n\nSimilarly, the number of O_a chests opened is the minimum of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can only unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Values**: First, we count the number of even and odd values in both the chests and the keys.\n2. **Determine Pairings**: Each even number on a chest can only be unlocked by an odd key, and each odd number on a chest can only be unlocked by an even key.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Openable Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum possible pairs between even/odd keys and chests. Specifically:\n   - The number of even chests that can be unlocked using odd keys.\n   - The number of odd chests that can be unlocked using even keys.\n4. **Ensure Total Keys Used**: Ensure that the total number of keys used does not exceed the available keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n, m = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+m]))\n    \n    E_a = 0  # even chests\n    O_a = 0  # odd chests\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            E_a += 1\n        else:\n            O_a += 1\n    \n    E_b = 0  # even keys\n    O_b = 0  # odd keys\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            E_b += 1\n        else:\n            O_b += 1\n    \n    # Calculate possible pairs\n    use_even_key_on_odd_chest = min(E_b, O_a)\n    use_odd_key_on_even_chest = min(O_b, E_a)\n    \n    max_chests = use_even_key_on_odd_chest + use_odd_key_on_even_chest\n    print(max_chests)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We iterate through the chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- **Pairing Strategy**: We determine how many even chests can be unlocked by odd keys and how many odd chests can be unlocked by even keys.\n- **Summing Up**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of these two values, ensuring we do not exceed the available keys.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened with the given constraints, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
