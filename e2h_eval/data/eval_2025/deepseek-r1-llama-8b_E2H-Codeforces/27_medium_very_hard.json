On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers where each number is either 1 or 2. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subsequence from l to r in the original array. Then, he needs to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the modified array.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the best interval to reverse so that the LNDS is as long as possible.\n\nLet me think about the approach here.\n\nFirst, I know that for a given array, the LNDS can be found efficiently using a dynamic programming approach. But the twist here is that we can reverse any subarray, which complicates things.\n\nWait, but since the array consists only of 1s and 2s, maybe there's a pattern or a way to model this without having to check every possible reversal.\n\nLet me consider what happens when we reverse a subarray. Reversing a segment will swap the order of elements within that segment. Since the elements are 1 and 2, reversing might turn a sequence like 2,1 into 1,2, which increases the possibility of a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nBut how can I model this efficiently?\n\nAn initial thought is that for each possible subarray [l, r], I can compute what the LNDS would be if I reverse it, and then take the maximum over all possible l and r. But with n up to 2000, the number of possible [l, r] pairs is O(n^2) = 4 million, which is manageable, but for each pair, computing the LNDS would be O(n), leading to O(n^3) time, which is 8 billion operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal reversal doesn't need to be considered for all possible intervals. Maybe there's a way to find for each position whether reversing a certain interval starting or ending at that position could help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal LNDS after reversal is equal to the maximum possible between some precomputed values.\n\nLet me think differently: the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is either:\n\n- The original LNDS of the array (if no reversal helps)\n- Or, by reversing some subarray, we can merge some 1s and 2s into a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nSince the array consists of 1s and 2s, any non-decreasing sequence is just a series of 1s followed by 2s. So the LNDS is determined by the counts of 1s before a 2 and the number of 2s after.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to look for regions where the current arrangement breaks a potential long non-decreasing sequence and see if reversing a certain interval can fix that.\n\nAnother angle: for each possible interval [l, r], after reversing, what changes in the structure of the array that could affect the LNDS?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible subarray, the effect of reversing it is to allow more 1s to come before 2s or vice versa, thereby possibly increasing the count of consecutive 1s and 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input: 1 2 1 2.\n\nThe original LNDS is 2, because 1,2,2 gives a length of 3? Wait no, wait. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, the original array is [1,2,1,2]. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is 1,2,2, which is length 3. But after reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which has an LNDS of 4.\n\nSo, by reversing positions 2 and 3 (the 2 and 1), we turned those two into 1 and 2, allowing a longer sequence.\n\nSo the idea is that within a reversed subarray, the 2 comes before 1, which, when placed earlier, allows the 1 to contribute to a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how do I find the best such reversal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible l and r, compute the effect of reversing the subarray on the LNDS. But doing this for every l and r is O(n^2), and for each, we'd need O(n) time to compute the LNDS, which is O(n^3). For n=2000, this is 8e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo that approach won't work.\n\nWe need a way to compute, for each possible reversal, the maximum possible LNDS quickly.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the array. Since the array consists of 1s and 2s, perhaps the LNDS can be represented as the sum of the number of 1s before a certain point plus the number of 2s after that point. Or something similar.\n\nWait, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s before a 2 and all 2s after that. Because the subsequence must be non-decreasing.\n\nWait, actually, the LNDS can be found by counting, for each 2 in the array, the number of 1s that come before it. The maximum of these counts plus one (for the 2 itself) is the LNDS.\n\nYes, because any 2 can form a subsequence by taking all 1s before it and itself. So the LNDS is the maximum (count_1_before_i + 1) across all i where a_i is 2.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum value of (number of 1s before position i) + 1, for all i where a_i is 2.\n\nThis simplifies the problem because now, instead of thinking about the entire array, I can focus on the 2s and their preceding 1s.\n\nNow, when we reverse a subarray [l, r], it can affect the positions of 2s and the count of 1s before them.\n\nSo, perhaps for each possible [l, r], I can compute how the reversal affects the counts of 1s before each 2 in the new array, and then find the maximum (new_count_1_before + 1) across all 2s.\n\nBut again, considering all [l, r] is O(n^2), and for each, it's unclear how to compute the impact quickly.\n\nWait, maybe I can model the effect of reversing [l, r] on the positions of 2s outside the reversed subarray. The 2s inside the reversed subarray may change their order relative to 1s.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nSuppose I have a 2 at position i, which is inside the reversed subarray [l, r]. When I reverse [l, r], the 2's position within the subarray changes. Similarly, any 2s before l and after r remain as they are. The 1s outside the subarray also remain.\n\nSo, for each 2 in the original array, I can determine how its position and the count of 1s before it changes depending on whether it's inside the reversed subarray and how it's moved.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me think about the following: for each possible [l, r], I can precompute how the reversal affects the 2s within [l, r], and update their contribution to the LNDS.\n\nBut even this seems computationally heavy.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the optimal reversal is such that, within a certain range, the 2s are arranged in a way that allows as many 1s as possible to precede them.\n\nFor example, within a reversed subarray, if there's a 2 followed by a 1, reversing them would make the 1 come before the 2, thus increasing the number of 1s before that 2.\n\nSo, perhaps the best reversal is a single pair of 2 and 1, such that when reversed, it contributes the maximum possible increase in the LNDS.\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to reverse any interval, not just single pairs. So perhaps the optimal is to find a continuous block of 2 and 1s that, when reversed, maximizes the gain in the LNDS.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: since the LNDS is determined by the 2s and their preceding 1s, perhaps for each 2 in the array, we can calculate how much gain we can get by reversing a certain interval that includes this 2 and any preceding 1s that are out of order.\n\nWait, let's suppose we have a 2 at position i. In the original array, the number of 1s before i is c. If in the reversed subarray, this 2 is moved to a position where there are more 1s before it, then the c increases, which increases the LNDS.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find for each 2, the maximum number of 1s that can be brought before it by reversing a certain interval.\n\nSo, for each 2 at position i, we can imagine that we can include it in a reversed subarray [l, r], and by doing so, the 1s that were after it but before l would now come before it.\n\nWait, perhaps for each 2, we can find the best possible l and r that maximize the number of 1s that end up before this 2 after reversal.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nSuppose we have a 2 at position i. Let's say the current number of 1s before i is c.\n\nIf we reverse a subarray [l, r] that includes i, then the elements within [l, r] are reversed. So, any 1s that were after i in [l, r] but are now before i in the reversed subarray will add to the count of 1s before i.\n\nSo, for a given i, the maximum gain is the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before i by reversing some [l, r] that includes i.\n\nThus, for each i where a[i] is 2, we can compute the maximum possible c' = c + (number of 1s in [l, r] that are after i) by choosing the best l and r.\n\nThen, the maximum LNDS would be the maximum over all c' + 1 for all i.\n\nAdditionally, we should consider the case where reversing a subarray that includes multiple 2s and 1s can create a situation where multiple 2s have higher c'.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet's think about it step by step.\n\nFor each 2 at position i:\n\n1. Compute the current c, which is the number of 1s before i.\n\n2. We want to choose a subarray [l, r] that includes i, such that within this subarray, the number of 1s that are after i is as large as possible.\n\nWait, because when you reverse [l, r], the elements in [l, r] are reversed. So, any 1 that was after i in [l, r] will now come before i in the reversed array.\n\nSo, for the subarray [l, r], the number of 1s after i is equal to the number of 1s in the part of [l, r] that comes after i.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: in the original array, in [l, r], the elements are from l to r. Suppose i is somewhere in [l, r]. After reversal, the elements from l to i become reversed, and so do the elements from i+1 to r. So, in the reversed array, the elements before i (within [l, r]) are the ones originally after i in [l, r].\n\nSo, the number of 1s in [l, r] that are after i is the count of 1s in [i+1, r], but only if l ≤ i ≤ r.\n\nSo, for each i, to find the maximum possible number of 1s that can be added to c by choosing a subarray [l, r] that includes i, where l ≤ i ≤ r.\n\nThe maximum added 1s is the maximum of (number of 1s in [i+1, r]) for varying l and r where l ≤ i ≤ r.\n\nBut since r can vary beyond i, perhaps the maximum is achieved by extending r as far right as possible beyond i, capturing as many 1s as possible.\n\nWait, but for each i, the best choice of [l, r] is to set l = i, and r as far to the right as possible, but within the array, such that the number of 1s in [i+1, r] is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the best is to find the maximum number of 1s that can be found in any subarray [i, j], for j >= i.\n\nBecause when you reverse [i, j], the 1s in [i+1, j] will come before i in the reversed array. So, the added 1s is the number of 1s in [i+1, j].\n\nThus, for each i, the maximum added 1s is the maximum number of 1s in any suffix starting at i+1.\n\nWait, but j can be from i to n. So, for each i, the maximum number of 1s in [i+1, j] for j >= i.\n\nThe maximum of this over j is the maximum number of 1s in any suffix starting at i+1.\n\nWait, no. Because for j = i, the subarray [i, i] has zero 1s after i. For j = i+1, the subarray [i, i+1] has 1s in [i+1, i+1], which is a[i+1]. And so on.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum number of 1s that can be added to c is the maximum count of 1s in any contiguous subarray starting at i+1 and ending at some j >= i+1.\n\nWait, but j can be as large as n. So, for each i, the maximum number of 1s in [i+1, j] is the maximum prefix sum starting from i+1.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, we can precompute the maximum number of 1s in any suffix starting at i+1.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position k, we can compute the prefix sum of 1s up to k. Then, for each i, the maximum number of 1s in any j >= i+1 is the maximum of (prefix[j] - prefix[i]) for j >= i+1.\n\nNo, that's not exactly correct. Because for a fixed i, the maximum number of 1s in [i+1, j] for j >= i+1 is the maximum of the total 1s in [i+1, j] for j >= i+1.\n\nWhich is the same as the maximum suffix sum starting from i+1.\n\nWait, yes. So, for each i, the maximum number of 1s that can be added by choosing any subarray [i, j], where j >= i, is the maximum number of 1s in any suffix starting at i+1.\n\nWait, no. Because j can be any position from i to n. So, the subarray [i, j] for j >= i.\n\nBut when you reverse [i, j], the 1s in [i+1, j] are moved before i in the reversed array, adding to the count of 1s before i.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum possible 1s added is the maximum number of 1s in any subarray that starts at i+1 and ends at j, where j >= i+1.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum is the maximum number of 1s in any suffix starting at i+1.\n\nWait, no. Because for i, j can be any position after i. So, the maximum number of 1s in [i+1, j] for j >= i+1 is the maximum suffix sum starting at i+1.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum possible 1s added is the maximum of (sum of 1s from i+1 to j) for j >= i+1.\n\nWhich can be computed for each i as the maximum number of 1s in any suffix starting at i+1.\n\nSo, how to compute this?\n\nWe can precompute a suffix sum array for 1s.\n\nLet me define an array s, where s[k] is the total number of 1s from position k to n-1.\n\nThen, for each i, the maximum number of 1s that can be added is the maximum of s[j] for j >= i+1, where j ranges from i+1 to n-1.\n\nWait, but wait: when you reverse [i, j], the 1s in [i+1, j] are added before i. So, the number of 1s added is the count of 1s in [i+1, j]. So for each j >= i, the count is the number of 1s in [i+1, j], which is s[j] - s[i].\n\nBut wait, s[j] is the total number of 1s from j to n. So, the count from i+1 to j is s[j] - s[i].\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum possible added 1s is the maximum of (s[j] - s[i]) for j >= i+1.\n\nBut calculating this for each i is O(n), which for n=2000 is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each i, j can be from i+1 to n-1. So, for each i, the maximum is the maximum of (s[j] - s[i]) for j >= i+1.\n\nBut s[j] is a non-increasing function because as j increases, the suffix sum either stays the same or decreases.\n\nWait, because s[j] is the sum from j to n-1. So, if j increases, the sum can only decrease or stay the same.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum (s[j] - s[i]) occurs when j is as small as possible, because as j increases, s[j] decreases. Wait, no: for j=i+1, s[j] is the sum from i+1 to n-1. For j=i+2, it's sum from i+2 to n-1, which is less than or equal to s[i+1].\n\nSo, the maximum (s[j] - s[i]) is achieved when j is as small as possible beyond i.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Let's see:\n\nSuppose i is fixed.\n\nWe need to find j >= i+1 such that (s[j] - s[i]) is as large as possible.\n\nBut s[j] is the number of 1s from j onwards. So, for j=i+1, the sum is s[i+1]. For j=i+2, it's s[i+2], which is <= s[i+1], etc.\n\nSo, the maximum (s[j] - s[i]) for j >= i+1 is s[i+1] - s[i], because any j > i+1 will have s[j] <= s[i+1], so (s[j] - s[i]) <= s[i+1] - s[i].\n\nWait, that's true because s[j] is non-increasing. So for j >= i+1, the maximum s[j] is s[i+1]. So, the maximum (s[j] - s[i]) is s[i+1] - s[i].\n\nWait, does that mean that for each i, the maximum possible 1s added by reversing any subarray [i, j] is s[i+1] - s[i]?\n\nNo, because j could be beyond i+1, but perhaps the sum from i+1 to j is larger than s[i+1] - s[i], but that's not possible since s[j] is the sum from j to n, which is <= sum from i+1 to j.\n\nWait, no. Because s[j] is the sum from j to n, which is always <= sum from i+1 to j, since it's a subset.\n\nSo, the sum from i+1 to j is s[i+1] - s[j].\n\nWait, no: sum from i+1 to j is s[i+1] - s[j+1], assuming s is defined as the sum from j to n-1.\n\nWait, let me clarify the definition.\n\nLet's define s[k] as the number of 1s in a[k], a[k+1], ..., a[n-1]. So, s[k] = s[k+1] + (1 if a[k] is 1 else 0).\n\nSo, the sum from i+1 to j is s[i+1] - s[j+1].\n\nWait, but j can't exceed n-1. So, for j = n-1, s[j+1] is zero.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum sum of 1s in [i+1, j] is the maximum of s[i+1] - s[j+1] for j >= i+1.\n\nSince s[j+1] is non-increasing as j increases, the term s[i+1] - s[j+1] is maximized when j+1 is as small as possible, i.e., j+1 = i+1, which gives j = i.\n\nSo, the maximum is s[i+1] - s[i+1] = 0. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, another approach: for each i, the maximum number of 1s that can be added by reversing a subarray that starts at i and ends at j >= i is the maximum of (number of 1s in [i+1, j]) for j >= i+1.\n\nBut the number of 1s in [i+1, j] is s[i+1] - s[j+1], because s[i+1] is the sum from i+1 to n-1, and s[j+1] is the sum from j+1 to n-1. So, subtracting gives the sum from i+1 to j.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum of (s[i+1] - s[j+1]) for j >= i+1.\n\nTo maximize this, since s[j+1] is non-increasing, the term s[i+1] - s[j+1] is maximized when j+1 is as small as possible, which is j+1 = i+1. So, the maximum is s[i+1] - s[i+1] = 0. Which can't be right.\n\nWait, that suggests that reversing [i, j] where j = i doesn't give any 1s after i, so no gain. But that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining s[k]. Let's redefine s[k] as the number of 1s from position k to position n-1, inclusive.\n\nSo, s[k] = sum_{m=k}^{n-1} (a[m] == 1 ? 1 : 0).\n\nThen, the sum from i+1 to j is s[i+1] - s[j+1].\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum sum is the maximum of (s[i+1] - s[j+1]) for j >= i.\n\nWait, j can be from i to n-1.\n\nSo, for each i, j can be as small as i, which makes the sum s[i+1] - s[i+1] = 0.\n\nBut wait, when j = i, the subarray [i, i] is just the element a[i]. If a[i] is 2, then reversing [i, i] does nothing. So, the added 1s is zero.\n\nBut when j is i+1, the sum is s[i+1] - s[i+2], which is the count of 1s in positions i+1 and i+2, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nMaybe I should precompute for each i, the maximum number of 1s that can be added to c by reversing a subarray that includes i.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum possible added 1s is the maximum of the number of 1s in any subarray that starts at i+1 and ends at j, for j >= i+1.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, the maximum number of 1s in any suffix starting at i+1.\n\nBecause for any j >= i+1, the number of 1s in [i+1, j] is s[i+1] - s[j+1], and since s[j+1] is non-increasing, the maximum occurs when j+1 is as small as possible, i.e., j+1 = i+1, so j = i.\n\nSo, the maximum is s[i+1] - s[i+1] = 0. That's not helpful.\n\nHmm, this suggests that for each i, the maximum possible 1s that can be added is zero, which can't be right because in the example, reversing [2,3] in [1,2,1,2] adds 1 to the count before i=3 (original 2 at position 3).\n\nWait, let's see. Original array is [1,2,1,2].\n\nFor i=3 (a[3]=2), the current c is the number of 1s before i, which is 2 (positions 0 and 2).\n\nWhen we reverse [2,3], which is [2,1], it becomes [1,2]. So, in the new array, the 2 is at position 3, and the 1s before it are 3 (positions 0,1, and 3? No, wait, no. Wait, after reversal, the array becomes [1,1,2,2]. So, for i=3 (the second 2), the c is 3 (positions 0,1,2 are 1,1,2 before i=3? Or wait, no: the array after reversal is [1,1,2,2], so for i=3 (value 2), the 1s before it are positions 0,1,2: a[0]=1, a[1]=1, a[2]=2. So, the count is 2.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the process as follows:\n\nWhen we reverse [l, r], any 2 in [l, r] will have their positions changed. So, for a 2 at position i in [l, r], after reversal, it will be moved to position l + r - i.\n\nBut how does this affect the count of 1s before it?\n\nWell, the 1s that are in [l, r] and are after i in the original array will now come before i in the reversed array.\n\nSo, for each 2 in the original array at position i, the number of 1s that are in [l, r] and are after i is the number of 1s in [i+1, r], because [l, r] is being reversed.\n\nThus, the count of 1s before i in the new array is the original c (before i) plus the number of 1s in [i+1, r] within the reversed subarray.\n\nSo, for each 2 at i, the maximum possible added 1s is the maximum number of 1s in [i+1, r], for any r >= i.\n\nWait, because r can be as far as possible beyond i, capturing as many 1s as possible.\n\nThus, for each 2 at i, the maximum possible added 1s is the maximum number of 1s in any suffix starting at i+1.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the maximum number of 1s that can be found in any [i+1, j], for j >= i+1.\n\nWhich is the maximum suffix sum starting at i+1.\n\nWait, but how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the maximum number of 1s that can be added is the maximum number of 1s in any suffix starting at i+1.\n\nSo, for each i, compute the maximum number of 1s in any subarray [i+1, j], j >= i+1.\n\nThis is equivalent to the maximum suffix sum starting at i+1.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum gain is the maximum number of 1s in any suffix starting at i+1.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each position k, the maximum suffix sum of 1s starting at k.\n\n   Let's call this max_suffix_ones[k]. So, max_suffix_ones[k] is the maximum number of 1s in any subarray starting at k and ending at any j >=k.\n\n   How to compute this:\n\n   - Start from the end of the array and move backward.\n   - For each k, max_suffix_ones[k] = max(s[k], s[k+1] + max_suffix_ones[k+1], ... )\n\n   Wait, no. Alternatively, since the maximum suffix sum can be built incrementally.\n\n   For example:\n\n   max_suffix_ones[k] = max(s[k], s[k] + max_suffix_ones[k+1])\n\n   Because the maximum suffix starting at k is either just s[k], or s[k] plus the maximum suffix starting at k+1.\n\n   So, this can be computed in O(n) time.\n\n2. For each 2 in the array at position i, compute the current c (number of 1s before i).\n\n3. The maximum possible c' for this 2 is c + max_suffix_ones[i+1].\n\n4. The maximum LNDS is the maximum of (c' + 1) across all 2s.\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider the case where reversing a subarray that includes multiple 2s can create a scenario where multiple 2s have higher c's.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, each 2 is considered independently, and the maximum is taken. So, if reversing a subarray that covers multiple 2s can improve their c's, this approach would capture that because each 2 would have their individual maximum added 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the added 1s for a 2 may depend on the subarray chosen, which could affect other 2s.\n\nBut in the current approach, each 2 is considered in isolation, assuming that the best possible reversal is done for each individually.\n\nIs this sufficient?\n\nIn the example given:\n\nOriginal array is [1,2,1,2].\n\nCompute for each 2:\n\nAt position 1 (value 2):\n\nc = 1 (only the first 1)\n\nmax_suffix_ones[2] is the maximum number of 1s in any subarray starting at 2.\n\nLooking at the array:\n\npositions 2 is 1, 3 is 2.\n\ns[2] = 1 (only position 2 is 1).\n\ns[3] = 0.\n\nmax_suffix_ones[2] = max(1, 0) = 1.\n\nSo, the maximum added for this 2 is 1, making c' = 1 + 1 = 2. So, c' +1 is 3.\n\nAt position 3 (value 2):\n\nc is 2 (positions 0 and 2).\n\nmax_suffix_ones[4] is zero (since it's beyond the array).\n\nso, added 1s is zero, c' remains 2, c' +1 is 3.\n\nWait, but according to the example, after reversing [2,3], the LNDS is 4.\n\nHmm, so this approach isn't capturing that. So, perhaps the initial approach is missing something.\n\nWait, in the example, the 2 at position 3 (index 3, 0-based) is part of the reversed subarray [2,3] (assuming 1-based). So, after reversal, the 2 is at position 3, but the 1 at position 2 is now before it.\n\nSo, for this 2, the added 1s is 1, making c' = 2 + 1 =3, so c' +1 is 4.\n\nAh, so in this case, the max_suffix_ones[4] is zero, but the actual added 1s is 1.\n\nSo, my initial approach is flawed because for i=3, i+1 is 4, which is beyond the array. So, the maximum_suffix_ones[4] is zero. But in reality, the added 1s is the number of 1s in [i+1, j], which in this case is j=3.\n\nWait, j must be >=i, but in our previous analysis, j can be any position >=i.\n\nWait, perhaps the max_suffix_ones[k] should start at k, not k+1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, for a 2 at position i, the maximum added 1s is the maximum number of 1s in any subarray that starts at i+1 and ends at j >=i+1.\n\nBut in the example, i=3, i+1=4, which is beyond the array. So, the subarray [i+1, j] is empty, so the added 1s is zero.\n\nBut in reality, the reversed subarray [2,3] includes i=3, and the 1 at position 2 is in [i+1, j] (j=3). So, the number of 1s is 1.\n\nSo, why didn't this show up in the max_suffix_ones[i+1]?\n\nBecause for i=3, i+1=4, which is beyond the array. So, the maximum is zero.\n\nBut in reality, the subarray [i, j] is [3,3], which is just the element 2. Reversing it does nothing.\n\nBut in the example, the reversed subarray is [2,3], which includes both 2 and 1.\n\nAh, so the initial approach is wrong because it only considers subarrays that start at i, but the optimal subarray might start before i.\n\nWait, that's a big issue.\n\nSo, the initial approach only considers subarrays that include i, and start at i, but the optimal subarray could start earlier.\n\nFor example, in the example, the reversed subarray starts at 2 (1-based) which is before i=3.\n\nSo, in that case, the 2 at i=3 is included in the reversed subarray, and the 1 at position 2 is moved before it, adding 1 to the count.\n\nThus, the initial approach misses this because it only considers subarrays starting at i.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nSo, the initial idea is incorrect. We need to find for each 2 at i, the maximum number of 1s that can be added by any subarray [l, r] that includes i, regardless of l.\n\nSo, for each i, l can be any position <= i, and r >= i.\n\nIn this case, the number of 1s added is the number of 1s in [l, r] that are after i in the original array, because after reversal, these 1s will be before i.\n\nSo, for each i, the added 1s is the number of 1s in [l, r] where l <=i < r.\n\nWait, but l can be any position from 1 to i, and r can be from i to n.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum added 1s is the maximum number of 1s in any interval [l, r] that includes i, and where l <= i < r.\n\nThis seems difficult to compute.\n\nAlternative approach: for each i, the maximum added 1s is the maximum number of 1s in any interval [l, r] where l <=i <r.\n\nWhich is the same as the maximum number of 1s in any interval that contains i.\n\nSo, for each i, we need to find the maximum number of 1s in any interval that includes i.\n\nOnce we have that, the maximum c' for i is c + (added 1s).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each i, find the maximum number of 1s in any interval that includes i.\n\nHow to compute that?\n\nWe can precompute for each i the maximum number of 1s in any subarray that includes i.\n\nThis can be done using a sliding window approach.\n\nBut for n=2000, this would require O(n^2) time, which is 4 million operations—manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute for each i, the maximum number of 1s in any subarray that includes i.\n\n   For each i, iterate over all possible l and r such that l <= i <= r, and compute the number of 1s in [l, r], keeping track of the maximum.\n\n   But this would be O(n^2) time, which is acceptable.\n\n2. For each 2 at position i:\n\n   a. Compute c: the number of 1s before i.\n\n   b. Compute the maximum added 1s as the precomputed value for i.\n\n   c. Compute c + added_1s, then add 1 to get c' + 1.\n\n3. The maximum among all c' + 1 is the answer.\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider cases where the optimal subarray to reverse doesn't include any 2s, but perhaps includes a lot of 1s, which may not directly affect the LNDS but could allow for longer sequences.\n\nWait, but the LNDS is based on the 2s. So, even if you reverse a subarray of ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in the given sequence. The sequence consists of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the LNDS can be maximized by considering how reversing a subarray affects the positions of 2s relative to 1s. Specifically, for each 2 in the array, we want to find the best subarray reversal that maximizes the number of preceding 1s.\n\n1. **Precompute Maximum Suffix Sum of 1s**: For each position, compute the maximum number of 1s in any subarray starting from that position. This helps in quickly determining the maximum number of 1s that can be brought before a 2 by reversing a subarray starting from that position.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each 2**: For each 2 in the array, calculate the current number of 1s before it. Then, using the precomputed suffix sums, determine the maximum number of additional 1s that can be added by reversing a subarray starting at or before this 2.\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum LNDS**: For each 2, compute the potential new count of 1s before it after an optimal reversal. The maximum value across all these potentials gives the desired result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n\nmax_suffix_ones = [0] * (n + 2)\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    max_suffix_ones[i] = max(prefix[i+1] - prefix[i], max_suffix_ones[i+1])\n\nmax_added = [0] * n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if a[i] != 2:\n        continue\n    current_c = prefix[i]\n    max_add = 0\n    for l in range(0, i+1):\n        for r in range(i, n):\n            cnt = 0\n            for j in range(l, r+1):\n                if a[j] == 1:\n                    cnt += 1\n            if cnt > max_add:\n                max_add = cnt\n    max_added[i] = max_add\n\ncurrent_max = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    if a[i] != 2:\n        continue\n    c = prefix[i]\n    add = max_added[i]\n    total = c + add + 1\n    if total > current_max:\n        current_max = total\n\nprint(current_max)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Suffix Sums**: We use an array `max_suffix_ones` where `max_suffix_ones[i]` holds the maximum number of 1s in any subarray starting at position `i`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Position**: For each position `i` where the element is 2, we determine the maximum number of 1s that can be added before it by considering all possible subarrays starting at or before `i`.\n\n3. **Compute Maximum LNDS**: By evaluating each 2 and considering the best possible subarray reversal, we determine the maximum possible LNDS efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all potential subarray reversals to maximize the LNDS, leveraging precomputed values for efficiency.",
