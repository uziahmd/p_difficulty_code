Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on their sides. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides x, y, z. The conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, it's required that x, y, z form a non-degenerate triangle, which means x + y > z must hold because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since z is the largest here (because C ≤ z ≤ D and C ≥ B), the condition simplifies to x + y > z.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Because x can be up to B, y can be up to C, but z starts at C and goes up to D. So in all cases, z is at least as big as y and x. So for the triangle inequality, the only necessary condition is x + y > z. Because if z is larger than or equal to y, then x + z will definitely be larger than y, and y + z is larger than x. So the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo, the approach is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) where x is between A and B, y is between B and C, z is between C and D, and x + y > z.\n\nBut considering the ranges, especially when B, C, D are large, like up to 5e5, iterating through each possible x, y, z would be too slow. So I need an efficient way to calculate this without brute-forcing all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's fix x and y. Then for each such pair (x, y), I need to find the number of z's that are >= C and <= min(D, x + y - 1). Because z must satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. So for a given x and y, the valid z's are from max(C, ...) to min(D, x+y-1).\n\nWait, but z can't be less than C. So the lower bound is C, upper bound is the minimum of D and x+y-1. But wait, x + y - 1 could be less than C. In that case, there are no valid z's for that (x, y) pair.\n\nSo the idea is to iterate over x and y, compute the maximum possible z (which is min(x + y - 1, D)), and then see if that z is >= C. If yes, then the number of z's is max(0, (upper_bound - lower_bound + 1)).\n\nBut even with that, if we have to loop through every possible x and y, that's going to be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the ranges and how to compute the total efficiently.\n\nLet me try to break down the variables:\n\nFor x, the range is [A, B].\n\nFor y, the range is [B, C].\n\nFor z, it's [C, D], but z has to be less than x + y.\n\nSo perhaps, instead of iterating x and y, I can find the sum x + y and determine how many z's are allowed for each possible sum.\n\nWait, but x can vary and y can vary, so for each possible sum s = x + y, the number of z's is the number of integers in [C, min(D, s-1)].\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each s, the count of (x,y) pairs that sum to s, multiplied by the count of z's for that s.\n\nWait, but s can vary from 2A (x=A, y=B) to B + C (since y can be up to C).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each possible sum s, calculate the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y = s.\n\n2. For each s, calculate the number of z's that are >= C and <= min(D, s-1). This is max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1) if s-1 >= C; else 0.\n\n3. Multiply the count from step 1 and step 2, then sum all these products for all possible s.\n\nSo the total is the sum over s of (number of (x,y) pairs with x+y=s) * (number of z's allowed for s).\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute the number of (x, y) pairs for each s efficiently.\n\nLet's define the ranges:\n\nx can be from x_min = A to x_max = B.\n\ny can be from y_min = B to y_max = C.\n\nWe need x + y = s.\n\nSo for a given s, what's the number of (x, y) pairs?\n\nLet me think about the possible x and y values.\n\nThe minimal x is A, and the minimal y is B. So the minimal s is A + B.\n\nThe maximal x is B, and the maximal y is C. So the maximal s is B + C.\n\nSo s can range from A+B to B+C.\n\nFor each s in [A+B, B+C], we need to find the number of (x,y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y = s.\n\nSo how do we find the count for each s?\n\nLet me express x as x = s - y.\n\nThen, for a fixed s, y can vary, but x must lie within [A, B].\n\nSo for each s, the possible y's are such that y >= B, y <= C, and y <= s - A (since x >= A => y <= s - A), and y >= s - B (since x <= B => y >= s - B).\n\nWait, let's rephrase:\n\nGiven x + y = s,\n\nx must be >= A and <= B.\n\ny must be >= B and <= C.\n\nSo substituting x = s - y,\n\ns - y >= A => y <= s - A.\n\ns - y <= B => y >= s - B.\n\nAlso, y must be >= B and <= C.\n\nSo combining these, the valid y's for a given s are in the intersection of:\n\ny >= max(B, s - B)\n\nand\n\ny <= min(C, s - A)\n\nAdditionally, the lower bound must be <= upper bound; otherwise, no solutions for this s.\n\nSo the count for s is the number of integers y in [lower, upper], where lower = max(B, s - B), upper = min(C, s - A).\n\nIf lower > upper, then count is 0.\n\nSo the steps for each s:\n\nCompute lower = max(B, s - B).\n\nCompute upper = min(C, s - A).\n\nIf lower > upper: continue.\n\nElse: count += (upper - lower + 1).\n\nSo now, for each s in [A+B, B+C], compute this count.\n\nOnce we have the count for s, we also need to compute the number of z's allowed, which is z >= C, z <= min(D, s-1).\n\nSo z_count = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1) if s-1 >= C else 0.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that.\n\nz can be from C to min(D, s-1), but only if s-1 >= C.\n\nOtherwise, there's no valid z.\n\nSo z_count = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1) if s >= C + 1 else 0.\n\nWait, because z must be >= C and <= min(D, s-1). So if s-1 < C, then z can't be chosen.\n\nSo z_count is:\n\nif s-1 < C → 0.\n\nelse → (min(D, s-1) - C + 1) → but if min(D, s-1) is less than C, it's 0.\n\nWait, no. Because if s-1 >= C, then min(D, s-1) is >= C, so the count is min(D, s-1) - C + 1.\n\nBut if s-1 < C, then min(D, s-1) is s-1, which is less than C, so z can't be >= C, so count is zero.\n\nSo overall, the z_count is:\n\nif s-1 >= C:\n\n   z_upper = min(D, s-1)\n\n   if z_upper >= C:\n\n       count_z = z_upper - C + 1\n\n   else:\n\n       count_z = 0\n\nelse:\n\n   count_z = 0\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1) if s-1 >= C else 0\n\nAlternatively, more concisely:\n\ncount_z = max(0, (min(D, s-1) - C + 1)) if (s-1 >= C) else 0\n\nBut perhaps a better way is:\n\nz_low = C\n\nz_high = min(D, s-1)\n\nif z_high < z_low:\n\n   count_z = 0\n\nelse:\n\n   count_z = z_high - z_low + 1\n\nSo the count_z is:\n\ncount_z = max(0, z_high - z_low + 1) if z_high >= z_low else 0.\n\nSo putting it all together, for each s from A+B to B+C:\n\n- Compute lower = max(B, s - B)\n- Compute upper = min(C, s - A)\n- if lower > upper: continue\n- else: add (upper - lower + 1) * count_z to the total.\n\nNow, the question is: how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBecause s can be up to B + C, which for B and C up to 5e5 each, is up to 1e6. So s ranges up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop s from A+B to B+C:\n\n   compute lower and upper for y.\n\n   if lower > upper: continue.\n\n   compute count_y = upper - lower + 1.\n\n   compute z_low = C, z_high = min(D, s-1).\n\n   if z_high < z_low: count_z = 0.\n\n   else: count_z = z_high - z_low + 1.\n\n   total += count_y * count_z.\n\nSo the key is to loop through all possible s, compute these, and sum.\n\nNow, considering the constraints on s:\n\ns must be >= A + B, and <= B + C.\n\nSo for s in this range, proceed.\n\nNow, what about the time complexity? For s from A+B to B+C, which can be up to (5e5 + 5e5) = 1e6 steps. Each step is O(1), so overall O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo now, the code structure can be:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B.\n\ns_max = B + C.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop s from s_min to s_max:\n\n   lower = max(B, s - B)\n\n   upper = min(C, s - A)\n\n   if lower > upper: continue\n\n   count_y = upper - lower + 1\n\n   # compute z's\n\n   z_low = C\n\n   z_high_candidate = s - 1\n\n   z_high = min(z_high_candidate, D)\n\n   if z_high < z_low:\n\n       count_z = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       count_z = z_high - z_low + 1\n\n   total += count_y * count_z\n\nOutput total.\n\nWait, but wait: What if s_max is larger than B + C? No, because s_max is B + C.\n\nBut let's test with some examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: 1 2 3 4.\n\ns_min = 1+2=3.\n\ns_max=2+3=5.\n\nSo s ranges from 3 to 5.\n\nFor each s:\n\ns=3:\n\nlower = max(2, 3-2=1) → 2.\n\nupper = min(3, 3-1=2) → 2.\n\nso y can be 2.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_low=3, z_high_candidate=2 → which is less than 3. So count_z=0.\n\nSo contributes 0.\n\ns=4:\n\nlower = max(2,4-2=2) → 2.\n\nupper = min(3,4-1=3) →3.\n\ny can be 2,3 → count_y=2.\n\nz_low=3, z_high_candidate=3. So z can be 3,4 (since D=4). min(3,4)=3. So z_high=3.\n\ncount_z=3-3+1=1.\n\ncontribution: 2*1=2.\n\ns=5:\n\nlower = max(2,5-2=3) →3.\n\nupper = min(3,5-1=4) →3.\n\nso y=3.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=4.\n\nz_high=min(4,4)=4.\n\ncount_z=4-3+1=2.\n\ncontribution:1*2=2.\n\nTotal is 0+2+2=4. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: '1 2 2 5' → output is 3.\n\nCompute s_min=1+2=3, s_max=2+2=4.\n\ns=3:\n\nlower = max(2,3-2=1) →2.\n\nupper = min(2,3-1=2) →2.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=2.\n\nz_high = min(5,2) =2.\n\nsince 2 >= C=2, count_z=2-2+1=1.\n\ncontribution 1*1=1.\n\ns=4:\n\nlower = max(2,4-2=2) →2.\n\nupper = min(2,4-1=3) →2.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=3.\n\nz_high=min(5,3)=3.\n\ncount_z=3-2+1=2.\n\ncontribution 1*2=2.\n\ntotal is 1+2=3. Which matches.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\ns_min=500000+500000=1e6.\n\ns_max=500000+500000=1e6.\n\nOnly s=1e6.\n\nlower = max(5e5, 1e6 -5e5=5e5) →5e5.\n\nupper = min(5e5, 1e6 -5e5=5e5) →5e5.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=5e6-1? Wait, s=1e6, s-1=999,999.\n\nz_high = min(5e5, 999,999) →5e5.\n\nz_low=5e5.\n\ncount_z=5e5 -5e5 +1=1.\n\ncontribution 1*1=1.\n\nSo total is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where A=B=C=D.\n\nLike A=2, B=2, C=2, D=2.\n\ns_min=4, s_max=4.\n\ns=4.\n\nlower = max(2,4-2=2) →2.\n\nupper = min(2,4-2=2) →2.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=3. z_high = min(2,3) =2.\n\nz_low=2.\n\ncount_z=1.\n\ntotal=1*1=1.\n\nWhich is correct: the triangle is (2,2,2).\n\nAnother case: A=3, B=5, C=5, D=10.\n\ns_min=8, s_max=10.\n\nFor s=8:\n\nlower = max(5,8-5=3) →5.\n\nupper = min(5,8-3=5) →5.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=7. z_high = min(10,7)=7.\n\nz_low=5.\n\ncount_z=7-5+1=3.\n\nContribution 3.\n\ns=9:\n\nlower = max(5,9-5=4) →5.\n\nupper = min(5,9-3=6) →5.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=8.\n\nz_high=8.\n\ncount_z=8-5+1=4.\n\ncontribution 4.\n\ns=10:\n\nlower = max(5,10-5=5) →5.\n\nupper = min(5,10-3=7) →5.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=9.\n\nz_high=9.\n\ncount_z=9-5+1=5.\n\ncontribution 5.\n\nTotal is 3+4+5=12.\n\nBut wait, let's compute the actual triplets.\n\nx can be 3,4,5.\n\nWait, no, x is in [3,5], so x can be 3,4,5.\n\nWait, no, wait: A=3, B=5. So x is from 3 to5.\n\nBut y is from B=5 to C=5. So y is 5.\n\nz is from 5 to 10.\n\nSo for each x in 3,4,5:\n\ny=5.\n\ns=x+5.\n\nSo for x=3: s=8.\n\nz can be 5 to 7 →3 options.\n\nx=4: s=9.\n\nz can be 5 to 8 →4 options.\n\nx=5: s=10.\n\nz can be 5 to9 →5 options.\n\nTotal 3+4+5=12. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm correctly counts this.\n\nAnother edge case: when x + y is less than C.\n\nFor example, A=1, B=2, C=4, D=5.\n\nSo x can be 1 or 2, y can be 2,3,4.\n\ns_min=3, s_max=6.\n\nFor s=3:\n\nlower = max(2,3-2=1) →2.\n\nupper = min(4,3-1=2) →2.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=2. Since C=4>2, count_z=0.\n\nSo contribution 0.\n\nSimilarly, for s=4:\n\nlower = max(2,4-2=2) →2.\n\nupper = min(4,4-1=3) →3.\n\ny can be 2,3.\n\ncount_y=2.\n\nz_high_candidate=3 <4 →count_z=0.\n\nContribution 0.\n\ns=5:\n\nlower = max(2,5-2=3) →3.\n\nupper = min(4,5-1=4) →4.\n\ny can be 3,4.\n\ncount_y=2.\n\nz_high_candidate=4.\n\nz_high = min(5,4)=4.\n\nSince 4 >=4, count_z=4-4+1=1.\n\nSo contribution 2*1=2.\n\ns=6:\n\nlower = max(2,6-2=4) →4.\n\nupper = min(4,6-1=5) →4.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=5.\n\nz_high = min(5,5)=5.\n\ncount_z=5-4+1=2.\n\ncontribution 2.\n\nTotal is 0+0+2+2=4.\n\nLet's list all possible triplets:\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\ny can be 2,3,4.\n\nz can be4 or5.\n\nBut we need x + y > z.\n\nLooking for all possible triplets:\n\nPossible (x,y,z):\n\nFor x=1, y=2: s=3. z must be <3. But z starts at 4. So no.\n\nx=1, y=3: s=4. z must be <4. So no.\n\nx=1, y=4: s=5. z can be4,5. But 1+4=5, so z must be <5. So z can be4.\n\nSo triplet (1,4,4): 1+4>4? 5>4 → yes.\n\nSo count 1.\n\nx=2, y=2: s=4. z must be <4. So no.\n\nx=2, y=3: s=5. z can be4,5. Check 2+3=5>4 → yes. So z=4,5.\n\nWait, 2+3=5>4 → yes, and 5>4? Yes. Wait, wait, wait: 2+3=5>4: yes.\n\nSo for z=4: 2+3>4 →5>4 → yes.\n\nz=5: 2+3=5>5? No, because it's not strictly greater. So only z=4 is allowed.\n\nWait, wait: 2+3>4 → 5>4 → yes. So z=4 is allowed.\n\nSo triplet (2,3,4).\n\nSimilarly, z=5: 2+3=5 is not >5, so no.\n\nSo for x=2, y=3: only z=4.\n\nx=2, y=4: s=6. z can be4 or5.\n\nCheck 2+4=6>4 → yes.\n\n2+4=6>5 → yes.\n\nSo for z=4: 6>4.\n\nz=5: 6>5.\n\nSo both are allowed.\n\nSo triplets (2,4,4) and (2,4,5).\n\nSo total triplets:\n\n(1,4,4), (2,3,4), (2,4,4), (2,4,5).\n\nThat's 4 triplets. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, thinking about how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe need to read four integers A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B.\n\ns_max = B + C.\n\nThen, for each s from s_min to s_max inclusive:\n\ncompute lower = max(B, s - B).\n\nupper = min(C, s - A).\n\nif lower > upper: continue.\n\ncount_y = upper - lower + 1.\n\nCompute z_low = C.\n\nz_high_candidate = s - 1.\n\nz_high = min(z_high_candidate, D).\n\nif z_high < z_low: count_z = 0.\n\nelse: count_z = z_high - z_low + 1.\n\nAdd count_y * count_z to the total.\n\nFinally, print the total.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\ns_min = A + B\n\ns_max = B + C\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n    lower = max(B, s - B)\n\n    upper = min(C, s - A)\n\n    if lower > upper:\n\n        continue\n\n    count_y = upper - lower + 1\n\n    z_low = C\n\n    z_high_candidate = s - 1\n\n    z_high = min(z_high_candidate, D)\n\n    if z_high < z_low:\n\n        count_z = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        count_z = z_high - z_low + 1\n\n    total += count_y * count_z\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait: what if s_min is greater than s_max? That can't happen because A <= B <= C, so A+B <= B+C.\n\nYes, because A <= B implies A + B <= B + B, and B + B <= B + C (since C >= B). So s_min is always <= s_max.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when s is very small, like s_min, but s - A could be larger than C, making upper = C.\n\nOr when s is very large, but s - B may be larger than C.\n\nBut the code handles that.\n\nTesting with the samples.\n\nSample 1: 1 2 3 4.\n\ns runs 3,4,5.\n\nAs before, code gives 4.\n\nSample 2: 1 2 2 5.\n\ns runs 3,4.\n\ns=3: lower=2, upper=2. count_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=2.\n\nz_high = min(2,5) =2.\n\ncount_z=1.\n\nSo 1*1=1.\n\ns=4: lower=2, upper=2.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=3.\n\nz_high=3.\n\ncount_z=3-2+1=2.\n\nSo 1*2=2.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nSample3: 5e5 5e5 5e5 5e5.\n\ns=1e6.\n\nlower=5e5.\n\nupper=5e5.\n\ncount_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=999,999.\n\nz_high=5e5.\n\ncount_z=5e5 -5e5 +1=1.\n\nTotal 1.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case where A=3, B=5, C=5, D=10.\n\ns runs from 8 to 10.\n\ns=8: lower=5, upper=5 → count_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=7. z_high=7.\n\ncount_z=7-5+1=3.\n\ns=9: lower=5, upper=5 →count_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=8 → count_z=4.\n\ns=10: lower=5, upper=5 →count_y=1.\n\nz_high_candidate=9 → count_z=5.\n\nTotal 3+4+5=12.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's think about handling very large numbers. Since A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, and s can be up to 1e6, the loop is manageable.\n\nIn Python, looping from s_min to s_max is acceptable as it's O(1e6) steps, which is fine.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nRead the input as four integers.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B.\n\ns_max = B + C.\n\nThen loop s in range(s_min, s_max + 1).\n\nCompute lower and upper.\n\nIf lower > upper, skip.\n\nElse, compute count_y.\n\nCompute z_low = C.\n\nz_high_candidate = s - 1.\n\nz_high = min(z_high_candidate, D).\n\nif z_high < z_low: count_z=0.\n\nelse: count_z = z_high - z_low + 1.\n\nAdd count_y * count_z to total.\n\nFinally, print(total).\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that can be formed with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side, which simplifies to \\(x + y > z\\) given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Constraints**: The sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) must lie within specific ranges: \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\), \\(B \\leq y \\leq C\\), and \\(C \\leq z \\leq D\\).\n2. **Sum Range**: For each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\), determine the valid range of \\(z\\) such that \\(C \\leq z \\leq \\min(D, s-1)\\). This ensures \\(z\\) is within its allowed range and forms a valid triangle.\n3. **Efficient Counting**: Instead of iterating through all possible values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), we iterate over possible sums \\(s\\) and count valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for each \\(s\\). For each valid \\(s\\), compute the number of valid \\(z\\) values and accumulate the total count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\ns_min = A + B\ns_max = B + C\ntotal = 0\n\nfor s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n    lower = max(B, s - B)\n    upper = min(C, s - A)\n    if lower > upper:\n        continue\n    count_y = upper - lower + 1\n    z_low = C\n    z_high_candidate = s - 1\n    z_high = min(z_high_candidate, D)\n    if z_high < z_low:\n        count_z = 0\n    else:\n        count_z = z_high - z_low + 1\n    total += count_y * count_z\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sum Calculation**: For each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\) from \\(A+B\\) to \\(B+C\\), calculate the valid range of \\(y\\) such that \\(x\\) lies within \\([A, B]\\).\n2. **Range Check**: For each sum \\(s\\), determine the valid range for \\(y\\) and count how many such \\(y\\) values exist.\n3. **Z Range Check**: For each valid \\(s\\), determine the valid range for \\(z\\) starting from \\(C\\) up to \\(\\min(D, s-1)\\) and count how many such \\(z\\) values exist.\n4. **Accumulate Counts**: Multiply the counts of valid \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) values for each \\(s\\) and accumulate the total.\n\nThis approach efficiently reduces the problem complexity by leveraging mathematical properties and ranges, ensuring the solution is optimal even for large input sizes.",
