He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I need to output how many such numbers there are and list them in order.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, and higher multiples contribute more. So, the formula for trailing zeros is sum(n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ...) until the division is zero.\n\nSo, my task is to find all n's where this sum equals m. But wait, it's possible that multiple consecutive n's give the same count. For example, after 5!, which gives 1 zero, 6! also gives 1, but 7! still gives 1 as well. So there might be a range of n's that satisfy the condition.\n\nThe approach would be to find the smallest n where the trailing zeros are equal to m, and then check if the next numbers also give the same count. The question is, how far can this go?\n\nI think the maximum number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. So, for a given m, there might be a range of n's that all have exactly m zeros. My goal is to find all these n's.\n\nWait, let's think about how the trailing zeros function behaves. It's a non-decreasing function. Once you hit a multiple of 5, the count increases. But between multiples, it might stay the same for a few steps before increasing again.\n\nFor instance, 24! has (24/5)+(24/25) = 4 + 0 = 4 zeros. 25! adds another 5 (since 25/5=5), so 5+5=10? Wait no, 25! is 25/5=5, 25/25=1, so total 6 zeros.\n\nWait, maybe I should test some examples. Let's take m=5:\n\nLooking at the sample input, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Let's see why.\n\n5! has 1 zero (from 5).\n6! same as 5! because 6 doesn't add a 5.\nWait, 5! is 120, 6! is 720, both have 1 zero? No, wait 5! has one zero, 6! has one as well because 6 doesn't contribute any 5s. So why does the sample output include 5,6,7,8,9?\n\nAh, wait the sample input is '1' and '5'—wait, no, looking back, the sample input is ['1', '5'] but perhaps that's a typo. Wait, the problem says the sample input is '1' and '5' as separate lines? Or maybe it's a list of two m's? No, the problem statement shows the sample input as ['1','5'], but perhaps it's a single line with m=5.\n\nWait the problem's note says in the first sample, m=1, n can be 5. But the sample output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' for m=1? Or wait, the sample output shows for m=1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, that can't be right because 5! has 1 zero, but 6! also has 1, 7! has 1, etc., up to 9!.\n\nYes, because 10! adds another 5, so 10! will have 2 zeros. So for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo, the idea is that the function f(n) = trailing zeros in n! increases by 1 each time n crosses a multiple of 5, but sometimes jumps more.\n\nBut sometimes, when n crosses a multiple of 25, it adds two 5s, etc.\n\nSo, for a given m, we need to find all n where f(n) = m.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the lower bound: the smallest n where f(n) >= m.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for m=5, the minimal n is 25, but wait no, 25! has 6 trailing zeros. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the function f(n) correctly.\n\nLet me compute f(n) for various n:\n\nn | f(n)\n--- | ---\n1 | 0\n2 | 0\n3 | 0\n4 | 0\n5 | 1\n6 | 1\n7 | 1\n8 | 1\n9 | 1\n10 | 2\n11 | 2\n12 | 2\n13 | 2\n14 | 2\n15 | 3\n16 | 3\n17 | 3\n18 | 3\n19 | 3\n20 | 4\n21 |4\n22|4\n23|4\n24|4\n25|6\n26|6\n27|6\n28|6\n29|6\n30|7\n\nSo for m=5, there is no n because f(n) jumps from 4 (n=24) to 6 (n=25). Wait, no, wait 24 has 4, 25 has 6. So m=5 has no solution.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, when m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. So for m=1, f(n)=1 for n=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo how do I find the range of n's for a given m?\n\nI think the correct approach is:\n\n- Find the minimal n where f(n) = m.\n\n- Then, check how many consecutive n's after that also have f(n)=m. Because when you pass a multiple of 5, the trailing zeros increase, but sometimes, the next n may not immediately increase the count.\n\nWait, for example, when you reach a multiple of 5, say 25, f(n) increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So between 24 and 25, the count goes from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there's no solution.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n_low such that f(n_low) = m.\n\n2. Check if f(n_low +1) is still m. If yes, proceed to find the upper bound.\n\n3. The upper bound is the largest n_high where f(n_high) = m. But since the function f(n) is non-decreasing, once f(n_high) > m, we stop.\n\n4. The range is [n_low, n_high], but only if n_low <= n_high.\n\nWait, but how to compute n_low and n_high?\n\nWell, for n_low, we can perform a binary search over possible n's to find the smallest n where f(n) = m.\n\nSimilarly, for n_high, we can find the largest n where f(n) = m.\n\nOnce we have both, the count is n_high - n_low + 1.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, implement a function to compute f(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that works.\n\nThen, for a given m, find the minimal n_low such that count_zeros(n_low) = m.\n\nWait, but what if m is 0? But according to the problem statement, m >=1.\n\nWait, the input constraints say m >=1.\n\nSo, for m=1, the minimal n is 5.\n\nNow, the issue is, how to find n_low and n_high.\n\nFor n_low, we can start from 1 and incrementally compute f(n) until it reaches m. But for large m, this could be slow.\n\nAlternatively, use binary search.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible n for m up to 1e5?\n\nEach step of 5 contributes at least one zero, so for m=1e5, the minimal n is 5*m, which is 5e5. Wait, no, because higher powers of 5 contribute more.\n\nWait, 5^k contributes k zeros. So for m, the maximum n required is roughly 5*m, but that's an overestimation.\n\nWait, for m=1e5, the maximum n is 5*1e5=5e5, but actually, it's less because 25 contributes two, 125 three, etc.\n\nSo, for binary search, the low can be 0 and high can be 5*m.\n\nBut let's think: for a given m, the minimal n is somewhere between 5*(m) and 5*(m-1). Wait, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to set high as 5*m, but that's arbitrary.\n\nWait, for m=5, the minimal n is 25. But 5*5=25, which is correct.\n\nWait, for m=6, the minimal n is 25, which is 5*5.\n\nHmm, perhaps setting high to 5*m is sufficient.\n\nSo, for binary search, for a given m, the minimal n_low is the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nSimilarly, for n_high, it's the largest n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nWait, but for some m, there might be no such n. Like m=5, as in the earlier example.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, for m=1, there are multiple n's. So, for m=5, perhaps there are no solutions.\n\nWait, for m=5, the minimal n is 25, which gives 6 zeros. So no solution exists.\n\nSo, the code must handle cases where no solution exists.\n\nWait, but the problem says m can be up to 1e5. So, for m=5, the output would be 0, indicating no such n exists.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For a given m, find if there exists an n where count_zeros(n) == m.\n\n- If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal and maximal n that satisfy this condition, and list all in between.\n\nSo, steps for the code:\n\n1. Read m from input.\n\n2. Compute the minimal n_low using binary search, such that count_zeros(n_low) == m.\n\n   - If during binary search, no n is found, output 0.\n\n3. Compute the maximal n_high such that count_zeros(n_high) == m.\n\n4. The numbers are from n_low to n_high, inclusive. So the count is n_high - n_low + 1.\n\n5. Output the count, followed by the numbers in order.\n\nWait, but how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, then check if it's exactly m.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, for m=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25, which gives 6>5. So, in this case, there's no solution.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\na. Use binary search to find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nb. Let candidate = this n.\n\nc. Check if count_zeros(candidate) == m.\n\nd. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find the first n where count_zeros(n) >m, subtract 1 to get the upper bound.\n\nWait, no. Because after candidate, the next numbers may have same count or higher.\n\nWait, for example, when m=1:\n\ncandidate is 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5)=1 == m.\n\nWe need to find the maximum n where count_zeros(n)=1.\n\nWhich is 9.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nOnce candidate is found, we can then look for the maximum n where count_zeros(n) == m.\n\nSo, to find the maximum n, we can perform another binary search.\n\nAlternatively, starting from candidate, keep increasing n until count_zeros(n) > m, then the previous n is the maximum.\n\nBut for large m, this could be time-consuming.\n\nSo, perhaps a better way is to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nIf that count is not equal to m, then output 0.\n\nElse, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nThen, the maximum n is (minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=m+1) -1.\n\nThus, the numbers from n_low to (max_n) are the solutions.\n\nSo, let's formalize this.\n\nCompute low = minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nif count_zeros(low) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   high = minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n   max_n = high -1.\n\n   the numbers are low to max_n, inclusive.\n\nSo, for m=1:\n\nlow is 5, since count_zeros(5)=1.\n\nhigh is 10, since count_zeros(10)=2.\n\nmax_n=10-1=9.\n\nSo, numbers from 5 to9.\n\nAnother example: m=6.\n\nlow is 25, count is 6.\n\nhigh is 30, count is 7.\n\nmax_n=29.\n\nSo, numbers 25-29.\n\nAnother example: m=2.\n\nWhat's the situation?\n\nn=6: count is 1.\n\nn=10: count is 2.\n\nWait, no. Let's calculate:\n\nn=5:1.\n\nn=6:1.\n\nn=7:1.\n\nn=8:1.\n\nn=9:1.\n\nn=10:2.\n\nWait, no, wait for m=2:\n\nthe minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=2 is 10.\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2.\n\nso, low=10.\n\nthen high is the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=3.\n\nWhich is 15.\n\nso, max_n=14.\n\nSo, numbers 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nEach of these will have count_zeros(n) =2.\n\nSo, for m=2, the output is 5 numbers.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Read m.\n\n2. Use binary search to find the smallest n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >=m.\n\n3. If count_zeros(n_low) !=m, output 0.\n\n4. Else, find the smallest n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >=m+1.\n\n5. The maximum n is n_high-1.\n\n6. The numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the solutions.\n\nSo, now, implementing this.\n\nImplementing binary search for finding n_low:\n\nThe function is monotonic, so binary search is efficient.\n\nSimilarly for n_high.\n\nImplementing count_zeros is straightforward.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- m=0: but the problem says m>=1.\n\n- m=1: as in the sample.\n\n- m=5: no solution.\n\nWait, let's compute for m=5.\n\nn_low is the smallest n where count_zeros(n)>=5.\n\nCompute for n=24: count is 4.\n\nn=25: count is 6.\n\nSo, binary search finds n_low=25, but count is 6 !=5. So, output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: m=6.\n\nn_low=25, count=6.\n\nn_high is the first n where count_zeros(n)>=7.\n\nWhich is 30.\n\nSo, numbers 25-29.\n\nSo, the code needs to correctly find these.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nNow, coding steps.\n\nFirst, implement count_zeros.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >=5:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, implement binary search for n_low.\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) //2.\n\n   cz = count_zeros(mid).\n\n   if cz < m: low = mid +1.\n\n   else: high=mid.\n\nAfter loop, low is the minimal n where count_zeros >=m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(low) ==m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSimilarly, find n_high:\n\nSet low=0, high=5*(m+1).\n\nFind the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=m+1.\n\nOnce n_high is found.\n\nThen, the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low via binary search.\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) !=m:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   compute n_high via binary search for m+1.\n\n   max_n = n_high -1.\n\n   the numbers are n_low ... max_n.\n\n   output len(list) as (max_n -n_low +1).\n\n   then, print the numbers.\n\nSo, for example, m=1:\n\nn_low=5.\n\ncount_zeros(5)=1.\n\nn_high is the first n where count_zeros(n)>=2.\n\nWhich is 10.\n\nmax_n=9.\n\nSo, output 5 numbers:5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut wait, for m=0, which is not allowed.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, m >=1.\n\nSo, code can proceed.\n\nNow, testing.\n\nTest case 1: m=1.\n\nn_low=5.\n\nn_high is 10.\n\nNumbers:5,6,7,8,9.\n\nOutput: 5 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWait, but the sample output for m=1 is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\".\n\nWait, the sample input is a list containing '1' and '5'? Or perhaps the sample input is a single integer.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the input is an integer m.\n\nWait, in the sample input, perhaps it's a typo, and the sample input is m=5.\n\nNo, the note says the sample input is 1 and 5 as separate inputs. Or perhaps it's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the sample input is written as ['1','5'], but perhaps it's a mistake. Looking back:\n\nIn the sample input section, it says:\n\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\nBut the sample output is for m=1, which produces 5 numbers, and for m=5, which outputs 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases.\n\nSo, for input 1, output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nFor input 5, output is 0.\n\nSo, in code, it's handling each m separately.\n\nSo, code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nn_low is 25, count=6 !=5.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until \\( n \\) divided by 5^k is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound (n_low)**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound (n_high)**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: If the count of trailing zeros at n_low is exactly \\( m \\), then the valid range of \\( n \\) values is from n_low to n_high - 1. If not, there are no such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    max_n = n_high - 1\n    numbers = list(range(n_low, max_n + 1))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by repeatedly dividing \\( n \\) by 5 and summing the quotients.\n- **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is at least the given target.\n- **Main Logic**: After determining the lower bound \\( n_low \\) and checking if it exactly meets the trailing zero count \\( m \\), the upper bound \\( n_high \\) is found. The valid \\( n \\) values are from \\( n_low \\) to \\( n_high - 1 \\), which are then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
