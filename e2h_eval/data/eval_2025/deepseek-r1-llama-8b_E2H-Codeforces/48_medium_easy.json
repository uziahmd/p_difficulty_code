He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to convert a number from base a to base b, but the catch is that when the second part is 'R', it means that the target base is the Roman numeral system. So, the problem has two main parts: converting numbers to and from Roman numerals.\n\nLet me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the input has multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing a and b. Then, there's a line with c in base a. My task is to convert c into base b, considering that if b is 'R', then I need to represent the number as a Roman numeral.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is read each test case correctly. For each case:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is 'R', then the output will be a Roman numeral. Otherwise, output the number in base b as a string.\n2. Read the number c which is given in base a. It might have leading zeros, but we need to process it correctly.\n\nThe steps I need to perform are:\n\nFor each test case:\n- Parse a and b. If b is 'R', then the target is Roman; else, it's a numerical base.\n- Parse the number c in base a. So, I'll need a function to convert a string in base a to an integer.\n- Once I have the integer value, if the target is a number (not R), I need to convert it to base b as a string without leading zeros.\n- If the target is Roman, I need to convert the integer to a Roman numeral string.\n\nSo, I think I should write three functions:\n1. One to convert a string in any base to an integer.\n2. Another to convert an integer to a Roman numeral.\n3. And another to convert an integer to a string in a given base.\n\nWait, but for bases higher than 10, letters are used. So, when converting to base b (if not R), the digits above 9 will be represented by letters A (10), B (11), etc. So, the function to convert to base b needs to handle digits beyond 9, using the appropriate characters.\n\nLet me think about each function.\n\nFirst, the function to convert a string in base a to an integer. This is straightforward. For each character in the string, multiply the current total by a and add the value of the digit. But since the input could have leading zeros, the function should handle that.\n\nSecond, the function to convert an integer to a Roman numeral. This is a bit more involved because of the specific rules for subtractive notation (like IV for 4, IX for 9, etc.). Also, the representation depends on the order of the symbols and their values. I remember that Roman numerals use certain patterns based on the digit's place. So, I'll need to create a list of tuples that map the integer values to their corresponding Roman symbols, following the subtractive rules.\n\nThird, the function to convert an integer to a string in a given base. This function will handle bases up to 25, so digits can go up to 25. For each digit, if it's less than 10, use the corresponding number as a string. If it's 10 or higher, use 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, and so on.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps for each function.\n\nFunction 1: str_to_int(s, base)\n- Initialize result to 0.\n- For each char in s:\n   - Get its value (digit).\n   - result = result * base + digit_value\n- Return result.\n\nBut wait, what about the digits? For example, in base a, each character represents a digit. So, for a base 10, '0' is 0, '1' is 1, etc. But how are the characters represented when base > 10?\n\nIn the input, the number c is given as a string in base a. So, each character is a valid digit in base a. For example, in base 16, the digits can be 0-9 and A-F. So, the function needs to correctly parse each character into its numerical value.\n\nSo, for each character in the string s, the function will map it to its value. For example, 'A' in base 16 is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. Also, uppercase letters are allowed? Or does the input use lowercase? The problem statement doesn't specify, but looking at the sample input, in one case the output is 'A'. So perhaps the input uses uppercase letters. But the code needs to handle both cases? Or maybe the input is always uppercase. Wait, the sample input shows 'A' as the output, but the input for that case was '12 13\\nA'—so the input for c is 'A' which is being treated as 10 in base 13. So yes, the function must interpret 'A' as 10 in any base >=10.\n\nSo, the helper function to get the digit value for a character is needed. For a given character, return its numeric value. So, for '0'-'9', it's their integer value. For letters, 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, up to 'Z' (but the problem says the maximum base is 25, so 'Z' is 35, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the base can be up to 25. So, the maximum digit is 25, which would correspond to 'P' (since 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, ..., 'P' is 25). So, any letter beyond 'P' isn't allowed in the input.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. So, each character in c is a valid digit in base a. So, for a base a, the digits allowed are 0 to a-1. So, for example, if a is 16, the digits can be 0-15, represented as 0-9, A-F.\n\nSo, the function to convert a character to its value is:\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\nBecause 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, etc.\n\nSo, for each character in the string, we get its value and accumulate the total.\n\nWait, but for the leading zeros: for example, in the sample input, one of the cases is '2 2\\n1111001'. So, the string is '1111001' in base 2, which is 1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + ... etc. So, the function handles leading zeros correctly.\n\nSo, the first function is manageable.\n\nFunction 2: int_to_roman(num)\nThis function converts a given integer to its Roman numeral representation.\n\nI know that Roman numerals have specific patterns. The standard approach is to create a list of pairs, where each pair is (value, symbol). The list should be ordered from highest to lowest. For example, M(1000), CM(900), D(500), CD(400), C(100), XC(90), L(50), XL(40), X(10), IX(9), V(5), IV(4), I(1).\n\nSo, the function can be built by iterating through these pairs, subtracting the value from the number and appending the symbols accordingly.\n\nSo, the function will look like this:\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    roman_num = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            roman_num += r\n            num -= i\n    return roman_num\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nFunction 3: int_to_base(n, base)\nThis function converts a given integer n to a string representation in base 'base'. The string should have no leading zeros.\n\nFor example, if n is 0, return '0'.\n\nOtherwise, for n >=0:\n\nWe can repeatedly divide n by the base, collecting the remainders. These remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits.\n\nBut we have to handle the case when the base is greater than 10. In that case, digits 10-25 are represented by 'A'-'Z' respectively.\n\nSo, for each remainder:\n\nif remainder <10: append str(remainder)\nelse: append chr(ord('A') + (remainder -10))\n\nSo, for example, remainder 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc.\n\nWait, but the input c can be up to 101510, which is manageable.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nSo, function steps:\n\nif n ==0: return '0'\n\nelse:\n\ndigits = []\n\nwhile n>0:\n\n    rem = n % base\n\n    if rem <10:\n\n        digits.append(str(rem))\n\n    else:\n\n        digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem -10))\n\n    n = n // base\n\nThen, reverse the digits and join.\n\nWait, but let's test this with an example.\n\nFor example, n=5, base=2.\n\n5 divided by 2 is 2, rem 1.\n\n2 divided by 2 is 1, rem 0.\n\n1 divided by 2 is 0, rem 1.\n\nDigits collected are [1,0,1], reversed gives 101, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=10, base=13.\n\n10 divided by 13 is 0, rem 10. So digit is 'A'. So output is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample input.\n\nAnother example: n=4, base=2: 100, but wait, no. Wait, n=4 in binary is 100. Let's see:\n\nn=4, base=2.\n\n4//2 = 2, rem 0.\n\n2//2 =1, rem 0.\n\n1//2=0, rem 1.\n\nDigits are [0,0,1]. Reversed, 100.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the function seems correct.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, for the overall problem:\n\nRead each test case.\n\nEach test case is two lines: the first line is a and b, the second line is c in base a.\n\nSo, the input is read line by line. Wait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', ...].\n\nWait, perhaps each test case is a pair of lines: the first line is a and b, the second is c in base a.\n\nSo, for each test case, I need to read two lines: the first is a and b, the second is c.\n\nWait, but how many test cases are there? Looking at the sample input, it's five test cases, each with two lines.\n\nSo, the code needs to read lines until EOF, processing each two lines as a test case.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   read a_line = input().strip()\n\n   split into a and b.\n\n   a = int(a_line[0])\n\n   b = a_line[1]\n\nWait, no, the first line is a and b separated by space. So, for example, '10 2' is a=10, b=2.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—wait, no, looking at the sample input description:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWait, perhaps each line is a single string, but the actual input is given as multiple lines, each representing a test case.\n\nSo, the code should read lines until there are no more.\n\nBut in Python, reading from stdin can be done via:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\nthen, process lines in pairs.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as:\n\nlines = []\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    lines.append(line.strip())\n\ntest_cases = []\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n    if i+1 >= len(lines):\n        # incomplete test case?\n        # but according to the problem statement, each test case is complete\n        break\n    case = lines[i]\n    next_case = lines[i+1]\n    test_cases.append( (case, next_case) )\n\nThen, for each test case:\n\nprocess the a and b, then process c.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\ns_a_b = test_case[0].split()\na = int(s_a_b[0])\nb = s_a_b[1]  # can be 'R' or a number\n\nc_str = test_case[1].strip()\n\nThen, process c_str as a number in base a.\n\nCompute its integer value.\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert the integer to Roman.\n\nElse, convert the integer to base b as a string.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the conversion of c_str to integer.\n\nBut wait, c_str can be a very long string (up to 103 digits). So, the function to convert it must be efficient.\n\nSo, the function to convert from base a string to integer.\n\nImplementing that:\n\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n\n    value = 0\n\n    for c in s:\n\n        digit = char_to_value(c)\n\n        value = value * base + digit\n\n    return value\n\nBut wait, what if the string is empty? But the problem says that c is a non-zero number, so the string is not empty.\n\nBut in code, we have to make sure that.\n\nAlso, leading zeros are allowed in the input, but when outputting, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nSo, the function will correctly process leading zeros.\n\nWait, for example, '00101' in base 2 is 5, same as '101'.\n\nSo, the function handles it.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: a=2, b=2, c='0' → output '0'.\n\nCase 2: a=2, c is '1111001' (binary 1*64 + 1*32 + 1*16 + 1*8 + 0*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 64+32+16+8+1=121). So, in base 2, it's '1111001' → output same.\n\nCase 3: a=10, c='123' → 123 in base 10. If b is 2, output is '1111011'.\n\nAnother case: c is 'M' in base 10 → which is invalid because 'M' is not a digit in base 10. Wait, no. Wait, the function is called with base a, but in the problem statement, c is a number in base a. So, the function expects that each character in c is a valid digit in base a.\n\nSo, in the code, during the conversion, if any character is invalid, it will throw an error. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the input is correct.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nImplement the helper functions.\n\nNow, testing the functions.\n\nTesting str_to_int:\n\nTest case: c_str = '5', a=2. So, 5 in binary is 101.\n\nstr_to_int('101', 2) → 1*4 + 0*2 +1 → 5.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting int_to_roman(4) → 'IV'.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting int_to_roman(5) → 'V'.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting int_to_roman(9) → 'IX'.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting int_to_roman(10) → 'X'.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting int_to_base(5, 2) → '101'.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting int_to_base(5, 13) → '5' in base 13 is 5, which is '5'.\n\nWait, but 5 in base 13 is represented as '5' because 5<13.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: 26 in base 13 is 2*13 + 0 → '20'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 26 in decimal is 2*13 + 0, so in base 13, it's '20'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: 30 in base 16 → 1E.\n\nWait, 30 /16 is 1, remainder 14 → 'E'.\n\nSo, '1E'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the functions seem correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the overall code.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess each test case as two consecutive lines.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nParse a and b from the first line.\n\nParse c_str from the second line.\n\nConvert c_str from base a to integer.\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert the integer to Roman and print.\n\nElse, convert the integer to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\nWait, but what if the integer is zero? According to the problem statement, c is not zero. So, no need to handle that.\n\nNow, let's implement the helper functions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nImplement char_to_value:\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        # uppercase\n        c_upper = c.upper()\n        return 10 + ord(c_upper) - ord('A')\n\nImplement str_to_int:\n\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        digit = char_to_value(c)\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nImplement int_to_roman:\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    roman_num = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            roman_num += r\n            num -= i\n    return roman_num\n\nImplement int_to_base:\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but in the case where the base is larger than 10, and the number is 0, but according to the problem statement, c is not zero. So, the function returns '0' only when n is zero, which is allowed.\n\nBut since c is non-zero, the function will not return '0' for n=0 except when the original c is zero, which is not possible.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the input c is non-zero, but in the code, we have to handle it. So, the function returns '0' only when n is zero.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input c is non-zero, so the function will not receive n=0 unless it's after conversion.\n\nWait, for example, if a=2 and c is '0', but the problem statement says that c is non-zero. So, the function is safe.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead all the lines, process them in pairs.\n\nFor each pair, extract a and b, then c_str.\n\nConvert c_str to integer.\n\nCheck if b is 'R' → convert to Roman.\n\nElse, convert to base b as a string.\n\nPrint the result.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        c_upper = c.upper()\n        return 10 + ord(c_upper) - ord('A')\n\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        digit = char_to_value(c)\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    roman_num = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            roman_num += r\n            num -= i\n    return roman_num\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef main():\n    lines = []\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        lines.append(line.strip())\n    test_cases = []\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        if i+1 >= len(lines):\n            break  # incomplete, but problem says no\n        a_b = lines[i].split()\n        a = int(a_b[0])\n        b = a_b[1]\n        c_str = lines[i+1].strip()\n        test_cases.append( (a, b, c_str) )\n    \n    for a, b, c_str in test_cases:\n        # Convert c_str to integer\n        try:\n            num = str_to_int(c_str, a)\n        except:\n            # According to problem statement, input is valid\n            pass\n        \n        if b == 'R':\n            print(int_to_roman(num))\n        else:\n            # Check if b is a number, else error\n            # But according to the problem, b is either R or a number\n            # So, cast to int\n            b_int = int(b)\n            print(int_to_base(num, b_int))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, when b is 'R', it's converted to Roman. Else, it's converted to base b as a string.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nSo, the code processes each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nIn the first test case:\n\na=10, b=2, c_str='1'.\n\nstr_to_int('1',10) is 1.\n\nSince b is 2, output is int_to_base(1,2) → '1'.\n\nSecond test case:\n\na=16, b='R', c_str='5'.\n\nnum is 5.\n\nb is 'R' → output is 'V'.\n\nThird test case:\n\na=5, b='R', c_str='4'.\n\nnum=4 → 'IV'.\n\nFourth test case:\n\na=2, b=2, c_str='1111001' → binary 121.\n\nint_to_base(121, 2) → '1111001'.\n\nFifth test case:\n\na=12, b=13, c_str='A' → in base 12, 'A' is 10.\n\nnum=10.\n\nb=13 → output is 'A'.\n\nSo, sample output is as given.\n\nNow, let's see if the code handles these.\n\nTesting the fifth case:\n\nc_str is 'A', a=12.\n\nchar_to_value('A') → 10.\n\nnum = 10.\n\nb is 13.\n\nint_to_base(10,13) → 10 <13 → 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: c_str is 'II' in base 3.\n\nstr_to_int('II',3) is 2*3 +2= 8.\n\nint_to_base(8,10) → '8'.\n\nAnother test case: c_str is 'III' in base 5 → 3*5 +3=18.\n\nConvert to base 10 → '18'.\n\nAnother case: when b is 1. Wait, but according to the problem statement, b is at least 2. Because in the input constraints, b is ≥2.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So, no, in code, when b is 'R', it's handled. Else, it's a number, and since 2 ≤ b ≤25, so no problem.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling leading zeros in the output. The function int_to_base returns no leading zeros, except when n is zero, which is not possible as per the problem statement.\n\n- Correctly parsing 'R' as Roman numerals.\n\n- Correctly handling the case where the converted number is zero. But according to the problem statement, c is non-zero, so no issue.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when the number is exactly a power of the base. For example, 8 in base 2 is 1000.\n\nTesting this in code: int_to_base(8,2) → '1000'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when the number is 25 in base 26. It should be '25'? No, wait, in base 26, 25 is represented as 'P' (since 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, ..., 'P' is 25). So, int_to_base(25,26) → 'P'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when the number is 26 in base 26 → 1*26 + 0 → '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nI think the code covers all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, considering that the target base can be either a standard numerical base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves reading multiple test cases, each containing a number in a given base and converting it to the target base, which can be either a numerical base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case is provided in two lines: the first line specifies the source base (a) and the target base (b), and the second line provides the number in base a.\n2. **Conversion Functions**:\n   - **str_to_int**: Converts a string in a given base to an integer.\n   - **int_to_roman**: Converts an integer to its Roman numeral representation.\n   - **int_to_base**: Converts an integer to a string representation in a specified base, handling bases up to 25 using letters for digits beyond 9.\n3. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, convert the given number from base a to an integer, then determine if the target base is Roman numerals or a numerical base. Convert the integer accordingly and print the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        c_upper = c.upper()\n        return 10 + ord(c_upper) - ord('A')\n\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        digit = char_to_value(c)\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    roman_num = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            roman_num += r\n            num -= i\n    return roman_num\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef main():\n    lines = []\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        lines.append(line.strip())\n    test_cases = []\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        if i + 1 >= len(lines):\n            break\n        a_b = lines[i].split()\n        a = int(a_b[0])\n        b = a_b[1]\n        c_str = lines[i+1].strip()\n        test_cases.append((a, b, c_str))\n    \n    for a, b, c_str in test_cases:\n        num = str_to_int(c_str, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            print(int_to_roman(num))\n        else:\n            b_int = int(b)\n            print(int_to_base(num, b_int))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads all input lines at once and processes them in pairs, each pair representing a test case.\n- **Conversion Functions**: \n  - `char_to_value` converts a character to its corresponding integer value, handling both digits and letters.\n  - `str_to_int` converts a string in a given base to an integer by iterating over each character and accumulating the total value.\n  - `int_to_roman` converts an integer to a Roman numeral string using predefined values and their corresponding symbols.\n  - `int_to_base` converts an integer to a string in a specified base, using letters for bases higher than 10.\n- **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the number is converted from the source base to an integer.
