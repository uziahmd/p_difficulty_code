    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then determine the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among such graphs with that minimum number of nodes.\n\nLet me first understand what a p-reachable directed graph is. So, a p-reachable graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v, u and v are reachable from each other. So, these pairs form an undirected edge between u and v in the underlying undirected graph. But since it's a directed graph, for each such pair, there's a path in both directions, but not necessarily a direct edge.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the definition says that u and v are reachable from each other. So for each such pair, u can reach v and v can reach u. So in the undirected sense, they are connected. The p refers to the number of such edges in the undirected graph.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: find a graph where the number of edges in the underlying undirected graph is exactly p, and we want to minimize the number of nodes. Then, for the minimal node count, arrange the edges in such a way that the number of unidirectional pairs (which are directed edges that are not part of any mutual reachability) is maximized.\n\nHmm, so first, let's think about the minimal number of nodes. For a given p, what's the smallest n such that the maximum number of edges in an undirected graph with n nodes is at least p? Because the undirected graph must have exactly p edges, right? Because each edge contributes to one pair (u, v) where u < v, and they are reachable.\n\nWait, no. Because in the directed graph, each pair (u, v) where u can reach v and v can reach u implies that u < v or v < u. But when considering all such pairs, each undirected edge corresponds to exactly one such ordered pair. So the total number of such ordered pairs is equal to the number of edges in the underlying undirected graph. So p is equal to the number of edges in the undirected version of the directed graph.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to finding an undirected graph with exactly p edges, and we need the minimal n such that the maximal number of edges in an undirected graph with n nodes is >= p. Because the underlying undirected graph must have exactly p edges.\n\nWait, no. Because for any directed graph that is p-reachable, its underlying undirected graph has exactly p edges. Because each such edge represents a mutual reachable pair (u, v) where u can reach v and v can reach u, which forms an edge in the undirected graph.\n\nSo, to find the minimal n, we need to find the smallest n where the maximum possible number of edges in an undirected graph is at least p. Wait, but the maximum number of edges in an undirected graph with n nodes is n*(n-1)/2. So, we need the smallest n where n*(n-1)/2 >= p.\n\nWait, no, because the directed graph must be such that the undirected version has exactly p edges. So for example, if p=3, n=3 is possible because 3*(3-1)/2=3. So the minimal n is the smallest integer such that n(n-1)/2 >= p. That makes sense.\n\nWait, let's test the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: p=3\n\nThe minimal n is 3 because 3*2/2=3 >=3.\n\nSample Input 2: p=4\n\nn=3: 3 edges max. So 3 is not enough. So n=4, since 4*3/2=6>=4. So minimal n is 4.\n\nSample Input 3: p=0. So we need a graph with 0 edges. So n=1, because 1 node has 0 edges, and that's the minimal.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's see:\n\nIn the sample, for p=3, output is 3 nodes and 0 unidirectional pairs. So that graph is a complete undirected graph, where each edge is bidirectional. So all edges are mutual, hence no unidirectional pairs.\n\nBut wait, in the directed graph, the unidirectional pairs are those (u, v) where u can reach v but v cannot reach u. So in a complete undirected graph, every edge is bidirectional, so the number of unidirectional pairs is zero.\n\nSo, for the minimal n, the structure of the graph that maximizes unidirectional pairs would be one where as many edges as possible are unidirectional. But wait, in the undirected graph, each edge is bidirectional, so in the directed graph, each edge can be either present in both directions or only one. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among such graphs with that minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, and both can reach each other. This implies that the underlying undirected graph must have exactly `p` edges.\n2. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The smallest number of nodes `n` such that the maximum number of edges in an undirected graph with `n` nodes is at least `p`. This is given by the smallest `n` where `n*(n-1)/2 >= p`.\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: For the minimal `n`, construct a graph where as many edges as possible are unidirectional. This is achieved by making the graph as \"directed\" as possible, ensuring that for each edge, one direction is present without the reverse.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_min_nodes(p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return (1, 0)\n    n = 1\n    while True:\n        max_edges = n * (n - 1) // 2\n        if max_edges >= p:\n            break\n        n += 1\n    return n\n\ndef compute_max_uni(n):\n    # To maximize unidirectional, make as many edges as possible unidirectional\n    # So arrange the edges in a way that each added edge is only one way\n    # The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (n*(n-1)//2 - p) + p\n    # Wait, no.
