Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm. So, the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d where every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The street is a line from 0 to l. Each lantern i is at position ai. The area it covers is [ai - d, ai + d], but we have to make sure that this doesn't go beyond 0 or l. Wait, no—actually, since the street is from 0 to l, any part of the coverage beyond those points is irrelevant. So for each lantern, its effective coverage is the maximum between 0 and (ai -d) as the start, and the minimum between l and (ai +d) as the end. But wait, actually, if a lantern is at ai, then its coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). But the entire street needs to be covered by the union of all these intervals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the street is a continuous line, so the union of all intervals must cover [0, l]. So, for the street to be completely lit, every point x in [0, l] must be covered by at least one lantern's interval.\n\nSo, how can we compute the minimal d?\n\nHmm. One approach is to find the maximum gap between adjacent lanterns, considering their coverage, and set d so that these gaps are covered.\n\nBut wait, the lanterns might not be sorted. So first, perhaps we should sort the lantern positions.\n\nYes, because the coverage depends on the positions relative to each other. Sorting will help identify the critical points where the coverage might be insufficient.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort all lantern positions in increasing order.\n2. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the distance between them.\n3. The minimal required d must be such that the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns' coverage is covered. That is, the distance between two lanterns' positions minus the sum of their individual d's must be covered by the next lantern.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: after sorting, the coverage of each lantern is [ai -d, ai +d]. The street is [0, l], so we need to ensure that 0 is covered by the leftmost lantern, and l is covered by the rightmost lantern. Also, between any two consecutive lanterns, the distance between them should be less than or equal to 2d. Otherwise, there's a gap in coverage.\n\nWait, no. Because each lantern contributes to the coverage, the combined coverage may overlap enough to fill any gaps.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the largest distance between two consecutive lanterns when they are as far apart as possible, but also considering the edges.\n\nLet me think: after sorting the lantern positions, the minimal d must satisfy that the distance between each consecutive pair is <= 2d. But also, the first lantern must cover from 0, and the last must cover to l.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Sort the lanterns' positions in ascending order.\n- Check if the first lantern's left coverage (ai[0] -d) is >= 0. Similarly, the last lantern's right coverage (ai[-1] +d) must be <= l.\n- For each consecutive pair, the distance between them must be <= 2d.\n- So, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n   a) The required d to cover the beginning: (ai[0] - 0)/2. Because ai[0] -d >=0 implies d <= ai[0], but wait, no. Wait, ai[0] -d >=0 → d <= ai[0]. Similarly, ai[0] +d >=0 is always true since ai[0] is >=0 and d is positive. So to cover the beginning, we need ai[0] -d >=0 → d ≤ ai[0]. Wait, but that's only one condition. However, for the end, we need ai[-1] +d >= l → d ≥ l - ai[-1].\n\nSimilarly, for the middle parts, the distance between consecutive lanterns must be <= 2d. So the minimal d must satisfy d >= (distance between two consecutive lanterns)/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- (l - ai[-1]) → to cover the end.\n- (ai[0] - 0) / 2? Or wait, no. Wait, to cover 0, the first lantern's left coverage must be >=0. So ai[0] -d >=0 → d <= ai[0]. But since we're trying to find the minimal d that works, perhaps it's better to see what's the necessary condition.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let's re-express:\n\nThe first lantern must cover from 0. So, the earliest point it covers is ai[0] -d. To cover 0, ai[0] -d must be <=0. Because 0 is on the street. Wait, no: the lantern's coverage is [ai -d, ai +d], but the street is from 0 to l. So, if ai -d is <=0, then 0 is covered. Similarly, if ai +d >= l, then l is covered.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 0 is on the street. So, for 0 to be covered, there must be a lantern whose coverage includes 0. So, for some lantern i, 0 >= ai_i -d → d >= ai_i -0 = ai_i.\n\nSimilarly, for l to be covered, there must be a lantern j where l <= aj +d → d >= l - aj.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the minimal d must be at least the maximum of (aj +d >= l) and (ai_i -d <=0) for some i and j.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with my earlier approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum of three values:\n\n1. The distance from the leftmost lantern to 0, divided by 2. Because the leftmost lantern's coverage must reach 0. So, ai[0] -d <=0 → d >= ai[0]. No, that's not correct. Wait, ai[0] is the position. So, for the leftmost lantern to cover 0, we must have 0 >= ai[0] -d → d >= ai[0] -0 → d >= ai[0]. Wait, no, because 0 is to the left of ai[0]. So, for 0 to be covered by ai[0], we need 0 <= ai[0] +d. Which is always true since d is positive and ai[0] is >=0. So that's not an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The coverage of a lantern is all points within d distance. So, the leftmost point covered is ai -d, and the rightmost is ai +d.\n\nBut the street starts at 0 and ends at l. So, for 0 to be covered by any lantern, there must be a lantern i such that 0 >= ai_i -d → d >= ai_i. Because ai_i -d <=0 → 0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly, for l to be covered, there must be a lantern j such that l <= aj +d → d >= l - aj.\n\nSo, the minimal d must be at least the maximum of all (ai_i) and (l - aj), but that's probably not correct because it's possible that multiple lanterns contribute.\n\nWait, no. Because it's sufficient for any lantern to cover 0, and any lantern to cover l. So the minimal d is the maximum between the minimal d needed to cover 0 and the minimal d needed to cover l.\n\nWait, no. Because even if a lantern covers 0, perhaps another lantern covers l, but the middle parts may have gaps.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum of:\n\n- The distance from the first lantern to 0, which is ai[0], but that's not correct. Because the first lantern's coverage is ai[0] -d to ai[0] +d. For 0 to be covered, 0 must be in [ai[0]-d, ai[0]+d]. So 0 >= ai[0] -d → d >= ai[0]. So, the minimal d to cover 0 is ai[0].\n\nWait, no. If ai[0] is 5, then to cover 0, d must be at least 5. Because 5 -d <=0 → d >=5.\n\nSimilarly, for l to be covered, the lantern furthest to the right must have aj +d >= l → d >= l - aj.\n\nWait, but maybe another lantern can cover l. For example, suppose the lanterns are at positions 3 and 8, and l is 10. Then, for 10 to be covered, either the first lantern (3) would require d >=7 (3+7=10), or the second (8) requires d>=2 (10-8=2). So, the minimal d to cover l is 2.\n\nSo, the minimal d to cover 0 is the position of the first lantern, and the minimal d to cover l is l - position of the last lantern.\n\nWait, no. Because the first lantern could be at position 5, but another lantern at position 0 can cover 0 with a smaller d. So, perhaps I should find the minimal d that covers 0 and the minimal d that covers l, and take the maximum of those two.\n\nBut wait, it's possible that a single lantern covers both 0 and l. Like, if a lantern is at position l/2, then d must be at least l/2 to cover both 0 and l.\n\nSo, the minimal d to cover 0 is the minimal distance from any lantern to 0, which is ai_i. Because for a lantern at ai_i, the distance from 0 is ai_i. So, to cover 0, you need d >= ai_i. So the minimal d to cover 0 is the minimal ai_i among all lanterns.\n\nWait, no. Because if a lantern is at position ai_i, then the distance from 0 to that lantern is ai_i. So, to cover 0, the lantern's coverage must include 0, which requires that ai_i -d <=0 → d >= ai_i.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Wait, the coverage is [ai_i -d, ai_i +d]. So 0 is covered if 0 >= ai_i -d → d >= ai_i.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case. Suppose ai_i is 5, d is 3. Then 5 -3 =2>0. So 0 is not covered. So to cover 0, the lantern's coverage must include 0, which requires that 0 >= ai_i -d → d >= ai_i.\n\nSo, for a lantern to cover 0, d must be at least ai_i.\n\nSo, the minimal d to cover 0 is the minimal ai_i, because that's the smallest possible d needed to cover 0. Because if you choose a lantern closer to 0, you can have a smaller d.\n\nWait, no. Because if you have a lantern at position 5, to cover 0, you need d >=5. But another lantern at position 3 would allow d=3 to cover 0.\n\nSo, yes, the minimal d to cover 0 is the minimal ai_i among all lanterns.\n\nSimilarly, the minimal d to cover l is (l - max_aj), where max_aj is the maximum aj among all lanterns. Because to cover l, a lantern's coverage must reach l, which requires d >= l - aj.\n\nWait, no. For a lantern at aj, to cover l, we need aj +d >= l → d >= l - aj.\n\nSo, the minimal d to cover l is l - max_aj, since max_aj is the largest aj, making l - max_aj the smallest possible value.\n\nSo, the minimal d must be at least the maximum of the minimal d for 0 and for l.\n\nBut wait, that's not all. Because there could be gaps in between.\n\nSo, besides the edges, we also need to make sure that between any two lanterns, the coverage overlaps enough.\n\nFor example, consider two lanterns at positions 0 and 10, and l=15. Then, the first lantern covers up to d, the second covers from 10-d to 20. But for l=15 to be covered, the second lantern's coverage must reach 15, which requires d >=5 (since 10 +d >=15 → d >=5). Also, the first lantern's coverage must reach 0, which it does with d >=0.\n\nBut between 0 and 10, if d is 5, then the first lantern covers 0-5 and 0+5=5. The second covers 5 (10-5) to 15. So the entire street from 0 to 15 is covered.\n\nWait, but what if d is 3? Then the first lantern covers 0-3 to 3. The second covers 7 to 13. So the street from 0 to 3 is covered, 7 to13 is covered, but 3 to7 is not. So, the street isn't fully lit.\n\nSo, the minimal d is 5, which is the maximum between 5 (for covering l) and 0 (for covering 0), but also the distance between 0 and10 is 10, which is 2*5, so that's covered.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal d is determined by the maximum of:\n\n- (max_aj - l): no, wait. Wait, in this case, the max_aj is 10, l is 15. l - max_aj is 5. So, to cover l, d must be at least 5.\n\nSo, the minimal d is 5, which is the maximum between 5 (from l) and the first lantern's position (0, which is less than 5). And also, the distance between the two lanterns is 10, which is 2*5. So, that's acceptable.\n\nSo, in general, the minimal d must be the maximum of:\n\n1. The minimal d to cover 0: which is the minimal ai_i.\n   Wait, no. Because for 0 to be covered, the lantern's coverage must include 0. So, the minimal d for 0 is the minimal ai_i, because choosing a lantern closer to 0 allows a smaller d.\n\n   Wait, no. Because for a lantern at ai_i, d must be >= ai_i to cover 0. So, the minimal d to cover 0 is the minimal ai_i. Because if you have a lantern at position 3, then d can be 3. But if you have another lantern at position 5, you'd need d >=5 to cover 0 via that lantern, but using the first one, you can have d=3.\n\nSo, the minimal d to cover 0 is the minimal ai_i.\n\nSimilarly, the minimal d to cover l is (l - max_aj).\n\nAdditionally, for any two consecutive lanterns, the distance between them must be <= 2d. Because, otherwise, there's a gap between their coverages.\n\nSo, the minimal d must also be >= (distance between two consecutive lanterns) / 2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nSo, the overall minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- minimal d for 0: min_ai\n- minimal d for l: (l - max_ai)\n- (max_gap / 2) where max_gap is the maximum distance between any two consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, but the minimal d is the maximum of these three values.\n\nBecause:\n\n- To cover 0, you need d >= min_ai.\n- To cover l, you need d >= (l - max_ai).\n- To cover the gaps between lanterns, for any two consecutive lanterns, the distance between them must be <= 2d. So, d must be >= (distance) / 2 for each pair.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of min_ai, (l - max_ai), and (max_distance_between_consecutive_lanterns) / 2.\n\nWait, but wait. What if the first lantern is already covering 0, but the next is at some distance away. So, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum of (min_ai, (l - max_ai), max_consecutivedistance/2).\n\nBut wait, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of (max_consecutivedistance/2, min(min_ai, (l - max_ai))).\n\nNo, because sometimes the minimal d for covering 0 or l could be larger than the required for the gaps.\n\nSo, the correct way is to compute:\n\nd_candidate1 = min_ai → to cover 0.\nd_candidate2 = (l - max_ai) → to cover l.\nd_candidate3 = max_consecutivedistance / 2 → to cover the gaps between lanterns.\n\nThen, the minimal d is the maximum of these three candidates.\n\nBecause:\n\n- If d is at least candidate1, then 0 is covered.\n- If d is at least candidate2, then l is covered.\n- If d is at least candidate3, then all gaps are covered.\n\nSo, the overall minimal d is the maximum of candidate1, candidate2, and candidate3.\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is at position 0? Then min_ai is 0, and d_candidate1 is 0. But 0 is covered without needing any d.\n\nWait, no. Because if a lantern is at 0, then to cover 0, d can be 0, but that's allowed. So, the minimal d is 0, but that's not useful because the lantern's coverage is 0 (radius 0) but the street may not be covered elsewhere.\n\nWait, no. Because if the lantern is at 0, then for d=0, it covers exactly 0. So, the rest of the street may or may not be covered by other lanterns.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal d must be determined by other factors.\n\nSo, the logic is: the minimal d is the maximum of the three candidates.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and l.\n2. Read the list of ai.\n3. Sort the ai list.\n4. Compute min_ai = min(ai)\n5. Compute max_ai = max(ai)\n6. Compute d_cover_0 = min_ai\n7. Compute d_cover_l = l - max_ai\n8. Compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n   - Iterate through the sorted list, for each i from 1 to n-1, compute ai[i] - ai[i-1]\n   - Find the maximum gap.\n9. d_gap = max_gap / 2\n10. Compute d = max(d_cover_0, d_cover_l, d_gap)\n\nWait, but wait. What about the case where the minimal d is determined by the gaps, but not the edges?\n\nLike, suppose the first lantern is at 0, the last at l. Then, d_cover_0 is 0, d_cover_l is 0. But the gaps between lanterns may require a larger d.\n\nFor example, n=2, l=100. ai = [0, 50]. Then, the first lantern covers 0 to d, the second covers 50-d to 100 +d. But wait, no, the second lantern is at 50. So, its coverage is 50 -d to 50 +d. For the entire street to be covered, the coverage of the first lantern must reach at least 50 -d, and the second must reach from 50 -d to 50 +d, which may overlap.\n\nWait, but in this case, the first lantern's coverage is 0 to d. The second's is 50-d to 50+d. So, the entire street is covered if 50 -d <=d → 50 <= 2d → d >=25.\n\nSo, the minimal d is 25, which is the maximum of the three candidates:\n\nd_cover_0 is 0, d_cover_l is 0, and the gap between 0 and50 is50, so d_gap=25.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nAnother test case from the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo, ai after sorting is [2,5].\n\nd_cover_0 is 2, because the first lantern is at 2, so to cover 0, d must be at least 2.\n\nd_cover_l is 5-5=0.\n\nThe gap between 2 and5 is 3. So, d_gap =3/2=1.5.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of 2, 0, 1.5 → 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case from the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, ai is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nd_cover_0 is 0.\n\nd_cover_l is 15-15=0.\n\nCompute the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0=3 → gap is 3 → d_gap=1.5\n\n5-3=2 → d_gap=1\n\n7-5=2 → 1\n\n9-7=2 →1\n\n14-9=5 →2.5\n\n15-14=1 →0.5\n\nSo, the maximum gap is5, so d_gap=5/2=2.5.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of 0,0,2.5 → 2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll sort the ai list.\n\nThen, compute min_ai and max_ai.\n\nCompute d_cover_0 = min_ai.\n\nCompute d_cover_l = l - max_ai.\n\nIf d_cover_l is negative, then it's zero? Or can it be negative?\n\nWait, l is the end of the street. So, the lantern's coverage must reach l.\n\nSo, for the last lantern, aj = max_ai.\n\nWe need aj +d >= l → d >= l - aj.\n\nBut if aj >=l, then d can be zero because aj +d >=l is automatically true.\n\nWait, no. Because if aj is greater than l, then adding d (which is positive) makes it even larger. So, for the last lantern, d_cover_l is max(0, l - aj).\n\nWait, no. Because if aj > l, then l - aj is negative. So, d >= negative number is always true. So, for d_cover_l, we can compute it as max(0, l - max_ai).\n\nBecause if max_ai is beyond l, then d_cover_l is zero.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nd_cover_l = max(0, l - max_ai)\n\nSimilarly, for d_cover_0, it's max(0, min_ai). Because if min_ai is zero, then d_cover_0 is zero.\n\nWait, no. Because if min_ai is zero, then to cover 0, d can be zero.\n\nWait, no. Because the coverage of a lantern at 0 with d=0 is just 0. So, if the first lantern is at 0, then d_cover_0 is zero, but the rest of the street may not be covered. So, that's why we also need to consider the gaps.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nd_cover_0 = max(0, min_ai)\n\nd_cover_l = max(0, l - max_ai)\n\nWait, but in the sample input 2, min_ai is 2, so d_cover_0 is 2.\n\nIn sample input 1, min_ai is 0, so d_cover_0 is 0.\n\nBut in that case, the rest of the street is covered by other lanterns.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nSort the ai.\n\nCompute min_ai = min(ai)\n\nmax_ai = max(ai)\n\nCompute d_cover_0 = max(0, min_ai)\n\nd_cover_l = max(0, l - max_ai)\n\nCompute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nFind the maximum gap.\n\nd_gap = max_gap / 2\n\nd = max(d_cover_0, d_cover_l, d_gap)\n\nSo, now, in code.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no lanterns? But according to the constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nWait, the problem says n >=1.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the ai as a list of integers.\n\nSort the ai.\n\nCompute min_ai = ai[0]\n\nmax_ai = ai[-1]\n\nCompute d_cover_0 = max(0, min_ai)\n\nd_cover_l = max(0, l - max_ai)\n\nCompute the gaps:\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, len(ai)):\n\n    gap = ai[i] - ai[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nd_gap = max_gap / 2\n\nd = max(d_cover_0, d_cover_l, d_gap)\n\nThen, print d with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, but what if n=1?\n\nLike, n=1, l=5, ai=[3]\n\nThen, d_cover_0 is 3, d_cover_l is 5-3=2. So, d must be at least 3, because to cover 0, it's 3, which is larger than 2.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, ai=0, l=5.\n\nThen, d_cover_0 is 0, d_cover_l is 5.\n\nThe gap is zero (since only one lantern). So, d is max(0,5, 0) →5.\n\nWhich is correct, because the lantern at 0 with d=5 covers 0 to5, which covers the entire street.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, ai=5, l=5.\n\nThen, d_cover_0 is5, d_cover_l is0. So, d is5.\n\nWhich is correct, as the lantern at5 with d=5 covers 0 to10, but l is5, so it's covered.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when the lanterns are in the middle, and the required d is determined by the gaps.\n\nLike, n=3, ai = [1,4,6], l=10.\n\nd_cover_0 is1, d_cover_l is10-6=4.\n\nThe gaps between 1 and4 is3 →d_gap 1.5.\n\nBetween4 and6 is2 →1.\n\nSo, the maximum gap is3 →d_gap=1.5.\n\nSo, the minimal d is max(1,4,1.5) →4.\n\nBut wait, with d=4, the coverage is:\n\n Lantern 1:1-4=-3 →0 (since street starts at 0) and 5.\n\n Lantern4:4-4=0 and 8.\n\n Lantern6:6-4=2 and 10.\n\nSo, the street is covered from 0 to 10.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the middle part between 6 and10? Wait, no, the lantern at6 with d=4 covers up to 10.\n\nSo, the entire street is covered.\n\nBut let's see:\n\n Lantern6's coverage is 2 to10.\n\n Lantern4's coverage is 0 to8.\n\n Lantern1's coverage is -3 (so 0) to5.\n\nSo, combined, the street is fully covered.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, ai=[1,3], l=5.\n\nd_cover_0 is1, d_cover_l is5-3=2.\n\nThe gap is2, so d_gap=1.\n\nSo, the minimal d is max(1,2,1) →2.\n\nSo, d=2.\n\nCheck coverage:\n\n Lantern1: -1 (so 0) to3.\n\n Lantern3:1 to5.\n\nSo, the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, ai=[0,5,10], l=10.\n\nd_cover_0 is0.\n\nd_cover_l is10-10=0.\n\nGaps:5-0=5 →d_gap 2.5; 10-5=5 →2.5.\n\nSo, d is max(0,0,2.5)=2.5.\n\nCoverage:\n\n Lantern0: -2.5 (0) to 2.5.\n\n Lantern5:2.5 to7.5.\n\n Lantern10:7.5 to12.5 (but l is10, so up to10).\n\nCombined, 0 to2.5 is covered by first, 2.5 to7.5 by second, 7.5 to10 by third.\n\nSo, the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nEdge cases:\n\n- All lanterns are at 0: n=1000, ai all 0.\n\nThen, d_cover_0 is0, d_cover_l is l, and gaps are0.\n\nSo, d is max(0, l, 0) → l.\n\nWhich is correct because with d=l, the first lantern covers 0 to l, covering the entire street.\n\nAnother edge case: l=0. But according to constraints, l is at least1.\n\nWait, problem statement says 1 ≤ l ≤ 109.\n\nSo, no.\n\nAnother case: n=1, ai=0, l=0. Not possible, since l is at least1.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nImplement steps:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute min_ai and max_ai.\n\nCompute d_cover_0 and d_cover_l.\n\nCompute gaps between consecutive elements, find the maximum gap.\n\nd_gap is max_gap /2.\n\nd is the maximum of the three.\n\nPrint d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, code.\n\nTesting sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → after sorting: 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nd_cover_0 is0.\n\nd_cover_l is15-15=0.\n\ngaps:3,2,2,2,5,1 → max gap 5 →d_gap 2.5.\n\nSo, d=2.5.\n\nSample Output 1: 2.5000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5].\n\nd_cover_0=2.\n\nd_cover_l=5-5=0.\n\ngaps=3 →d_gap 1.5.\n\nSo, d=2.\n\nSample Output 2:2.0000000000.\n\nSo, code works for samples.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nRead n, l.\n\nThen, read the ai.\n\nSort.\n\nCompute min_ai, max_ai.\n\nCompute d_cover_0 = max(0, min_ai).\n\nd_cover_l = max(0, l - max_ai).\n\nCompute max_gap:\n\nif n ==1:\n\n   max_gap is 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   loop through the sorted list, compute gaps.\n\nd_gap = max_gap / 2.\n\nd = max(d_cover_0, d_cover_l, d_gap).\n\nPrint d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\nai.sort()\nmin_ai = ai[0]\nmax_ai = ai[-1]\n\nd_cover_0 = max(0, min_ai)\nd_cover_l = max(0, l - max_ai)\n\nif n ==1:\n    max_gap =0\nelse:\n    max_gap =0\n    for i in range(1, len(ai)):\n        gap = ai[i] - ai[i-1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\nd_gap = max_gap /2\n\nd = max(d_cover_0, d_cover_l, d_gap)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but in the case where n==1, the max_gap is zero, which is correct.\n\nTesting n=1, ai=[5], l=10.\n\nd_cover_0=5, d_cover_l=10-5=5.\n\nd_gap=0.\n\nSo, d=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nAnother edge case: when all lanterns are same position.\n\nn=1000, ai all 5.\n\nd_cover_0=5, d_cover_l= l-5.\n\ngaps are 0.\n\nSo, d is max(5, l-5, 0).\n\nIf l is 10, then d is max(5,5,0) →5.\n\nWhich is correct because the single lantern at5 with d=5 covers 0 to10.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, ai=[1,4,6], l=10.\n\nAs before, d_cover_0=1, d_cover_l=4, max_gap=5 →d_gap=2.5.\n\nd is4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street light up the entire street. The street is represented as a straight line from 0 to \\( l \\), and each lantern lights up all points within a distance \\( d \\) from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps in efficiently determining the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Coverage for Edges**: \n   - Compute the minimum radius needed to cover the start of the street (0) using the closest lantern to 0.\n   - Compute the minimum radius needed to cover the end of the street (\\( l \\)) using the farthest lantern from \\( l \\).\n3. **Compute Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: Determine the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns. The radius \\( d \\) must be large enough to cover these gaps.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum value among the three computed values: the coverage needed for the start, the coverage needed for the end, and half the largest gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\nai.sort()\n\nmin_ai = ai[0]\nmax_ai = ai[-1]\n\nd_cover_0 = max(0, min_ai)\nd_cover_l = max(0, l - max_ai)\n\nif n == 1:\n    max_gap = 0\nelse:\n    max_gap = 0\n    for i in range(1, len(ai)):\n        gap = ai[i] - ai[i-1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n\nd_gap = max_gap / 2\n\nd = max(d_cover_0, d_cover_l, d_gap)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns \\( n \\) and the length of the street \\( l \\), followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Edge Coverage**: The minimum radius needed to cover the start and end of the street is determined by the closest and farthest lanterns respectively.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: The largest gap between consecutive lanterns is found, and half of this gap gives the required radius to cover the gap.\n5. **Result**: The final radius \\( d \\) is the maximum of the three computed values to ensure the entire street is covered.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required by considering both the edge coverage and the gaps between lanterns.",
