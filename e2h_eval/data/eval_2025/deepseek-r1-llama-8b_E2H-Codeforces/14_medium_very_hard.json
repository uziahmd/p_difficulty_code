He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I need to output how many such numbers there are and the list of those numbers in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n, because there are always enough 2s to pair with the 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division result is zero.\n\nSo the task is to find all n where this sum equals m. But how do I find the possible n's?\n\nWait, the function that counts trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases. That means once n crosses a certain point, the count jumps by more than one. So for a given m, there might be either zero, one, or multiple n's that yield exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the count can sometimes increase by more than one when n increases by 1. For example, consider n=24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0. So total is 4. Then n=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, so total is 6. So between 24 and 25, the trailing zeros jump from 4 to 6, skipping 5. So for m=5, there's no n such that n! has exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nAh, right. So for some m, there may be no solution, like m=5 in the example. Wait, in the sample input, the first test case is '1' which outputs '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', meaning that n can be 5,6,7,8,9 each giving exactly 1 trailing zero. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 5! is 120, which has one zero. 6! is 720, also one zero? No, wait, 6! is 720— two zeros. Oh wait, wait, no, 5! is 120 (one zero), 6! is 720 (one zero?), no, 720 ends with one zero? No, wait 720 is 720, which ends with a single zero. Wait, no, 720 divided by 10 is 72, so it has one trailing zero. Oh right, 10 is 10, 100 is two, 1000 is three, etc. So 6! is 720, which has one trailing zero.\n\nWait, let me calculate:\n\n5! = 120 → 1 zero\n6! = 720 → 1 zero\n7! = 5040 → 1 zero?\nWait, 5040 ends with one zero. Yes.\n8! = 40320 → 1 zero? No, 40320 ends with one zero? Wait 40320 divided by 10 is 4032, so yes, one zero. Wait, but 9! is 362880 → one zero. And 10! is 3628800 → two zeros. So for m=1, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9. Because each of these gives exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\nSo the sample shows that for m=1, there are 5 values of n. For m=5, there are zero.\n\nSo the approach is to find all n where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But since the function is non-decreasing, there might be a range of n's that all give the same m.\n\nBut how do I find that range?\n\nI think I can use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds where the count equals m.\n\nWait, but the function is not strictly increasing. For example, at n=24, count is 4. At n=25, it's 6. So between n=24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6, missing 5. So for m=5, there's no solution.\n\nSo the idea is to find all n where the count is m. So we can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where the count is m, and the largest n where the count is m. Then, if such n exists, all numbers between them inclusive will also have the count equal to m.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, when m=6, n=25 gives count 6. What about n=26? Let's see: 26/5=5, 26/25=1, 26/125=0. So 5+1=6. So 26 also gives 6. Similarly, 27,28,29,30: wait, 30/5=6, 30/25=1, 30/125=0. So 6+1=7. So for m=6, the numbers 25-29 all have count 6, while 30 jumps to 7.\n\nSo for m=6, the possible n's are 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the smallest n_low such that the count is m.\n2. Find the largest n_high such that the count is m.\n3. If n_low exceeds n_high, then there are no solutions.\n4. Otherwise, the number of solutions is n_high - n_low + 1.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nWe can use binary search to find the minimal n that gives count >= m, but then we have to check if that n actually gives count == m. Similarly, find the maximal n where count <= m, but again check if it's equal to m.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nFind the first n where count is m, then find the last n where count is m.\n\nSo for each m, the n's that satisfy form a contiguous range.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of m and the last occurrence?\n\nAlternatively, since the count function is monotonic, once the count reaches m, it remains m until some point where it jumps to m+1 or higher. So the possible n's are all the n's where count(n) = m.\n\nSo, to find the start and end points of this interval.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n where count(n) == m.\n- Find the maximal n where count(n) == m.\n- The count between min and max will all be m.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, suppose that for some n, count(n) = m. Then, for n+1, count(n+1) could be m or higher. So the set of n's where count(n) = m is [a, b], where a is the first n with count m, and b is the last n with count m.\n\nSo the approach is to find a and b, then the number of solutions is b-a+1.\n\nIf a > b, then no solution.\n\nSo how to compute a and b.\n\nTo find a, the smallest n where count(n) == m.\n\nTo find b, the largest n where count(n) == m.\n\nOnce I have a and b, the answer is the list from a to b.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute a and b.\n\nAn efficient way is needed, as m can be up to 1e5, but even higher in the code.\n\nWait, but for m up to 1e5, n can be up to roughly 5*m, but I'm not sure. Let's see:\n\nEach 5 contributes one zero, each 25 contributes an extra, etc. So for m=1e5, n is approximately 5*(m) * 1, but considering higher exponents, maybe n is around 5e5 or something.\n\nWait, for m=1e5, the count function would be:\n\ncount(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + n//625 + ... \n\nSo solving for n where this sum is 1e5.\n\nBut regardless, binary search is feasible here.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a helper function that calculates the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\nThen, perform a binary search to find the smallest a where count(a) >= m. Once found, check if count(a) == m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nSimilarly, find the largest b where count(b) <= m. Then check if count(b) == m.\n\nWait, no. Because for the binary search, the initial approach may not capture all cases correctly.\n\nAlternatively, find a using binary search as the minimal n where count(n) == m.\n\nWait, but binary search can be used to find the leftmost occurrence where count(n) >= m, but that's not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the lower bound and upper bound of n where count(n) is m.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find the first occurrence of m and the last occurrence.\n\nWait, for the first occurrence a:\n\nWe can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where count(n) == m.\n\nBut how? Because the count function is not strictly increasing, but in most cases, it's non-decreasing.\n\nWait, but for n, the count can stay the same or increase as n increases.\n\nSo, for example, n=5: count=1. n=6: count=1. So the count remains same until n=10, where it becomes 2.\n\nSo to find a, the first n where count(n) == m, we can look for the minimal n where count(n) >= m, but then verify if the count is exactly m.\n\nBecause, if the minimal n where count(n) >= m has a count greater than m, then there's no solution.\n\nSimilarly for the upper bound.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Use binary search to find the minimal n where count(n) >= m.\n\n   a. If count(n) > m, then no solution exists, return 0.\n\n   b. Else, find the minimal a where count(a) == m.\n\n2. Similarly, find the maximal b where count(b) == m.\n\n   a. How? We can perform another binary search for the maximal n where count(n) <= m, but then check if count(n) == m.\n\nAlternatively, find the minimal n where count(n) > m, then subtract 1 to get the maximum b.\n\nWait, that's a clever approach.\n\nFor example, to find the maximum b where count(b) == m:\n\nFind the smallest c where count(c) > m. Then b = c-1.\n\nBecause the count function is non-decreasing, all numbers before c have count <= m. So the maximum b is c-1.\n\nBut we need to ensure that count(b) == m.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Compute a as the minimal n where count(n) >= m and count(n) == m.\n\n- Compute c as the minimal n where count(n) > m.\n\n- Then b = c-1.\n\nBut only if count(b) == m.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nCompute a:\n\nUse binary search to find the first n where count(n) >= m.\n\nIf count(n) != m, then no solution.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nCompute c:\n\nAgain, binary search for the first n where count(n) > m.\n\nThen, b = c-1.\n\nBut we need to ensure that count(b) == m.\n\nIf count(b) < m, then no solution.\n\nWait, but that shouldn't happen because a was found correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in the case where a is found, but after a, the count remains m until c.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck a: if count(a) != m, then no solution.\n\nElse, find c as the first n where count(n) > m.\n\nSet b = c-1.\n\nCheck if count(b) == m.\n\nIf yes, then the numbers are a to b.\n\nElse, no solution.\n\nWait, but in the case where a is found, count(a) is m, and c is the first n where count is >m, then for all numbers between a and c-1, count is m.\n\nSo b is c-1, and count(b) must be m.\n\nSo in code:\n\nCompute a via binary search for the first n where count(n) >= m.\n\nIf count(a) != m: return 0.\n\nElse, compute c as the first n where count(n) > m.\n\nb = c-1.\n\nIf count(b) != m: return 0.\n\nElse, the numbers are a to b.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nImplement a function to count trailing zeros.\n\nImplement binary search for a and c.\n\nNow, the binary search functions:\n\nFunction to find the first n where count(n) >= target.\n\nIn Python, for binary search, the low can be 0, high can be a large enough number, say 5*(target*2) or something.\n\nWait, what's the maximum possible n for a given m?\n\nEach step adds at least 1 to the count, but sometimes more.\n\nSo for m=1e5, n could be up to 5e5, but perhaps 5e5 is a safe upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, since each 5^k contributes more, perhaps a higher upper bound is needed.\n\nBut perhaps for binary search, setting a high value that's definitely higher than any possible n for m up to 1e5.\n\nLike, 5e5 should suffice, because for m=1e5, the count is 1e5, which is achieved around n=5e5.\n\nWait, let's think: count(n) = n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... \n\nWhich is less than n/4. So for m=1e5, n is about 4*m, so 4e5 is sufficient.\n\nBut perhaps setting high as 5e5 is safer.\n\nSo, in the binary search, the low can be 0, high can be 5e5.\n\nBut what about larger m? Well, the constraints say m is up to 1e5, so 5e5 is enough.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    res = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n // 5\n\n        res += n\n\n    return res\n\ndef find_first_ge(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m  # Or some higher value.\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        c = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if c >= m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nSimilarly, for finding the first n where count(n) > m:\n\ndef find_first_gt(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m  # Or higher.\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        c = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if c > m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but in the function find_first_gt, the condition is c > m.\n\nSo, for example, when looking for m=6:\n\nn=25: count is 6.\n\nn=26: count is 6.\n\nn=30: count is 7.\n\nSo find_first_gt(6) should return 30.\n\nThus, b = 29.\n\nSo, in code:\n\na = find_first_ge(m)\n\nif count_zeros(a) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    c = find_first_gt(m)\n\n    b = c -1\n\n    if count_zeros(b) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        print(b - a +1, ' '.join(map(str, range(a, b+1))))\n\nWait, but in the case where m=0, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\nWait, but the problem says m can be 1 to 1e5, inclusive.\n\nNow, testing for sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nCompute a: find_first_ge(1).\n\nWhat is the first n where count(n) >=1.\n\nn=5: count is 1.\n\nSo a=5.\n\nCheck count(5)=1.\n\nYes.\n\nCompute c = find_first_gt(1). It finds the first n where count(n) >1.\n\nn=10: count is 2.\n\nSo c=10.\n\nb =9.\n\nCheck count(9): 9//5=1, 9//25=0. Sum is 1. So yes.\n\nSo the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So 5 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nCompute a: find_first_ge(5). Let's see:\n\nCheck n=20: 20//5=4, 20//25=0. Total 4.\n\nn=21: 21//5=4, 21//25=0. 4.\n\nn=22: same.\n\nn=23: same.\n\nn=24: same.\n\nn=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1. 5+1=6>5.\n\nSo a is 25.\n\nBut count(25) is 6>5. So in the first step, a=25, but count(a)!=m. So output is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\na is 25, count is 6.\n\nc is 30, since 30//5=6, 30//25=1, 6+1=7>6.\n\nSo b=29.\n\nCheck count(29): 29//5=5, 29//25=1. 5+1=6.\n\nSo the numbers are 25-29, 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nCompute a: find_first_ge(2).\n\nLooking for the first n where count>=2.\n\nn=10: 10//5=2. So a=10.\n\nCheck count(10)=2.\n\nYes.\n\nCompute c: first n where count>2.\n\nn=15: 15//5=3, 15//25=0. Sum is 3>2. So c=15.\n\nb=14.\n\nCount(14): 14//5=2, 14//25=0. Sum is 2. So yes.\n\nSo the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14. 5 numbers.\n\nWait, but what about n=9: count is 1.\n\nn=10: count 2.\n\nn=11: 11//5=2.\n\nn=12: same.\n\nn=13: same.\n\nn=14: same.\n\nn=15: count is 3.\n\nSo yes, 10-14, 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, potential edge cases:\n\nCase when m=0: Not in problem constraints.\n\nCase when m=4.\n\nCompute a: find_first_ge(4).\n\nn=19: count is 3.\n\nn=20: 4.\n\nSo a=20.\n\nBut count(20) is 4.\n\nCompute c: first n where count>4.\n\nn=21: 21//5=4, 21//25=0. Sum 4.\n\nn=22: same.\n\nn=23: same.\n\nn=24: same.\n\nn=25: count is 6>4.\n\nSo c=25.\n\nb=24.\n\nCheck count(24): 4+0=4.\n\nSo numbers are 20,21,22,23,24. 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother edge case: m=7.\n\nCompute a: find_first_ge(7).\n\nLooking for the first n where count >=7.\n\nn=25: count is 6.\n\nn=26: 26//5=5, 26//25=1. 5+1=6.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1. 6+1=7.\n\nSo a=30.\n\nCheck count(30) is 7.\n\nCompute c: find_first_gt(7).\n\nLooking for first n where count>7.\n\nn=31: 31//5=6, 31//25=1. 6+1=7.\n\nn=32: same.\n\nn=33: same.\n\nn=34: same.\n\nn=35: 35//5=7, 35//25=1. 7+1=8>7. So c=35.\n\nb=34.\n\nCount(34) is 7.\n\nSo the numbers are 30,31,32,33,34: 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the functions find_first_ge and find_first_gt need to be efficient.\n\nImplementing helper functions for binary search.\n\nBut in Python, it's straightforward.\n\nBut for very large m, like 1e5, the binary search would be O(log(5e5)) which is acceptable.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nThe input is given as a string, probably split into two lines, each being the m.\n\nWait, the input is a single line containing two integers, m1 and m2, separated by space?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input description:\n\nIn the note, the input is shown as ['1', '5'], but the output is printed as two lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as a single line with two integers separated by space.\n\nBut the problem statement says:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the sample input.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nBut the output is two lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is a single line with two integers, m1 and m2.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to read two test cases, but the problem statement says \"the only line of input contains an integer m\".\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nLooking back:\n\nProblem statement:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the sample input is a typo. Because in the sample input, the output is two lines, but the problem says the input is a single m.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is a bit different.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is two test cases, but the problem statement says the input is a single integer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the input is two integers.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the input is two integers.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows two lines, but the problem says the input is a single line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is a mistake.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the sample is a misunderstanding.\n\nIn any case, the problem statement says the input is a single integer m.\n\nSo for the code, the input is a single integer m, which can be up to 1e5.\n\nSo in Python, read the input as m = int(input()).\n\nThen, compute a, c, etc.\n\nSo the code would read m, then process.\n\nBut the sample input shows two inputs, but perhaps that's a mistake.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nBut the output is two lines: first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', second line is '0'.\n\nBut that's for two different m's, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the input is two integers.\n\nBut the problem statement says the input is a single integer.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nBut perhaps in the actual problem, the input is two integers, each on separate lines, but the problem statement is ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the sample input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a list of two strings, but that's not standard.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the sample is a mistake.\n\nBut to proceed, I'll assume that the input is a single integer m.\n\nSo in code:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nThen, proceed as above.\n\nBut in the sample, the input is ['1', '5'], which is two numbers. So perhaps the problem expects two test cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is wrong and the input is two integers, m1 and m2, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says \"the only line of input contains an integer m\".\n\nHmm.\n\nWell, perhaps the sample is a mistake, and the actual problem expects a single m.\n\nBut the sample output shows two outputs, which suggests that perhaps the problem expects two m's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to read a list of m's.\n\nBut I think the problem statement is correct, and the sample is a typo.\n\nBut perhaps the code should read a single integer.\n\nBut let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer.\n\nSo the code reads m as int(input()).\n\nSo the sample input provided is likely incorrect.\n\nThus, in code, read m as a single integer.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the binary search functions.\n\nHandle the cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute a = find_first_ge(m).\n\nIf count_zeros(a) != m: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   compute c = find_first_gt(m).\n\n   b = c-1.\n\n   if count_zeros(b) != m: output 0.\n\n   else: output k = b - a +1, followed by the list a to b.\n\nBut in code, how to write the binary search functions.\n\nImplement find_first_ge(m):\n\ndef find_first_ge(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m  # initial estimate.\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt >= m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nSimilarly, find_first_gt(m):\n\ndef find_first_gt(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m  # initial estimate.\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt > m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, 5*1e5=500,000. Is that enough?\n\nProbably, because for n=5e5, count(n) = 1e5 + ... ?\n\nWait, let's compute for n=5e5:\n\n5e5 /5 = 1e5.\n\n5e5 /25 = 2e4.\n\n5e5 /125=4e3.\n\n5e5 /625= 800.\n\n5e5 /3125=160.\n\n5e5 /15625=32.\n\n5e5 /78125=6.\n\n5e5 /390625=1.\n\nTotal is 1e5 + 2e4 +4e3 +800 +160 +32 +6 +1 = 124,999.\n\nWait, so for m=124,999, n=5e5 gives count=124,999.\n\nSo for m=125,000, n=5e5 would give count= (5e5//5) + ... \n\nWait, 5e5//5=1e5.\n\n5e5//25=2e4.\n\n5e5//125=4e3.\n\n5e5//625=800.\n\n5e5//3125=160.\n\n5e5//15625=32.\n\n5e5//78125=6.\n\n5e5//390625=1.\n\nAdding these: 100000 +20000=120000; +4000=124000; +800=124800; +160=124960; +32=124992; +6=124998; +1=124999.\n\nSo for m=125000, the count is 124999, which is less than m. So the binary search needs to go higher.\n\nWait, so high=5e5 is insufficient for m=125000.\n\nWait, so perhaps high should be set higher.\n\nAlternative approach: set high to 5*(m+1)*5.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial high is 5e18, but that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, we can set high to 5e18, which is a safe upper bound for any m up to 1e18.\n\nBut for this problem, m is up to 1e5, so 5e5 is sufficient.\n\nWait, but in the earlier calculation, m=125000 requires n=5e5 gives 124999, which is less than m.\n\nSo for m=125000, the binary search will have to find a higher n.\n\nSo perhaps 5e5 is not sufficient.\n\nThus, the initial high is 5e5, but for some cases, it's not enough.\n\nSo, perhaps we should set high to 5e18.\n\nBut 5e18 is a huge number, but binary search will handle it quickly.\n\nSo, in code, set high to 5e18.\n\nSo, in the binary search functions, set high to 5e18.\n\nThus, code:\n\ndef find_first_ge(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * 10**18\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt >= m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nSimilarly for find_first_gt.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nImplement the functions, then handle the cases.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute a.\n\nIf count(a) != m: output 0.\n\nElse, compute c.\n\nb = c-1.\n\nIf count(b) != m: output 0.\n\nElse, output the numbers.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the sample, for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWait, but in the code, the output is a single line with the numbers separated by spaces, but the sample shows a new line after 5.\n\nWait, no, looking at the sample output:\n\nThe first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' — but that's probably a representation.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a single line with the numbers separated by spaces, followed by a newline.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is two lines: first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' and the second is '0'.\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample output is written as:\n\nFor m=1, the output is '5 6 7 8 9' on the first line.\n\nAnd for m=5, the output is '0'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample shows the output as two lines, which is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the sample is just a representation, and the actual code should output a single line.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement's sample, the output is:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nSo, for the first case, the output is a single line with '5 6 7 8 9' preceded by a newline, and then another line with '0'.\n\nWait, that can't be right because each test case is independent.\n\nSo perhaps the sample is incorrect, and the output is supposed to be for each m, a single line.\n\nThus, in code, for each m, the output is a single line.\n\nThus, in the code, after computing the numbers, if k is the count, print k, then print the numbers separated by spaces, each on the same line.\n\nThus, for the first case, print '5 6 7 8 9' on the first line.\n\nThus, the code should generate the correct output.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute a.\n\nIf count(a) != m: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   compute c.\n\n   b = c-1.\n\n   if count(b) !=m: print 0.\n\n   else:\n\n       print the numbers from a to b.\n\nThus, the code.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nBut for m=5, a=25, count(a)=6 !=5. So output is 0.\n\nFor m=6, a=25, count is 6. c is 30, b=29. count(29)=6. So output 5 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nWait, no, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29: 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code should output '5 25 26 27 28 29' on the first line.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\na=10, c=15, b=14.\n\nNumbers:10,11,12,13,14.\n\nThus, output '5 10 11 12 13 14'.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the functions are inside the script, but in Python, functions can't be nested in some versions, but in Python 3, they can.\n\nAlternatively, just inline the functions.\n\nBut for clarity, perhaps it's better to keep them as helper functions.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nImplement count_zeros.\n\nImplement find_first_ge and find_first_gt.\n\nCompute a, c.\n\nCheck conditions.\n\nPrint the result.\n\nThus, the full code:\n\nRead m.\n\nImplement helper functions.\n\nProceed.\n\nNow, implementing in Python.\n\nAlso, note that for large m, the binary search can take a few iterations, but it's manageable.\n\nThus, the code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    res = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        res += n\n    return res\n\ndef find_first_ge(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * 10**18\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef find_first_gt(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * 10**18\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt > m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\na = find_first_ge(m)\nif count_zeros(a) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    c = find_first_gt(m)\n    b = c - 1\n    if count_zeros(b) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = b - a + 1\n        print(k, end=' ')\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(a, b + 1))))\n\nWait, but in the code, the 'print(k, end=' ') followed by ' '.join(...) will add a space after k, then the numbers. But in the sample, the output is a single line with the numbers.\n\nThus, perhaps the code should print the numbers in a single line, with the count followed by the numbers.\n\nThus, for the sample, the output is:\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprint(k, end=' ')\n\nif k > 0:\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(a, b+1))))\n\nBut in the code, perhaps it's better to structure it as:\n\nif k ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(k, end=' ')\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(a, b+1))))\n\nBut in the code, the current approach is to print k, then a space, then the numbers.\n\nBut that would result in 'k numbers' with a leading space.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn the code:\n\nprint(k, end=' ')\n\nthen, print(' '.join(...)).\n\nThus, the output is 'k numbers'.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is '5 6 7 8 9' as a single line.\n\nSo the code would print '5 ', then '5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWhich is '5 5 6 7 8 9' — which is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because the first print statement is 'k, end=' ', which adds a space after k, then the second print adds the numbers.\n\nThus, the output would be 'k numbers', which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample, the first output line is '5 6 7 8 9', which is the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nTesting the code for m=1:\n\na=5, count=1.\n\nc=10, b=9.\n\nnumbers 5-9.\n\nOutput is '5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the count of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This is because each pair of factors 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero in the factorial product. The count of trailing zeros can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound (a)**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound (b)**: Find the largest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros is at most \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Check Validity**: After determining the bounds, we check if the counts at these bounds are exactly \\( m \\). If not, there are no valid \\( n \\) values.\n\n4. **Output the Results**: If valid, output the count of valid \\( n \\) values and the values themselves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    res = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        res += n\n    return res\n\ndef find_first_ge(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * 10**18  # Safe upper bound\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef find_first_gt(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * 10**18  # Safe upper bound\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt > m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\na = find_first_ge(m)\nif count_zeros(a) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    c = find_first_gt(m)\n    b = c - 1\n    if count_zeros(b) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = b - a + 1\n        print(k, end=' ')\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(a, b + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_zeros Function**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing up the contributions from each power of 5.\n- **find_first_ge Function**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n- **find_first_gt Function**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\).\n- **Main Logic**: Reads the input \\( m \\), determines the valid range of \\( n \\) values using the helper functions, and prints the result based on whether the range is valid.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large values of \\( m \\).",
