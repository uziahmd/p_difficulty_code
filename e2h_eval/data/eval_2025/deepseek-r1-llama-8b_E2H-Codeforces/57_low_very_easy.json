His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasya's Olympiad results. The teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points in total from both tours. But the results are given for each participant in two separate lists—first tour points and second tour points. The order of these lists isn't aligned with the participants' names, which complicates things because we don't know which a_i corresponds to which b_j.\n\nThe task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved. \n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements:\n\n- Each participant has a score from the first tour (a_i) and the second tour (b_i). These are given in arbitrary order.\n- The sum of a_i + b_i for each participant determines their rank. Higher sum means better rank (lower position number).\n- If two participants have the same sum, the jury can arrange them in any order, so Vasya could be placed anywhere relative to them.\n\nSo, to find the best possible rank for Vasya, we need to maximize his sum, but subject to the condition that he has at least x points. Wait, no: wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So Vasya's total is s = a_i + b_j, where a_i is his first tour and b_j is his second tour. We don't know which i and j correspond to him. So our job is to find the minimal s such that s >= x, but then arrange the other participants' scores to maximize or minimize his rank.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So Vasya's total is s >= x. But for our purposes, when computing the best possible rank, we should consider the maximum possible s for Vasya (since a higher s would give a better rank), but also ensuring that s >=x. Wait, no: perhaps not. Because to get the best possible rank, Vasya can have the maximum possible s, but perhaps that's not necessary if other participants have even higher sums. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nFor each participant, including Vasya, their total is a_i + b_j. But the a and b lists are in arbitrary orders. So to model this, perhaps the correct approach is to pair each a_i with a b_j, possibly in a way that maximizes or minimizes Vasya's rank.\n\nWait, but Vasya's a_i and b_j are fixed? Or can they be any pair as long as a_i + b_j >=x? No, wait, no. Wait, Vasya is one specific participant. So in reality, Vasya has a certain a and b. But the problem doesn't tell us which ones. So when considering the possible ranks, we can choose which a and b pair is Vasya's, as long as their sum is >=x. Then, for the rest of the participants, we can assign their a's and b's in any way that allows us to compute the best and worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour but without names. So all we know is that each participant has an a_i and a b_j, but the a and b lists are shuffled. So for each participant, including Vasya, their a and b are some permutation.\n\nBut since the problem gives us the a and b lists, we can consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) as possible candidates for Vasya's total, provided that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists at least one i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So Vasya's a and b must be such that their sum is at least x.\n\nSo for the purpose of finding the best possible rank, we need to select a pair (a_p, b_q) such that a_p + b_q is as high as possible, but still >=x. Then, the best rank would be determined by how many participants have a sum greater than a_p + b_q, and how many have equal or less.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we need to select a pair (a_p, b_q) such that a_p + b_q is as low as possible, but still >=x. Then, determine how many participants have a sum higher than or equal to this.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities. Because the way the other participants are paired could affect how many have higher sums. For example, suppose in the a list, some a_i are very high, but in the b list, others are low",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given in arbitrary order, and the goal is to find the optimal placements considering all possible pairings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each participant's total score is the sum of their points from the first and second tours. The problem requires us to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve, considering all valid pairings of his points from the two tours.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For the best rank, Vasya should have the highest possible total score that is at least `x`.\n   - For the worst rank, Vasya should have the lowest possible total score that is still at least `x`.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - Generate all possible pairs of scores from the first and second tours to find valid totals for Vasya.\n   - For each valid total, calculate how many participants could have a higher total score, which determines Vasya's rank.\n   - Determine the best rank by finding the highest valid total and counting how many participants can have a higher score.\n   - Determine the worst rank by finding the lowest valid total and counting how many participants can have a higher or equal score.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Generate all possible a_i + b_j sums where sum >= x\npossible_sums = []\nfor ai in a:\n    for bj in b:\n        s = ai + bj\n        if s >= x:\n            possible_sums.append((ai, bj, s))\n\nif not possible_sums:\n    print(\"0 0\")  # Shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n\nbest = None\nworst = None\n\n# To compute best rank\nmax_sum = max([s for (ai, bj, s) in possible_sums])\ncandidates_best = [(ai, bj, s) for (ai, bj, s) in possible_sums if s == max_sum]\nnum_higher = 0\nfor c in possible_sums:\n    ai_c, bj_c, s_c = c\n    if (s_c > max_sum):\n        num_higher += 1\n    else:\n        pass  # since same sum can be arranged\nbest_rank = num_higher + 1  # because in case of same sum, can be placed anywhere\n# Now, check if any candidate has higher sum than others\n# Wait, no: in the best case, Vasya has the maximum sum, so the number of people with higher sum is the count of sums > max_sum\n# So the above code is correct.\n\n# To compute worst rank\nmin_sum = min([s for (ai, bj, s) in possible_sums])\ncandidates_worst = [(ai, bj, s) for (ai, bj, s) in possible_sums if s == min_sum]\nnum_lower_or_eq = 0\nfor c in possible_sums:\n    ai_c, bj_c, s_c = c\n    if (s_c >= min_sum):\n        num_lower_or_eq += 1\n    else:\n        pass\nworst_rank = num_lower_or_eq\n\nprint(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generating Possible Sums**: We iterate through all possible pairs of scores from the first and second tours to find all valid totals for Vasya that meet the condition of being at least `x`.\n\n2. **Best Rank Calculation**: We find the highest valid total Vasya can have and then count how many participants have a higher total score. This count plus one gives the best rank.\n\n3. **Worst Rank Calculation**: We find the lowest valid total Vasya can have and then count how many participants have a total score greater than or equal to this. This count gives the worst rank.\n\nThis approach ensures we consider all possible scenarios and efficiently determine the optimal ranks for Vasya.",
