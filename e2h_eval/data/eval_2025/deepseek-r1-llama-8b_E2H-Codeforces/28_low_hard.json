String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of \"beautiful\" strings based on certain criteria. The beautiful string has to meet specific conditions regarding the count of 0s and 1s, and also how these counts can be achieved through a series of modifications.\n\nLet me try to break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the string is beautiful if:\n1. It consists only of 0s and 1s.\n2. The number of 0s is exactly n.\n3. The number of 1s is exactly m.\n\nAdditionally, we can obtain character g (either 0 or 1) from the string with some modifications. But wait, what does that mean? Oh right, the modifications are operations where you replace the last two characters with one, choosing 1 if both were 0, otherwise 0. Each modification reduces the length by one.\n\nBut for the string to be considered beautiful, after possibly zero modifications, the resulting string must have exactly g as its last character. Hmm, no, wait: the problem says, \"we can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So, after performing some modifications, the string becomes such that its last character is g. Wait, no. Or maybe, the string after all possible modifications can be reduced to a single character which is g? Or perhaps, the original string can be modified in such a way that the final result after applying some number of modifications ends up with the last character being g.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is replacing two last characters with one other character.\" So each modification reduces the length by one. So, for example, a string of length k can be modified until its length is 1, and the final character is determined by the process.\n\nSo, for the string s to be beautiful, it must satisfy two things:\n- It has exactly n zeros and m ones, and\n- After some number of modifications (possibly zero), the resulting single character is g.\n\nWait, but modifications are applied to the string, changing it, but the initial string has n zeros and m ones. So the modifications change the counts of zeros and ones as well as the length.\n\nWait, no. Because each modification replaces two last characters with one. For example, if the last two are 00, they become 0. If they are 01 or 10, they become 0. If they are 11, they become 1. So each modification can change the count of 0s and 1s.\n\nSo the initial string s has n zeros and m ones. But after each modification, the counts can change.\n\nBut for s to be beautiful, after any number of modifications (including zero), the resulting string's last character (when it's down to length 1) must be g.\n\nWait, but when you perform a modification, you're not just modifying the end; you're effectively reducing the string step by step until it's a single character. So the final character depends on the entire process.\n\nSo the problem is: count all binary strings of length (n + m) with exactly n zeros and m ones, such that after applying a series of modifications (each step reducing the length by 1), the final character is g.\n\nHmm. So for each possible string s, we need to see if there's a way to perform modifications such that the last character is g.\n\nThis feels like a dynamic programming problem. Because for each string, the possible ways to reduce it depend on the last few characters.\n\nLet me think about the process of reduction. Let's model the reduction steps:\n\nEach step, you take the last two characters and replace them with one, which is 0 if both are 0 or both are 0 and 1 (i.e., 00 or 01?), no wait: the description says, \"replace two last characters by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise equals zero.\" So, if the two are both 0, then replace with 1. Otherwise, replace with 0.\n\nWait, no: \"this character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise equals zero.\" So if the two last characters are 00, replace with 1. Else, replace with 0.\n\nSo the rule is:\n- If the two last characters are both 0 → replaced by 1.\n- Else → replaced by 0.\n\nSo, during each modification, the new character is determined by the last two.\n\nSo the process is deterministic once the string is given. Because each step depends only on the last two characters.\n\nSo for a string s, the final character after all possible modifications is determined uniquely. Because each step is determined, and the process continues until the string length is 1.\n\nSo for a string s, we can compute whether the final character is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be formed from a given string after performing a series of modifications. A beautiful string is defined as a string that meets specific criteria regarding the counts of '0's and '1's and can be reduced to a single character 'g' through a series of modifications.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The string must consist of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones. Additionally, after applying a series of modifications, the string should reduce to a single character `g`. Each modification replaces the last two characters with one, determined by whether they are both zeros or not.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We can model the problem using dynamic programming where each state represents the current count of zeros and ones at the end of the string.\n3. **State Transition**: For each possible state (count of zeros and ones), we consider the result of applying the next modification. This helps us build up the solution by considering all possible ways to reach the desired state.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\n# dp[i][j] = number of ways to have a string with i zeros and j ones at the end\ndp = [[0]*(m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\n# Base case: empty string\ndp[0][0] = 1\n\nfor i in range(n+1):\n    for j in range(m+1):\n        if dp[i][j] == 0:\n            continue\n        # Current last character is 0\n        if i > 0:\n            new_i = i - 1\n            new_j = j\n            dp[new_i][new_j] = (dp[new_i][new_j] + dp[i][j]) % MOD\n        # Current last two characters are 00 → replaced by 1\n        if i >= 2:\n            new_i = i - 2\n            new_j = j + 1\n            dp[new_i][new_j] = (dp[new_i][new_j] + dp[i][j]) % MOD\n        # Current last two characters are 01 or 10 → replaced by 0\n        if j >= 1:\n            new_i = i - 1\n            new_j = j - 1\n            dp[new_i][new_j] = (dp[new_i][new_j] + dp[i][j]) % MOD\n\n# Now, compute how many ways to end with 'g'\nresult = 0\nif g == 0:\n    result = dp[n][m]\nelse:\n    result = dp[n][m] if (n >= 0 and m >= 1) else 0\n\nprint(result % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a string ending with `i` zeros and `j` ones.\n2. **Base Case**: The base case is an empty string, which has one way to exist.\n3. **State Transitions**: For each state `(i, j)`, we consider three possible transitions:\n   - Adding a '0' at the end.\n   - Replacing two '0's at the end with a '1'.\n   - Replacing any other pair of characters at the end with '0'.\n4. **Result Calculation**: After filling the DP table, we check the number of ways to end with the required character `g` and print the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently counts all valid beautiful strings by leveraging dynamic programming to explore all possible ways to reduce the string to the desired character.",
