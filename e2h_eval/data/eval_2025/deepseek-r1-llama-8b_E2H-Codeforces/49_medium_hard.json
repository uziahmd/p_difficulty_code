They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about restoring the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the information from some roads. Each road gives two numbers: the GCD and LCM of the two lawns it connects. My task is to determine if there's a possible arrangement of mushrooms that satisfies all these constraints. If it's possible, I need to output any valid configuration; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nHmm. So the approach here is probably to model this as a graph where each node represents a lawn, and each edge represents the constraints between two nodes. Since the edges form a graph, perhaps we can model this with a system of equations or inequalities.\n\nWait, but how do the GCD and LCM relate the two nodes? Let's think. Suppose an edge connects u and v. The GCD of their mushroom counts (let's denote them as x_u and x_v) must equal the given GCD (g), and the LCM must equal the given LCM (l). \n\nI remember that for any two numbers a and b, the product of their GCD and LCM is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So:\n\nGCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b\n\nSo in our case, x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nBut wait, since GCD(x_u, x_v) = g, and LCM(x_u, x_v) = l, then the product of the two numbers is exactly g*l. So, x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nSo each edge imposes the condition that the product of the two nodes' values equals g*l. But that's not the only condition—since the GCD is also specified, which might add more constraints.\n\nWait, but for two numbers a and b, if GCD(a,b) = g, then a = g*a', b = g*b', where a' and b' are coprime. Then LCM(a, b) is g*a'*b'. So the given LCM must be equal to g*a'*b'. But since a' and b' are coprime, their product is the LCM of a' and b'.\n\nSo, for each edge, after factoring out the GCD, the remaining parts must multiply to the LCM divided by the GCD. Because:\n\nGiven that GCD(u, v) = g, and LCM(u, v) = l, then:\n\nu = g * a\nv = g * b\n\nAnd LCM(g*a, g*b) = g * LCM(a, b) = l.\n\nSo, LCM(a, b) = l / g.\n\nBut since a and b must be coprime, because their GCD is 1.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can model this as:\n\nx_u = g * a\nx_v = g * b\n\nwhere a and b are coprime, and a*b = (l / g).\n\nWait, but wait: if l is not divisible by g, then this would not be possible. So for each edge, l must be a multiple of g. Otherwise, it's impossible. That's one of the first checks I should perform.\n\nSo step one: For each edge, check if LCM % GCD == 0. If any edge doesn't satisfy this, output NO.\n\nIf that's the case, proceed. Otherwise, for each edge, compute l/g, which is the product a*b.\n\nBut since a and b must be coprime, and their product is k = l/g, we can factor k into a and b such that they are coprime. There could be multiple ways, but any pair (a, b) that are coprimes and multiply to k will work.\n\nHmm. So for each edge, we can model the relationship between u and v as x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b, with a and b coprimes and a*b = k.\n\nBut how do we model this across the entire graph?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model variables and their relationships, possibly using Union-Find data structure with some additional constraints, like in a system of equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model each variable as a node, and the constraints as edges, and then find a way to assign values to the variables such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, but for each edge, x_u = g * a and x_v = g * b, with a*b = k. So for each variable, its value is determined by the product of the GCD along the path from a root to that variable.\n\nThis suggests that the variables can be represented in terms of the product of certain factors along the path from a root.\n\nMaybe we can model this with a tree structure, where each node has a parent, and the value is expressed in terms of the parent's value multiplied by some factor.\n\nWait, but the graph isn't necessarily a tree; it can have cycles. So we need a way to handle cycles without contradictions.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps represent each variable as a node, and for each edge, create equations x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b. But this seems tricky because a and b are dependent on each other.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the variables in terms of their prime factors. Because the GCD and LCM are related to the prime exponents.\n\nBut that might get complicated, especially since the numbers can be up to 10^6 or something, but in the problem statement, the maximum GCD and LCM are 106. So the variables x_u can't be larger than, say, 10^6 or something manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the variables using a system where each variable is a multiple of the GCDs along the path, and the product constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's choose one node as the root, say node 1. Then for each node, express x_i in terms of x_1.\n\nFor example, if there's a path from node 1 to node i via edges with GCDs g1, g2, etc., then x_i would be a product involving these GCDs multiplied by some factors.\n\nWait, but each edge's GCD is fixed. So perhaps, for each node, the value is determined by the product of the GCDs along the path from the root to that node, multiplied by some factors that are coprimes.\n\nWait, perhaps each variable can be represented as x_i = (product of certain GCDs) * a_i, where a_i is a product of certain primes. Then, when considering edges, the product of a_i and a_j must be equal to (l/g), as per the earlier equation.\n\nHmm, but this might get too abstract. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For each edge, x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nAlso, GCD(x_u, x_v) = g, which implies that x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b, and GCD(a, b) = 1, and a * b = l/g.\n\nSo for each edge, we can represent the relationship as x_u = g * a and x_v = g * b, with a and b coprimes and a*b = l/g.\n\nNow, the problem is to assign a value to each node such that all edges' constraints are satisfied.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled with a directed graph where each edge enforces certain multiplicative relationships between the variables.\n\nWait, but since the graph is undirected, perhaps we can model this with a system where each node's value is a multiple of a certain base value, and the constraints propagate through the graph.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations where each variable is a function of others, and check for consistency.\n\nBut solving such a system for all variables might be challenging, especially for large n.\n\nWait, but n is up to 1e5? Or is it small? Wait, the problem statement says n and m are given, but the sample input has 3 lawns and 4 roads. Wait, no, looking back: the input is m lines, each with four numbers. So m can be up to ... I'm not sure, but perhaps n can be up to 1e5, but the code needs to handle it efficiently.\n\nHmm, but how? Because for each node, the value depends on the product of various GCDs along paths, which could involve a lot of factors.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps represent each node's value as a product of the GCDs along the path from the root, multiplied by a variable that is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the path is taken or not. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model each variable as a product of certain factors, and the constraints between variables as multiplicative equations. Then, for each connected component, we can assign a base value and compute the rest relative to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each variable can be assigned a value, and for each edge, we can check if the constraints are satisfied. But this seems like a brute-force approach and would be computationally expensive for large n.\n\nWait, but let's think about the problem in terms of connected components. Each connected component can be processed independently.\n\nSo, for each connected component, we can try to assign a value to one node, and then compute the values of all other nodes relative to it. If any inconsistency is found during this process, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Check for each edge whether LCM is divisible by GCD. If any edge fails this, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component, choose a root node (say, node 1 in that component).\n\n3. Assign a variable 'value' to the root. Let's call this 'k'.\n\n4. For each node in the component, compute its value as a function of 'k' and the constraints imposed by the edges.\n\n5. If during this process any inconsistency is found (like a node having conflicting values based on different paths), output NO.\n\n6. After processing all components, assign the computed values to the nodes. If any node's value is zero or negative, output NO.\n\nWait, but the initial problem statement says that the numbers on the roads were at least 1. So the final values must be positive integers.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each connected component:\n\n   - Choose a root.\n\n   - Assign a value to the root (like 1 initially, but may need to adjust later).\n\n   - For each node, compute its value based on the edges and the root's value.\n\n   - Check for consistency. If any conflict arises, the entire setup is invalid.\n\n- After all components are processed, check if all values are positive integers.\n\n- If so, output YES and the values. Else, NO.\n\nBut how to represent the computation of each node's value?\n\nHmm, perhaps each node's value can be represented as a product of certain GCDs multiplied by a variable that's either 1 or -1, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each edge can be used to set up a ratio between the variables of the two nodes.\n\nFor example, for edge u-v with GCD g and LCM l:\n\nx_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nWe can write this as x_u / x_v = (g * l) / x_v², but that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for each edge, the product x_u * x_v is fixed, so each edge introduces a constraint that x_u = (g*l)/x_v.\n\nBut this is a multiplicative constraint.\n\nSo, perhaps for each node, we can track its value as a variable, and for each edge, enforce that the product of u and v equals g*l.\n\nBut how to model this in a way that allows us to compute the values.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a system of equations where each equation is x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nThese equations form a system that must be satisfied.\n\nBut solving such a system for n variables is non-trivial, especially since it's nonlinear.\n\nWait, but perhaps each equation can be rewritten as x_u = (g*l) / x_v, which is a linear equation if we take logarithms.\n\nBut even then, it's a system of nonlinear equations.\n\nHmm, perhaps taking logarithms isn't feasible because of floating point inaccuracies.\n\nAnother thought: since each equation is x_u * x_v = k (for some constant k), perhaps the variables can be represented in terms of each other, leading to a tree-like structure.\n\nWait, but the graph is arbitrary, so cycles can exist. So, for example, a cycle of edges would require that the product around the cycle is consistent.\n\nIn other words, for a cycle u1-u2-u3-...-uk-u1, the product of the edges' (g_i * l_i) must be a square, because the product around the cycle would be equal to the product of all x_i squared (since each x appears twice in numerator and denominator).\n\nWait, perhaps that's a key insight.\n\nBecause each edge u-v contributes x_u * x_v = g * l. So, for a cycle, we can multiply all the edges' equations together, leading to x_u * x_v * ... * x_v * x_u = product of (g * l) for each edge in the cycle.\n\nWait, but each node in the cycle appears exactly twice in the product: once as x_u in edge u-v and once as x_v in edge v-w, etc.\n\nWait, no: each node in the cycle is connected via two edges. For example, in a cycle u1-u2-u3-u1:\n\nEdge u1-u2: x_u1 * x_u2 = g12 * l12.\n\nEdge u2-u3: x_u2 * x_u3 = g23 * l23.\n\nEdge u3-u1: x_u3 * x_u1 = g31 * l31.\n\nMultiplying all three equations: (x_u1 * x_u2) * (x_u2 * x_u3) * (x_u3 * x_u1) ) = (g12 l12)(g23 l23)(g31 l31).\n\nSimplify the left side: x_u1^2 * x_u2^2 * x_u3^2.\n\nSo, (x_u1 x_u2 x_u3)^2 = product of (g l) terms.\n\nTaking square roots, x_u1 x_u2 x_u3 = sqrt( product of (g l) terms ).\n\nBut since x's are positive integers, the product of (g l) terms must be a perfect square.\n\nOtherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSo, for any cycle in the graph, the product of (g * l) for each edge in the cycle must be a perfect square.\n\nIf this is not the case, the entire setup is invalid.\n\nSo, this is a necessary condition for the problem to have a solution.\n\nBut wait, what if the graph is a tree? Then there are no cycles, so this condition doesn't apply. So, for trees, the problem is always solvable as long as all individual edge constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, but in a tree, each edge's constraints are independent, so you can assign values accordingly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each edge, check if l % g == 0. If any edge fails, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component, check if it's a tree. Wait, no—because any graph can have cycles, regardless of being a tree or not. So, for each connected component, we need to ensure that any cycles in it have the product of (g * l) for their edges being a perfect square.\n\n3. Once the above conditions are satisfied, assign values to the nodes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each edge, check l % g == 0. If any fails, output NO.\n\n- For each connected component:\n\n   - Identify all cycles.\n\n   - For each cycle, compute the product of (g * l) for all edges in the cycle.\n\n   - Check if this product is a perfect square. If any cycle fails, output NO.\n\n- Now, for each connected component, assign a variable to one node (the root), and compute all other node values based on the edges.\n\nBut how to compute the values without getting stuck in dependencies.\n\nWait, perhaps using BFS or DFS, and for each node, compute its value in terms of the root's value. But the dependencies can be complex.\n\nAlternatively, for each connected component, we can model the variables as follows:\n\nChoose a root node, say r. We'll assign x_r = k (some value to be determined).\n\nThen, for each edge connected to r, we can compute the adjacent node's value.\n\nFor example, edge r-v with g and l:\n\nx_r * x_v = g * l => x_v = (g * l) / x_r.\n\nSimilarly, for each subsequent edge, we can compute the next node's value.\n\nBut this approach requires that all edges in the component form a tree, but if there are cycles, this method can lead to contradictions unless the cycle's product is a perfect square.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For each connected component:\n\n   - Check if it's possible to assign values without conflicts.\n\n   - Assign a value to the root.\n\n   - Propagate the values through the edges, ensuring that each edge's product is correct.\n\n   - If any conflict arises (like a node being assigned two different values based on different paths), output NO.\n\nSo, to implement this:\n\nFirst, build the graph. For each edge, store the u, v, g, l.\n\nThen, for each connected component:\n\n   - Perform a BFS or DFS to traverse all nodes.\n\n   - For each node, track its value in terms of the root's value.\n\n   - When visiting a new node, compute its value based on the edge connecting it to the current node.\n\n   - If the new value conflicts with an existing assignment, it's invalid.\n\nBut how to represent the value in terms of the root? It's a multiplicative process.\n\nWait, perhaps each node's value can be represented as the root's value multiplied by a product of certain factors along the path.\n\nBut then, when encountering an edge that connects to another node, the product must match.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, track the value as a variable relative to the root.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each variable as a logarithm, but since we're dealing with integers, that might not be feasible.\n\nAnother idea: for each node, keep track of the product of the edges along the path from the root. Then, when visiting a new node, compute its value as (g * l) / current_node_value.\n\nBut again, this could lead to conflicts.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model each node's value as a rational number, expressed in terms of the root's value.\n\nSo, for node u, x_u = (some product of g's and l's) * k, where k is the root's value.\n\nWhen processing an edge u-v, we compute x_v as (g * l) / x_u.\n\nSo, if during BFS, we assign x_u and then compute x_v, and then process x_v's edges, we can see if any conflicts arise.\n\nBut how to represent this in code.\n\nPerhaps, for each node, we can keep a variable 'val' which is a dictionary representing the factors by which the root's value is multiplied. For example, the root has val = 1, and each node's val is a product of certain factors.\n\nBut this could get complex, especially when handling multiple factors.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, we can represent its value as a fraction. For example, x_u = num_u / den_u, where num_u and den_u are integers with no common factors.\n\nBut again, handling fractions might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, the value can be expressed as a product of primes raised to certain exponents, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent each node's value as a multiple of the root's value. So, for each node, x_u = k * (product of factors along the path from root to u). Then, when processing an edge, x_v = (g * l) / x_u.\n\nBut during BFS, we can compute x_v and see if it's consistent with any previous assignments.\n\nWait, but the root's value is a variable, say k. So, perhaps, for each node, the value is expressed in terms of k. So, for example, node u has x_u = f_u * k, where f_u is some integer.\n\nThen, for an edge u-v with GCD g and LCM l, we have:\n\nx_u * x_v = g * l => (f_u * k) * (f_v * k) = g * l => f_u * f_v * k^2 = g * l.\n\nSo, for each edge, the product f_u * f_v must be equal to (g * l) / k².\n\nBut since k is a variable, this complicates things.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.\n\nLet me think about the sample input given:\n\nSample Input:\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\nWait, the sample input seems to have 4 roads:\n\nLooking at the sample input, perhaps the actual input is:\n\nn=4, m=4.\n\nEach of the next lines represents a road.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is:\n\nLine 1: 4 4\n\nLine 2: 1 0 --> 1 is connected to 0? No, wait, perhaps the input is in the format of each line containing u, v, g, l.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\nWait, perhaps the first line is '1 0' meaning n=1 and m=0? Or perhaps it's a typo.\n\nWait, the sample output shows that the first case returns YES with 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nn=4, m=4.\n\nEach of the next 4 lines represents a road.\n\nBut perhaps the first road is '1 2 1 3'?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is a bit unclear. But regardless, the approach remains.\n\nSo, in the sample, one of the test cases is:\n\nRoad between 2 and 1: GCD 1, LCM 2.\n\nSo, x2 * x1 = 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nSo, x1 and x2 must be 1 and 2, or 2 and 1.\n\nBut since it's a road, the order doesn't matter. So, x1 can be 1, x2 2, or vice versa.\n\nBut then, another road between 3 and 2: GCD 2, LCM 3.\n\nSo, x3 * x2 = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nSo, if x2 is 2, then x3 is 3.\n\nAnother road between 3 and 1: GCD 1, LCM 10.\n\nSo, x3 * x1 = 1*10=10.\n\nIf x3 is 3 and x1 is 1, 3*1=3 !=10. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps the third road is between 3 and 1, with GCD 1 and LCM 10.\n\nSo, x3 * x1 = 1 * 10 = 10.\n\nBut if x3 is 3 and x1 is 1, 3 * 1 = 3 !=10. So that's invalid.\n\nSo, how does the sample output return 5 1 2?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is 'YES\\n5 1 2' for the third case. So, the third case has nodes 3, 1, 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the third case is:\n\nLawns 3 is connected to 1 via a road with GCD 1 and LCM 10. So, x3 * x1 = 1*10=10.\n\nAlso, 3 is connected to 2 via a road with GCD 2 and LCM 3. So, x3 * x2 = 2*3=6.\n\nAnd 2 is connected to 1 via a road with GCD 1 and LCM 2. So, x2 *x1 = 1*2=2.\n\nSo, let's assign variables:\n\nLet x1 = a, x2 = b, x3 = c.\n\nWe have:\n\nc * a = 10 --> equation 1.\n\nc * b = 6 --> equation 2.\n\nb * a = 2 --> equation 3.\n\nFrom equation 3: b = 2/a.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: c*(2/a) =6 → c = (6a)/2 = 3a.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1: (3a)*a =10 → 3a² =10 → a²=10/3 → a= sqrt(10/3), which is not an integer.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nBut the sample output says that this case is valid with x3=5, x1=2, x2=1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nx3=5, x1=2: 5*2=10 → correct.\n\nx3=5, x2=1: 5*1=5. But the LCM is 3, which is 2*3=6. Wait, but 5*1=5, which is not equal to 2*3=6. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, the third case's roads are:\n\n3 2 1 2\n\n3 1 1 10\n\n2 1 1 3\n\nWait, perhaps the third road is between 3 and 1, with GCD 1 and LCM 10.\n\nSo, x3 * x1 = 1*10=10.\n\nThe second road is between 3 and 2: GCD 2, LCM 3. So x3 *x2=2*3=6.\n\nThe fourth road is between 2 and 1: GCD 1, LCM 2. So x2*x1=1*2=2.\n\nSo, let's assign:\n\nx1 = a, x2 = b, x3 = c.\n\nEquations:\n\nc*a =10 → eq1.\n\nc*b=6 → eq2.\n\nb*a=2 → eq3.\n\nFrom eq3: b=2/(a).\n\nSubstituting into eq2: c*(2/a)=6 → c= (6a)/2=3a.\n\nSubstituting into eq1: 3a *a =10 → 3a²=10 → a²=10/3 → a=√(10/3) ≈1.826, which is not integer.\n\nSo, how does the sample output have x3=5, x1=2, x2=1.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nx1=2, x2=1, x3=5.\n\nCheck eq3: 1*2=2 → correct.\n\neq2:5*1=5 → but the road expects 2*3=6. 5≠6. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's input.\n\nWait, perhaps each line in the input is u, v, g, l. So, for the third case, the roads are:\n\n3 2 with g=1 and l=2.\n\n3 1 with g=1 and l=10.\n\n2 1 with g=1 and l=3.\n\nAh! So, the third road is between 2 and 1, g=1, l=3.\n\nSo, x2 *x1 =1*3=3.\n\nSo, now, the equations are:\n\nc*a=10 → eq1.\n\nc*b=6 → eq2.\n\nb*a=3 → eq3.\n\nSo, from eq3: b=3/a.\n\nSubstituting into eq2: c*(3/a)=6 → c= 6a/3= 2a.\n\nSubstituting into eq1: 2a * a=10 → 2a²=10 → a²=5 → a=√5, which is not integer.\n\nSo, why does the sample output have x3=5, x1=2, x2=1?\n\nWait, because that would give:\n\nx3=5, x1=2: 5*2=10 → correct.\n\nx3=5, x2=1:5*1=5 ≠6 (road expects 6). So that's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the third road is between 3 and 1 with g=1, l=10, and the fourth road is between 2 and 1 with g=1, l=3.\n\nSo, let's re-express all equations:\n\neq1: x3 * x1 =10.\n\neq2: x3 * x2 =6.\n\neq3: x2 *x1 =3.\n\nSo, from eq3: x2=3/x1.\n\nSubstituting into eq2: x3 * (3/x1) =6 → x3 = (6 x1)/3 = 2x1.\n\nSubstituting into eq1: 2x1 * x1 =10 → 2x1²=10 → x1²=5 → x1=√5.\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nHmm, so why is the sample output showing that this is possible with x3=5, x1=2, x2=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the edges. Let me check the sample input again.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the third case is:\n\n['3 2\\n3 2 1 2', '3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\nWait, perhaps the third case's roads are:\n\n3 2, with g=2, l=1.\n\n3 1, with g=1, l=10.\n\n2 1, with g=1, l=3.\n\nWait, that's possible.\n\nSo, let's re-calculate:\n\nx3 *x2 = 2*1=2 → eq1.\n\nx3 *x1 =1*10=10 → eq2.\n\nx2 *x1 =1*3=3 → eq3.\n\nSo, from eq3: x2=3/x1.\n\nSubstituting into eq1: x3*(3/x1)=2 → x3= (2x1)/3.\n\nSubstituting into eq2: (2x1/3) *x1=10 → (2x1²)/3=10 → x1²=15 → x1=√15 → not integer.\n\nHmm, still no good.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the roads are bidirectional, but the way I'm processing them is unidirectional.\n\nNo, because in the BFS approach, direction doesn't matter; edges are treated as two-way.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for a pattern or a way to represent the variables in a way that avoids floating points.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to model each variable as a product of primes, and then the constraints can be checked for consistency.\n\nBut this would involve factorizing each (g * l), which can be done since g and l are up to 106.\n\nBut that's manageable.\n\nSo, for each edge, compute g * l, factorize it into primes, and store the exponents.\n\nThen, for each edge, the product of the variables' factors must equal the product of the edge's factors.\n\nWait, but how to represent this.\n\nAlternatively, for each edge, the product of the variables' exponents must equal the sum of the exponents from the edge.\n\nWait, perhaps for each prime p, the exponent of p in x_u plus the exponent in x_v must equal the exponent in (g*l).\n\nBut that's not correct because x_u *x_v = g*l, so the exponents for each prime in x_u and x_v add up to the exponents in g*l.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nSo, for each prime p, the exponent in x_u plus the exponent in x_v equals the exponent in (g*l).\n\nSo, for each edge, we can factorize g*l into primes, and for each prime, note that the sum of exponents from x_u and x_v is equal to the exponent in (g*l).\n\nBut this leads to a system of equations for each prime.\n\nBut how to manage this across the entire graph.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each edge, compute the product g*l. Factorize this product into its prime factors.\n\n2. For each connected component, build a system where for each edge, for each prime, the sum of exponents from the two nodes is equal to the exponent in the edge's product.\n\n3. Solve this system to find possible exponents for each node's value.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, since the exponents are additive, perhaps we can model each node's value as a vector of exponents for each prime, and then for each edge, the sum of the vectors for the two nodes must equal the vector of the edge's product.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, especially with multiple primes.\n\nBut considering that the maximum g and l are 106, the maximum product is 106 * 106 = 11236, whose prime factors are limited. So, for each edge, the number of distinct primes is small.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute all primes up to 11236.\n\n- For each edge, compute g*l, and factorize it into primes.\n\n- For each connected component:\n\n   - For each node, initialize an empty dictionary (or a default dictionary) to track the exponents of each prime.\n\n   - For each edge in the component, for each prime in the edge's factorization, set up equations that the sum of exponents from the two nodes equals the edge's exponent.\n\n   - Solve these equations to find exponents for each node.\n\n   - If any inconsistency is found, output NO.\n\nBut solving this system of equations for multiple primes and multiple nodes is challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, we can model its exponents as a multiple of a base node's exponents.\n\nBut again, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, the exponents of the primes can be represented as a linear combination of the base node's exponents. So, for each node, x_i = k * (product of primes to certain exponents), where k is the base value.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: for each node, represent its value as a product of primes raised to exponents. Then, for each edge, the exponents of the two nodes must add up to the exponents of the edge's product.\n\nBut the exponents are additive, so this forms a system of linear equations.\n\nSo, for each edge, and for each prime, the sum of exponents in the two nodes equals the exponent in the edge's product.\n\nThus, for each node and each prime, the exponent is a variable, and the equations are the sum of the variables for the two nodes equals the exponent in the edge's product.\n\nBut solving this for each connected component is the same as solving a system of linear equations over the exponents.\n\nSince the exponents are non-negative integers, this is a Diophantine system.\n\nBut solving this for all primes and all nodes is computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, we can choose a root node and express all other nodes' exponents in terms of the root's exponents.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, for each node, the exponents can be represented as the root's exponents plus some offset. Then, for each edge, the sum of the two nodes' exponents equals the edge's exponents.\n\nSo, for example, node u's exponent for p is a_p, node v's is b_p.\n\nThen, a_p + b_p = c_p, where c_p is the exponent in the edge's product.\n\nIf we choose the root's exponents as a reference, then for each node, the exponents are determined relative to the root.\n\nSo, for each node, we can track the exponents as delta exponents relative to the root.\n\nThen, for each edge, the sum of the deltas for the two nodes plus the root's exponents must equal the edge's exponents.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo, for each node, we have a dictionary of exponents relative to the root.\n\nWhen processing an edge between u and v:\n\nFor each prime p:\n\nroot_p + u_p + v_p = edge_p.\n\nSo, u_p + v_p = edge_p - root_p.\n\nBut since the root_p is known, this determines u_p and v_p.\n\nWait, but that's only if the edge's exponents are known and the root's exponents are known.\n\nBut in practice, the root's exponents are variables as well. So, this approach may not directly help.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck on how to model the exponents and solve the system.\n\nPerhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think differently: since each edge's product is fixed, perhaps the variables can be represented as the product of certain factors, and the exponents can be managed accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps it's time to look for similar problems or standard approaches.\n\nUpon reflection, this problem resembles a problem where variables are connected via multiplicative constraints, and we need to find if such variables can be assigned consistent values.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of checking if a graph is bipartite, but with multiplicative constraints instead of additive.\n\nIn such cases, a BFS approach can be used, where each node's value is determined",

If possible, we should output any valid configuration; otherwise, we should output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Edge Validity**: For each edge, check if the LCM is a multiple of the GCD. If any edge fails this check, output \"NO\".\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list where each node points to its connected nodes along with the GCD and LCM values.\n3. **Connected Components**: Use BFS to traverse each connected component of the graph.\n4. **Cycle Check**: For each cycle in the graph, ensure that the product of the GCD and LCM values around the cycle forms a perfect square. If any cycle fails this check, output \"NO\".\n5. **BFS for Value Assignment**: For each connected component, use BFS to assign values starting from a root node.
