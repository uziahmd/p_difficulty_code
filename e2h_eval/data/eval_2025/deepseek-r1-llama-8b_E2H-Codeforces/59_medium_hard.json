    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. Let me break down what's given.\n\nWe have N and K as inputs. We need to find the number of different arrays containing N sets S_1 to S_N. Each set can have zero or more distinct integers from 1 to K. \n\nThe main condition is that there exists a rearrangement of these sets into S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N such that each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. \n\nWhat's a child here? A set A is a child of B if for every x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1}, then B must have at least 2. If A has {2}, B must have 3, etc. And if A is empty, then it's trivially a child of any B.\n\nSo, the task is to count all possible arrays of N sets where this condition holds, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. How do I model this?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the sets in the array after rearrangement. Since each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}, this implies that for each i, S'_i is a subset of S'_{i+1} in some way. Wait, not exactly a subset, but a subset with the property that every element in S'_i is less than some element in S'_{i+1}.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the elements present. For each x, the presence of x in a set implies the next set must have x+1. So, the minimal requirement is that for the sets in the rearranged order, their elements are strictly increasing in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the maximum elements in each set. Let me think: for a chain S_1 → S_2 → ... → S_N, each step requires that S_i is a child of S_{i+1}. So, the maximum element in S_1 must be less than the maximum element in S_2, but wait, no. Because S_1 could have elements like 1 and 2, and S_2 has 3. Then S_1 is a child of S_2 because 1 is in S_1 and 2 is in S_2 (since 1+1=2 is in S_2). Similarly, 2 is in S_1 and 3 is in S_2, so it's covered.\n\nWait, so the maximum in S_1 doesn't have to be less than the maximum in S_2. It's more about whether every element in S_1 is covered by S_2.\n\nSo perhaps the structure is that for each x, the earliest occurrence of x in the array must be followed by an occurrence of x+1 later in the array.\n\nBut how does this translate into the count of possible arrays?\n\nMaybe I can model this by considering the presence of each number up to K in the sets. Let's think of each number x from 1 to K as being present in some subsets, and their inclusion must form a chain where if a set has x, the next set in the chain must have x+1.\n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is that for the entire array, the presence of x in any set S_i implies that x+1 is present in some set S_j where j > i in the rearranged order. But since the rearrangement is arbitrary, perhaps the constraints are on the overall structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each x can be thought of as being \"closed\" when it's present in some set S_i, but then x+1 must be present in a later set. Or maybe it's more about the maximum required for each x.\n\nAnother approach: for each x, consider the earliest position in the array where x appears. Then, in all sets after that position, x+1 must appear. Or something along those lines.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the structure after rearrangement. Suppose we arrange the sets in such a way that each S_i is a child of S_{i+1}. So, the entire sequence forms a chain where each step builds upon the previous.\n\nIn this case, the sets must be arranged such that for each i, S_i is a subset in some way that satisfies the child condition. But how do we model the choices for each set?\n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem in terms of the minimal required structure. For the entire array of sets, after rearrangement, the presence of each x in any set S_i implies that x+1 is present in some S_j where j > i.\n\nWait, but since the sets can be reordered, perhaps the order of x's appearance isn't fixed. Hmm, this seems tricky.\n\nMaybe another angle: The condition is that the sets can be arranged in such a way that each is a child of the next. So, for each x, if x is present in any set S_i, then in the rearranged sequence, there must exist some j > i where S_j contains x+1.\n\nBut since the rearrangement is arbitrary, perhaps the condition is that for each x, the latest occurrence of x in the original array must be followed by an occurrence of x+1 in some set.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the problem by considering that in the original array, for each x, the last occurrence of x must come before the first occurrence of x+1. Because in the rearranged array, x will be placed before x+1, ensuring that x is in an earlier set than x+1.\n\nWait, no. Because in the original array, the sets are [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N], and in the rearranged array [S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N], each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for each x, if x is present in any S'_i, then x+1 must be present in some S'_j where j > i.\n\nThus, in the original array, for each x, the last set that contains x must be placed before the first set that contains x+1 in the rearranged array.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, but something along those lines.\n\nAlternatively, for each x, the presence of x in any set in the array implies that x+1 must be present in at least one set that comes after it in the rearranged order.\n\nBut how do I model this in terms of the original array's sets?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should think about the problem in terms of the multiplicative contributions of each x.\n\nLet me think: For each x, the decision to include x or not affects the possibilities for x+1.\n\nWait, perhaps dynamic programming can help here. Let's consider the problem as building the sets in a way that for each x, if x is included in some set, then x+1 must also be included in some set that comes after in the rearrangement.\n\nBut since the rearrangement is arbitrary, perhaps the condition is that for each x, if x is present in any of the sets, then x+1 must be present in some set that is after it in the array.\n\nWait, no. Because the rearrangement can be any permutation, so any set containing x can be placed before any set containing x+1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that for each x, the earliest set that contains x must have a later set that contains x+1. Or, more accurately, in the rearranged array, the x-containing sets must come before the x+1-containing sets.\n\nWait, that might not capture all cases. For example, if a set contains x but not x+1, but another set contains x+1. But as long as in the rearranged array, the set with x is before the set with x+1, the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be viewed as requiring that for each x, if any set in the array contains x, then there must be at least one set in the array that contains x+1, and that in the rearranged array, this set containing x+1 comes after the set containing x.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because perhaps in the array, there are multiple sets containing x, but all the sets containing x+1 are before them. That would violate the condition.\n\nSo, the correct condition is that for each x, in the original array, for any set S_i that contains x, there exists a set S_j (j ≠ i) that contains x+1, and in the rearranged array, S_j comes after S_i.\n\nBut since the rearrangement is arbitrary, the only way to ensure this is that in the original array, the last occurrence of x must be before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nWait, no. Because in the rearranged array, any occurrence of x can be followed by any occurrence of x+1.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the earliest set that contains x+1 must come after the latest set that contains x.\n\nBecause in the rearranged array, the latest x set must be placed before the earliest x+1 set.\n\nSo, for each x, the latest occurrence of x must come before the earliest occurrence of x+1.\n\nIf that's the case, then the problem reduces to ensuring that for each x, the last set that contains x is placed before the first set that contains x+1 in the rearranged array.\n\nSo, the constraints on the array are:\n\nFor each x, the last occurrence of x in the original array is before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nWait, no. Because the original array is [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N]. In the rearranged array, S'_i could be any permutation. So, the last occurrence of x in the original array is S_p, and the first occurrence of x+1 is S_q. To satisfy the condition, in the rearranged array, S_p must come before S_q. But since the rearrangement is arbitrary, this is only possible if in the original array, p < q. Because otherwise, S_p comes after S_q, and in the rearranged array, you can't have S_p before S_q.\n\nWait, no. Because the rearranged array is a permutation, so if in the original array, the last occurrence of x is at position p, and the first occurrence of x+1 is at position q, then in the original array, if p >= q, then in any rearrangement, S_p comes after S_q. So, when you try to arrange the sets, the last x set is after the first x+1 set, which violates the condition.\n\nSo, to avoid this, for each x, the last occurrence of x in the original array must be before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nAh, that makes sense! Because if the last x is before the first x+1, then in any rearrangement, you can arrange the x-containing sets before the x+1-containing sets.\n\nSo, the condition is that for each x, the last occurrence of x is before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nThat's a crucial insight. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of arrays of sets S_1 to S_N where:\n\n- For each x in 1..K-1: if any S_i contains x, then the last such i is less than the first occurrence of x+1 in the array.\n\nAdditionally, the sets can be anything as long as this condition is met.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nLet me think in terms of each x and the constraints they impose on the array.\n\nFor each x, we can choose whether to include it in the sets. But if x is included, then x+1 must be included in some set(s), and the first occurrence of x+1 must come after the last occurrence of x.\n\nWait, but x can be included in multiple sets. The key is that the last occurrence of x must be before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nSo, for x, the presence of x in any set implies that x+1 must be present in at least one set, and the first occurrence of x+1 is after the last occurrence of x.\n\nSo, the steps for building the array could be:\n\n1. Decide for each x whether to include it or not. But if x is included, then x+1 must be included, and the first occurrence of x+1 is after the last occurrence of x.\n\nBut how to model this? It's getting a bit tangled.\n\nAnother idea: For each x, the first occurrence of x+1 must be after the last occurrence of x. So, for all x, the presence of x in the array implies the presence of x+1, and the first x+1 comes after the last x.\n\nWait, but x can be 0? No, because the sets can contain 1 to K. So x ranges from 1 to K-1.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a chain. For x from 1 to K, if x is present, x+1 must be present, and the first occurrence of x+1 is after the last occurrence of x.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model the problem by considering the positions of each x.\n\nLet me think about the process of building the array step by step.\n\nEach set S_i can contain any subset of {1, 2, ..., K}. However, the inclusion of x in any S_i imposes constraints on the inclusion of x+1, and vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but that might get complicated for large K and N.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model the problem with dynamic programming, considering the state as the current maximum x that has been 'closed'.\n\nWait, another idea: For each x, if x is present in the array, then x+1 must be present, and the first occurrence of x+1 is after the last occurrence of x.\n\nSo, the presence of x requires that x+1 is present, and their occurrences are ordered.\n\nBut what about higher x's? Like, if x is present, x+1 is present, and then x+2 must be present, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of x requires the presence of x+1, which in turn requires x+2, and so on, up to K.\n\nSo, the presence of x implies the presence of x+1, x+2, ..., K.\n\nWait, that makes sense because if x is present, then x+1 must be present, and then x+2 must be present because x+1 is present, and so on.\n\nSo, the set of x's present in the array must form a consecutive range from some minimum x up to K. Because if x is present, x+1 must be present, and so on.\n\nWait, for example, if the array includes 3, then it must include 4, 5, ..., K.\n\nSimilarly, if the array includes 2, it must include 3, 4, ..., K.\n\nSo, the presence of any x less than K implies the presence of x+1, which implies the presence of x+2, etc., up to K.\n\nThus, the only way for the array to have x is if all numbers from some s up to K are present. Where s is the smallest x in the array.\n\nWait, that's a big insight. So, the possible sets in the array must consist of numbers from some s to K, inclusive. So, the array can have sets that include numbers from s to K, and s can be any value between 1 and K, but once s is chosen, all higher numbers up to K must be present.\n\nSo, the first thing to decide is the value of s, the smallest x present in the array. Then, for each x from s to K-1, the presence of x implies the presence of x+1.\n\nOnce s is chosen, the array can include any combination of subsets of {s, s+1, ..., K} for each set, provided that the last occurrence of x is before the first occurrence of x+1 for each x.\n\nWait, but s can be 0? No, because the sets can include 1 to K. So s ranges from 1 to K.\n\nWait, no, s can be 1, or higher. For example, if the array doesn't include 1, but includes 2, then s is 2.\n\nSo, the first step is to determine all possible s (from 1 to K), and for each s, count the number of valid arrays where the sets are built from {s, s+1, ..., K}, and for each x from s to K-1, the last occurrence of x is before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the case when s is 1? Then x runs from 1 to K-1, so all x must be present.\n\nNo, wait. s is the smallest x in the array. So if s is 2, then x=1 is not present, but x=2,3,...,K must be present.\n\nWait, no. Because s is the minimal x present. So if s is 2, then 2 is present, but 1 is not.\n\nBut then, according to the earlier condition, for x=1, since 1 is not present in the array, there's no constraint. But for x=2, since it's present, x+1=3 must be present, and so on.\n\nSo, for each s, the array must include s, s+1, ..., K.\n\nSo, the first step is to choose s, the minimal x in the array. Then, for each x from s to K-1, the presence of x implies the presence of x+1, which in turn implies the presence of x+2, etc., up to K.\n\nSo, for each s, the array can include any combination of sets that include elements from s to K, but for each x in s to K-1, the last occurrence of x is before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nSo, for each s, the problem reduces to counting the number of arrays where the sets are subsets of {s, s+1, ..., K}, and for each x in s to K-1, the last occurrence of x is before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nNow, how to compute this for each s and sum over all possible s.\n\nLet me think about the structure within a particular s.\n\nSuppose s is fixed. Then, the elements involved are {x | x = s, s+1, ..., K}.\n\nEach set S_i can contain any subset of these elements, but with the condition that for each x in s to K-1, the last occurrence of x is before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nWait, but how can this condition be enforced?\n\nLet me think about the first occurrence of x+1. Let's denote f(x) as the position of the first occurrence of x+1, and l(x) as the position of the last occurrence of x.\n\nThe condition is that for each x in s to K-1, l(x) < f(x+1).\n\nSo, for each x, the last x in the array must be before the first x+1.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nThis seems similar to the constraints in certain types of permutations or sequences, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for a particular x, the earliest occurrence of x+1 must be after the last occurrence of x.\n\nSo, in the array, all x's must appear before any x+1's.\n\nBut this is not entirely accurate because x can appear in multiple sets, but as long as the last x is before the first x+1.\n\nWait, yes. For example, suppose x is present in sets 1, 3, and 5, and x+1 is present in sets 6,7. Then, the last x is at 5, the first x+1 is at 6. So 5 <6, condition is satisfied.\n\nBut if x is present in set 5 and x+1 is present in set 3, then the last x is 5, first x+1 is 3. So 5>3, condition violated.\n\nSo, to satisfy the condition for x and x+1, the last occurrence of x must be before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nSo, for each x, we have to track the last occurrence of x and the first occurrence of x+1.\n\nBut how to model this across the entire array.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire array can be considered as a collection of intervals where for each x, the interval for x ends before the interval for x+1 starts.\n\nAlternatively, for each x, the first occurrence of x+1 must come after the last occurrence of x.\n\nSo, for each x, the first occurrence of x+1 is in some position f(x+1), and the last occurrence of x is in some position l(x). We require l(x) < f(x+1).\n\nThis seems similar to the constraints in scheduling jobs with dependencies.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut how can we model this for all x in s to K-1.\n\nLet me consider that for x from K-1 down to s.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the first occurrence of x+1 must come after the last occurrence of x.\n\nSo, for x = K-1, the first occurrence of K must be after the last occurrence of K-1.\n\nFor x = K-2, the first occurrence of K-1 must be after the last occurrence of K-2.\n\nAnd so on, until x = s.\n\nSo, the constraints form a chain: for each x, f(x+1) > l(x).\n\nSo, the question is, how to count the number of ways to assign f(x+1) and l(x) for each x, such that f(x+1) > l(x), and for each x, the sets are constructed in a way that the sets containing x are before the sets containing x+1.\n\nWait, but each x can be present in multiple sets, as long as the last x is before the first x+1.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model the array as a series of segments where for each x, all sets containing x are before all sets containing x+1.\n\nBut that's not quite right because sets can have multiple x's and x+1's, but the condition is only on the last x and the first x+1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array can be divided into blocks, where for each x, the block of x comes before the block of x+1, but other x's can be interleaved as long as their constraints are satisfied.\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe we can model this with dynamic programming, considering the maximum x processed so far and the current position.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the earliest occurrence of x+1 must be after the latest occurrence of x.\n\nSo, for x from s to K-1, the first occurrence of x+1 is after the last occurrence of x.\n\nSo, for each x, in the array, the earliest x+1 is after the latest x.\n\nSo, for example, if x is in sets 1, 3, and 5, then the first x+1 must be in a set after 5.\n\nBut how can we model this in the array.\n\nAnother approach: For each x, the first occurrence of x+1 is after the last occurrence of x. So, the first occurrence of x+1 must be after all x's in the array.\n\nThus, for x, the first x+1 must be in a position greater than the last x.\n\nSo, the last x is in some position p, and the first x+1 is in some q > p.\n\nThus, for all x, we can represent the constraints as:\n\nq(x+1) > p(x)\n\nWhere p(x) is the last position of x, and q(x+1) is the first position of x+1.\n\nSo, the problem is to arrange the sets such that for each x, the last x is before the first x+1.\n\nHmm, this seems manageable.\n\nSo, for a fixed s, the elements involved are x = s, s+1, ..., K.\n\nWe need to assign for each x in s to K-1, the first occurrence of x+1 is after the last occurrence of x.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n1. For each s, compute the number of valid arrays where the sets are subsets of {s, s+1, ..., K}, and for each x in s to K-1, the last occurrence of x is before the first occurrence of x+1.\n\n2. Sum over all s from 1 to K.\n\nSo, the total answer is the sum for s=1 to s=K of the number of arrays for that s.\n\nNow, for a fixed s, how do we compute the number of arrays.\n\nLet me think about the variables involved for a fixed s.\n\nLet me denote the elements as x_1 = s, x_2 = s+1, ..., x_m = K, where m = K - s + 1.\n\nEach set S_i can contain any subset of these elements. But with the constraints that for each x_j, the last occurrence of x_j is before the first occurrence of x_{j+1}.\n\nWait, but since x_j is x_{j} = x_{j-1} + 1, this becomes a chain.\n\nSo, for the elements x_1, x_2, ..., x_m, the constraints are:\n\nlast(x_1) < first(x_2)\nlast(x_2) < first(x_3)\n...\nlast(x_{m-1}) < first(x_m)\n\nWhich implies that:\n\nfirst(x_2) > last(x_1)\nfirst(x_3) > last(x_2)\n...\nfirst(x_m) > last(x_{m-1})\n\nSo, each x_{j+1}'s first occurrence is after x_j's last occurrence.\n\nSo, for each j, the first occurrence of x_{j+1} is after the last occurrence of x_j.\n\nThis suggests that the array is structured such that all x_1's are before any x_2's, all x_2's are before any x_3's, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Because for x_1, the last occurrence is before the first occurrence of x_2. So, all x_1's must come before any x_2's.\n\nSimilarly, all x_2's must come before any x_3's.\n\nSo, the array can be partitioned into segments where each segment corresponds to a specific x, and all x's are grouped together, with x_1's first, followed by x_2's, then x_3's, etc.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. Because for x_1, all its occurrences must come before x_2's. For x_2, all its occurrences must come before x_3's, etc.\n\nSo, the array is a concatenation of blocks, each block containing all occurrences of x_j for j from 1 to m, in order.\n\nBut wait, what about x_j can have overlapping sets with x_{j+1}? No, because the last occurrence of x_j must be before the first occurrence of x_{j+1}.\n\nThus, the entire array can be considered as a series of blocks, each block corresponding to x_j, and the blocks are ordered x_1, x_2, ..., x_m.\n\nMoreover, within each block, the sets can be any subsets of x_j, but subject to the constraints that for each set in the block, any x_j can be present.\n\nWait, but each set can have any combination of the x's, but the blocks are ordered such that x_1's are all before x_2's, which are all before x_3's, etc.\n\nSo, the array is a sequence of N sets, each set being a subset of x_1, x_2, ..., x_m, but the order of the sets is constrained such that all x_1's are in the first part, x_2's in the second, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because the array is a sequence of N sets, but the blocks for x_1, x_2, etc., are contiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps the array is split into m contiguous blocks, each corresponding to x_j, and within each block, the sets can be any subsets of x_j, but the order of the blocks is fixed as x_1, x_2, ..., x_m.\n\nBut each set can have any combination of x_j's, as long as the blocks are ordered correctly.\n\nWait, no. Because each set can be a subset of any of the x_j's, but the entire array's sets must be ordered such that all x_1's are in the first block, x_2's in the second, etc.\n\nNo, that's not the case. Because each set can have any combination of x_j's, but the constraints require that for each x_j, all occurrences of x_j are before x_{j+1}.\n\nThus, the entire array can be thought of as a sequence where the first part contains all the x_1's, followed by the x_2's, then x_3's, etc.\n\nBut each set can be a mix of x_j's from the current block and higher blocks, as long as the constraints are met.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nEach set in the array is a subset of the union of x_1, x_2, ..., x_m.\n\nBut the constraints are that for each x_j, the last occurrence of x_j is before the first occurrence of x_{j+1}.\n\nThis means that all x_1's must appear before any x_2's, all x_2's must appear before any x_3's, etc.\n\nSo, the array can be partitioned into m contiguous blocks, where the j-th block contains all the sets that contain x_j, and any sets that contain x_{j+1}, x_{j+2}, etc., are allowed as long as their x's are in higher j's.\n\nWait, no. Because the constraints are per x_j. For example, the last occurrence of x_1 must be before the first occurrence of x_2. So, all x_1's must be in the first part of the array, and x_2's must be in the latter part.\n\nSimilarly, all x_2's must be in the second block, followed by x_3's, etc.\n\nSo, the array is divided into m blocks, each corresponding to x_j, and the blocks are ordered from x_1 to x_m.\n\nEach block j can consist of any number of sets, including zero, but each set in block j can have any subset of x_j, x_{j+1}, ..., x_m.\n\nWait, no. Because the constraints are that for x_j, the last occurrence of x_j is before the first occurrence of x_{j+1}.\n\nThus, the sets containing x_j can appear in block j, but sets containing x_{j+1} can also appear in block j, as long as their x_{j+1} is added only after the last x_j.\n\nWait, but that's not possible. Because if a set in block j contains x_j and x_{j+1}, then the last occurrence of x_j is in block j, and the first occurrence of x_{j+1} is also in block j. Which violates the condition.\n\nThus, the only way to satisfy the condition is that in block j, all sets can only contain x_j and possibly higher x's (like x_{j+1}, x_{j+2}, etc.), but the sets cannot contain x_j and x_{j+1} in the same block j.\n\nWait, no. Because the sets can contain any combination of x_j, x_{j+1}, etc., but the last occurrence of x_j must be before the first occurrence of x_{j+1}.\n\nThus, the only way this can happen is if all x_j's are in block j, and x_{j+1}'s are in block j+1 and beyond.\n\nSo, each set can only belong to exactly one block, and each block j consists of sets that contain x_j and no x_k for k < j.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Because if a set in block j contains x_j and x_{j+1}, then x_j's last occurrence is in block j, but x_{j+1}'s first occurrence is also in block j, which violates the condition.\n\nThus, the only way to satisfy the condition is that each set belongs to exactly one block, and all sets in block j can contain x_j, x_{j+1}, ..., x_m, but no x_k for k < j.\n\nWait, no. Because a set in block j can contain x_j and higher, but the last occurrence of x_j must be before the first occurrence of x_{j+1}.\n\nSo, the last occurrence of x_j is in block j, and the first occurrence of x_{j+1} is in block j+1. Thus, the condition is satisfied.\n\nThus, the array is partitioned into m blocks, each block j can contain any number of sets, each of which is a subset of {x_j, x_{j+1}, ..., x_m}.\n\nBut wait, no. Because a set in block j can contain x_j and x_{j+1}, but that would mean x_j's last occurrence is in block j, and x_{j+1}'s first occurrence is also in block j, which violates the condition.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that each set in block j can only contain x_j and higher x's (like x_{j+1}, etc.), but not lower x's.\n\nBut that's not correct because x_j is in block j, and x_{j+1} is in block j+1. So, a set in block j can't contain x_{j+1} because x_{j+1} hasn't appeared yet.\n\nWait, no. Because the condition is about x_j and x_{j+1}: the last occurrence of x_j is before the first occurrence of x_{j+1}.\n\nSo, the first occurrence of x_{j+1} can be in block j+1, but a set in block j can contain x_{j+1}, as long as it's the first occurrence.\n\nWait, no. Because if a set in block j contains x_{j+1}, then the first occurrence of x_{j+1} is in block j, but the last occurrence of x_j is also in block j, which violates the condition.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that each set can only be in exactly one block, and the blocks are ordered x_1, x_2, ..., x_m.\n\nMoreover, each set in block j can contain x_j, x_{j+1}, ..., x_m, but not x_1, x_2, ..., x_{j-1}.\n\nThus, the array is a sequence of m blocks, each block j can have any number of sets (including zero), and each set in block j can be any subset of {x_j, x_{j+1}, ..., x_m}.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct. Because a set in block j can't contain x_j unless it's the only x in that set. Or, perhaps, the set can contain x_j and higher x's, but the condition is still satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that the last occurrence of x_j is before the first occurrence of x_{j+1}, regardless of whether x_{j+1} is present in the same set as x_j.\n\nBut that's impossible because if a set in block j contains x_j and x_{j+1}, then the last occurrence of x_j is in block j, and the first occurrence of x_{j+1} is also in block j, violating the condition.\n\nThus, the only way to satisfy the condition is that each set in block j can only contain x_j and higher x's, but not any x_k for k < j.\n\nWait, but that's not necessary. Because if a set in block j contains x_j and x_{j+1}, then x_j's last occurrence is in block j, but x_{j+1}'s first occurrence is also in block j. Which violates the condition.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that each set can only be in exactly one block, and in block j, the sets can contain x_j, x_{j+1}, ..., x_m, but not any x_k for k < j.\n\nThus, the array is a sequence of blocks, each block j can have any number of sets, each of which is a subset of {x_j, x_{j+1}, ..., x_m}.\n\nMoreover, the blocks must be in order x_1, x_2, ..., x_m.\n\nSo, for a fixed s, the array is composed of m = K - s + 1 blocks. Each block j (for x_j = s + j - 1) can have any number of sets, each of which is a subset of {x_j, x_{j+1}, ..., x_m}.\n\nSo, the problem now reduces to counting the number of ways to split the N sets into m blocks, where each block j can have any number of sets (including zero), and each set in block j is a subset of {x_j, x_{j+1}, ..., x_m}.\n\nWait, but the blocks are in order, so the order of the blocks is fixed as x_1, x_2, ..., x_m. So, the array is a sequence of m blocks, each block j can have any number of sets, and the sets in block j are ordered in some way, but the block order is fixed.\n\nWait, but each set can be placed in any of the blocks, as long as the blocks are in order.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem is similar to placing the sets into m ordered bins, where each bin j can receive any subset of the sets, but each set in bin j must be a subset of {x_j, x_{j+1}, ..., x_m}.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because each set can only be in one bin, and the bin j corresponds to x_j, x_{j+1}, etc.\n\nSo, for each set, we can choose which bin it goes into, but it can only go into a bin j if it is a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. The key insight is to model the problem using dynamic programming and combinatorics to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to find the number of arrays of sets such that there exists a rearrangement where each set is a child of the next. This translates to ensuring that for each element `x` in a set, the next element `x+1` must appear in a later set in the array.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each `x`, if `x` is present in any set, then `x+1` must be present in a later set. This forms a chain of dependencies from `1` up to `K`.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid arrays. We consider each possible starting point `s` (the smallest element in the array) and compute the number of valid arrays for each `s`.\n\n4. **Combinatorics**: For each starting point `s`, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the sets into blocks where each block corresponds to a range of elements starting from `s`. Each block can contain any number of sets, and each set in a block can include any combination of the elements corresponding to that block.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo `998244353` to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial modulo MOD\n    max_n = max(N, K)\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    \n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_n - 1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    def comb(n, k):\n        if n < 0 or k < 0 or k > n:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD\n    \n    total = 0\n    for s in range(1, K+1):\n        m = K - s + 1\n        if m == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # We need to split N into m parts, each part can have 0 or more.\n        # The number of ways is C(N + m - 1, m - 1)\n        ways = comb(N + m - 1, m - 1)\n        \n        # Now, for each of the m blocks, each set in the block can have any subset of the elements in that block.\n        # Each block j has elements from x_j to x_m.\n        # Each set in block j can have any subset of these elements.\n        # But since each set is independent, the total is product over all sets of subsets.\n        # Wait, but the order of the sets matters.\n        # Alternatively, the number of ways is (sum_{a_1} sum_{a_2} ... sum_{a_N}) where each a_i is a subset of some elements.\n        # But since the blocks are ordered, it's the product of the possibilities for each block.\n        # For each block j, the number of subsets is 2^{t_j}, where t_j is the number of elements in the block.\n        # However, each set can choose any subset of the elements in its block.\n        # So, for each block j, the number of subsets per set is 2^{size of block j}.\n        # But since the blocks are ordered, the total is the product for each set of 2^{m}?\n        # Wait, no.

No, that doesn't seem right.\n        # Another approach: For each set, it can be placed in any of the m blocks.

Let me think about generating functions.\n        # The generating function for each block j is (1 + 2^{m - j + 1} * x). The total generating function is the product of these terms for j=1 to m.\n        # We need the coefficient of x^N in this product, multiplied by C(N + m - 1, m - 1).\n        # The product is (1 + a_1 x)(1 + a_2 x)...(1 + a_m x), where a_j = 2^{m - j + 1}.\n        # So, the coefficient of x^k is the sum over all subsets of size k, each term being the product of a_j for j in the subset.\n        # So, the coefficient of x^N is the sum over all possible selections of d_j's (with d_1 + ... + d_m = N) of product (a_j^{d_j}).\n        # Which is exactly the sum we're trying to compute.\n        # So, the number of ways is ways * S, where S is the sum of product (a_j^{d_j}) for all d_j's summing to N.\n        # But calculating S directly for each s is computationally expensive for large N and K.\n        # Instead, we can precompute the generating function and extract the coefficient for x^N.\n        # The generating function is the product for j from 1 to m of (1 + a_j x), where a_j = 2^{m - j + 1}.\n        # So, the coefficient of x^N is the sum over all subsets of size N of the product of a_j for j in the subset.\n        # This can be computed using dynamic programming.\n        # Let dp[i] be the sum for the first i elements.\n        # Then, dp[0] = 1, and for each j, dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[i-1] * a_j.\n        # But since m can be up to 2e5, we need an efficient way to compute this.\n        # Alternatively, note that each a_j is a power of two, so we can represent the product as a bitmask and compute using binary exponentiation.\n        # However, for the constraints given, a direct approach might not be feasible, so we need a smarter way.\n        # Another observation: the sum S is equal to the sum_{k=0}^m (k! / (k! )) * (sum_{d_1 + ... + d_m = N} product a_j^{d_j} }, but I'm not sure.\n        # Perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for S.\n        # Let me try small cases.\n        # For example, when m=1: S = 1 + a_1 x, so the coefficient of x^N is a_1^N.\n        # When m=2: (1 + a_1 x)(1 + a_2 x) = 1 + (a_1 + a_2)x + a_1 a_2 x^2.\n        # The coefficient of x^N is a_1^N + a_2^N if N=0, else 0.

Let me think differently.\n        # The sum e_k is equal to the sum of all possible products of k distinct b_j's, where b_j = 2^j.\n        # This is equivalent to the sum of all possible combinations of k distinct exponents, which is equal to the sum of 2^{sum of exponents}, but this seems tricky.\n        # Another approach: the generating function is the product of (1 + 2^j x) for j=1 to m.\n        # The coefficient of x^k is the sum of products of k distinct 2^j's.\n        # Let's find a generating function approach or a combinatorial identity.\n        # Let me consider the binary representation.
