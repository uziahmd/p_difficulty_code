For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem statement again. The input is three notes, and I need to check if they form a major or minor triad when arranged in the correct order. If they don't fit either, it's 'strange'. Also, the answer is unambiguous, so no cases where both major and minor apply.\n\nSo, what defines a major and minor triad?\n\nFor a major triad, the notes can be ordered such that the first to second is 4 semitones apart, and second to third is 3. So the total is 7 semitones. But wait, the order doesn't matter because it's an unordered set. So I need to consider all possible permutations of the three notes and see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nSimilarly for a minor triad: the first two are 3 semitones apart, and the next two (so the last two) are 4. Again, the total is 7 semitones, but the order is different.\n\nBut wait, since the distance is measured from lower to higher, perhaps the way we order the notes matters. Because the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones going up. So for example, E to C is 8 semitones, not 4.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So each note is a step. So the list of notes is cyclic, but when calculating the distance from X to Y, it's the number of steps you take moving forward (clockwise) from X to reach Y.\n\nSo, for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones because C → C# → D → D# → E: four steps. The distance between E and C would be 8 semitones because moving forward from E: F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, H, C—eight steps.\n\nSo, for any two distinct notes X and Y, their distance is (Y - X) mod 12, multiplied by 1 semitone, but considering the order. Wait, no. Wait, each note has a position. Let's assign each note a numerical value, like C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11. Then, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12 if Y >= X. Otherwise, it's (Y + 12 - X). Or perhaps more accurately, it's (Y - X) % 12, but since the distance is always positive when moving forward, the actual distance is (Y - X) % 12. Wait, no, because moving backward would require adding 12. Hmm.\n\nWait, for example, the distance from E to C: E is 4, C is 0. So (0 - 4) is -4. But modulo 12, that's 8. Which is correct because it's 8 semitones forward from E to C.\n\nSo, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) % 12. Because when Y is less than X, subtracting gives a negative number, but modulo 12 makes it positive.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for any two notes, the distance is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12.\n\nNow, for a major triad, the three notes must be able to be arranged in an order X, Y, Z such that:\n\ndistance(X,Y) = 4 semitones,\n\ndistance(Y,Z) = 3 semitones.\n\nWhich means, the positions of X, Y, Z should satisfy Y = (X + 4) mod 12, and Z = (Y +3) mod 12.\n\nAlternatively, since the triad is unordered, any permutation that satisfies this would do.\n\nSimilarly, for a minor triad, the distances are 3 and 4 respectively: X to Y is 3, Y to Z is 4.\n\nSo, for the given three notes, I need to generate all possible permutations of the three, compute the distances between consecutive notes in each permutation, and see if any permutation meets the major or minor conditions.\n\nWait, but the triad could have any order, so for each permutation of the three, I need to calculate the distances between the first and second, and second and third, and see if they match the required pattern.\n\nSo the steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Convert each note into its numerical position.\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n\n3. For",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves converting the notes into numerical positions, generating all permutations of these notes, and checking each permutation to see if it fits the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Notes to Numerical Positions**: Each note is assigned a numerical value based on its position in the musical scale. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, and so on up to H which is 11.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since the order of notes matters for determining the triad type, we generate all possible permutations of the three notes.\n3. **Check Triad Conditions**: For each permutation, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad:\n   - **Major Triad**: The first note to the second is 4 semitones apart, and the second to the third is 3 semitones apart.\n   - **Minor Triad**: The first note to the second is 3 semitones apart, and the second to the third is 4 semitones apart.\n4. **Determine Result**: Based on the checks, classify the triad as major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Assign each note a numerical position\nnote_positions = {\n    'C': 0, 'C#': 1, 'D': 2, 'D#': 3, 'E': 4, 'F': 5, 'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7, 'G#': 8, 'A': 9, 'B': 10, 'H': 11\n}\n\n# Read input\ninput_notes = input().split()\nnotes = [note_positions[n] for n in input_notes]\n\n# Generate all possible permutations of the three notes\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    # Calculate the distances between consecutive notes\n    d1 = (perm[1] - perm[0]) % 12\n    d2 = (perm[2] - perm[1]) % 12\n    \n    # Check for major triad condition: 4, then 3 semitones\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        break\n    # Check for minor triad condition: 3, then 4 semitones\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        break\nelse:\n    # If none of the above, it's strange\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Conversion**: Each note is converted into a numerical position to facilitate distance calculations.\n- **Permutations**: We use permutations to consider all possible orders of the notes.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n- **Triad Check**: For each permutation, we check if the distances match the criteria for major or minor triads. If neither condition is met, the result is classified as strange.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the notes are considered, providing an accurate classification of the triad.",
