Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if the pile of letters found in the morning can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly, without any extra letters left. So, essentially, the combined letters of the guest and host should exactly match the pile.\n\nHmm, right. So the approach here is to check if the total count of each letter in the guest and host names equals the count in the pile. If they do for all letters, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this. The steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines: guest, host, pile.\n2. Combine the guest and host into one string.\n3. Compare the frequency of each character in this combined string with the frequency in the pile.\n4. If all counts match, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, first, I need a way to count the frequency of each character. In Python, I can use the Counter class from the collections module. That's efficient and easy to use.\n\nBut wait, what if there are uppercase letters? Oh, the problem states that all letters are uppercase, so no case issues to worry about.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure.\n\n- Read guest, host, pile from input. Note that each is on a separate line, possibly with a newline character. So, for each line, we'll probably strip any leading/trailing whitespace, like using .strip().\n\nWait, in Python, when reading lines from stdin, each line includes the trailing newline. Using .strip() will remove that, giving us just the letters.\n\nSo, for each line, we do something like:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combine guest and host:\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nThen, create Counters for combined and pile.\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nThen, compare these two counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the lengths? Well, the sum of the lengths of guest and host must equal the length of the pile. Otherwise, it's impossible. So as an optimization, perhaps first check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, immediately output NO.\n\nYes, that's a good idea because if the lengths don't match, the counts can't possibly match either.\n\nSo the steps become:\n\n1. Read the three lines, stripping them.\n2. Check if the sum of the lengths of guest and host equals the length of pile. If not, print NO.\n3. Else, combine guest and host, create the two counters.\n4. If the counters are equal, print YES, else NO.\n\nWhat about cases where one of the names is empty? But the problem says all lines are non-empty, so no problem.\n\nTesting the example given:\n\nIn the first sample input:\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined guest+host: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count the letters.\n\nWait, but when you combine them, it's the exact letters needed for the pile. So their counts should match.\n\nIn the second sample:\nGuest: PAPAINOEL\nHost: JOULUPUKKI\nPile: BABONATALE FATHERCHRISTMAS BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nWait, wait, the pile is \"BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\". So when we combine guest and host, we get PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's see their combined letters. Then the pile may have missing letters or extra.\n\nIn any case, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nAnother test case could be where the pile has exactly the same letters, but in different order. Since we're counting, the order doesn't matter.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- All letters are same.\n- Only one guest and one host, and the pile is exactly the concatenation.\n- One of the names is longer than the other, but the pile matches.\n\nPotential issues: Are there any letters that might be in the pile but not in the guest and host? Like, if the pile has an extra 'A' not present elsewhere, it should return NO.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would look like:\n\nRead the three lines, strip each.\n\nCheck the sum of lengths.\n\nIf not equal, print NO.\n\nElse, combine the guest and host strings.\n\nCreate two Counters.\n\nCompare.\n\nPrint YES or NO accordingly.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, import Counter from collections.\n\nThen, read the inputs.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that the combined letters of the guest and host should match exactly with the letters in the pile without any extra letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Check Lengths:** Verify if the sum of the lengths of the guest's and host's names equals the length of the pile. If not, immediately output \"NO\".\n3. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n4. **Count Frequencies:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in the combined string of the guest and host.\n5. **Compare Frequencies:** Compare the frequency of each character in the combined string with the frequency of each character in the pile. If they match exactly, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of characters without considering their order, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines from input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the combined length matches the pile's length\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Combine guest and host\n    combined = guest + host\n    # Create counters for both combined and pile\n    counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the two counters\n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read line by line, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace to ensure we only get the actual letters.\n- **Length Check:** Before proceeding further, we check if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. This is an early exit condition to quickly handle impossible cases.\n- **Combining Names:** By concatenating the guest's and host's names, we create a single string that represents all the letters needed to form both names.\n- **Frequency Counting:** Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module allows us to efficiently count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The comparison of the two counters ensures that every character appears the same number of times in both the combined string and the pile, confirming that the pile can be rearranged to form the names exactly.\n\nThis method ensures that we handle all edge cases and efficiently determine the correct output.",
