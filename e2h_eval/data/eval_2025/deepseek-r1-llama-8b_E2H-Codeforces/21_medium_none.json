The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a certain way.\n\nThe condition for unlocking is that the sum of a_i and b_j must be odd. So, a_i + b_j ≡ 1 mod 2. Which means one is even and the other is odd. Because an even plus an odd gives an odd sum.\n\nSo, each key can be used once to unlock one chest, and each chest can only be unlocked once.\n\nHmm, so the approach here is to find the maximum number of chests we can unlock by matching the keys appropriately.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's categorize the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i.\n\nSimilarly, for the keys, we'll categorize them into even and odd based on their b_j values.\n\nBecause for a key to unlock a chest, the parity (even or odd) of the key and chest must be different.\n\nSo, for example, if a key is even, it can only unlock chests with odd a_i. And vice versa.\n\nSo, the strategy would be:\n\n- Count the number of even and odd keys.\n- Count the number of even and odd chests.\n- Then, determine how to pair them optimally.\n\nWait, but the optimal pairing isn't just the maximum of the two possibilities because sometimes you can use both even and odd keys to maximize the total.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used only once, and each chest only once.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to compute:\n\nWe can unlock as many chests as possible by using the keys in such a way that for each chest, we have a suitable key.\n\nSo, the steps might be:\n\n1. Separate the chests into even_a (number of chests where a_i is even) and odd_a (number where a_i is odd).\n\n2. Similarly, separate the keys into even_b (keys with even b_j) and odd_b (keys with odd b_j).\n\n3. Now, for each key type, we can match to a specific chest type.\n\nFor example, even_b keys can be matched to odd_a chests, and odd_b keys can be matched to even_a chests.\n\nBut also, each key can be used at most once, and each chest as well.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests we can unlock is the minimum between:\n\na) The number of even_b keys and the number of odd_a chests. Because each even_b can unlock an odd_a chest, but each can be used once.\n\nb) The number of odd_b keys and the number of even_a chests.\n\nAdditionally, we can choose whether to use all even_b keys on odd_a, or some of them, but we need to find the maximum possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of chests is the sum of the minimums of the two possibilities, but not overlapping.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of chests is equal to the minimum of (even_b + odd_b) and (odd_a + even_a), but that's probably not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used once, but each chest can also be used once.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's say:\n\nWe have two possible ways to unlock chests:\n\n1. Use even_b keys to unlock odd_a chests.\n2. Use odd_b keys to unlock even_a chests.\n\nEach of these contributes to the total. So the total maximum is the sum of the minimum between the available even_b and odd_a, plus the minimum between the available odd_b and even_a.\n\nWait, no, because that might overcount. Because each key is either used for even or odd.\n\nWait, no, because for each even_b key, it can only be used for an odd_a chest. So the first part is min(even_b_count, odd_a_count). Similarly, the second part is min(odd_b_count, even_a_count). The sum of these two would be the maximum possible, but wait, is that possible?\n\nWait, no. Because after using some even_b keys on odd_a chests, the remaining even_b keys can't be used elsewhere. So the two choices are mutually exclusive for each key.\n\nWait, no. Because the even_b keys can only be used for odd_a chests. So we can't have any overlap.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests is the maximum possible from two options:\n\nOption 1: Use as many even_b as possible on odd_a, and as many odd_b as possible on even_a.\n\nBut the sum of these is min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a).\n\nBut wait, this might not be possible because the sum could exceed the total number of chests. Or perhaps not. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the maximum between:\n\nmin(even_b + odd_b, odd_a + even_a) and the sum of min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is the minimum of (even_b + odd_b) and (odd_a + even_a). But no, because even_b can't all be used on odd_a if there are more than odd_a chests.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the minimum between:\n\nmax_even_odd = min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)\n\nand\n\nmin(even_b + odd_b, even_a + odd_a)\n\nWait, no, because even_b + odd_b is the total number of keys, and even_a + odd_a is the total number of chests. So the maximum possible is the minimum of these two. Because you can't unlock more chests than the number of keys allows, and also not more than the number of chests.\n\nWait, yes! Because each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked by at most one key. So the maximum possible is the minimum of (total_keys, total_chests). But wait, that's not necessarily the case because the parities may not allow that.\n\nWait, for example, suppose all keys are even, and all chests are even. Then you can't unlock any chests, because even + even is even, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So in this case, the maximum is zero, but the minimum of keys and chests is non-zero.\n\nSo, the actual maximum is the minimum between the two options:\n\nEither the sum of the two min(even_b, odd_a) and min(odd_b, even_a), but not exceeding the minimum of (keys_total, chests_total).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: We use as many even_b as possible on odd_a, and as many odd_b as possible on even_a. The total is then the sum of these two. But we can't exceed the number of chests available.\n\nWait, no, because the sum could be up to min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a). But this sum could be larger than the total number of chests, which is n. So the actual maximum is the minimum between this sum and n.\n\nWait, but n is the total number of chests. Because each chest can be unlocked at most once.\n\nSo, the maximum is the minimum between (sum of min(even_b, odd_a) and min(odd_b, even_a)) and n.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each key can unlock a chest, but the total can't exceed the number of chests.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Split the a array into even and odd counts: count_ea and count_oe.\n\n2. Split the b array into even and odd counts: count_eb and count_ob.\n\n3. Compute the maximum possible as:\n\nmax_possible = min(count_eb, count_oe) + min(count_ob, count_ea)\n\n4. The answer is the minimum between max_possible and the total number of chests, n.\n\nWait, but wait. Because each key can only be used once, and each chest as well, but the sum could be higher than n.\n\nWait, no. Because each chest can be unlocked by exactly one key. So the maximum possible is the minimum between the sum of the two minima and n.\n\nWait, let me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\nn=5, m=4\na = [9,14,6,2,11] → a_i's parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\nSo, count_oe = 2 (chests 9 and 11), count_ea = 3 (14,6,2).\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]\n8 is even, 4 even,7 odd,20 even.\ncount_eb = 3 (8,4,20), count_ob=1 (7).\n\nCompute:\nmin(eb, oe) → min(3, 2) = 2\nmin(ob, ea) → min(1,3)=1\nsum is 3. The total chests is 5, so min(3,5) is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample 2:\nn=5, m=1\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even. count_oe=0, count_ea=5.\n\nb = [5] → odd. count_eb=0, count_ob=1.\n\nCompute:\nmin(eb, oe)=0, min(ob, ea)= min(1,5)=1. Sum is 1.\n\nWhich is <=5, so output is 1.\n\nSample3:\nn=1, m=4\na = [10] → even. count_oe=0, count_ea=1.\n\nb = [20,30,40,50] → all even. count_eb=4, count_ob=0.\n\nCompute:\nmin(eb, oe) = min(4,0)=0. min(ob, ea)=0. Sum is 0. So output 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=3.\n\na: [1,2,3] → odd, even, odd → count_oe=2, count_ea=1.\n\nb: [1,2,3] → odd, even, odd → count_ob=2, count_eb=1.\n\nCompute:\n\nmin(eb, oe)= min(1,2)=1.\n\nmin(ob, ea)= min(2,1)=1.\n\nSum is 2. n is 3, so the answer is 2.\n\nIs that correct? Let's see.\n\nWe can use even_b (only 1 even key) to unlock one of the odd chests. Then use the two odd_b keys to unlock the even chest. So total 2+1=3? Wait wait no.\n\nWait, no. Because the even_b key can be used for one of the two odd chests. Then, the two odd_b keys can each unlock the even chest, but since the even chest can only be unlocked once, that's not possible.\n\nWait, so in this case:\n\nWe have:\n\neven_b: 1 key.\n\nodd_b: 2 keys.\n\ncount_oe=2, count_ea=1.\n\nSo, the even_b can unlock one of the two odd chests. Then, the two odd_b keys can each try to unlock the even chest, but since the even chest can only be unlocked once, only one can be used.\n\nSo total is 1 (from even_b) + 1 (from odd_b) = 2. Which is what the sum suggests.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, m=4.\n\na: [1,3,5,7] → all odd. count_oe=4, count_ea=0.\n\nb: [2,4,6,8] → all even. count_eb=4, count_ob=0.\n\nSo, we can use each even_b key to unlock an odd chest. So 4 chests.\n\nSum is min(4,4) + min(0,0) =4.\n\nn is 4, so the maximum is 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=5.\n\na has 3 even, 2 odd.\n\nb has 4 even, 1 odd.\n\nSo:\n\nmin(eb, oe) = min(4,2)=2.\n\nmin(ob, ea) = min(1,3)=1.\n\nSum is 3.\n\nBut n=5, so 3 is the answer.\n\nBut wait, the total keys are 5, and the total chests are 5. So the maximum possible is 3 because the sum is 3, which is less than 5. So why isn't it 5?\n\nBecause the sum can't be more than the sum of the minima.\n\nWait, in this case, even though the total keys and chests are 5 each, the maximum is 3 because the parities don't allow more.\n\nSo the logic holds.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\nCalculate the number of even and odd chests, and even and odd keys.\n\nCompute the sum of min(even_b, odd_a) and min(odd_b, even_a). Then take the minimum between this sum and the total number of chests (n).\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Read n, m.\n\n2. Read the a array, count the number of even and odd elements (count_ea and count_oe).\n\n3. Read the b array, count the number of even and odd elements (count_eb and count_ob).\n\n4. Compute:\n\n   possible = min(count_eb, count_oe) + min(count_ob, count_ea)\n\n5. The answer is the minimum of possible and n.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nIn Python, I can do the following:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen, read the a list, and count how many are even and odd.\n\nSimilarly for the b list.\n\nCompute the possible value as described.\n\nThen, print the minimum between possible and n.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\ncount_ea =3 (14,6,2), count_oe=2.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]\n\ncount_eb=3, count_ob=1.\n\npossible = min(3,2) + min(1,3) → 2+1=3.\n\nn=5. So min(3,5)=3.\n\nSample 2:\n\na is all even (count_ea=5, count_oe=0).\n\nb has 1 odd.\n\npossible = min(0,0) + min(1,5) → 0+1=1.\n\nn=5. So 1.\n\nSample3:\n\na has 1 even.\n\nb has 4 even.\n\npossible = min(4,0) + min(0,1) → 0+0=0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\na has 1 even, 2 odd.\n\nb has 1 even, 2 odd.\n\npossible = min(1,2) + min(2,1) → 1+1=2.\n\nn=3. So 2.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nBut wait, how to read the input correctly?\n\nThe input is given as three lines:\n\nFirst line: n and m.\n\nSecond line: n integers, the a list.\n\nThird line: m integers, the b list.\n\nSo, the code will be something like:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_ea = 0\n\ncount_oe = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num %2 ==0:\n\n        count_ea +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        count_oe +=1\n\ncount_eb = 0\n\ncount_ob =0\n\nfor num in b:\n\n    if num%2 ==0:\n\n        count_eb +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        count_ob +=1\n\npossible = min(count_eb, count_oe) + min(count_ob, count_ea)\n\nans = min(possible, n)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, but what about when the sum is larger than n? For example, if possible is 5 and n is 3, then we can only take 3. So the min function correctly takes the lower value.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me test another edge case.\n\nCase where all a are even, and all b are even.\n\nn=2, m=3.\n\na: [2,4] → count_ea=2, count_oe=0.\n\nb: [2,4,6] → count_eb=3, count_ob=0.\n\npossible = min(3,0) + min(0,2) → 0+0=0. So ans is 0.\n\nWhich is correct because even + even is even, which doesn't meet the condition.\n\nAnother edge case: all a are even, and all b are odd.\n\nn=3, m=2.\n\na: even, even, even → count_ea=3, count_oe=0.\n\nb: odd, odd → count_eb=0, count_ob=2.\n\npossible = min(0,0) + min(2,3) → 0+2=2.\n\nn=3, so ans is 2.\n\nWhich is correct because each odd key can unlock an even chest.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. The condition for opening a chest is that the sum of the number on the chest and the key must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize the Chests and Keys**: Separate the chests into even and odd based on the numbers written on them. Similarly, separate the keys into even and odd.\n2. **Count the Parities**: Count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers. Do the same for the keys.\n3. **Calculate Possible Openings**: Determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened by considering two scenarios:\n   - Using even keys to unlock odd chests.\n   - Using odd keys to unlock even chests.\n4. **Compute the Result**: The result is the minimum of the total possible openings and the total number of chests, ensuring we do not exceed the available chests.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_ea = 0\ncount_oe = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        count_ea += 1\n    else:\n        count_oe += 1\n\ncount_eb = 0\ncount_ob = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        count_eb += 1\n    else:\n        count_ob += 1\n\npossible = min(count_eb, count_oe) + min(count_ob, count_ea)\nans = min(possible, n)\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of chests and keys, followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd**: For both chests and keys, count how many have even and odd numbers.\n3. **Determine Maximum Openings**: Calculate the maximum number of chests that can be opened by using even keys on odd chests and odd keys on even chests.\n4. **Output the Result**: The result is the minimum of the calculated possible openings and the total number of chests, ensuring we do not exceed the available chests.\n\nThis approach efficiently categorizes and counts the chests and keys, then computes the maximum possible openings using simple arithmetic operations, making it both optimal and easy to understand.",
