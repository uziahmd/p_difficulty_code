    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible substring, I need to check if it appears more than once, and keep track of the maximum length where this happens.\n\nFirst, I think about how to approach this. One way is to generate all possible substrings of the string, then for each possible length, starting from the largest possible, check if any substring of that length occurs at least twice.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we start checking from the largest possible lengths, the first time we find a substring that meets the condition, that's our answer. It's efficient because we don't need to check smaller lengths once we find the maximum.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible down to 1.\n2. For each length L, generate all substrings of length L.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears at least twice in the string.\n4. If such a substring exists, return L as the answer.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nThe string can be up to 100 characters long. So the maximum possible substring length is 99 (since a substring needs to appear at least twice, but wait, no, the substring can be of length 1 and appear twice, but maybe longer ones are better).\n\nWait, for example, the string 'aaaaa' has a substring 'aaa' that appears multiple times. So, the maximum possible substring length is len(s) - 1? Or perhaps len(s) // 2? Hmm, not sure. But to cover all possibilities, I should check from the largest possible L down to 1.\n\nSo for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\nWait, because for a string of length N, the maximum possible L is N-1. Because if the entire string was repeated, but that's only possible if N >= 2*L? Wait, no. Wait, no, for example, 'ababa' is length 5. The substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping. So L can be 3, which is (5-1)/2 + 1? Not sure. But the point is, the maximum L can be up to len(s)-1, because even a single character repeated would have L=1, but maybe longer substrings exist.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop L from len(s) down to 1:\n\nFor each L, collect all substrings of length L.\n\nFor each substring s_sub, check if it appears more than once in the main string.\n\nIf any s_sub meets this condition, return L as the answer.\n\nOnce found, since we're checking from largest L to smallest, the first occurrence will be the maximum possible.\n\nSo now, the question is: How to efficiently generate all substrings of length L, and check for duplicates.\n\nAn approach is:\n\nFor a given L, create a set of all substrings of length L. As we iterate through each substring, add it to the set. If adding it returns False (i.e., it's already present), then we know this substring has occurred before, so we can break early.\n\nBut wait, the set approach ensures that each substring is unique. So for each substring, when we add it to the set, if it's already there, we can note that a duplicate exists.\n\nBut since we are looking for any occurrence of a duplicate, as soon as any substring of length L has been seen before, we can immediately return L as the answer.\n\nSo, the steps for each L:\n\nInitialize an empty set.\n\nIterate through the string, taking substrings of length L:\n\nfor i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n    current_sub = s[i:i+L]\n    if current_sub in seen:\n        return L\n    else:\n        add current_sub to seen\n\nWait, but wait, what about the case where after adding current_sub, another current_sub comes again later. For example, in 'ababa', L=3: the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So when i=0, 'aba' is added. When i=2, we take 'aba' again. Since it's in the set, we return 3.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo this logic should work.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All characters are the same. Like 'zzzzz'.\n\nIn this case, the maximum L is len(s) -1. Because the entire string minus one character is the substring that repeats.\n\nWait, for 'zzz' (length 3), the substrings of length 2 are 'zz",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking substrings of decreasing lengths starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we generate all possible substrings and check if any of them appear more than once. The first length where such a substring is found will be our answer because we start from the largest possible length.\n\n1. **Generate Substrings**: For each possible substring length `L` starting from the maximum possible (length of the string minus one) down to 1, generate all substrings of that length.\n2. **Check for Duplicates**: Use a set to keep track of seen substrings. As we generate each substring, we check if it has already been seen. If it has, we immediately return the current length `L` as the result.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the longest substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and early termination when a duplicate is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: Read the input string and determine its length.\n- **Loop Over Lengths**: Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (string length) down to 1.\n- **Substring Generation and Check**: For each length, generate all substrings and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is found in the set, print the current length and exit.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If no valid substring is found after checking all lengths, print 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the longest repeating substring by ensuring we check the largest possible substrings first and stop as soon as a duplicate is detected.",
