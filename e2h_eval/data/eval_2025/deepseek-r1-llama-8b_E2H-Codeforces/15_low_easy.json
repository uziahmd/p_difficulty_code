They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine all the winning integers x for a given tournament setup. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the tournament is a knockout style with 2^n teams. Each game eliminates one team, and the process continues until one champion remains. The way the games are structured is important. In each phase, the teams are paired as (1,2), (3,4), etc., and the winners proceed to the next phase.\n\nThe string s gives information about the outcome of each phase. For each character in s, if it's '0', then in that phase, the lower-skilled team wins each match. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nThe permutation p represents the skill levels of the teams. So, each number from 1 to 2^n appears exactly once in p. We need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nHmm, so what determines whether x can be the champion? It depends on how the tournament's structure and the phase outcomes affect the path x takes to win.\n\nLet me think about the phases. There are n phases. The first phase has 2^(n-1) games, the second 2^(n-2), and so on until the nth phase has just 1 game.\n\nEach phase corresponds to a certain level of pairing. The i-th phase (starting from 0 maybe?) corresponds to grouping the remaining teams into pairs and determining the winners, which then move to the next phase.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that for the i-th phase, the phase has 2^(n-i) games. So for i=0, it's the first phase, which has 2^n games. Wait, no: 2^{n} -1 games in total. The first phase has 2^{n-1} games. Then each phase reduces the number of teams by half until the last phase has 1 game.\n\nWait, maybe the phases are ordered from top to bottom. Like, the first phase is the initial round, and each phase after that is the next round.\n\nBut regardless of the exact order, each phase has a certain way of pairing the teams based on their original numbering.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model each phase's impact on the possible candidates for the champion.\n\nI recall that for certain tournament structures, the champion must come from specific subsets depending on the phase outcomes.\n\nLet me consider the example given:\n\nIn the sample input, n=3, s is \"101\". So the phases are:\n\nPhase 1 (i=0): s[0] is '1' → higher skill wins each match.\nPhase 2 (i=1): s[1] is '0' → lower skill wins each match.\nPhase 3 (i=2): s[2] is '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nThe output is four winning integers: 4,5,6,7 and another group 2,3. Wait, but the output lists two groups, each with their own lines. So each line is a set of x's that can be the champion for some permutation.\n\nSo the approach is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x can reach the top by winning each necessary game according to the phase rules.\n\nHmm, how can we model this? Maybe we can represent the tournament as a binary tree, where each node is a game, and the leaves are the initial matches. The root is the final game.\n\nEach node (game) has two children: the two games that precede it in the tournament. The winner of each child becomes the parent's participant.\n\nWait, but the structure of the tournament is fixed based on the initial pairings. So, for each phase, the matches are determined by the current state of the teams.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the tournament as a series of stages, and for each stage, determine the constraints on the ranks of the teams that can progress.\n\nFor each phase i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n- The phase has 2^{n - i} games. Each game is between two consecutive teams in the current pool.\n\n- Depending on s[i], the winner is determined: either the higher or lower rank.\n\nAfter each phase, the winners form the next set of participants for the next phase.\n\nThe key is to track, for each possible candidate x, whether they can reach the final by satisfying all the phase conditions.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem. For each phase, we can keep track of the possible positions that a candidate can be in to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the tournament in reverse. Starting from the final game and moving back to the initial matches.\n\nIn the final game, only two teams remain. Let's say the final game is phase i = n-1. The winner of that game is the champion.\n\nBut the final game's outcome depends",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the winning integers \\( x \\) such that there exists a permutation of team skills where \\( x \\) can become the champion of the tournament. The tournament structure and phase outcomes are given by a string \\( s \\), where each character indicates whether the lower or higher skilled team wins in each phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in phases, starting with the initial round where teams are paired off, and progressing through subsequent rounds until only one team remains. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until the final game determines the champion.\n\n2. **Phase Outcomes**: Each phase has a specified outcome (given by the string \\( s \\)). If \\( s[i] \\) is '0', the lower-skilled team wins each match in that phase; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n3. **Reverse Simulation**: To determine possible champions, we simulate the tournament in reverse. Starting from the final game and moving backward, we track which teams can reach the final based on the phase outcomes.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to keep track of possible candidates for each phase. For each phase, we update the set of possible candidates by considering the winners of the previous phase's matches.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    # Initialize possible candidates for each phase\n    dp = [set() for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[n] = {1}\n    \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        current_phase = i + 1\n        next_phase = current_phase + 1\n        size = 2 ** (n - current_phase)\n        for a in dp[current_phase]:\n            for b in dp[current_phase]:\n                if a == b:\n                    continue\n                winner = None\n                if s[i] == '0':\n                    if a > b:\n                        winner = b\n                    else:\n                        winner = a\n                else:\n                    if a < b:\n                        winner = b\n                    else:\n                        winner = a\n                if winner is not None:\n                    if winner not in dp[next_phase]:\n                        dp[next_phase].add(winner)\n    \n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n+2):\n        if i in dp[n]:\n            result.append(i)\n    \n    groups = []\n    current_group = []\n    last = None\n    for num in sorted(result):\n        if num != last:\n            if current_group:\n                groups.append(current_group)\n            current_group = [num]\n            last = num\n        else:\n            current_group.append(num)\n    if current_group:\n        groups.append(current_group)\n    \n    for group in groups:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, group)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing the possible candidates for each phase. The final phase (phase \\( n \\)) can only have one candidate, which is trivially the champion.\n\n2. **Reverse Simulation**: We iterate from the final phase back to the initial phase. For each phase, we consider all pairs of teams that could have won their respective matches in the previous phase and determine the possible winners for the current phase based on the given outcome.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each phase, we update the set of possible candidates by considering the winners of the previous phase's matches. This allows us to track which teams can progress through each phase to eventually become the champion.\n\n4. **Result Compilation**: After processing all phases, we compile the results to determine all possible winning integers \\( x \\) and print them in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the tournament in reverse, ensuring that we correctly track all possible candidates for each phase and determine the valid champions based on the given outcomes.",
