Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) formed by roads in Crazy Town. Each road is an infinite line, and the roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to the university. A step is moving from one block to another if they share a common border segment with non-zero length.\n\nHmm. So each step requires crossing exactly one road. Because if two blocks share a border, that border is a segment of a single road. So, moving between adjacent blocks across a shared road boundary counts as one step.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is non-zero. So, if two blocks share a common boundary segment, which is part of a road, then you can move between them in one step. But each such movement is across a single road. Because if two blocks are on opposite sides of a road, then that's a single step.\n\nWait, perhaps each road contributes some partitions. So the minimal steps would be equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university regions. Because each such road must be crossed once.\n\nSo, the key idea here is: for each road, determine whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of it. Each such road contributes +1 to the step count. So the minimal steps required is the number of such roads.\n\nAh, that makes sense! Because each such road forms a barrier that must be crossed. So the total steps are the count of roads where home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each of the n roads, check whether the home and university points lie on the same side or opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of roads where they are on opposite sides.\n3. Output this count.\n\nYes, because each such road must be crossed exactly once to go from home to university, assuming that the paths are connected through these roads.\n\nSo the main task is to, for each line, determine whether the two points are on the same side or not.\n\nHow to do that? Well, for each line ax + by + c = 0, compute the value of ax + by + c for both points. If the signs are different, they are on opposite sides; otherwise, same.\n\nBut wait, since c could be positive or negative, the sign depends on the product of (a*x + b*y + c) for the two points.\n\nWait, more precisely: for a given line, compute d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If d1 and d2 have opposite signs, then the points are on opposite sides of the line. Otherwise, they are on the same side.\n\nSo, for each line, compute d1 and d2. If d1*d2 < 0, then count this line towards the answer.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, read the input. Home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Then n, followed by n lines of a, b, c.\n\nFor each of the n lines:\n\nCompute d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c.\n\nCompute d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c.\n\nIf d1 and d2 have opposite signs, increment the count.\n\nFinally, output the count as the result.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if a or b is zero? No problem, because the line is valid (since a and b are not both zero). So, for example, a vertical line is handled correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: when d1 is zero. But according to the problem statement, neither home nor university is on any of the roads. So d1 and d2 cannot be zero.\n\nSo we don't have to handle cases where d1 is zero, because the problem says it's guaranteed that the points are not on any road.\n\nThus, our code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\n- Read home and university points.\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Initialize a counter to 0.\n\n- For each of n lines:\n\n   - Read a, b, c.\n\n   - Compute d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c.\n\n   - Compute d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c.\n\n   - If d1 * d2 < 0, increment counter.\n\n- Output the counter.\n\nThat's it.\n\nTesting this logic against the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nWait, wait, looking back, the sample input seems to have two parts, maybe the home and university are on the same side for all roads?\n\nWait, wait, the first sample input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, perhaps the first part is home, second is university, third is n, and the next n lines are roads.\n\nWait, the problem statement shows the input format as:\n\nThe first line contains home coordinates.\n\nSecond line: university.\n\nThird line: n.\n\nThen n lines: a, b, c.\n\nSo in the sample input, after the first two lines, the third line is 2, meaning two roads.\n\nRoads are:\n\n0 1 0 --> equation is 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0.\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nSo for home (1,1):\n\nd1 for first road: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1 >0.\n\nd2 for university (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 =-1 <0.\n\nSo d1*d2 is -1 <0 → opposite sides. So count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0.\n\nHome is at x=1: d1=1>0.\n\nUniversity at x=-1: d2=-1<0. So again, opposite sides. So count becomes 2.\n\nSo the output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nAnother test case: say home and university are on the same side for all roads. Then the steps needed is 0.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because the problem states that the home and university are in different blocks. But perhaps in some configurations, like when multiple roads separate them.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that neither home nor university is on a road, but they can be in the same block if there's no road separating them.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the initial arrangement is that all the roads are present, so home and university are in different blocks because they are separated by some roads.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the home and university are located in some blocks. It doesn't say that they are necessarily in different blocks. So if they are in the same block, then the answer is zero steps.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, is it possible? Let's see.\n\nIn the input, the third line is n, which is the number of roads.\n\nEach road is a line, and the home and university are not on any of the lines.\n\nSo, the home and university could be in the same block if the roads do not form a path between them. Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, no. Because the roads are lines, which partition the plane into regions. So the way the lines are arranged, the home and university might be in the same region if none of the lines separate them.\n\nBut how? Because each line divides the plane into two half-planes. So for each line, if the home and university are on the same side, then that line doesn't contribute to the separation.\n\nBut if for all lines, home and university are on the same side, then the home and university are in the same block. So steps needed is zero.\n\nWait, but that's not possible. Because if the lines are arranged in such a way that all lines pass on one side, but there exists a path connecting the two points without crossing any lines.\n\nWait, perhaps if the two points are in the same connected region despite the lines. But that's not possible because the lines partition the space.\n\nNo, actually, the lines form a set of boundaries. So the arrangement of lines will split the plane into regions. For two points to be in the same region, they must be in the same connected component. That depends on the arrangement of the lines.\n\nBut regardless, the problem says that home and university are in some blocks, which may or may not be the same.\n\nBut in terms of the solution, the number of roads that separate them (i.e., on which home and university are on opposite sides) is the minimal steps required to move from one to the other.\n\nBecause each such road must be crossed once.\n\nSo the algorithm remains correct.\n\nSo the code should process all roads, count those where the two points are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nWe can read the input as follows.\n\nRead home_x, home_y.\n\nRead uni_x, uni_y.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen for each of n lines:\n\nread a, b, c.\n\ncompute d1 = a * home_x + b * home_y + c.\n\nd2 = a * uni_x + b * uni_y + c.\n\nif d1 * d2 < 0, increment count.\n\nAt the end, print the count as a string.\n\nSo code-wise:\n\nRead the first line as a string, split into two integers.\n\nSame for the second line.\n\nThen n = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if d1 * d2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this against the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\nHome: 1 1\n\nUni: -1 -1\n\nn=2\n\nRoad 1: 0 1 0 → y=0.\n\nd1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1.\n\nd2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 =-1.\n\nProduct is -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad2: 1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nd1=1*1+0*1 +0=1.\n\nd2=1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 =-1.\n\nProduct -1 → count +=1. Total 2.\n\nSample output is 2.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose home and uni are on the same side for all roads.\n\nn=1, road: 2x + 4y + 6=0.\n\nHome is (1,1): 2+4+6=12>0.\n\nUni is (2,2): 4+8+6=18>0. So same side. So count is 0.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that home and uni are not on any road. So in this case, they are on the same side, and thus, same block.\n\nSo the code returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: home and uni are on opposite sides of two roads, same side for others.\n\nSo code counts 2.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nWhat about when a or b is zero? Like, a vertical line.\n\nE.g., road is x=5.\n\nHome is (6,7), uni is (4,8).\n\nSo for this road, a=1, b=0, c= -5.\n\nd1 = 1*6 + 0*7 -5 =6-5=1>0.\n\nd2=1*4 +0*8 -5=4-5=-1<0.\n\nProduct is -1 → count +=1.\n\nWhich is correct, because the road separates the two points.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: home is (0,0), uni is (0,0). But according to the problem statement, home and uni are in different blocks, but in this case, they are same point. But the problem says that it's guaranteed that they are not on any road. So in the code, it's safe.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"it is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university lie on the road.\"\n\nSo the points are not on any of the roads, but they could be same points. But that's not possible because the problem says the university is located in some block, implying it's different from home. Or perhaps home and uni can be same point, but that's unlikely.\n\nBut the code handles it regardless.\n\nSo I think the code is correct.\n\nSo now, time to write the Python code.\n\nWe'll read the first two lines, split into x1,y1 and x2,y2.\n\nThen read n.\n\nThen loop n times.\n\nCompute d1 and d2 for each line, check product.\n\nCount.\n\nPrint the count.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step involves crossing a road that separates two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The town is divided into blocks by roads represented as lines. Each road can be defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\). To move from one block to another, you must cross a road that separates them. The key insight is that each road that separates the home and university contributes exactly one step to the total count.\n\n2. **Determine Road Separation**: For each road, check if the home and university lie on opposite sides. This can be determined by evaluating the line equation at the coordinates of the home and university. If the results have opposite signs, the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n\n3. **Count Separating Roads**: For each road, compute the values for both home and university. If these values have opposite signs, increment the count of separating roads.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: The count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if d1 * d2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads.\n2. **Evaluating Each Road**: For each road, it computes the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Check Opposite Sides**: If the product of these values is negative, it means the points are on opposite sides of the road, so the count is incremented.\n4. **Output**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimum steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the required steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separation in the plane.",
