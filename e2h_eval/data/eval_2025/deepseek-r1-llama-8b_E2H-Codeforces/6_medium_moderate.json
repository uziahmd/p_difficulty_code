Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Leha choosing two vouchers for his vacation such that their durations sum up exactly to x days, and they don't overlap. Also, the total cost should be as minimal as possible. If it's not possible, we return -1.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration is ri - li + 1. So for two vouchers i and j, the sum of their durations should be exactly x.\n\nAlso, the vouchers must not intersect. That means either the first ends before the second starts (ri_i < lj) or the second ends before the first starts (ri_j < li_i). So they can't overlap at all.\n\nOur goal is to find two such vouchers with the sum of durations x and minimal total cost.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each voucher, compute its duration and store all vouchers along with their start, end, and cost.\n\n2. We need to find pairs of vouchers (i, j) where duration_i + duration_j = x.\n\n3. For each such pair, check if they are non-overlapping.\n\n4. Among all valid pairs, find the one with the minimal total cost.\n\nBut wait, considering that n can be up to 2e5, a naive O(n^2) approach would be too slow. So we need an efficient way to find these pairs.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. The sum of durations is x, which could be up to 2*1e5+ something. So perhaps, for each voucher, we can look for another voucher whose duration is (x - current_duration), and then check if they can be placed without overlapping.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each voucher i, we can calculate what duration j needs to have (d_j = x - d_i) and then look for a voucher j with that duration which doesn't overlap with i.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a list, each with their start, end, duration, and cost.\n\n- Sort the vouchers based on their end times, maybe. Or perhaps group them by their duration.\n\nWait, but grouping by duration might help. So for each duration d, we can have a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher i, we look for vouchers j in the group with duration (x - d_i). \n\nThat way, for each i, we can quickly access all possible j's that could form a pair with i.\n\nBut even within each group, checking every possible j for each i might still be O(n^2) in the worst case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible duration d, we can precompute some structures to allow efficient querying.\n\nWait, another thought: for each voucher i, the required duration for j is x - d_i. So for each i, we can look into the group of vouchers with that required duration and find the best j that doesn't overlap with i and has the minimal cost.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Create a dictionary where the keys are durations, and the values are lists of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end times.\n\nThen, for each voucher i:\n\n   - Compute required duration d_req = x - d_i.\n\n   - If d_req is not present in the dictionary, skip.\n\n   - Else, for each voucher j in the d_req group:\n\n      - Check if i and j are non-overlapping.\n\n      - If yes, compute the total cost and keep track of the minimum.\n\nBut wait, even this approach could be O(n^2) because for each i, there could be up to O(n) j's to check. So with n=2e5, this is 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: for each possible duration d, pre-sort the vouchers of duration d by their end time. Then, for each voucher i of duration d_i, find all vouchers j of duration d_j=x-d_i that end before i's start or start after i's end.\n\nBut again, how do we efficiently find such j's?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each j, we can pre-process their end times and start times in a way that allows binary search.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d, we can have a list of vouchers sorted by end time. Then, for a given i, which is in some other d group, we can perform a binary search on this sorted list to find vouchers j whose end time is <= i's start time - 1, or whose start time >= i's end + 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, j's end is before i's start, or j's start is after i's end.\n\nSo, for a given i, any j in the d_req group that satisfies either:\n\nj.end < i.start\n\nor \n\nj.start > i.end \n\nwould be a valid pair.\n\nSo, for each i, we can split the j's into two parts:\n\n1. Those that end before i's start.\n\n2. Those that start after i's end.\n\nAnd for each part, find the minimal cost j.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor part 1: among all j's in d_req group that end <= i.start - 1, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nFor part 2: among all j's in d_req group that start >= i.end + 1, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nIf either part exists, then i plus that j is a candidate.\n\nSo, for each i, the minimal cost for j in d_req group is the minimum between the minimal cost of part1 and part2.\n\nThus, for each i, the minimal cost pair is min( (cost_i + min_part1_cost), (cost_i + min_part2_cost) ), if both parts exist.\n\nBut how to compute min_part1_cost and min_part2_cost efficiently for each i.\n\nIdea:\n\nFor each d in the duration groups, precompute two things:\n\na) The minimal cost for vouchers in the group up to a certain end time. So for any i, in part 1, we can query the group's list of end times and find those <= i.start - 1, and find the minimal cost in that subset.\n\nb) The minimal cost for vouchers in the group that have start time >= some value. So for any i, in part 2, we can query the group's list of start times and find those >= i.end + 1, and find the minimal cost in that subset.\n\nBut how to structure this data.\n\nPerhaps for each duration d:\n\n- Sort the vouchers in the group by their end time.\n\n- For each voucher in this sorted list, precompute the prefix minimum cost up to that end time.\n\nSimilarly, sort the vouchers in the group by their start time, and precompute the suffix minimum cost from that start time.\n\nSo, for each d:\n\n- We have a list sorted by end time. Each entry contains (end, start, cost).\n\n- Precompute an array prefix_min where prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost from the first voucher to the k-th voucher in this sorted list.\n\n- Similarly, sort the vouchers by start time, and precompute a suffix_min array where suffix_min[k] is the minimal cost from the k-th voucher to the end.\n\nThen, for a given i, which is in d_i, and looking for j's in d_j = x - d_i:\n\nCase 1: j's end <= i's start -1.\n\nWe can perform a binary search on the sorted end list to find the largest end <= i.start -1.\n\nIf such a voucher exists, then the minimal cost for this part is prefix_min at that index.\n\nCase 2: j's start >= i's end + 1.\n\nWe perform a binary search on the sorted start list to find the smallest start >= i.end +1.\n\nIf such a voucher exists, the minimal cost is the suffix_min from that index.\n\nSo, for each i, we can get the minimal possible cost for j in O(log m), where m is the number of vouchers in the d_j group.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read all vouchers.\n\n2. For each voucher, compute its duration.\n\n3. Group the vouchers into a dictionary, where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers in that group.\n\n4. For each duration d in the dictionary:\n\n   a) Sort the vouchers in the group by end time. For this sorted list, create a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[k] is the minimum cost from 0 to k.\n\n   b) Sort the vouchers in the group by start time. For this sorted list, create a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[k] is the minimum cost from k to the end.\n\n5. For each voucher i in all vouchers:\n\n   a) Compute d_i = i.duration.\n\n   b) Compute d_req = x - d_i.\n\n   c) If d_req is not in the dictionary, skip.\n\n   d) Else, get the group for d_req.\n\n   e) Now, process two cases:\n\n      i) Case 1: find j's in the group where j.end <= i.start -1.\n\n         - Use binary search on the sorted end list to find the largest end <= i.start -1.\n\n         - If found, take the minimal cost from prefix_min up to that index.\n\n      ii) Case 2: find j's in the group where j.start >= i.end + 1.\n\n         - Use binary search on the sorted start list to find the first start >= i.end +1.\n\n         - If found, take the minimal cost from suffix_min starting at that index.\n\n      iii) For each case, if a minimal cost exists, compute the total cost (i.cost + min_cost_from_case).\n\n      iv) Keep track of the overall minimal cost across all such possibilities.\n\n6. After processing all vouchers, if the minimal cost is found, output it. Otherwise, output -1.\n\nThis approach should be efficient enough since for each voucher, the operations are O(log m) for each group, and the preprocessing is O(m log m) for each group.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, let's represent each voucher as a tuple or a class. But for efficiency, perhaps just a tuple with (li, ri, costi, duration).\n\nWait, no. Actually, when grouping, each voucher in a group needs to have their end and start times.\n\nSo, for each group, when sorting by end, we need to have (end, start, cost), so that during binary search, we can compare the end times.\n\nWait, no. When we sort the group by end, each voucher's end is part of the key. So the sorted list will be in increasing order of end.\n\nSo, for each group, we can create two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end: each element is (end, start, cost).\n\n- Sorted by start: each element is (start, end, cost).\n\nWait, no. When we sort by end, the elements are ordered by end, so their start and end are known.\n\nSo, for each group:\n\nsorted_end_list is a list of tuples (end, start, cost), sorted by end.\n\nsorted_start_list is a list of tuples (start, end, cost), sorted by start.\n\nThen, for the prefix_min:\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end_list[0].cost\n\nfor i from 1 to len(sorted_end_list)-1:\n\n   prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end_list[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, for the suffix_min:\n\nsuffix_min[len-1] = sorted_start_list[len-1].cost\n\nfor i from len-2 down to 0:\n\n   suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start_list[i].cost)\n\nThis way, for case 1, when we find the last index where end <= target, the prefix_min gives the minimal cost up to that index.\n\nFor case 2, when we find the first index where start >= target, the suffix_min gives the minimal cost from that index onwards.\n\nWait, no. Because in case 2, we want j's start >= i.end +1. So for each such j, the minimal cost is the minimal in the group from that index onwards.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, now, for each voucher i:\n\nWe compute d_i = ri - li +1.\n\nThen, d_req = x - d_i.\n\nIf d_req is not in the dictionary, continue.\n\nElse, get the group for d_req.\n\nThen, for case 1:\n\nWe need j's end <= i_li -1.\n\nWait, i's start is li, so j's end must be <= li -1.\n\nSo, target_end = i_li -1.\n\nIn the sorted_end_list of the group, find the rightmost voucher where end <= target_end.\n\nIf such a voucher exists, the minimal cost in this subset is prefix_min of that index.\n\nFor case 2:\n\ntarget_start = i_ri +1.\n\nIn the sorted_start_list of the group, find the leftmost voucher where start >= target_start.\n\nIf such a voucher exists, the minimal cost is the suffix_min starting from that index.\n\nSo, for each i, we can compute these two possibilities.\n\nBut wait, what if the same voucher j is used in both cases? Like, a voucher j that ends before i and starts after i. But that's allowed as long as they are non-overlapping.\n\nBut in our approach, for each i, we're considering all j's in the group, but in two separate cases.\n\nWait, no. Because j can be in either case, but not both. Because for a given j, it's either before i or after i, not both.\n\nWait, no. Because j can be either before i or after i, but not both.\n\nWait, for example, j could end before i starts, and also start after i ends. But in that case, j is both before and after, but since they are non-overlapping, both conditions are satisfied. So, in such a case, j can be considered in both case 1 and case 2. But in reality, we only need to consider j once, as either case 1 or case 2 would capture it.\n\nBut in our approach, for i, j may appear in both case 1 and case 2. However, since we are taking the minimal cost, adding j's cost twice is not a problem because in the code, we are considering j's cost only once per case, and then taking the minimal between the two.\n\nWait, no. Because for each i, we are checking case 1 and case 2 separately. So j could be in both, but when considering case 1, it's in that subset, and when considering case 2, it's also in that subset. So in the code, for each i, j is considered twice, but in reality, it's a single pair (i, j). So this could lead to considering j twice, but since it's a pair, it's okay because in the end, the minimal cost is correctly computed.\n\nWait, no. Because for each i, j is considered as a possible partner. So for each i, j is considered once in case 1 and once in case 2. But for each j, it's only added once to the group.\n\nSo, for example, if j is in case 1 for i, then when i is processed, j is considered. Similarly, when j is in case 2 for i, j is considered again.\n\nBut that's redundant because the pair (i,j) is considered twice, once as i in case 1, and once as j in case 2. But in reality, it's the same pair.\n\nWait, no. Because for a pair (i,j), when processing i, j is considered as a possible j for i, and when processing j, i is considered as a possible j for j. But in our code, for each i, j is considered as a possible partner, and the code tracks the minimal cost.\n\nBut in terms of the algorithm, it's correct because for each pair (i,j), it's considered once when i is processed and j is in the group. So even though j is processed as i in another iteration, it's not a problem because the code considers all possible pairs.\n\nBut wait, for the pair (i,j), it's considered once when i is processed, and j is in the group, and once when j is processed, i is in the group. But in each case, the code adds the cost of i and j.\n\nSo, for the pair (i,j), the cost is considered twice: once when i is processed as the first element, and once when j is processed as the first element.\n\nBut since we are looking for the minimal total cost, it's possible that the same pair is considered multiple times, but the minimal is correctly tracked.\n\nWait, no. Because when i is processed, j is in the group and is a possible partner, so the code computes i's cost plus j's cost, and adds it to the possible candidates. Similarly, when j is processed, i is in the group and is a possible partner, so the code computes j's cost plus i's cost, which is the same as before. So, each pair is considered twice, but it's okay because the minimal is correctly captured.\n\nBut this leads to the possibility of redundant computations, but since the problem is about finding the minimal cost, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, the code will process each pair (i,j) twice, once as (i,j) and once as (j,i), but since the sum of durations is the same regardless of order, and the cost is the same, it's okay.\n\nBut perhaps, to optimize, we could ensure that i < j to avoid double-processing, but that's more complex and may not be necessary.\n\nWell, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the initial approach is sufficient.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nEach group will have:\n\n- sorted_end_list: list of (end, start, cost), sorted by end.\n\n- prefix_min: list where prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost from 0 to k.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_start_list: list of (start, end, cost), sorted by start.\n\n- suffix_min: list where suffix_min[k] is the minimal cost from k to end.\n\nSo, the steps for each group:\n\nSort by end:\n\nsorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x.end)\n\nprefix_min = [voucher.cost for voucher in sorted_end]\n\ncurrent_min = prefix_min[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n\n   current_min = min(current_min, prefix_min[i])\n\n   prefix_min[i] = current_min\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_start_list:\n\nsorted_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x.start)\n\nsuffix_min = [voucher.cost for voucher in sorted_start]\n\ncurrent_min = suffix_min[-1]\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n   current_min = min(current_min, suffix_min[i])\n\n   suffix_min[i] = current_min\n\nWait, no. Because in the sorted_start list, the suffix_min[i] should be the minimal cost from i to the end. So, we can compute it by going from the end to the beginning.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the code, for each voucher i:\n\nd_i = ri - li +1\n\nd_req = x - d_i\n\nif d_req not in the groups, continue\n\nelse:\n\n   group = groups[d_req]\n\n   # Case 1: j's end <= i_li -1\n\n   target_end = i.li -1\n\n   # binary search in group.sorted_end for the largest end <= target_end\n\n   low = 0\n\n   high = len(group.sorted_end) -1\n\n   res = -1\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) //2\n\n       if group.sorted_end[mid].end <= target_end:\n\n           res = mid\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n   if res != -1:\n\n       min_cost_case1 = group.prefix_min[res]\n\n       total_cost = i.cost + min_cost_case1\n\n       # update the global minimal cost\n\n   # Case 2: j's start >= i_ri +1\n\n   target_start = i.ri +1\n\n   # binary search in group.sorted_start for the smallest start >= target_start\n\n   low = 0\n\n   high = len(group.sorted_start) -1\n\n   res = -1\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) //2\n\n       if group.sorted_start[mid].start >= target_start:\n\n           res = mid\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n       else:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n   if res != -1:\n\n       min_cost_case2 = group.suffix_min[res]\n\n       total_cost = i.cost + min_cost_case2\n\n       # update the global minimal cost\n\n   # compare total_cost with the current minimal\n\nSo, the code will loop through each voucher, for each i, process as above.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial setup.\n\nWe can represent each voucher as a class or a tuple.\n\nIn Python, tuples are immutable and can be hashed, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps a list of dictionaries is easier.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nEach voucher is (li, ri, costi). So, for each voucher, we can create a Voucher object with attributes:\n\nclass Voucher:\n\n    def __init__(self, li, ri, costi):\n\n        self.li = li\n\n        self.ri = ri\n\n        self.cost = costi\n\n        self.duration = ri - li +1\n\nSo, for each voucher, we can compute duration.\n\nGrouping them into a dictionary, where the key is duration, and the value is a list of vouchers.\n\nBut for each group, we need two sorted lists and their prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ngroups = {}\n\nfor each voucher in vouchers:\n\n    d = voucher.duration\n\n    if d not in groups:\n\n        groups[d] = {'sorted_end': [], 'sorted_start': [], 'prefix_min': [], 'suffix_min': []}\n\n    groups[d]['sorted_end'].append( (voucher.ri, voucher.li, voucher.cost) )\n\n    groups[d]['sorted_start'].append( (voucher.li, voucher.ri, voucher.cost) )\n\nThen, for each group in groups:\n\ngroup = groups[d]\n\ngroup['sorted_end'] = sorted(group['sorted_end'], key=lambda x: x[0])  # sorted by end\n\ngroup['sorted_start'] = sorted(group['sorted_start'], key=lambda x: x[0])  # sorted by start\n\nThen, compute prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nWait, but in the group's sorted_end list, each element is a tuple (end, start, cost). So, when we compute prefix_min, for each index, the cost is the third element.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_start.\n\nSo, for the group:\n\nsorted_end = group['sorted_end']\n\nprefix_min = [ ]\n\ncurrent_min = sorted_end[0][2]\n\nprefix_min.append(current_min)\n\nfor i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n\n    current_min = min(current_min, sorted_end[i][2])\n\n    prefix_min.append(current_min)\n\nSimilarly for suffix_min:\n\nsorted_start = group['sorted_start']\n\nsuffix_min = [ ]\n\ncurrent_min = sorted_start[-1][2]\n\nsuffix_min.append(current_min)\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n    current_min = min(current_min, sorted_start[i][2])\n\n    suffix_min.insert(0, current_min)\n\nWait, no. Because when you insert at 0, the list grows. Alternatively, we can create a new list and fill it from the end.\n\nAnother approach is to initialize suffix_min as a list of the same length as sorted_start, and fill it from the end.\n\nLike this:\n\nn = len(sorted_start)\n\nsuffix_min = [0]*n\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n\n    suffix_min[i] = min(sorted_start[i][2], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nSo, for each group, after sorting, compute prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i, we can proceed as outlined.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    duration = r - l +1\n\n    vouchers.append( Voucher(l, r, c) )\n\nCreate groups:\n\ngroups = defaultdict( lambda: { 'sorted_end': [], 'sorted_start': [], 'prefix_min': [], 'suffix_min': [] } )\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n\n    d = voucher.duration\n\n    end_tuple = (voucher.ri, voucher.li, voucher.cost)\n\n    start_tuple = (voucher.li, voucher.ri, voucher.cost)\n\n    groups[d]['sorted_end'].append(end_tuple)\n\n    groups[d]['sorted_start'].append(start_tuple)\n\nfor d in groups:\n\n    # sort the end list by end time\n\n    groups[d]['sorted_end'].sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # sort the start list by start time\n\n    groups[d]['sorted_start'].sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # compute prefix_min for end list\n\n    end_list = groups[d]['sorted_end']\n\n    prefix_min = []\n\n    if end_list:\n\n        current_min = end_list[0][2]\n\n        prefix_min.append(current_min)\n\n        for i in range(1, len(end_list)):\n\n            current_min = min(current_min, end_list[i][2])\n\n            prefix_min.append(current_min)\n\n    groups[d]['prefix_min'] = prefix_min\n\n    # compute suffix_min for start list\n\n    start_list = groups[d]['sorted_start']\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(start_list)\n\n    if start_list:\n\n        suffix_min[-1] = start_list[-1][2]\n\n        for i in range(len(start_list)-2, -1, -1):\n\n            suffix_min[i] = min( start_list[i][2], suffix_min[i+1] )\n\n    groups[d]['suffix_min'] = suffix_min\n\nNow, for each voucher i:\n\nmin_total = infinity\n\nfor i in vouchers:\n\n    d_i = i.duration\n\n    d_req = x - d_i\n\n    if d_req not in groups:\n\n        continue\n\n    group = groups[d_req]\n\n    # Case 1: j's end <= i's li -1\n\n    target_end = i.li -1\n\n    end_list = group['sorted_end']\n\n    if end_list:\n\n        # binary search for the largest end <= target_end\n\n        low = 0\n\n        high = len(end_list) -1\n\n        res = -1\n\n        while low <= high:\n\n            mid = (low + high) //2\n\n            if end_list[mid][0] <= target_end:\n\n                res = mid\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n        if res != -1:\n\n            cost_case1 = group['prefix_min'][res]\n\n            total = i.cost + cost_case1\n\n            if total < min_total:\n\n                min_total = total\n\n    # Case 2: j's start >= i's ri +1\n\n    target_start = i.ri +1\n\n    start_list = group['sorted_start']\n\n    if start_list:\n\n        # binary search for the first start >= target_start\n\n        low = 0\n\n        high = len(start_list) -1\n\n        res = -1\n\n        while low <= high:\n\n            mid = (low + high) //2\n\n            if start_list[mid][0] >= target_start:\n\n                res = mid\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n            else:\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n        if res != -1:\n\n            cost_case2 = group['suffix_min'][res]\n\n            total = i.cost + cost_case2\n\n            if total < min_total:\n\n                min_total = total\n\nAfter processing all i, if min_total is still infinity, output -1. Else, output min_total.\n\nWait, but what if a voucher j is in the same group as i and is such that j's end is <= i's start-1 and j's start is >= i's end+1? Then, when considering i, j is in case 1 and case 2. So, the code will consider j in both cases, but since the minimal cost is being tracked, it's okay.\n\nBut the code could potentially process the same j multiple times for different i's.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo, x is 5.\n\nSo, each pair of durations should sum to 5.\n\nLooking for pairs:\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nVoucher 1 (duration 3) and Voucher 3 (duration 2): 3+2=5.\n\nCheck if they are non-overlapping.\n\nVoucher1: 1-3.\n\nVoucher3:5-6.\n\nNo overlap. So total cost is 4+1=5.\n\nWhich is the minimal.\n\nAnother possible pair: voucher 2 (duration2) and voucher3 (duration3? No, because 2+3=5, but in the sample, voucher3's duration is 2. Wait, no. Voucher1 is 3, others are 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the sample wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nWait the sample input is:\n\n4 5\n\nThe vouchers are:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3.\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2.\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2.\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nSo, group for duration 3: only the first voucher.\n\nGroup for duration 2: three vouchers.\n\nNow, for each voucher i:\n\nTake i as the first voucher (duration3):\n\nd_req =5-3=2.\n\nSo, group for 2.\n\nIn case1: j's end <= 1-1=0.\n\nIn the group for 2, the vouchers are:\n\nvoucher2: end 2, start 1, cost5.\n\nvoucher3: end6, start5, cost1.\n\nvoucher4: end2, start1, cost4.\n\nWait, the group's sorted_end list is:\n\neach voucher's end is 2,2,6.\n\nSo sorted_end list is [(2,1,5), (2,1,4), (6,5,1)].\n\nWait, no: the tuples in sorted_end are (end, start, cost). So the end is the first element.\n\nSo for group 2, the sorted_end list is sorted by end:\n\nvoucher2's end is 2, voucher4's end is 2, voucher3's end is6.\n\nSo sorted_end is:\n\n(2,1,5), (2,1,4), (6,5,1).\n\nprefix_min is [5, 4, 1].\n\nNow, for i being the first voucher (li=1, ri=3):\n\ncase1: j's end <= 0.\n\nLooking for end <=0.\n\nIn the group's sorted_end, the first end is 2>0. So no j's in case1.\n\ncase2: j's start >=4.\n\nLooking for start >=4.\n\nIn group's sorted_start list: which is sorted by start.\n\nThe vouchers' start times are 1,1,5.\n\nSo sorted_start is [(1,1,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)].\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the group's sorted_start, each voucher's start is:\n\nvoucher2: 1.\n\nvoucher4:1.\n\nvoucher3:5.\n\nSo sorted_start is [(1,1,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)].\n\nNow, target_start is i.ri +1 =3+1=4.\n\nSo, in the group's sorted_start, find the first start >=4.\n\nLooking for 4 in the sorted_start.\n\nThe first voucher has start 1, next 1, then 5.\n\nSo the first start >=4 is at index2, with start5.\n\nSo res=2.\n\nsuffix_min[2] is 1.\n\nSo, total cost is 4 +1=5.\n\nSo, this is a candidate.\n\nOther vouchers:\n\nTaking i as voucher2 (duration2):\n\nd_req=3.\n\nCheck group for duration3, which has only the first voucher.\n\ncase1: j's end <=1-1=0.\n\nThe only voucher in group3 has end3>0. So no.\n\ncase2: j's start >=2+1=3.\n\nThe only voucher in group3 has start1<3. So no.\n\nSo no pair.\n\nTaking i as voucher3 (duration2):\n\nd_req=3.\n\nSame as above. No pair.\n\nTaking i as voucher4 (duration2):\n\nd_req=3.\n\nSame as above. No pair.\n\nThus, the minimal cost is5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for this case.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nn=3, x=2.\n\nEach voucher has duration3.\n\nSo, each pair sums to6, which is not equal to2.\n\nThus, no solution. Output-1.\n\nSo the code would correctly handle this.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nTest case where x is 0: but n>=2. But according to the problem statement, x can be up to 2e5, but I think x can be zero?\n\nWait, no, because the vouchers have duration ri - li +1 >=1.\n\nSo sum can be zero only if x=0, but that's impossible.\n\nThus, the code will return -1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, x=2.\n\nVoucher1: 1-1, cost1 (duration1).\n\nVoucher2: 2-2, cost1 (duration1).\n\nSum of durations is 2.\n\nThey are non-overlapping, so total cost is2.\n\nThus, the code should return2.\n\nIn the code, for each voucher i:\n\ni is voucher1: d_req=1.\n\nGroup for 1 has voucher2.\n\nCase1: j's end <=0.\n\nvoucher2's end is2>0. So no.\n\nCase2: j's start >=2.\n\nvoucher2's start is2>=2. So res=0.\n\nsuffix_min[0] is1.\n\nThus, total cost is1+1=2.\n\nSimilarly, when i is voucher2: same.\n\nThus, the code returns2.\n\nAnother edge case: vouchers where j is both before and after i.\n\nFor example, i starts at 3 and ends at5, j starts at1 and ends at2.\n\nSo, j is before i.\n\nThus, for i, j is in case1.\n\nFor j, i is in case2.\n\nThus, the code will find both possibilities.\n\nBut since we are tracking the minimal cost, it's okay.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, handling large n requires efficient code.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nWe can represent the groups as a dictionary where each key is a duration, and the value is an object containing the sorted_end, sorted_start, prefix_min, suffix_min.\n\nBut in Python, using lists and binary search via the bisect module could be more efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps using bisect module functions for binary search.\n\nYes, because in the code, for each case, the binary search is implemented manually. Using bisect could make the code cleaner and perhaps more efficient.\n\nSo, for case1:\n\nWe need to find the largest end <= target_end.\n\nIn the sorted_end list, which is a list of end times in ascending order.\n\nSo, the position where end <= target can be found via bisect_right, then the index is the position where insertion would give the first index where the value exceeds.\n\nWait, perhaps using bisect to find the right position.\n\nWait, for case1, the condition is ri < lj. Wait, no, no, the condition is that j's end is before i's start.\n\nWait, for case1, we need j's end <= i's start -1.\n\nWait, the condition is either j's end < i's start, or i's end < j's start.\n\nSo, for the case where j comes before i, we need to find vouchers j where ri_j <= li_i.\n\nWait, for case 1, j's end is before i's start.\n\nSo, for a voucher j, if ri < li of i's voucher.\n\nThus, vouchers j must have their end before voucher i's start.\n\nWait, no. For j to come before i, j's end is < li of i.\n\nSo, for a voucher j to be before i, it's either j's end < li of i, or j's end is before i's start.\n\nSo, for j and i to be non-overlapping, j's end < i's start or i's end < j's start.\n\nSo, for each voucher j, which is not i, we need to check whether j's end < li, or i's end < j's start.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the condition is that vouchers j and i do not intersect. So, either rj < li, or ri < lj or rj < li.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the vouchers don't overlap if either j's end is before i's start, or j's end is before your voucher i's start.\n\nWait, sorry, the condition is that either ri_j < li or rj < li. So, the two vouchers are non-overlapping if either j starts after i's end, or vice versa.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says that two vouchers don't intersect if either ri_j < li_i or r_i_j < li_j.\n\nSo, for j to be before i, j's end is <= i's start -1.\n\nOr, for j to be after i, j's start is >= i's end +1.\n\nSo, in the code, for each i, in case1, j's end <= i's start -1.\n\nIn case2, j's start >= i's end +1.\n\nSo, for the code, when using bisect, for case1, we can use bisect_right on the sorted_end list, with target = i's li -1.\n\nThe bisect_right returns the insertion point, which is the first index where the end is > target.\n\nSo, the largest index with end <= target is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration equals the given vacation duration `x` and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently searching for these pairs using sorting and binary search techniques to handle the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Data Representation**: Each voucher is represented by its start day, end day, and cost. We also compute the duration of each voucher as `end - start + 1`.\n\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped based on their duration. For each duration, we maintain two sorted lists: one sorted by the end day and another sorted by the start day. Additionally, we precompute prefix minimum costs for the end-sorted list and suffix minimum costs for the start-sorted list.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: For each voucher, we determine the required duration of the second voucher to sum up to `x`. Using binary search, we efficiently find the best possible second voucher that either ends before the current voucher starts or starts after the current voucher ends.\n\n4. **Prefix and Suffix Minimums**: These arrays help quickly determine the minimum cost of valid vouchers that can be paired with the current voucher without overlapping.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\nclass Voucher:\n    def __init__(self, li, ri, costi):\n        self.li = li\n        self.ri = ri\n        self.cost = costi\n        self.duration = ri - li + 1\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        c = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append(Voucher(l, r, c))\n    \n    # Group vouchers by their duration\n    groups = {}\n    for voucher in vouchers:\n        d = voucher.duration\n        if d not in groups:\n            groups[d] = {\n                'sorted_end': [],\n                'sorted_start': [],\n                'prefix_min': [],\n                'suffix_min': []\n            }\n        # Append tuples (end, start, cost)\n        end_tuple = (voucher.ri, voucher.li, voucher.cost)\n        start_tuple = (voucher.li, voucher.ri, voucher.cost)\n        groups[d]['sorted_end'].append(end_tuple)\n        groups[d]['sorted_start'].append(start_tuple)\n    \n    # Preprocess each group\n    for d in groups:\n        # Sort by end time\n        groups[d]['sorted_end'].sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        # Sort by start time\n        groups[d]['sorted_start'].sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        \n        # Compute prefix_min for sorted_end\n        sorted_end = groups[d]['sorted_end']\n        prefix_min = []\n        if sorted_end:\n            current_min = sorted_end[0][2]\n            prefix_min.append(current_min)\n            for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n                current_min = min(current_min, sorted_end[i][2])\n                prefix_min.append(current_min)\n        groups[d]['prefix_min'] = prefix_min\n        \n        # Compute suffix_min for sorted_start\n        sorted_start = groups[d]['sorted_start']\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n        if sorted_start:\n            suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n            for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min[i] = min(sorted_start[i][2], suffix_min[i+1])\n        groups[d]['suffix_min'] = suffix_min\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for voucher in vouchers:\n        d_i = voucher.duration\n        d_req = x - d_i\n        if d_req not in groups:\n            continue\n        group = groups[d_req]\n        \n        # Case 1: j's end <= voucher's start - 1\n        target_end = voucher.li - 1\n        sorted_end = group['sorted_end']\n        if sorted_end:\n            pos = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_end, (target_end, float('inf'), float('inf'))) - 1\n            if pos >= 0:\n                cost_case1 = group['prefix_min'][pos]\n                total = voucher.cost + cost_case1\n                if total < min_total:\n                    min_total = total\n        \n        # Case 2: j's start >= voucher's end + 1\n        target_start = voucher.ri + 1\n        sorted_start = group['sorted_start']\n        if sorted_start:\n            pos = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_start, (target_start, float('inf'), float('inf')))\n            if pos < len(sorted_start):\n                cost_case2 = group['suffix_min'][pos]\n                total = voucher.cost + cost_case2\n                if total < min_total:\n                    min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total != float('inf'):\n        print(min_total)\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution reads the input and processes each voucher to compute its duration. Vouchers are grouped by their duration, and each group is preprocessed to sort vouchers by end and start times, and compute prefix and suffix minimum costs. For each voucher, we determine the required duration of the second voucher and use binary search to efficiently find valid pairs.
