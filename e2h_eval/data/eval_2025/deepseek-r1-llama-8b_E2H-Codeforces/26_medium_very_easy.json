Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on their sides. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides x, y, z. The conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, it's required that x, y, z form a non-degenerate triangle, which means x + y > z must hold because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since z is the largest here (because C ≤ z ≤ D and C ≥ B), the condition simplifies to x + y > z.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Because x can be up to B, y up to C, and z starts at C. So z is at least as big as y. So for the triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the two smaller sides (x and y) must be greater than the largest side, which is z. So yes, the condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo the approach is to find all triplets (x, y, z) such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\nB ≤ y ≤ C\nC ≤ z ≤ D\nand x + y > z\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently? Because the input can be up to 5e5, so brute-forcing all possible x, y, z is impossible.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Since x is from A to B, inclusive, and y is from B to C, inclusive, and z is from C to D, inclusive, but with the constraint x + y > z.\n\nWait, but z has to be at least C. So for each possible x and y, what is the maximum z that allows x + y > z? The maximum z is min(D, x + y - 1). Because z has to be less than x + y.\n\nSo for a given x and y, the number of valid z's is the number of integers between C and min(D, x + y - 1), inclusive. So that's max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1).\n\nWait, but wait: z has to be >= C and <= D, and also <= x + y - 1. So if x + y -1 >= C, then the lower bound is C, upper is min(D, x+y-1). Otherwise, no z exists.\n\nSo the count for each x and y is:\n\nif x + y > C:\n   count_z = max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1)\nelse:\n   count_z = 0\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over x in [A,B], y in [B,C], and z as per above, of count_z.\n\nBut directly iterating through x and y is O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)), which could be up to (5e5)^2, which is way too big—25e10 operations, which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm. Let's think about grouping by z. Or perhaps precompute for each possible z the number of (x,y) pairs that satisfy x + y > z, and x is in [A,B], y in [B,C], and also y >= B, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express the problem in terms of z and find the range of z where certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, but z is from C to D. So for each z, we can compute the number of (x,y) pairs where x ≤ B, y ≤ C, and x + y > z.\n\nBut again, doing this for each z might be manageable if we can find an efficient way.\n\nLet me think: For a fixed z, what is the number of (x,y) pairs such that x is in [A,B], y is in [B,C], and x + y > z?\n\nWe can model this as finding the number of integer points (x,y) in the rectangle [A,B] x [B,C] that lie above the line x + y = z.\n\nThe line x + y = z can be rewritten as y = z - x.\n\nSo for each x, the minimum y needed is (z - x + 1). But y must be at least B, and at most C.\n\nSo for each x, the valid y's are those in [max(B, z - x + 1), C].\n\nIf the lower bound exceeds the upper, then there are zero y's for that x.\n\nSo the total count for a given z is the sum over x in [A, B] of max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated. Let me see.\n\nFor a given z and x:\n\ny must be >= B and >= (z - x + 1)\ny must be <= C\n\nSo the lower bound is max(B, z - x + 1). If this lower bound is > C, then no y's contribute.\n\nOtherwise, the number of y's is C - lower_bound + 1.\n\nSo the count for z is the sum over x in [A, B] of max(0, C - max(B, z -x +1) +1).\n\nBut how can we compute this sum quickly for varying z?\n\nHmm, let's consider that for each z, the expression depends on x in [A,B]. Maybe we can find a way to represent this sum as a function of z.\n\nAnother approach: Let's fix x and y, and then for each such pair, find the range of z where z < x + y. Then, for each z in [C, D], if z < x + y, it contributes 1 to the total count.\n\nWait, that's another way to look at it. The total number of valid (x,y,z) triplets is equal to the number of triplets where z is in [C, D], and z < x + y, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C].\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of (x,y) pairs where x is in [A,B], y is in [B,C], and x + y > C (since z must be at least C), and x + y > z, but z can be up to D. Wait, but for each (x,y), z can vary from C to min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nSo the total is the sum over x and y of (number of z's for that x and y).\n\nBut again, computing this directly is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's precompute for all possible (x,y) pairs whether x + y > C, and if so, add the number of z's which is max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate over all x in [A, B].\n2. For each x, iterate over y in [B, C].\n3. For each (x,y), check if x + y > C.\n   a. If yes, compute the number of z's as min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1, but only if this is >= 0.\n4. Sum all these counts.\n\nBut even this approach would be O((B - A + 1)*(C - B + 1)), which is too slow for large ranges.\n\nSo we need a mathematical way to compute this sum without iterating through every x and y.\n\nLet me consider the constraints on x and y.\n\nWe have A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C.\n\nSo for each x, y can vary from B to C.\n\nBut for the condition x + y > C, for a given x, the minimum y required is (C - x + 1). But y has to be at least B.\n\nSo for each x, the starting y is max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nIf this starting y is > C, then no y satisfies the condition for this x.\n\nOtherwise, the number of y's is C - starting_y + 1.\n\nWait, but this is similar to the earlier approach. So perhaps for each x, we can calculate the number of y's that satisfy x + y > C, and then multiply by the number of z's for each such (x,y).\n\nWait, but the number of z's depends on x + y. So it's more complex than that.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's precompute for each x, the minimal y that makes x + y > C. For each x, the minimal y is y_min = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nIf y_min > C, then no y for this x.\n\nElse, for each x, the y ranges from y_min to C.\n\nFor each such (x, y), the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nSo the sum becomes sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=y_min to C} (max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1)).\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nBut perhaps we can split this into two parts based on whether x + y -1 is <= D or not.\n\nBecause if x + y -1 <= D, then the number of z's is (x + y -1 - C + 1) = x + y - C.\n\nElse, it's D - C + 1.\n\nSo for each x, y:\n\nif x + y -1 <= D → count_z = x + y - C\n\nelse → count_z = D - C + 1\n\nSo the total for each x is the sum over y in [y_min, C] of:\n\nif x + y <= D + 1: (x + y - C)\n\nelse: (D - C + 1)\n\nWait, but x + y -1 <= D → x + y <= D + 1.\n\nSo for each (x, y), we can determine whether it's in the first case or the second.\n\nBut again, this seems challenging.\n\nAnother idea: Let's find the threshold y0 for each x such that x + y0 <= D + 1. So for y < y0, the count is x + y - C. For y >= y0, the count is D - C + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the y's are in [y_min, C].\n\nWe can compute the point where y crosses the threshold y0 = (D + 1 - x).\n\nIf y0 is larger than C, then all y's in [y_min, C] are in the first case.\n\nOtherwise, the y's are split into two parts: y < y0 and y >= y0.\n\nSo for each x, the sum can be computed as the sum for y < y0, plus the sum for y >= y0.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor a given x:\n\ny_low = y_min = max(B, C - x + 1)\ny_high = C\n\ny0 = D + 1 - x\n\nCompute the number of y's in [y_low, y_high] that are less than y0, and those that are >= y0.\n\nSo:\n\nnumber of y's before y0: max(0, min(y0 - 1, y_high))\nnumber of y's after y0: max(0, y_high - y0)\n\nWait, no. Wait, for y in [y_low, y_high], the split is at y0.\n\nSo:\n\ny_low_part = max(y_low, ... )\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the overlapping regions.\n\nSo for a given x, the sum can be broken down as:\n\nsum1 = sum_{y = y_low to min(y0 - 1, y_high)} (x + y - C)\nsum2 = sum_{y = max(y0, y_low)}^{y_high} (D - C + 1)\n\nThen the total for x is sum1 + sum2.\n\nBut how to compute sum1 and sum2 quickly.\n\nLet's compute sum1:\n\nsum1 is the sum from y = a to b of (x + y - C), where a = max(y_low, y_low), b = min(y0 -1, y_high).\n\nBut a must be <= b; else, sum1 is zero.\n\nEach term is (x - C) + y.\n\nSo sum1 can be written as (b - a + 1)*(x - C) + sum_{y = a}^b y.\n\nSum of y from a to b is (a + b)*(b - a +1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, sum2 is the number of terms multiplied by (D - C + 1), provided that the starting y is <= y_high.\n\nSo for sum2:\n\nnumber of terms is max(0, y_high - max(y_low, y0) + 1).\n\nBut only if max(y_low, y0) <= y_high.\n\nElse, sum2 is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each x in [A, B]:\n\n1. Compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n2. Compute y_high = C\n3. If y_low > y_high: continue (no y's for this x)\n4. Compute y0 = D + 1 - x\n5. Now, find the range of y's in [y_low, y_high] that are < y0, and those >= y0.\n6. For sum1: y ranges from y_low to min(y0-1, y_high)\n   a. a1 = y_low\n   b. b1 = min(y0 - 1, y_high)\n   c. if a1 > b1: sum1 = 0\n      else:\n         n = b1 - a1 + 1\n         sum1 = n*(x - C) + (a1 + b1)*n // 2\n7. For sum2: y ranges from max(y_low, y0) to y_high\n   a. a2 = max(y_low, y0)\n   b. b2 = y_high\n   c. if a2 > b2: sum2 = 0\n      else:\n         m = b2 - a2 + 1\n         sum2 = m * (D - C + 1)\n8. Total for x is sum1 + sum2\n9. Add this to the overall total.\n\nThis approach would require iterating x from A to B, which could be up to 5e5 steps. Each step involves some calculations, but they're O(1), so it's manageable.\n\nNow, I need to implement this.\n\nBut wait, what about the cases where x + y -1 < C? Because z has to be >= C. So when x + y -1 < C, the number of z's is zero. So I need to make sure that in the initial calculation, when x + y <= C, we don't count anything.\n\nWait, no. Because the condition x + y > z is necessary, but z starts at C. So for x + y > C, the z can be C, C+1, ..., up to min(x + y - 1, D). So if x + y <= C, then no z's are possible.\n\nThus, in our initial steps, we need to ensure that x + y > C. Which is why for each x, y must be >= y_low = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nWait, no. Because C - x + 1 is the minimal y that makes x + y > C. So for y >= C - x + 1, x + y > C.\n\nSo for each x, y must be >= max(B, C -x + 1). So the code correctly computes y_low as that.\n\nBut what if x + y is still less than or equal to C? Then, no z's. But y_low is set to C -x + 1, which ensures that x + y >= C + 1. So in that case, for each y in y_low to y_high, x + y >= C + 1, which is > C.\n\nWait, no. Because x + y > C is equivalent to y > C -x. So for y >= C - x +1, x + y >= C +1 > C.\n\nSo, for each x, the y's considered are such that x + y > C, so z can be at least C.\n\nTherefore, the code correctly considers only valid (x, y) pairs.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop through each x from A to B.\n\nFor each x:\n\n   Compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n   if y_low > C: continue (no y's)\n   y_high = C\n\n   Compute y0 = D + 1 - x\n\n   Now, find the split point for y's into those below y0 and above.\n\n   For sum1: y ranges from y_low to min(y0 -1, y_high)\n   For sum2: y ranges from max(y_low, y0) to y_high\n\n   Compute sum1 and sum2 as per the formulas.\n\n   Add sum1 + sum2 to the total.\n\nBut wait, what about when y0 is less than y_low?\n\nIn that case, all y's are in sum2.\n\nSimilarly, if y0 is greater than y_high, all y's are in sum1.\n\nAlso, what if y_high is less than y_low? Then, no y's, so skip.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n1 2 3 4\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nFor each x in 1, 2:\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 -1 +1) = max(2, 3) → 3.\n\ny_high =3.\n\ny0 =4+1 -1=4.\n\nSo y_low is 3, y_high 3.\n\ny0 is 4.\n\nSo sum1: y ranges from 3 to min(4-1=3, 3) → 3.\n\nsum1 is (3 to 3):\n\neach term is (1-3) + y → -2 + y.\n\nSo for y=3: -2 +3 =1.\n\nsum1 is 1*1=1.\n\nsum2: y >= max(3,4)=4, but y_high is 3. So sum2 is 0.\n\nTotal for x=1: 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-2+1)=max(2,2)=2.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0 =4+1 -2=3.\n\nSo y0 is 3.\n\nsum1: y ranges from 2 to min(3-1=2,3) → 2.\n\nsum1: each term is (2-3) + y → -1 + y.\n\ny=2: 1.\n\nsum1 is 1*1=1.\n\nsum2: y >= max(2,3)=3, up to 3.\n\nEach term is (4-3+1) =2.\n\nsum2: 1 term → 2.\n\nTotal for x=2: 1+2=3.\n\nTotal across x is 1+3=4, which matches the sample.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput 2: 1 2 2 5.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2 -1 +1)= max(2,2)=2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ny0=5+1 -1=5.\n\nsum1: y ranges from 2 to min(5-1=4, 2) → 2.\n\nsum1: (1-2) +2 → -1 +2=1. So sum1=1.\n\nsum2: y >= max(2,5) →5>2, so sum2 is 0.\n\nTotal x=1:1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2-2 +1)= max(2,1)=2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ny0=5+1-2=4.\n\nsum1: y ranges from 2 to min(4-1=3,2) →2.\n\nsum1: (2-2)+2=2.\n\nsum2: y >= max(2,4) →4>2, sum2 is 0.\n\nSo x=2 contributes 2.\n\nTotal: 1+2=3, which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nOnly x=500000.\n\ny_low = max(500000, 500000 -500000 +1) →500001.\n\nBut y_high=500000. So y_low> y_high → no y's. So x=5e5 contributes nothing.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, C is 5e5, so y cannot exceed that. So for x=5e5, y_low is 5e5 + 1 -5e5 +1? Wait no.\n\nWait, x=500000.\n\ny_low = max(B, C -x +1) → B is 5e5, C is 5e5.\n\nC -x +1 = 5e5 -5e5 +1=1.\n\nSo y_low is max(5e5, 1) →5e5.\n\nBut y_high is 5e5.\n\nSo y_low is 5e5, y_high is 5e5.\n\ny0 = D+1 -x =5e5+1 -5e5=1.\n\nsum1: y ranges from 5e5 to min(1-1=0,5e5) → invalid. So sum1=0.\n\nsum2: y ranges from max(5e5,1) to 5e5 →5e5.\n\nsum2: 1 term → (5e5 -5e5 +1) =1.\n\nSo total for x=5e5 is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nGreat.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut what about handling the edge cases?\n\nEdge Case 1: A == B == C == D.\n\nIf x = A, y = B, z = C. Then x + y > z?\n\nA + A > A → yes.\n\nSo count is 1.\n\nAnother Edge Case: C > D.\n\nWait, no, the problem says A <= B <= C <= D, so C can't be larger than D.\n\nAnother Edge Case: x + y is just enough to include z.\n\nLike x + y = z +1.\n\nSo z can be up to x + y -1.\n\nSo the code needs to handle all these.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nRead A, B, C, D from input.\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nFor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n   y_low = max(B, C - x +1)\n\n   if y_low > C:\n\n       continue\n\n   y_high = C\n\n   if y_low > y_high:\n\n       continue\n\n   # Compute y0\n\n   y0 = D + 1 - x\n\n   # sum1: y from y_low to min(y0-1, y_high)\n\n   a1 = y_low\n\n   b1 = min(y0-1, y_high)\n\n   if a1 > b1:\n\n       sum1 =0\n\n   else:\n\n       n = b1 - a1 +1\n\n       sum1 = n*(x - C) + (a1 + b1)*n // 2\n\n   # sum2: y from max(y_low, y0) to y_high\n\n   a2 = max(y_low, y0)\n\n   b2 = y_high\n\n   if a2 > b2:\n\n       sum2=0\n\n   else:\n\n       m = b2 - a2 +1\n\n       sum2 = m * (D - C +1)\n\n   total += sum1 + sum2\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for x in range(A, B+1): when A is 5e5 and B is 5e5, it's okay.\n\nBut for very large ranges, say A=1, B=5e5, this loop will take 5e5 iterations, which is manageable since 5e5 is acceptable for Python.\n\nWait, 5e5 is 500,000 iterations.

But D=5, so 5 is the maximum. So 2 options.\n\nSo total for x=3 is 2 +2=4.\n\nTotal 3+4=7, which matches the code.\n\nWait, no. Because for x=2, y=3, z can be 4 and 5?\n\nNo, because z is from C=4 to min(D, x+y-1).\n\nx+y-1=5-1=4. So z can be 4 only.\n\nSo for (2,3): 1 option.\n\nFor (2,4): x+y=6 → z can be 4,5.\n\nSo 2 options.\n\nFor (3,3): x+y=6 → z can be4,5.\n\n2 options.\n\nFor (3,4): x+y=7 → z can be4,5.\n\n2 options.\n\nSo total 1+2+2+2=7.\n\nWhich matches the code.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo now, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single line of four integers, possibly as a string separated by spaces.\n\nSo the code needs to read the four integers.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into four integers.\n\nCompute A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop x in A to B inclusive.\n\nFor each x, compute y_low, y_high, y0.\n\nCompute sum1 and sum2 as per the steps.\n\nAdd to total.\n\nFinally, print the total as a string.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Integer overflows: In Python, integers can be large, so no problem.\n\n- Handling when y0 is less than y_low, which is fine.\n\n- Cases where y0 is beyond y_high.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when D < C, but the problem states C<=D, so no.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n    y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n    if y_low > C:\n\n        continue\n\n    y_high = C\n\n    if y_low > y_high:\n\n        continue\n\n    y0 = D + 1 - x\n\n    # sum1\n\n    a1 = y_low\n\n    b1 = min(y0 - 1, y_high)\n\n    if a1 > b1:\n\n        sum1 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        n = b1 - a1 + 1\n\n        sum1 = n * (x - C) + (a1 + b1) * n // 2\n\n    # sum2\n\n    a2 = max(y_low, y0)\n\n    b2 = y_high\n\n    if a2 > b2:\n\n        sum2 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        m = b2 - a2 + 1\n\n        sum2 = m * (D - C + 1)\n\n    total += sum1 + sum2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if D is less than C? But according to the problem statement, C <= D, so D >= C.\n\nSo, in sum2, D - C +1 is always non-negative.\n\nBut what if D < C? Well, the problem says it's impossible, so no need to worry.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nSample 1:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nAs before.\n\nSample 2: 1 2 2 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSample3: 5e5,5e5,5e5,5e5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: A=2, B=3, C=4, D=5.\n\nAs before, code returns 7.\n\nAnother test case: A=2, B=3, C=5, D=10.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(3,5-2+1)=4.\n\ny_high=5.\n\ny0=10+1-2=9.\n\nsum1: y ranges from 4 to min(8,5) →4 to5.\n\nsum1: for each y, (2-5) + y = -3 + y.\n\nFor y=4: 1.\n\ny=5: 2.\n\nSo sum1 = (4+5)*2/2 * (-3) + (4+5)*2/2 → ?\n\nWait, wait. No, for n=2, sum1 is 2*(2-5) + (4+5)*2/2.\n\nWait, 2*(2-5) is 2*(-3)= -6.\n\n(4+5)*2/2 = 9.\n\nSo sum1= -6 +9=3.\n\nsum2: y >= max(4,9)=9, but y_high=5. So sum2=0.\n\nSo for x=2, sum is 3.\n\nx=3:\n\ny_low = max(3,5-3+1)=3.\n\ny_high=5.\n\ny0=10+1-3=8.\n\nsum1: y ranges from3 to min(7,5) →3-5.\n\nEach term: (3-5)+y= -2 + y.\n\ny=3:1.\n\ny=4:2.\n\ny=5:3.\n\nsum1: 3 terms.\n\nn=3.\n\nsum1=3*(-2) + (3+4+5)*3/2 → -6 + (12)*3/2 →-6 +18=12.\n\nsum2: y >= max(3,8)=8>5 → sum2=0.\n\nSo x=3 contributes 12.\n\nTotal so far:3+12=15.\n\nx=4:\n\nWait, wait, B is 3, so x can be 2,3.\n\nWait, in the example, B is 3.\n\nSo for x=3, as above.\n\nSo total is 3+12=15.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nPossible (x,y) pairs:\n\nx=2:\n\ny=4,5.\n\nFor (2,4): x+y=6. z can be 5,6,7,8,9,10. But D=10, so z can be5,6,7,8,9,10. So 6 options.\n\nWait, no. Because x+y=6 → z can be <6. So z can be5 (since 5<6). Wait, no: x + y > z. So for (2,4), z can be up to 5 (since 6-1=5).

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that can be formed with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\) and \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraints**: The sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) must satisfy \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\), \\(B \\leq y \\leq C\\), and \\(C \\leq z \\leq D\\). Additionally, for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side, which simplifies to \\(x + y > z\\) since \\(z\\) is the largest side.\n\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Directly iterating through all possible values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) is infeasible due to the large potential input size (up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\)). Instead, we use a mathematical approach to efficiently count valid triangles.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Values**: For each \\(x\\) in the range \\([A, B]\\), determine the valid range of \\(y\\) values and compute the number of valid \\(z\\) values for each pair \\((x, y)\\).\n\n4. **Range Calculation**: For each \\(x\\), calculate the minimum \\(y\\) value such that \\(x + y > C\\). Then, determine the split point where \\(x + y\\) exceeds \\(D\\). This allows us to split the calculation into two parts: one where \\(z\\) can take more values and another where it can only take fewer values.\n\n5. **Summing Valid Counts**: Use arithmetic series to efficiently compute the number of valid \\(z\\) values for each \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) without iterating through all possibilities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_triangles(A, B, C, D):\n    total = 0\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n        if y_low > C:\n            continue\n        y_high = C\n        if y_low > y_high:\n            continue\n        \n        y0 = D + 1 - x\n        \n        # Calculate sum1\n        a1 = y_low\n        b1 = min(y0 - 1, y_high)\n        if a1 > b1:\n            sum1 = 0\n        else:\n            n = b1 - a1 + 1\n            sum1 = n * (x - C) + (a1 + b1) * n // 2\n        \n        # Calculate sum2\n        a2 = max(y_low, y0)\n        b2 = y_high\n        if a2 > b2:\n            sum2 = 0\n        else:\n            m = b2 - a2 + 1\n            sum2 = m * (D - C + 1)\n        \n        total += sum1 + sum2\n    return total\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input_line.split())\n\n# Compute and print the result\nprint(count_triangles(A, B, C, D))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution iterates over each possible value of \\(x\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). For each \\(x\\), it calculates the valid range of \\(y\\) values that satisfy the triangle condition. It then splits the calculation into two parts based on whether \\(x + y\\) exceeds \\(D\\) or not, using arithmetic series to efficiently compute the number of valid \\(z\\) values. This approach ensures that we handle large input sizes efficiently by reducing the number of necessary computations.",
