Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. So, the minimal number of cards depends on how much the current sum is away from zero and the maximum possible contribution per card.\n\nLet me think: the sum of the found cards is S. We need to find K cards such that the sum of these K cards is equal to -S. But each of these K cards can be at most x in absolute value. So the maximum possible sum we can get with K cards is K * x (if all are x) and the minimum is -K*x (if all are -x).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum of K cards can range from -K*x to K*x, stepping by 2, perhaps, but for our purposes, the exact steps might not matter as long as we can reach the desired value.\n\nSo, to make the total sum zero, the sum of the K additional cards must be equal to -S. So, we need to find the smallest K such that:\n\n- The required sum T = -S must satisfy |T| <= K * x.\n\nBecause each card can contribute up to x towards T.\n\nSo, the minimal K is the ceiling of |T| / x, but wait, only if |T| is non-zero.\n\nBut wait, what if S is already zero? Then no additional cards are needed.\n\nSo, the steps I should take:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the given cards.\n2. If S is zero, output 0.\n3. Else, compute T = -S. Then, the minimal K is the smallest integer such that K >= |T| / x, rounded up. But since K must be an integer, it's the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nFor example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Then 5 / 2 is 2.5, so K is 3 because 2*2=4 <5, so you need 3 cards (each contributing 2, summing to 6 which is more than 5, but maybe some are -2 or other numbers?)\n\nWait, no. Because the sum can be adjusted by choosing different signs. For example, 5 can be achieved with two cards: 3 and 2 (but wait, x is 2, so 3 is beyond x). No, because in this case, x is 2. So the maximum per card is 2.\n\nWait, let's take the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\nn=3, x=2\ncards are [-1,1,2]\nsum S is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2.\n\nSo T = -2.\n\nWe need K cards whose sum is -2.\n\nWhat is the minimal K?\n\nEach card can contribute up to 2. So the minimal K is 1, because one card with -2 would do it.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\nn=2, x=3\ncards are [-2,-2], sum S is -4. T is 4.\n\nSo K must be at least 4/3, which is 1.333, so 2.\n\nBecause 2 cards each contributing 2 would sum to 4.\n\nYes, the sample shows that.\n\nAnother test case: suppose S is 5, x is 2.\n\nThen T is -5, |T|=5.\n\nEach card can contribute up to 2.\n\nSo 5 /2 = 2.5 → ceil is 3.\n\nBut can 3 cards sum to 5? Yes: 2+2+1=5, but wait, x is 2, so 1 is allowed. Oh right, because each card can be any number up to x in absolute value, including lower values.\n\nWait, but in this case, the sum T is -S = -5.\n\nWait, no, no— sorry, T is -S. So if S is 5, T is -5. So we need to have the sum of K cards equal to -5.\n\nWait, no: the total sum should be zero",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and new) equals zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum \\( S \\) of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Check for Zero Sum**: If \\( S \\) is already zero, no additional cards are needed, so the result is 0.\n3. **Determine Required Sum**: If \\( S \\) is not zero, compute the required sum \\( T \\) such that the total sum becomes zero. This means \\( T = -S \\).\n4. **Calculate Minimum Additional Cards**: The minimum number of additional cards required is determined by how much \\( |T| \\) exceeds the maximum possible contribution per card (which is \\( x \\)). This is calculated as the ceiling of \\( |T| / x \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    t = -s\n    min_cards = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x  # Equivalent to ceiling division\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine the current imbalance.\n- **Zero Check**: If the sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n- **Required Adjustment**: The required adjustment is the negative of the current sum to balance it to zero.\n- **Ceiling Division**: The minimum number of cards needed is found by dividing the absolute value of the required adjustment by the maximum card value, rounding up to ensure we have enough contribution to reach the target sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal number of additional cards using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
