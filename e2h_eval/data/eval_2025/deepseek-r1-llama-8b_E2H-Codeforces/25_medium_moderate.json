При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine if a given string t could be the result of an error in a network transmission. The error happens when two identical messages are sent one after another, and their ends overlap, causing them to merge. My task is to check if such a scenario is possible and, if so, find a possible original message s.\n\nLet me understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the error occurs when two messages s1 and s2 (which are the same) are sent one after another. Due to an error, they merge into a single message t. The way they merge is that the end of s1 overlaps with the beginning of s2. So, for example, if s1 is \"abcd\" and s2 is \"cdxy\", then the merged message would be \"abcdcdxy\". But wait, no—wait, actually, the way it's described is that the end of the first message is concatenated with the beginning of the second. So, for instance, if s1 is \"abcde\" and s2 is \"cdefg\", then the merged t would be \"abcdefg\".\n\nWait, but the problem says that the overlapping can only happen on the same symbols. So the number of overlapping characters must be at least 1, and it must be a suffix of the first message and a prefix of the second. Also, the length of the overlapping part must be less than the length of the entire message.\n\nSo, given t, I need to check if it can be split into two equal parts (s1 and s2, which are the same), such that the second part starts with the suffix of the first part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more accurately, t must consist of s concatenated twice, but with some overlapping in between.\n\nWait, no. Because s1 and s2 are the same, but when they're sent, they might merge. So t would be s1 followed by s2, but with some overlapping.\n\nWait, let's think: When two messages s are sent, the first is s, the second is s. They are sent back-to-back, but due to an error, the last k characters of the first message are overlapped with the first k characters of the second message. So the resulting t is s concatenated with s, but with the first k characters of s overlapped by the last k of s, leading to a total length of len(s) + len(s) -k = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nWait, no. Because the two messages are s and s. So, normally, without any error, t would be s followed by s, making the length 2*len(s). But with the error, t becomes s1 + s2, but the end of s1 overlaps with the start of s2 by k characters, so the total length is len(s) + len(s) -k = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nBut how do I model this? Let's say t is formed as s concatenated with s, but with some overlapping. So, t must be equal to s + s', where s' is the same as s, but the first k characters of s' overlap with the last k characters of s. So, for some k ≥1, t can be written as s + s, where the first k characters of s are the same as the last k of s.\n\nWait, no. Because s1 is s, s2 is s. So the merged t is the concatenation of s1 and s2, but with the overlapping. So, the merged string is s1's suffix of length k concatenated with s2's prefix of length k, and the rest of s2 comes after. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWhen two messages are sent, s and s, they are supposed to be transmitted consecutively. But due to an error, their ends overlap. So the first message is s, the second is s. The error causes the end of the first to overlap with the beginning of the second. So the resulting t is the first message's string, but the last k characters are replaced by the second message's first k characters. Or is it that the entire second message is appended, but the overlapping is done?\n\nWait, the description says that the two messages s1 and s2 (which are the same) are sent, and due to an error, they combine into one message t. The way they combine is that the end of s1 is connected to the beginning of s2, and the length of the overlap is k>0, which is less than the length of s.\n\nSo, for example, s1 is \"ab\", s2 is \"ba\". Then the error would cause t to be \"ab\" + \"ba\" but with some overlapping. But since the last character of s1 is 'b' and the first of s2 is 'b', the overlapping is 1. So t would be \"a\" followed by the entire s2? Or wait, maybe it's that the end of s1 and the beginning of s2 are overlapped by k characters. So the merged t is s1 concatenated with s2, but the last k characters of s1 are the same as the first k of s2, so those k characters are merged into one. So the total length is len(s1) + len(s2) -k. Since s1 and s2 are the same, len(s1)=len(s2)=n, so t has length 2n -k.\n\nSo, for example, if s is \"abcd\", and the error causes k=2, then the first two characters of s2 (which is \"abcd\") would overlap with the last two of s1. So s1 is \"abcd\", s2 is \"abcd\". The last two of s1 are \"cd\", and the first two of s2 are \"ab\". Oh wait, wait no—if the error is that the end of s1 is overlapped with the beginning of s2, but the overlapping must be on the same symbols. So in this case, the last two of s1 are \"cd\", and the first two of s2 are \"ab\"—they don't match, so no overlap. So the error wouldn't occur.\n\nWait, but the error only occurs if the end of s1 and the beginning of s2 have a common prefix/suffix. So for s1 and s2 being the same, the condition is that the last k characters of s are equal to the first k characters of s. So for some k>0, the last k of s equals the first k.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because s1 and s2 are the same, the error can only happen if s's last k is equal to its first k, for some k>=1.\n\nSo, for the merged t, it's s concatenated with s, but with the first k of s2 (which is s) overlapping the last k of s1 (which is s). So the merged t is s + s, but the first k characters of s2 are the same as the last k of s1. Therefore, the t is s concatenated with s, but the first k of s2 are merged into the last k of s1. So the total length is len(s) + len(s) -k = 2n -k, where n is len(s).\n\nSo, to find if t is a possible result of such an error, we need to find a split point in t such that:\n\nt can be written as s + s', where s' is s but starting from position k, but wait no. Alternatively, t is formed by merging s1 and s2, which are both s. So t is s1 followed by s2, but with the last k of s1 and first k of s2 overlapping. So t is the concatenation of s1 and s2, minus the overlapping k characters.\n\nBut since s1 and s2 are the same, s1 is s, s2 is s. So the merged t is s concatenated with s, but with the first k of s2 overlapping the last k of s1. So the total length is 2n -k.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\nFor t to be a possible result of such an error, there must exist some k (1<=k< n, where n is the length of s) such that the last k characters of s are equal to the first k of s. And t must be s + s with the first k of s overlapping.\n\nWait, but how does this translate into t's structure?\n\nWait, perhaps t is equal to s concatenated with s, but with the first k characters of s removed. So, t is s concatenated with s[k:]. For example, if s is 'abcd' and k=2, then s2 is 'abcd', and the first 2 characters of s2 are 'ab'. The last 2 of s1 are 'cd', which don't match. So no error. But if s is 'aaaaa', then the last 2 of s are 'aa', the first 2 of s are 'aa', so k=2 is valid. Then t would be 'aaaaa' concatenated with 'aaaaa', but with the first 2 of s2 overlapping. So the merged t is 'aaaaa' + 'aaa', making the total length 5+5-2=8. So t would be 'aaaaaaa'? Or wait, perhaps t is s followed by s, but the first k of s are replaced by the last k of s. So t would be s[ : n -k] + s[n -k : ] + s[:k]. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the merged t is s concatenated with s, but with the first k of s2 (which is s) overlapping the last k of s1 (which is s). So the merged t is s followed by s, but the first k of s2 are the same as the last k of s1. So the merged t is s followed by s, but the first k of s2 are merged into the last k of s1. So t is s + s, but the first k characters of s are now part of the last k of s. So t's length is n + (n -k) = 2n -k.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model t as s concatenated with s, but with the first k of s2 (the second s) overlapping with the last k of s1 (the first s). So t is s1 (s) followed by s2 (s), but s2's first k characters are the same as s1's last k. So t is s1 + s2, but s2's first k is the same as s1's last k, so the merged string is s1's (n -k) + s2's (n -k) ? No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps t is s1 + s2, but s1's last k and s2's first k are the same. So the merged t is s1 followed by s2, but with the first k of s2 overlapping with the last k of s1. So t's length is len(s1) + len(s2) -k = 2n -k.\n\nSo for example, if s is 'abracadabra' (11 letters), and the error occurs with k=4, then s1 is 'abracadabra' and s2 is 'abracadabra'. The last 4 of s1 are 'dabra', the first 4 of s2 are 'abra'—do they match? No, wait, the last 4 of s1 are 'rabra'? Or wait, perhaps I should calculate indices.\n\nWait, let's take the sample input:\n\nIn the first example, the output is 'YES' with s being 'abrakadabra'. Let's see what that implies.\n\nThe output is 'YES\\nabrakadabra'. So t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nWait, let's count the length of t. Let's see: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' has 20 characters. So 2n -k =20, where n is the length of s.\n\nIf s is 'abrakadabra', which is 11 letters, then 2*11=22, 22 -k=20 → k=2. So the last 2 characters of s are 'a' (since s is 'abrakadabra'—the last two letters are 'ra')? Wait, wait, 'abrakadabra' is spelled as a b r a k a d a b r a—so the last two letters are 'a' and 'r' a? Wait, no, 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters: positions 0-10.\n\nLetters: 0:a, 1:b, 2:r, 3:a, 4:k, 5:a, 6:d,7:a,8:b,9:r,10:a.\n\nSo the last two letters are 'r' and 'a'? Or wait, index 9 is 'r', 10 is 'a'.\n\nSo the last two letters are 'ra'.\n\nThe first two letters are 'ab'.\n\nSo for k=2, the last two of s are 'ra', the first two are 'ab'—so they are different. So why is the sample output saying that t is possible with s='abrakadabra'?\n\nWait, perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 20 characters.\n\nWait, 20 = 2*11 - 2. So 2*11 is 22, 22-2=20. So k=2.\n\nSo the merged t is s1 + s2, but the last 2 of s1 and the first 2 of s2 are the same.\n\nBut in the sample, the t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is s1 followed by s2, but s2's first 2 letters are 'br', which should match s1's last 2 letters 'ra'?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the error works is that during the transmission, the two messages s1 and s2 are sent, but the first message's end and the second's beginning are overlapped. So the resulting t is s1's entire string, except the last k characters, plus s2's entire string except the first k characters, but since s1 and s2 are the same, this results in t being s1's string up to (n-k) characters, followed by s2's string from (n-k) onwards.\n\nWait, but s2 is the same as s1, which is s. So t is s1[0..n-k-1] + s2[n-k ... n-1], but since s2 is s, which is the same as s1, that's s1[0..n-k-1] + s1[n-k ... n-1].\n\nWait, but that would mean t is s concatenated with s, but with the first k characters of s2 overlapping the last k of s1. So t is s1 followed by s2, but the first k of s2 are the same as the last k of s1. So the overall t is s1 + s2[k:], because the first k of s2 are merged into the last k of s1.\n\nSo for example, if s is 'abcd' and k=2, s2 is 'abcd' and s1 is 'abcd'. The first 2 of s2 are 'ab', the last 2 of s1 are 'cd'. If they don't match, then no error. But if they do, then the error occurs.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the messages are the same, so s1 and s2 are both s. So the error can only happen if the last k of s equals the first k of s for some k >=1 and k < len(s).\n\nAh! That's the key. So for s to be a possible message, it must have a period k where the last k characters are equal to the first k.\n\nSo, for example, 'ababab' has a period of 2: 'ababab' → last 2 'ab', first 2 'ab'. So s can be 'ababab', and k=2.\n\nSo, the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. For the given t, check if it can be split into s + s, but with the first k of s overlapping the last k of s.\n\nSo, for each possible possible split into s + s', where s' is s but with the first k characters overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for a possible s such that t is formed by taking s, and then appending s, but the first k of s are the same as the last k of s.\n\nSo, to find s, the following must hold:\n\nt = s + s, but the first k of s is equal to the last k of s.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because s + s would be 2n, but t's length is 2n -k.\n\nWait, no. Because when s1 and s2 are s, and the error occurs with k characters overlapping, the resulting t is s1 + s2, but the first k of s2 are the same as the last k of s1. So t is s1 followed by s2[k:].\n\nSince s2 is s, t is s followed by s[k:].\n\nSo, for t to be the result of such an error, t must be equal to s + s[k:], where s has a period of k (i.e., the last k of s equals the first k of s).\n\nSo, our approach is:\n\nFor each possible k (from 1 to len(t)-1, but perhaps limited by the possible s lengths), check if t can be written as s + s[k:], and s has a period of k.\n\nBut how do we find s and k?\n\nAlternative approach: For t, try all possible possible k where 1 <=k < len(t), and see if t can be divided into s + s[k:], where s has a period of k.\n\nBut this might be computationally expensive for large t, but given that t can be up to 100 characters, it's manageable.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible k values from 1 to len(t)-1. Because the minimum possible k is 1, and maximum is len(t)-1 (since s must be at least k+1 characters long, otherwise s + s[k:] would be empty or require k to be larger than len(s)).\n\nWait, no. Because s must have a length of at least k, because the last k of s must be equal to the first k. So len(s) must be >=k.\n\nBut when we split t into s + s[k:], the length of s must be such that len(t) = len(s) + len(s[k:]) = len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nSo, len(t) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nWe can rearrange this as len(s) = (len(t)+k)/2.\n\nSince len(s) must be integer, len(t)+k must be even, and (len(t)+k)/2 must be >=k.\n\nSo, for each possible k, check if (len(t)+k) is even, and the resulting len(s) is >=k.\n\nIf so, then s can be constructed as the first (len(s)) characters, and we need to check if s's last k equals its first k.\n\nAdditionally, we also need to ensure that when you concatenate s and s[k:], you get t.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each possible k from 1 to (len(t)-1):\n\n   if (len(t) +k) is even:\n\n       len_s = (len(t)+k)//2\n\n       if len_s >=k:\n\n           s = t[0:len_s]\n\n           if s[-k:] == s[:k]:\n\n               then, construct t_candidate = s + s[k:]\n\n               if t_candidate == t:\n\n                   return YES and s.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nLoop over possible k:\n\n   Check if (len(t)+k) is even → len_s = (len(t)+k)/2 must be integer.\n\n   Check if len_s >=k.\n\n   Extract s as the first len_s characters of t.\n\n   Check if s's last k characters are equal to its first k.\n\n   Then, construct t_candidate by s followed by s[k:].\n\n   If t_candidate equals t, then it's a valid solution.\n\nWe need to find any such s and k.\n\nIf none found, output NO.\n\nBut wait, for each k, we have to compute len_s and see if t can be split accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nFor each possible k in 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n   Compute len_s = (len(t) +k ) // 2.\n\n   Check if len_s >=k.\n\n   Check if len(t) == 2*len_s -k → which it will be automatically because len(t) = (len_s)*2 -k.\n\n   Now, extract s as t[0: len_s].\n\n   Check if s's last k characters are equal to the first k.\n\n   Then, check if s concatenated with s[k:] equals t.\n\nBecause sometimes, the s may have a period, but when concatenated, it's not equal to t. So the final check is necessary.\n\nOnce any such s and k are found, output YES and s.\n\nOtherwise, after checking all k, output NO.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra']\n\nWhich is t = 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → length is 20.\n\nWe need to find k such that (20 +k) is even, len_s = (20 +k)/2 >=k.\n\nPossible k's:\n\nLet's try k=2.\n\nlen_s = (20+2)/2=11.\n\nIs 11 >=2 → yes.\n\ns is the first 11 characters of t: 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck s's last 2 characters: 'a' and 'r' → 'ar'.\n\ns's first 2: 'ab' → 'ab' != 'ar' → invalid.\n\nSo k=2 is invalid.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, s is 'abrakadabra' with k=2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the error occurs is that the two messages s1 and s2 are sent, and the error is that the end of s1 overlaps with the beginning of s2. So t is s1 followed by s2, but with the first k of s2 overlapping the last k of s1.\n\nSo, t is s1 + s2[k:].\n\nBut since s1 and s2 are the same, t is s + s[k:].\n\nSo, in the sample, t is s + s[k:].\n\nBut in the sample, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 20 letters.\n\ns is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters).\n\nThen, s + s[k:] = 11 + (11 -k) = 20 → 11 + (11 -k) =20 → 22 -k=20 →k=2.\n\nSo, s is 'abrakadabra', and s[k:] is s[2:] → 'rakadabra'.\n\nSo t should be 'abrakadabra' + 'rakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabakadabra'? No, that's not matching the sample.\n\nWait, the sample t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 20 letters.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters.\n\ns + s[k:] when k=2 would be 'abrakadabra' + 'rakadabra' → which is 11+9=20 letters.\n\nBut the sample t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 20 letters. So the first part is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), then 'brakadabra' (9 letters). So s[k:] is 'brakadabra', which would imply that s's substring from index 2 is 'brakadabra'.\n\nBut 'abrakadabra' from index 2 is 'rakadabra' → so 'rakadabra' is not equal to 'brakadabra' → thus, this can't be.\n\nWait, so perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the way t is formed. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nWhen two messages s1 and s2 are sent, the error causes them to merge. The way they merge is that the end of the first message is combined with the beginning of the second, with the same characters.\n\nSo, the resulting message t is formed by taking the end of s1 (suffix of length k) and the beginning of s2 (prefix of length k), and then the rest of s2 beyond the first k.\n\nWait, no. Because the error is that the two messages are sent back-to-back, but their ends overlap. So the first message is s1, the second is s2. The error causes the end of s1 to merge with the beginning of s2.\n\nSo, the merged t is s1's suffix of length k plus s2's prefix of length (n -k), where n is len(s1) and len(s2)?\n\nNo, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose s1 is \"abc\", s2 is \"cba\". The error occurs with k=1. So the end of s1 is 'c', the start of s2 is 'c'. So the merged t would be 'c' followed by s2[1:] → 'cba' → 'cb' → t would be 'ccba'? Or wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the way it works is that the two messages are s1 and s2. During transmission, the error causes s1 to be followed by s2, but the last k of s1 and the first k of s2 are the same, so they merge into one. So, the resulting t is the first (len(s1) -k) of s1, followed by s2.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because s2 is the same as s1, so if s2 is s1, then the first (len(s1) -k) of s1 is s1[0:(n-k)], followed by s2, but s2 is s1.\n\nWait, perhaps t is s1[0:(n-k)] + s2.\n\nBut s2 is s1. So t is s1[0:(n-k)] + s1.\n\nWait, but that's just s1[0:(n-k)] + s1 → which is s1 followed by s1, but with the first k characters of s1 merged into the last k.\n\nSo, for example, if s1 is 'abcd' (n=4), and k=2.\n\nThen s1[0:(4-2)] is 'ab', followed by s1 → 'abcd' → so t is 'abcdabcd' → but that's 8 letters.\n\nWait, but the error is that the two messages are sent, and their ends are merged. So t should be s1 followed by s2, but the last k of s1 and the first k of s2 are the same, so they are merged.\n\nSo, in this case, s1 is 'abcd', s2 is 'abcd'.\n\nThe last 2 of s1 is 'cd', first 2 of s2 is 'ab' → different, so no error.\n\nBut if s1 is 'abab', then the last 2 is 'ab', first 2 of s2 is 'ab' → so they can merge.\n\nSo, t is s1 followed by s2, but the last k of s1 and first k of s2 are merged. So t is s1[0:(n-k)] + s2.\n\nWait, but since s1 and s2 are the same, s2 is s1. So t is s1[0:(n-k)] + s1.\n\nSo, len(t) = (n -k) + n = 2n -k.\n\nIn the sample input, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → 20 letters.\n\nAssuming n is 11, then 2n -k =20 → 22 -k=20 →k=2.\n\nSo, s1 is 'abrakadabra' → len 11.\n\nt is s1[0:9] ('abrakadabr') followed by s1 → 'abrakadabra' → so t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → which is exactly the sample input.\n\nYes! So, in this case, s1 is 'abrakadabra', s2 is 'abrakadabra', and the error occurs with k=2, so the last 2 of s1 are 'ra', the first 2 of s2 are 'ab' → wait, that's not the same. So how is this a valid case?\n\nWait, this suggests that my previous approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, according to the sample, s is 'abrakadabra' and t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the two messages are sent and merged due to the error. So t is s1 followed by s2, but with the last k of s1 and first k of s2 overlapping. So, in the sample, the last 2 of s1 are 'ra', the first 2 of s2 are 'ab' → which are different. So why is this considered a valid error?\n\nThis suggests that my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам.\"\n\nSo, the end of the first message is merged with the beginning of the second. So the two messages are s and s. So, the end of s is merged with the beginning of s.\n\nWait, so for the merged t to have this, the end of s must be equal to the beginning of s. So, the last k of s must be equal to the first k of s.\n\nSo, in the sample, s is 'abrakadabra', and the last 2 letters are 'ra' and the first 2 are 'ab' → which are not the same. So why is this considered a valid case?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. Maybe the end of the second message is merged with the beginning of the first.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго\".\n\nSo, the end of the first (s1) is merged with the start of the second (s2). So, s1 is 'abrakadabra', s2 is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nThe end of s1 is the last k characters. The start of s2 is the first k.\n\nSo, for the error to occur, these must be the same.\n\nIn the sample, the last 2 of s1 are 'ra', the first 2 of s2 are 'ab' → they are not the same. So this shouldn't be a valid case.\n\nBut the sample says it is. So I'm definitely misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the indices.\n\nWait, let's write out s1 and s2 as 'abrakadabra'.\n\ns1 = 'a b r a k a d a b r a'\n\nIndices 0 to 10.\n\nSo, the last 2 characters are indices 9 and 10: 'r' and 'a'.\n\nThe first 2 are 0 and 1: 'a' and 'b'.\n\nThey are not the same.\n\nSo why is the sample output considering this as a valid case?\n\nThis suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows the messages to be s and s, and the error is that the end of the first and the start of the second are the same, regardless of whether they are the same as each other.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the two messages are identical. So, for the error to occur, the end of the first (s) and the start of the second (s) must be the same.\n\nSo, in the sample, the end of s is 'ra' and the start of s is 'ab' → which are different. So this shouldn't be a valid case.\n\nBut according to the sample, it is valid. So I must be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the error can occur if the end of the first message and the start of the second message are the same, regardless of whether they are the same as each other. But that can't be, because the two messages are the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"two messages are sent one after another, and due to an error, they merge. The end of the first message is combined with the beginning of the second message. The combined part must be of the same symbols.\"\n\nSo, the two messages are s1 and s2. They are the same. So, the end of s1 and the start of s2 must be the same.\n\nSo, for the sample, the end of s1 is 'ra', the start of s2 is 'ab' → not the same. So the error shouldn't have occurred.\n\nBut according to the sample, it's considered a valid case.\n\nThis suggests that my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking about the problem backwards. Maybe the error is that the end of the first message is merged into the start of the second message, but the two messages can be different.\n\nNo, the problem says that the two messages are the same. So, perhaps the issue is that the messages are sent in the order s and s, but the error is that the end of s is merged into the start of s, thus creating a t that is s + s but with the first k of s merged into the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the error works is that the two messages are s and s, and the end of the first is merged into the beginning of the second. So the resulting t is s + s, but the first k of s2 (second s) is replaced by the last k of s1 (first s). So the merged t is s1 + s2[k:].\n\nSo, for the sample, s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), s2 is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nThe first s1 is 'abrakadabra', the second s2 is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nThe error causes the last k of s1 to be merged into the start of s2.\n\nSo, t is s1 + s2[k:].\n\nIn the sample, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nLet's see:\n\ns1 is 'abrakadabra' → len 11.\n\ns2[k:] is s2[2:] → 'rakadabra' → len 9.\n\nSo s1 + s2[k:] is 'abrakadabra' + 'rakadabra' → len 20.\n\nBut in the sample, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → which is 'abrakadabra' followed by 'brakadabra' → which is 11 + 9=20 letters.\n\nWait, but 'abrakadabra' + 'rakadabra' is 'abrakadabrabakadabra' → no, that's 11+9=20 letters, but the actual t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 20 letters.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabra' is 'a','b','r','a','k','a','d','a','b','r','a'.\n\ns2[k:] is s2[2:] → 'r','a','k','a','d','a','b','r','a' → 'rakadabra'.\n\nSo, s1 + s2[k:] is 'abrakadabra' + 'rakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabakadabra'? No, that can't be right.\n\nWait, no, 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. Adding 'rakadabra' (9 letters) gives 20 letters. So 'abrakadabra' followed by 'rakadabra' is 'abrakadabrabakadabra'? Or wait, no: 'abrakadabra' is 'a b r a k a d a b r a' → adding 'r a k a d a b r a' → 'a b r a k a d a b r a r a k a d a b r a' → which is 20 letters.\n\nBut the sample t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → which is 'a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a' → 20 letters.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters.\n\ns2[k:] when k=2 is 'r a k a d a b r a' → 9 letters.\n\nSo, s1 + s2[k:] is 11+9=20 letters.\n\nSo, the merged t is 'a b r a k a d a b r a' + 'r a k a d a b r a' → which is 20 letters.\n\nBut the sample t is 'a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a' → which is 20 letters.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly. Let me write it out:\n\ns1 is 'a b r a k a d a b r a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could be the result of an error in a network transmission where two identical messages were merged. The error occurs when the end of the first message overlaps with the beginning of the second message by at least one character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Error Mechanism**: When two identical messages `s1` and `s2` are sent consecutively, an error causes their end and start to overlap by `k` characters (where `k` is a positive integer less than the length of `s`). The resulting string `t` will be the concatenation of `s1` and `s2`, but with the overlapping part merged.\n\n2. **Check for Possible Overlaps**: For each possible value of `k` from 1 to `len(t)-1`, check if `t` can be split into two parts such that the second part starts with the last `k` characters of the first part. This ensures that the overlap condition is met.\n\n3. **Construct Candidate Strings**: For each valid `k`, construct the candidate original message `s` by taking the first part of `t` and verifying if its last `k` characters match the first `k` characters.\n\n4. **Validate the Construction**: Ensure that the constructed candidate message `s` followed by `s[k:]` equals `t`.\n\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, output \"YES\" followed by `s`. Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef find_possible_s(t):\n    n = len(t)\n    for k in range(1, n):  # k can't be equal to n, as s must have at least k+1 characters\n        if (n + k) % 2 != 0:\n            continue\n        len_s = (n + k) // 2\n        if len_s < k:\n            continue\n        s = t[:len_s]\n        if len(s) < k:\n            continue\n        if s[-k:] == s[:k]:\n            # Now check if s concatenated with s[k:] gives t\n            candidate = s + s[k:]\n            if candidate == t:\n                return s\n    return None\n\nt = input().strip()\nresult = find_possible_s(t)\nif result is not None:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: Read the input string `t`.\n- **Loop Through Possible k Values**: Iterate through each possible `k` to determine potential overlaps.\n- **Check Validity of k**: Ensure that the derived length of `s` is valid and meets the conditions for an overlap.\n- **Construct and Validate Candidate**: For each valid `k`, construct the candidate `s` and verify if it correctly forms `t` when overlapped.\n- **Output Result**: Based on the checks, output whether a valid `s` exists or not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible overlaps and ensures the correct formation of `t` from a possible original message `s`, providing the solution in an optimal manner.",
