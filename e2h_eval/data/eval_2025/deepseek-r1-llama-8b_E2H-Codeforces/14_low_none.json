He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I have to output the count of such numbers and the numbers themselves in increasing order.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n because there are always enough factors of 2. So for each multiple of 5, we add one zero, and for multiples of 25, 125, etc., we add more.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nNow, the task is to find all n such that Z(n) equals m. The challenge is to find all possible n's and then output them.\n\nI think the approach would be to perform a binary search to find the lower and upper bounds of n where Z(n) equals m. Because the function Z(n) is non-decreasing (as adding more numbers can only increase the count), once Z(n) exceeds m, we stop searching on the higher side.\n\nWait, but sometimes multiple n's can have the same Z(n). For example, in the sample input, m=5, the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all give Z(n)=5. So, I need to find all such consecutive n's that produce the same m.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n   - If Z(n) is exactly m, it's the starting point.\n   - Otherwise, no solution exists, so return 0.\n2. Once we have the smallest n, find the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n   - How? We can keep incrementing n until Z(n) > m, then take the previous n.\n3. All n's between the smallest and largest (inclusive) are the solutions.\n\nBut wait, maybe after finding the lower bound, the next step is to find all consecutive n's where Z(n) remains m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using binary search to find the lower bound, then expanding around it to find all possible n's.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, I'll need a helper function to calculate the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\nThen, for a given m, I can perform a binary search to find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m. Let's call this low. If Z(low) != m, then there's no solution.\n\nIf Z(low) == m, then I need to find the maximum high such that Z(high) == m. How?\n\nOne way is to start from low and keep checking higher n's until Z increases beyond m. The last n before Z exceeds m is the high.\n\nFor example, in the sample where m=5:\nlow starts at 5, since Z(5) is 1+0 =1? Wait wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, let's compute Z(5):\n\n5//5=1, 5//25=0, so sum is 1. But in the sample input, when m=1, the output is 5, meaning n=5. So for m=5, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, how does that happen? Let me compute Z(5): 5/5=1, 25 is larger than 5, so Z(5)=1. But in the sample, m=5 gives n from 5 to 9, which must have Z(n)=5. Oh right, because 5! has 1 zero, but as n increases, the count increases.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute Z(5), Z(6), etc.\n\nZ(5) = 1 (from 5)\nZ(6) = 1\nZ(7) =1\nZ(8)=1\nZ(9)=1\nZ(10)= 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0)\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, 10/5=2, 10/25=0. So Z(10)=2.\n\nWait, then for n=5, Z(n) is 1. So why in the sample, when m=5, the output is 5,6,7,8,9? Because those n's have Z(n)=5? No, that's not correct. Wait, no—maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait the sample input is '1' and '5', but the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. Wait, the first sample input is m",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always enough factors of 2, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   where each term accounts for multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: We use binary search to efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). If \\( Z(n) \\) equals \\( m \\) at this point, we then find the largest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) \\) remains \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Finding All Valid \\( n \\)**: Once the bounds are determined, all integers between the smallest and largest \\( n \\) (inclusive) are valid solutions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(m):\n    def z(n):\n        count = 0\n        power = 5\n        while power <= n:\n            count += n // power\n            power *= 5\n        return count\n\n    # Find the smallest n where z(n) >= m\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # An upper bound, though it might not be tight\n    result_low = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        current = z(mid)\n        if current < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            if result_low == -1 or mid < result_low:\n                result_low = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    if result_low == -1:\n        return (0, [])\n\n    # Now find the highest n where z(n) == m\n    current_n = result_low\n    while True:\n        next_n = current_n + 1\n        if z(next_n) > m:\n            break\n        current_n = next_n\n\n    # Now collect all numbers from result_low to current_n\n    nums = list(range(result_low, current_n + 1))\n    return (len(nums), nums)\n\nm = int(input())\nk, nums = count_trailing_zeros(m)\nprint(k)\nif k > 0:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, nums)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Helper Function `z(n)`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions from multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: We perform binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). If \\( Z(n) \\) equals \\( m \\) at this point, we proceed to find the upper bound.\n3. **Expanding Upper Bound**: Starting from the lower bound, we incrementally check higher values until \\( Z(n) \\) exceeds \\( m \\), thus determining the upper bound.\n4. **Collecting Results**: All integers between the lower and upper bounds are collected and returned as the solution.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
