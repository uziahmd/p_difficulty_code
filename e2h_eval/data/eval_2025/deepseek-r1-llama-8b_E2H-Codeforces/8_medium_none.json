Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the direction of each edge in a flow network such that the resulting graph satisfies certain conditions. The goal is to make sure that for each vertex v (except the source and sink), the sum of incoming edges equals the sum of outgoing edges. Also, the source has no incoming edges, and there are no cycles in the directed graph.\n\nHmm. So the given graph is undirected, and we need to assign directions to each edge to form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a valid max flow.\n\nWait, but how do we determine the directions? It feels like this is related to the concept of residual graphs and maybe something like finding a DAG that's consistent with the flow.\n\nLet me think. Each edge in the original graph will become either an edge from ai to bi or vice versa. The direction chosen must satisfy certain constraints:\n\n1. For every node except the source and sink, the sum of outgoing edges' flows equals the sum of incoming edges' flows.\n2. The source has no incoming edges.\n3. The graph is a DAG, which implies it's a directed acyclic graph.\n\nWait, but the sum condition is similar to the conservation of flow at each intermediate node. That makes sense because in a flow network, the flow into a node must equal the flow out of it (except for the source and sink).\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to model this as assigning directions such that the residual graph is a DAG and satisfies the flow conservation.\n\nAnother thought: Since the given graph is connected and the solution exists, we can construct a spanning tree using some method, like BFS, starting from the source. Then, for each edge not in the tree, assign its direction based on the potential of the nodes.\n\nWait, that rings a bell. There's a standard approach for this kind of problem where you assign potentials to each node and direct edges according to the difference in potentials.\n\nRight! This is similar to the problem of making a graph a DAG by orienting edges based on a potential function. If for an edge (u, v), if the potential of u is less than v, then the edge is directed u->v. Otherwise, it's directed v->u.\n\nBut how does this relate to flow here? Because in our case, the flow through each edge contributes to the conservation at the nodes.\n\nSo perhaps the solution involves:\n\n1. Assigning a potential (or level) to each node such that the sum of flows along edges leaving a node equals the sum entering it (except for source and sink).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that for each node v (1 < v < n), the sum of incoming ci equals the sum of outgoing ci. So the net flow through v is zero.\n\nThis suggests that the flow conservation holds, which is necessary for the existence of a maximum flow.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- First, find a spanning tree that connects all the nodes, starting from the source. The spanning tree would be a subset of edges that connect all nodes with minimal or some structure.\n\n- For each node, compute its depth or potential relative to the source. This can be done via BFS.\n\n- Then, for each edge (u, v) with flow c, decide the direction based on whether u is higher or lower in the BFS tree. If the potential of u is less than v, then the edge is directed from u to v; else, from v to u. But wait, no, because the flow is fixed. Or perhaps the direction is determined by the potential difference.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose we have a potential function h(v) for each node v. Then, for each edge (u, v), if h(u) < h(v), then the edge should be directed u→v. Otherwise, v→u. But how does this ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nBecause when we have such a setup, the sum of flows into each node v is equal to the sum of flows out of v. Because, for any cycle, the potentials would satisfy h(u) > h(v) for all edges in the cycle in one direction, which isn't possible since the potential function is acyclic.\n\nWait, but the graph is undirected. So in this approach, the directed edges form a DAG, and the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nBut how do we handle the flow values? Because the flow on each edge depends on the direction assigned.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the direction of each edge is determined by the potential function h, ensuring that the flow through the edge contributes to the balance of the potentials.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a problem of finding a DAG orientation that satisfies the flow conservation for all internal nodes.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Perform BFS starting from the source (node 1) to determine the levels (h) of each node. This gives us a way to assign a potential to each node.\n\n2. For each edge (u, v), if h[u] < h[v], then direct the edge from u to v. Otherwise, direct it from v to u. However, this might not always hold because the flow needs to be considered.\n\nWait, but in the BFS approach, if u is at a lower level than v, then u should push flow towards v. So the edge is directed u→v. But what about the flow value ci? Because the flow contributes to the balance.\n\nWait, maybe the direction is determined by the potential, but the flow's direction must account for the fact that the flow is moving from higher to lower potential in the other direction.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as a directed graph where each edge has a capacity, but the direction is to be determined. We need to assign directions such that:\n\n- The sum of incoming and outgoing edges for each node v (except source and sink) are equal.\n\n- Source has no incoming edges.\n\n- The graph is a DAG.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to finding an orientation of the edges that forms a DAG and satisfies flow conservation at each node.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a BFS-based approach to determine the levels and then orient the edges accordingly.\n\nSo, here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Compute the levels (h) of each node using BFS starting from the source. This ensures that the source is at level 0, and each subsequent level is one more than the parent.\n\n2. For each edge (u, v), if h[u] < h[v], then direct it from u to v. Otherwise, direct it from v to u.\n\n3. Once all edges are directed, check if the flow conservation holds.\n\nWait, but how does this ensure that the flow is correctly split? Because each edge's flow is given, and we're just directing them.\n\nWait, perhaps the direction assignment ensures that the flow is such that the sum of incoming equals outgoing for each node except source and sink.\n\nLet me see. Suppose for a node v, all edges directed into it come from nodes with lower levels (i.e., in the BFS tree, they are ancestors). Then, the sum of flows going out of v would be the sum of edges directed away, which are to higher-level nodes. But the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows.\n\nWait, maybe not directly, but the process of assigning directions based on levels ensures that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BFS-based approach ensures that the flow is routed in such a way that each node's incoming and outgoing flows balance out.\n\nI think I've seen this approach before. Let me try to formalize it.\n\nEach edge (u, v) with flow c contributes to the potential of u and v. If u is directed towards v, then the flow c is part of the outgoing flow of u and incoming to v. So the sum of outgoing from u must equal the sum of incoming to u, which is enforced by the direction assignment based on levels.\n\nWait, but the sum of outgoing edges from u is equal to the sum of incoming edges to u, which is required by the problem statement.\n\nSo, when we assign direction based on levels, the sum of outgoing edges from u will be the sum of edges directed away from u, which are those where u is at a lower level than v. Similarly, the incoming edges to u are those where v is at a lower level than u.\n\nSo, for each node v, the sum of outgoing edges is the sum of c_i where v is the source, and the sum of incoming is the sum of c_j where v is the destination.\n\nIf we arrange the directions such that for each edge (u, v), if h[u] < h[v], then u → v, else v → u.\n\nThen, for each node, the sum of outgoing edges is equal to the sum of incoming edges.\n\nBecause in the BFS, the edges are oriented in a way that for any path from the source, the direction is consistent with the level hierarchy.\n\nMoreover, this ensures that the graph is a DAG because any cycle would require that for some nodes u and v, their levels are both higher and lower, which is impossible.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n- Perform BFS to assign levels to each node.\n\n- For each edge, if the level of u is less than that of v, direct u→v; else, direct v→u.\n\nNow, the next question is: How to implement this.\n\nFirst, I'll represent the graph as an adjacency list. Each edge will be stored as (u, v, c).\n\nThen, perform BFS starting from node 1. For each node, store its level (distance from the source). Since the graph is connected, this is possible.\n\nOnce the levels are computed, for each edge (u, v, c), compare h[u] and h[v]. If h[u] < h[v], then output '0' (since u→v is the direction, and 0 indicates that the original edge is directed that way). Wait, wait: Wait, the output is 0 if the edge is directed ai → bi, else 1. So for each input edge ai, bi, ci, we need to output 0 if we are directing ai→bi, else 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is di = 0 if the direction is ai→bi, else 1.\n\nSo for each edge in the input, which is between ai and bi, we need to determine whether it's directed ai→bi or bi→ai.\n\nSo, during the processing, for each edge (u, v, c), if h[u] < h[v], then it's directed u→v, so di is 0. Else, it's directed v→u, so di is 1.\n\nWait, yes. Because if u is ai and v is bi, then if h[u] < h[v], then the edge is directed ai→bi, so di is 0. Otherwise, it's bi→ai, so di is 1.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each input edge, represented as (ai, bi, ci):\n\nif h[ai] < h[bi], then di is 0, else di is 1.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when ai == bi? Well, the problem says that in the input, all edges are between different vertices, so ai != bi.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nBuild the adjacency list.\n\nPerform BFS starting from node 1 to compute h for each node.\n\nThen, for each edge in the input, compare h[ai] and h[bi], output 0 if ai's h is less than bi's, else 1.\n\nWait, but in the example given:\n\nIn the first test case, the edges are:\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nWait, the output is '1\\n0\\n1'.\n\nLet me see. For the first edge, 3-2, h[3] is 1 (assuming BFS starts at 1, so 1 is level 0, its neighbors (like 2 and 3) are level 1. So h[3] = 1, h[2] = 1.\n\nSo for edge 3-2: h[3] is equal to h[2], so which direction do we choose?\n\nHmm, in the sample, the output is 1, meaning the edge is directed 2→3.\n\nWait, why?\n\nBecause in the BFS, 1 is level 0, and 2 and 3 are level 1. So for the edge 3-2, since h[3] is not less than h[2], the direction is 2→3, which is di=1.\n\nSimilarly, the second edge is 1-2 with c=10. Since h[1] < h[2], di is 0.\n\nThird edge is 3-1, which is directed 1→3, because h[1] < h[3], di is 0.\n\nWait, but the sample output is '1\\n0\\n1', which corresponds to the three edges.\n\nWait, the first edge is 3→2: no, the output is 1, meaning 2→3.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but what about when two nodes have the same level? Like in the example above, 2 and 3 are both level 1.\n\nIn that case, the edge between them could be directed either way, as long as the overall conditions are met.\n\nBut the problem allows any valid solution, so it's acceptable.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this.\n\nBut wait, how to perform the BFS correctly. Because the graph is undirected, when processing each node's edges, we need to avoid revisiting the parent node.\n\nYes, because in BFS, each node is visited once, and we track the parent to prevent revisiting.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nedges = []\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\nfor _ in range(m):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    edges.append( (a, b, c) )\n    adj[a].append(b)\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\nThen, perform BFS:\n\nh = [-1]*(n+1)\nfrom collections import deque\nq = deque()\nq.append(1)\nh[1] = 0\n\nwhile q:\n    u = q.popleft()\n    for v in adj[u]:\n        if h[v] == -1:\n            h[v] = h[u] + 1\n            q.append(v)\n\nWait, but what if the graph is such that node 1 is connected to multiple nodes, but others are also connected in a way that requires a longer path. But BFS ensures that the shortest path is found, but the level assignment is correct regardless.\n\nWait, but the BFS will correctly assign the level for each node, since the graph is connected.\n\nOnce h is computed, then for each edge in the edges list, determine di.\n\nBut the edges are given in the order of input, so for each edge (a, b, c), compare h[a] and h[b], and set di=0 if h[a] < h[b], else 1.\n\nBut wait, what about when h[a] == h[b]? For example, in the first test case, the edge between 3 and 2 is 3-2, which is h[3]=1, h[2]=1. So, for that edge, di is 1, as per the sample.\n\nYes, which aligns with the sample.\n\nSo, the code for processing each edge is:\n\nfor a, b, c in edges:\n    if h[a] < h[b]:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(1)\n\nWait, but in the sample, the third edge is 3-1. h[3] is 1, h[1] is 0. So, h[3] > h[1], so the edge is directed 1→3, hence di is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting another scenario: what if a node is disconnected from the source? But the problem says the graph is connected, so that's not a concern.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, m=5.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0'. Let's see:\n\nThe edges are:\n\n4 5: hmm, wait, wait. Wait, the first line is '4 5'—no, wait, the sample input is:\n\n['4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Oh, no, the sample input is given as two lines, each representing a test case. But in the problem statement, the input is a single test case, but perhaps the user made a mistake in the formatting.\n\nWait, the actual input is probably two separate test cases. But in the problem statement, the sample input is written as two separate lines, each representing a test case.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement shows the input as:\n\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\nBut perhaps that's a typo, and it's a single test case.\n\nBut in any case, the code should process each test case as provided.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is a single test case. So the code will read n, m, then m lines of edges.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if h is not correctly computed? No, BFS from 1 is correct.\n\n- Are the edges processed in the right order? Yes, because for each edge, we process as per their input order.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the edges are given in an order, and the output must be for each edge in the input order.\n\nYes, because the edges are stored in a list as per the input order, and processed in that order.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1.\n\nEdge between 1 and 2, c=5.\n\nBFS: 1 is level 0, 2 is level 1.\n\nSo, h[1]<h[2], so the edge is directed 1→2, di=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=2.\n\nEdges:\n\n1-2 (c=5), 2-3 (c=10).\n\nBFS: 1 is level 0, 2 is level 1, 3 is level 2.\n\nSo, for edge 1-2: h[1]<h[2], di=0.\n\nFor edge 2-3: h[2]<h[3], di=0.\n\nThus, output is 0 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, m=4.\n\nEdges:\n\n1-2 (c=5), 1-3 (c=10), 2-4 (c=20), 3-4 (c=30).\n\nBFS levels: 1:0, 2:1,3:1,4:2.\n\nSo, edge 1-2: di=0.\n\nEdge 1-3: di=0.\n\nEdge 2-4: di=0.\n\nEdge 3-4: h[3]=1 < h[4]=2, so di=0.\n\nSo output four 0s.\n\nBut what if another edge is present, say 2-3 with c=15.\n\nThen, for 2-3: h[2]=1, h[3]=1. So di=1.\n\nSo, the code correctly assigns directions.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nBuild adjacency list.\n\nBFS to compute h.\n\nFor each edge in the input, output 0 if h[a]<h[b], else 1.\n\nSo, the Python code:\n\nWe can proceed to write it.\n\nBut wait, in the code, after building the adjacency list, we process each edge in the order they were read.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the edges are given as m lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nSo, the code reads n and m, then for each of m lines, reads a, b, c, appends to edges, and builds the adjacency list.\n\nThen, perform BFS.\n\nThen, for each edge in edges, output 0 if a's h < b's h, else 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the edges are stored as a list, and processed in that order.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the output must correspond to the input edges in the order they are given.\n\nYes, so the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nSample Output:\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nSo, let's compute h.\n\nBFS starts at 1, h[1]=0.\n\nNeighbors of 1: 2 and 3.\n\nSo, h[2] = 1, h[3]=1.\n\nWhen processing edge 3-2: h[3]=1, h[2]=1 → di=1.\n\nEdge 1-2: h[1]<h[2] → di=0.\n\nEdge 3-1: h[3]>h[1] → di=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond test case in the problem's input:\n\n4 5\n\n1 2 10\n\n1 3 10\n\n2 3 5\n\n4 2 15\n\n3 4 5\n\nSo, the edges are:\n\n1-2 (c=10), 1-3 (c=10), 2-3 (c=5), 4-2 (c=15), 3-4 (c=5).\n\nBFS:\n\n1 is level 0.\n\nIts neighbors are 2 and 3: level 1.\n\n2's neighbor is 4: level 2.\n\n3's neighbor is 4: level 2.\n\nSo, h is:\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:1\n\n4:2.\n\nSo, for each edge:\n\n1-2: h[1]<h[2] → di=0.\n\n1-3: h[1]<h[3] → di=0.\n\n2-3: h[2]==h[3] → di=1.\n\n4-2: h[4]>h[2] → di=1.\n\n3-4: h[3]==h[4] → di=1.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the output is '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0'.\n\nWait, that's 5 edges.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the order.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nWait, the edges as per input order are:\n\n1. 1 2 10 → di=0.\n\n2. 1 3 10 → di=0.\n\n3. 2 3 5 → di=1.\n\n4. 4 2 15 → di=1.\n\n5. 3 4 5 → h[3]=1 < h[4]=2 → di=0.\n\nSo, the output should be 0,0,1,1,0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nYes, because for the fifth edge, 3→4 is allowed, so di is 0.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the direction of each edge in a flow network such that the resulting graph satisfies certain conditions.
