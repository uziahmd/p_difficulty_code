Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if the pile of letters found in the morning can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. That means all the letters from the guest and host should be present in the pile, with no extra letters and no missing ones.\n\nHmm, the input has three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second the host's, and the third the pile. I need to check if combining the two names' letters exactly matches the pile.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, the key is to count the frequency of each character in the combined guest and host names and then compare it to the frequency in the pile.\n\nRight, so the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the guest and host strings.\n3. Count the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.\n4. Do the same for the pile string.\n5. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they're identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nBut wait, what about case sensitivity? The problem says all lines are uppercase letters, so no issues there.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nI think using the collections.Counter class would be helpful. It can count the occurrences of each character efficiently.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the three lines, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace (though the problem states that lines are not empty, so maybe not necessary, but better safe).\n- Combine the first and second lines into a single string.\n- Create a Counter for this combined string.\n- Create another Counter for the third line.\n- Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but what about when the lengths don't match? Because if the combined length isn't equal to the pile's length, we can immediately return NO. So perhaps adding that check first could save some computation time.\n\nYes, that's a good idea. So first, check if len(guest) + len(host) equals len(pile). If not, output NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed with the counters.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead guest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, total_length = len(guest) + len(host)\nif total_length != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # proceed to count\n\nWait, no, because the guest and host may have a combined length that's different from the pile. So yes, checking their sum is a necessary condition.\n\nOnce that's satisfied, create the combined string, then compare the counts.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    from collections import Counter\n    cnt_combined = Counter(combined)\n    cnt_pile = Counter(pile)\n    if cnt_combined == cnt_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, let's see:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, no, looking back at the problem statement, the actual input is three lines, which are the guest, host, and pile. So in the sample input, the guest is the first line, host the second, pile the third.\n\nSo the code correctly reads them as guest, host, pile.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nguest is \"SANTACLAUS\", host is \"DEDMOROZ\", so combined is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". Pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\nWait, but the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" — does that combine with the guest and host to form the same letters?\n\nHmm, the sample output is YES, so the code should correctly count all letters.\n\nAnother test case is when the pile has an extra letter, like in the second sample, where the pile is missing a 'P' and has an extra 'L'. So the code correctly returns NO.\n\nEdge cases: what if one of the names is empty? But the problem says all lines are non-empty, so no issue.\n\nWhat about when the combined length is zero? But again, per problem statement, the lines are not empty, so combined can't be zero.\n\nAnother edge case: all letters are the same, like guest is 'A', host is 'A', pile is 'AA' — should return YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is 'AB', host is 'CD', pile is 'ACBD' — should return YES.\n\nIf the pile is 'ACD', it's NO since length is 3 vs 4.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nI think that's all. So the code is straightforward: read the three lines, check their combined length, then compare their character counts.\n\nOne more thing: the problem says to print \"YES\" or \"NO\" without quotes. So in Python, just print those strings directly.\n\nYes, that should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the morning can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that all letters from both names should be present in the pile without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three input lines representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths**: Verify if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, it is immediately impossible to form the names from the pile, so we return \"NO\".\n4. **Count Characters**: Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in both the combined string and the pile.\n5. **Compare Counts**: If the character counts for both strings are identical, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the presence and absence of each character, leveraging the properties of the Counter class in Python for accurate comparisons.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines of input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the total number of characters matches\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Count the occurrences of each character\n    cnt_combined = Counter(combined)\n    cnt_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the two counters\n    if cnt_combined == cnt_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, ensuring we capture each name and the pile correctly.\n- **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated to form a single string that represents all the letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Length Check**: Before proceeding with character counting, we check if the combined length of the names matches the pile's length. This is an optimization to quickly rule out impossible cases.\n- **Character Counting**: Using the Counter class, we count how many times each character appears in both the combined string and the pile.\n- **Comparison**: The final step compares these two counts. If they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names, otherwise, it cannot.\n\nThis method efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures correctness by directly comparing the character frequencies.",
