They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about restoring the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the information from some roads. Each road gives two numbers: the GCD and LCM of the two lawns it connects. My task is to determine if there's a possible arrangement of mushrooms that satisfies all these constraints. If it's possible, I need to output any valid configuration; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nHmm. So the approach here is probably to model this as a graph where each node represents a lawn, and each edge represents the constraints between two nodes. Since the edges form a graph, perhaps we can model this with a system of equations or inequalities.\n\nWait, for each edge, let's say between node u and v, the GCD is g and the LCM is l. Then, what do we know about the mushrooms on u and v?\n\nWe know that GCD(a_u, a_v) = g and LCM(a_u, a_v) = l. Also, since GCD and LCM are related by the formula LCM(a,b) * GCD(a,b) = a*b, but only when a and b are positive integers. So in this case, since GCD is g and LCM is l, then g * l must equal a_u * a_v. But wait, no. Because a_u and a_v could be multiples of g and l, respectively, but not necessarily in a direct product relationship. Wait, no, the standard formula is that for any two positive integers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So yes, that holds.\n\nSo for each edge, a_u * a_v = g * l.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the edge says that the GCD is g and the LCM is l. So a_u and a_v must satisfy those two conditions. So let's think:\n\nLet’s denote a_u as x and a_v as y. Then, GCD(x, y) = g and LCM(x, y) = l. So from these two, we can derive that x and y are multiples of g. Because the GCD is g, both x and y are multiples of g. Similarly, the LCM is l, which must be a multiple of both x and y.\n\nSo x = g * a, y = g * b, where a and b are coprime integers (since the GCD of a and b would be 1). Then, the LCM of x and y is g * LCM(a, b) = l. So LCM(a, b) = l / g.\n\nBut also, since x and y are expressed as g*a and g*b, their product is g² a b. But from the earlier formula, x*y = g*l. So substituting, g² a b = g l → g a b = l. So a*b = l/(g).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So a and b are coprime, and their product is l/g. So for each edge, the pair (a, b) must be factors of l/g, and they must be coprime.\n\nWait, but l must be a multiple of g because LCM(x,y) is always a multiple of both x and y. So l must be >= g. Otherwise, the given input is invalid because the initial map had such properties. But the problem statement says that the numbers on the roads were no less than 1 and didn't exceed 106. So I don't need to worry about cases where l < g, because the input ensures that.\n\nSo, for each edge, the values of x and y must satisfy x = g * a, y = g * b, with a and b being coprimes, and a * b = l / g.\n\nSo the problem reduces to assigning values to each node such that for every edge, the values assigned to the two endpoints meet these conditions.\n\nNow, how to model this. It feels like a problem where each node has variables that are constrained by the edges. This is similar to a system of equations, but more like a system of multiplicative constraints.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using Union-Find with some additional information. Because each connected component must have consistent assignments, and the constraints might form a tree or have cycles that can be checked for consistency.\n\nSo perhaps we can model each node's value as a variable, and for each edge, we create an equation that relates the two variables. Then, during the process of checking the constraints, we can detect if any cycles lead to contradictions.\n\nBut how? Let's think about it.\n\nEach edge between u and v enforces that x_u * x_v = (g * l), as per the earlier reasoning. So for each edge, the product of the two variables is fixed. So for each node, we can represent its",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the given constraints from the roads. Each road provides the GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on the two lawns it connects. We need to ensure that these constraints are satisfied across the entire graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each node is a lawn and each edge represents a constraint (GCD and LCM) between two nodes.\n2. **Constraints Analysis**: For each edge with GCD `g` and LCM `l`, the product of the mushrooms on the two connected nodes must be `g * l`. This can be broken down into factors that must be coprime.\n3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use a union-find data structure to manage connected components and track the product constraints. This helps in efficiently checking for contradictions when adding new edges.\n4. **Cycle Check**: For each connected component, ensure that the constraints do not form a cycle that leads to a contradiction. If a contradiction is found, output \"NO\".\n5. **Assign Values**: If all constraints are consistent, assign values to each node based on the constraints, ensuring that the product of values on each edge matches the given GCD and LCM.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        parts = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n        u = int(parts[0])-1  # Convert to 0-based\n        v = int(parts[1])-1\n        g = int(parts[2])\n        l = int(parts[3])\n        edges.append((u, v, g, l))\n    \n    parent = list(range(n))\n    rank = [1] * n\n\n    def find(u):\n        while parent[u] != u:\n            parent[u] = parent[parent[u]]\n            u = parent[u]\n        return u\n\n    def union(u, v, g, l):\n        u_root = find(u)\n        v_root = find(v)\n        if u_root == v_root:\n            # Check if current edge's product is consistent\n            current_product = (parent[u_root][0] * parent[v_root][0])\n            expected_product = g * l\n            if current_product != expected_product:\n                return False\n            return True\n        if rank[u_root] < rank[v_root]:\n            parent[u_root] = v_root\n            a, b = parent[u_root], parent[v_root]\n        else:\n            parent[v_root] = u_root\n            a, b = parent[v_root], parent[u_root]\n            if rank[u_root] == rank[v_root]:\n                rank[u_root] += 1\n        # Now, a and b are the roots of their respective sets\n        # The product of a and b should be g*l\n        # But since they are in different sets, we have to merge them with the product constraint\n        # So the product of a and b is g*l, but also a*b = product before merging\n        # Wait, maybe I'm mixing something here.

Maybe another approach is needed.\n        # Another idea: For each node, we can keep track of the product of its value relative to the root. So, when we have an edge u-v with g and l, the product of u's value and v's value must be g*l.\n        # So when merging two trees, we can calculate what the root's value should be and update accordingly.\n        # Let me think of it this way: When merging u_root and v_root, the product of their values must be g*l. So, if u_root has value a and v_root has value b, then a * b = g * l.\n        # So when we link one to the other, say make v_root a child of u_root, then the value of v_root becomes (g * l) / a.

Now, we need to set the value of the child root such that a * (child's value) = expected\n        # Wait, no. The product of a and b is expected, which is g*l. So, when we link one to the other, we need to set the child's value accordingly.\n        # For example, if we make v_root a child of u_root, then v_root's value is (expected) / a.\n        # So, let's proceed to do that.\n        # First, decide which tree to attach to which based on rank.\n        if rank[u_root] < rank[v_root]:\n            parent[u_root] = v_root\n            # The value of u_root is now (expected) / a\n            # But wait, no. Because a is the value of u_root, and we are making u_root a child of v_root.\n            # Then, the product of a (u_root's value) and the new value of u_root (which was v_root's previous value) must equal expected.\n            # Wait, no. Actually, after the merge, the value of u_root is now part of v_root's tree. So, the relationship is a * b = expected.\n            # So, if we make u_root's parent v_root, then any query to u_root's value would be a function of v_root's value.\n            # Alternatively, perhaps the way to represent this is by keeping track of the product from each node to the root.\n            # Each node has a 'value' which is the product of the values along the path from the node to the root.\n            # So, for node u, value[u] = a, and for node v, value[v] = b.

So, when we have an edge u-v with g and l, the product of u's value and v's value must be g*l.\n        # So when merging two trees, we can calculate what the root's value should be and update accordingly.\n        # Let me think of it this way: When merging u_root and v_root, the product of their values must be g*l. So, if u_root has value a and v_root has value b, then a * b = g * l.\n        # So when we link one to the other, say make v_root a child of u_root, then the value of v_root becomes (g * l) / a. Similarly, if we make u_root a child of v_root, then u_root's value becomes (g * l) / b.\n        # But wait, this is only possible if g * l is divisible by a or b, respectively. Otherwise, it's impossible, and we return False.\n        # So during the union step, we check if a * b equals g * l. If not, it's a contradiction, and we return False.\n        # If it is equal, we proceed to merge the trees, adjusting the value of the child node accordingly.\n        # So the steps are:\n        # 1. Find roots of u and v.\n        # 2. If roots are same, check if a * b == g * l; if not, return False.\n        # 3. Else, merge the smaller tree into the larger one, and adjust the value of the child accordingly.\n        # 4. Return True.\n\n        # Now, compute the product of a and b\n        product = a * b\n        expected = g * l\n        if product != expected:\n            return False\n        # So, we can merge the trees. Now, we need to set the value of the child root such that a * (child's value) = expected\n        # Wait, no. The product of a and b is expected, which is g*l. So, when we link one to the other, we need to set the child's value accordingly.\n        # For example, if we make v_root a child of u_root, then v_root's value is (expected) / a.\n        # So, let's proceed to do that.\n        # First, decide which tree to attach to which based on rank.\n        if rank[u_root] < rank[v_root]:\n            parent[u_root] = v_root\n            # The value of u_root is now (expected) / a\n            # But wait, no. Because a is the value of u_root, and we are making u_root a child of v_root.\n            # Then, the product of a (u_root's value) and the new value of u_root (which was v_root's previous value) must equal expected.\n            # Wait, no. Actually, after the merge, the value of u_root is now part of v_root's tree. So, the relationship is a * b = expected.\n            # So, if we make u_root's parent v_root, then any query to u_root's value would be a function of v_root's value.\n            # Alternatively, perhaps the way to represent this is by keeping track of the product from each node to the root.\n            # Each node has a 'value' which is the product of the values along the path from the node to the root.\n            # So, for node u, value[u] = a, and for node v, value[v] = b. Then, when we merge u and v, we have a * b = g * l.\n            # So, during the union, we can express the relationship between the two trees.\n            # Thus, if u_root is attached to v_root, then the value of u_root becomes (g * l) / b.\n            # Similarly, if v_root is attached to u_root, the value of v_root becomes (g * l) / a.\n            # So, let's implement this.\n\n            # So, when attaching u_root to v_root, u_root's value is (g * l) / b.\n            # Because a * b = g * l → a = (g*l)/b.\n\n            # So, we set the value of u_root as (g * l) // b.\n            # But we have to make sure that this division is exact, else it's impossible.\n\n            # So, check if (g * l) is divisible by b.\n            if (g * l) % b != 0:\n                return False\n            # Update the value of u_root to be (g * l) // b\n            # But since u_root is now part of v_root's tree, we need to store this value in the data structure.\n            # So, we can keep a dictionary called 'value' where value[u] represents the product from u to the root.\n            # Initialize the value dictionary if necessary.\n\n            # So, let's initialize the value dictionary.\n            if 'value' not in locals():\n                value = [1] * n\n            # Now, set the value of u_root to (g*l)//b\n            value[u_root] = (g * l) // b\n            return True\n        else:\n            # Attach v_root to u_root\n            parent[v_root] = u_root\n            # The value of v_root is (g*l) / a\n            if (g * l) % a != 0:\n                return False\n            value[v_root] = (g * l) // a\n            return True\n\n    # Now, process all edges\n    possible = True\n    value = [1] * n\n    for u, v, g, l in edges:\n        if not union(u, v, g, l):\n            possible = False\n            break\n\n    if not possible:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Now, assign the values\n    # Since it's possible, assign the values in BFS order, ensuring consistency\n    visited = [False] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            queue = [i]\n            visited[i] = True\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.pop(0)\n                # For each neighbor v of u, check the edge\n                for edge in edges:\n                    if edge[0] == u or edge[1] == u:\n                        v = edge[0] if edge[1] == u else edge[1]\n                        g = edge[2]\n                        l = edge[3]\n                        # Check if u and v have the correct product\n                        if value[u] * value[v] != g * l:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n                for edge in edges:\n                    if edge[0] == u or edge[1] == u:\n                        v = edge[0] if edge[1] == u else edge[1]\n                        g = edge[2]\n                        l = edge[3]\n                        if value[u] * value[v] != g * l:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n                if not possible:\n                    break\n                # Assign values to children\n                for edge in edges:\n                    if edge[0] == u:\n                        v = edge[1]\n                        if not visited[v]:\n                            visited[v] = True\n                            queue.append(v)\n                            # Set value[v] based on u and the edge's g and l\n                            # Since u's value is known, v's value should be (g * l) / u's value\n                            # But wait, from the union step, we have already set this.\n                            # So perhaps we don't need to do this here.\n                            # Or maybe the value[v] is already set correctly via the union steps.\n                            # So perhaps this is redundant.\n\n    # After processing, if possible, output the values\n    if possible:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(' '.join(map(str, value)))\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
