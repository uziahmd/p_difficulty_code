    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible substring, I need to check if it appears more than once, and keep track of the maximum length where this happens.\n\nFirst, I think about how to approach this. One way is to generate all possible substrings of the string, then for each possible length, starting from the largest possible, check if any substring of that length occurs at least twice.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we start checking from the largest possible lengths, the first time we find a substring that meets the condition, that's our answer. It's efficient because we don't need to check smaller lengths once we find the maximum.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible down to 1.\n2. For each length L, generate all substrings of length L.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears at least twice in the string.\n4. If such a substring exists, return L as the answer.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nThe string can be up to 100 characters long. So the maximum possible substring length is 99 (since a substring needs to appear at least twice, but wait, no, the substring can be of length 1 and appear twice, but maybe longer ones are better).\n\nWait, for example, the string 'aaaaa' has a substring 'aaa' that appears multiple times. So the approach should correctly find the maximum possible.\n\nSo, for each possible L starting from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n- Generate all substrings of length L.\n- For each substring, check if it appears again somewhere else in the string.\n\nBut how to efficiently check for duplicates? One way is to use a set, and for each substring of length L, add it to the set as we go. If we encounter a substring that's already in the set, we can immediately return L as the answer.\n\nWait, but that would only catch the first occurrence. Wait, no: as we iterate through each position, adding the substring to the set. If any substring is found again later, then we know there's a duplicate. So yes, using a set would work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n    create an empty set\n    for i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n        current_sub = s[i:i+L]\n        if current_sub is in the set:\n            return L\n        else:\n            add current_sub to the set\n    continue\n\nIf after checking all L's down to 1, none found, return 0. But wait, according to the examples, when the string is 'zzz', the output is 2. Wait, 'zzz' is length 3. The substrings of length 2 are 'zz' (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, but for L=2, in 'zzz' the substrings are 'zz' (twice). So the code would find it and return 2.\n\nSo the code should loop L from len(s) down to 1, and for each, check if any substring of length L appears more than once.\n\nWait, but for L= len(s), the only possible substring is the entire string, which can't appear more than once. So the loop will start with L = len(s)-1, perhaps? Or maybe len(s)-1 is the maximum possible substring length that can have two occurrences.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is 'abcde', the maximum possible L where a substring appears at least twice is 4. Because 'abcd' and 'bcde' would be two occurrences. So in that case, L=4 would be correct.\n\nWait, but how? Because the substring 'abcd' appears once, 'bcde' appears once. Are they considered different? Or do they need to be the same substring?\n\nOh right! The same substring must appear at least twice. So for the string 'abcde', the substrings of length 4 are 'abcd' and 'bcde'. They are different, so L=4 doesn't qualify. So the next possible L is 3. Substrings are 'abc', 'bcd', 'cde'. None of them repeat, so L=3 isn't good. Then L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd', 'de'. No duplicates. L=1: 'a','b','c','d','e'—all unique. So the result is 0.\n\nWait, but the sample input includes 'zzz' which returns",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking substrings of decreasing lengths starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we generate all possible substrings and use a set to track which substrings have been seen. If a substring is encountered again, we immediately return the current length as the result since we are checking from the largest possible length downwards.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (length of the string minus 1) down to 1.\n2. For each length, generate all substrings of that length.\n3. Use a set to keep track of the substrings we have seen so far.\n4. For each substring, if it is found in the set, return the current length as the result.\n5. If no duplicates are found for any length, return 0.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the longest substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and avoiding unnecessary checks once a valid substring is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = len(s)\nresult = 0\n\nfor L in range(max_len - 1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Loop Over Lengths**: We loop from the maximum possible substring length down to 1. This ensures that we check the longest possible substrings first.\n- **Substring Generation**: For each length, we generate all possible substrings of that length.\n- **Set for Tracking**: A set is used to keep track of the substrings we have seen so far. If a substring is found in the set, it means it has appeared before, and we print the current length and exit.\n- **Efficiency**: The use of a set allows for O(1) average-time complexity for membership checks, making the solution efficient even for the maximum input size.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the longest substring that appears at least twice in an efficient manner.",
