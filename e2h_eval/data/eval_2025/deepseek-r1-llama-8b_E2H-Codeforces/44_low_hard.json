He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Polycarp solving problems over k days. Each day he must solve a contiguous sequence of problems from his list without skipping any. So, the entire list is divided into exactly k consecutive segments. Each segment corresponds to one day's work.\n\nThe profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that day's segment. The total profit is the sum of these maxima across all days. We need to maximize this total profit.\n\nHmm. So the goal is to split the array into k consecutive parts such that the sum of the maxima of these parts is as large as possible.\n\nWhat's the approach here? Let me think.\n\nI remember that for problems involving splitting arrays into segments and maximizing some function, dynamic programming (DP) often comes into play. So maybe we can model this with DP.\n\nLet's consider DP[i][j] as the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems and dividing them into j segments.\n\nWait, but how do we compute this? For each possible split point, we can look back at previous splits and add the maximum of the current segment.\n\nBut what's the state transition?\n\nFor DP[i][j], we can try to split the first i elements into j segments. To do this, we can choose a point m where the (j-1)th segment ends. Then, the jth segment starts at m+1 and ends at i. The maximum of this jth segment is the maximum value between m+1 and i. So the profit added would be this maximum.\n\nSo, DP[i][j] = max over m < i of (DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]))\n\nBut wait, computing max(a[m+1..i]) for every possible m and i could be expensive if done naively, especially since n can be up to 2000. So we need an efficient way to find the maximums quickly.\n\nMaybe precompute a table of maximums for all ranges. Or for each i, keep track of the maximums as we increase the window from left to right.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i and j, when adding the jth segment, we can track the current maximum as we expand the end of the segment.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Precompute a 2D array max_suffix, where max_suffix[i][j] represents the maximum value from position i to j.\n\nBut no, that's O(n^2), which for n=2000 is manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, maybe for each i, as we process j, we can keep track of the current maximum in the segment being considered. So for each DP[i][j], when trying to extend a segment ending at i, we can compute the max on the fly.\n\nAnother thought: For each position i and j, DP[i][j] can be built by considering all possible m from j-1 to i-1. For each m, the last segment is from m+1 to i, and the max for this segment is the maximum of a[m+1..i]. So, for each m, we need to compute the max quickly.\n\nComputing max(a[m+1..i]) for each m can be done by keeping track of the current maximum as we iterate m from i-1 down to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps during the DP computation, for each i and j, we can loop m from (j-1)-1 to i-1, but that might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, when considering j, we can start from j=1 to j=k, and for each j, determine the best m to split.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to represent DP[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i elements divided into j days.\n\nThen, the recurrence is:\n\nDP[i][j] = max for all possible m (from j-1 to i-1) of (DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1 ... i]))\n\nThis makes sense because the j-th day would consist of the segment starting at m+1 and ending at i.\n\nThe base cases are DP[0][0] = 0, DP[i][1] = max of the first i elements.\n\nBut wait, the initial conditions need to be correct. For example, DP[0][0] is zero because there are zero elements and zero days. For j=1, DP[i][1] is the maximum of the first i elements because all are solved in one day.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a DP table where DP[i][j] will hold the maximum total profit for the first i problems in j days.\n\n- Fill the DP table using the recurrence relation.\n\n- After filling, the answer is DP[n][k].\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this efficiently.\n\nThe issue is that for each i and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over a given number of days. Each day, Polycarp must solve a contiguous sequence of problems without skipping any, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently compute the maximum total profit. The key idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and use the results from these subproblems to build up the solution.\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum total profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems over `j` days.\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - `dp[0][0] = 0`: No problems solved, no days taken, so profit is zero.\n   - `dp[i][1] = max(a[0..i-1])`: If all problems are solved in one day, the profit is the maximum difficulty in the first `i` problems.\n3. **State Transition**: For each `dp[i][j]`, consider all possible previous split points `m` where the last segment starts at `m+1` and ends at `i`. The profit added by this segment is the maximum difficulty in this segment. Thus, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum value of `dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])` for all valid `m`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\nmax_dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n# Base case: dp[i][1] is the max of the first i elements\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    current_max = 0\n    for j in range(i):\n        current_max = max(current_max, a[j])\n    dp[i][1] = current_max\n\n# Fill dp[i][j] for j >= 2\nfor j in range(2, k + 1):\n    for i in range(j, n + 1):\n        # We need to split into j segments, the last of which ends at i\n        # So the last segment starts at some m+1, where m < i\n        max_val = 0\n        best = 0\n        for m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n            if m < j-1:\n                current_max = max(a[m+1:i])\n                total = dp[m][j-1] + current_max\n                if total > best:\n                    best = total\n                    max_val = current_max\n        dp[i][j] = best\n\n# Now reconstruct the segments\nsegments = [0] * k\ncurrent = n\nday = k\nwhile day > 0 and current > 0:\n    start = segments[day-1] + 1 if day > 1 else 0\n    end = current\n    max_in_segment = max(a[start:end])\n    segments[day-1] = end\n    current = start\n    day -= 1\n\nprint(dp[n][k])\nprint(' '.join(map(str, segments)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The DP table is initialized to store the maximum profit values for different splits of the problem list.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: For each possible number of days starting from 1, the maximum difficulty of the first `i` problems is computed and stored.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible number of days, the maximum profit is computed by considering all possible previous split points and updating the DP table accordingly.\n4. **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, the optimal segments for each day are reconstructed to determine the exact distribution of problems across the days.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible total profit using dynamic programming, handling up to the maximum constraints effectively.",
