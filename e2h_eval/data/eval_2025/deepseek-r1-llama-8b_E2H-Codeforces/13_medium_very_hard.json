For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given triad (a set of three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The definition of major and minor chords is based on the distances between the notes in a certain order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. These are arranged cyclically, meaning after H comes C again. The distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. So, each step from one note to the next adds a semitone.\n\nA major triad has three notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and from Y to Z is 3 semitones. So the total is 7 semitones from X to Z. A minor triad is the opposite: X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4, totaling 7 semitones.\n\nBut wait, the order matters here. So for a given set of three notes, we need to consider all possible orderings (permutations) of these notes and see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nThe input is three notes as a single string separated by spaces. So, first, I'll split them into a list of three elements.\n\nThen, for each possible permutation of these three notes, calculate the distances between consecutive notes in the order. For each permutation, check if the distances are either 4 and 3 (major) or 3 and 4 (minor). If any permutation meets the major condition, then the chord is major. Similarly for minor.\n\nWait, but the same note can appear multiple times? No, because a triad consists of exactly three distinct notes. Wait, no—the problem says \"unordered set of no less than three notes.\" Oh, right, but in this problem, it's exactly three notes. So the input will have three distinct notes.\n\nSo each permutation will arrange the three notes in some order, and for each order, compute the distances between consecutive notes.\n\nNow, the key is to represent each note with its position in the scale, so that calculating the distance becomes straightforward.\n\nLet me assign each note a number from 0 to 11, where 0 is C, 1 is C#, up to 11 being H. Then, the distance from note A to note B is calculated as (B - A) mod 12, but since we're moving forward, the distance from A to B is (B - A) semitones. But since the scale is cyclic, the distance from A to B can be calculated as (B - A) % 12. Because each step is a semitone.\n\nWait, for example, from C (0) to E (4): 4 semitones. From E (4) to G (7): 3 semitones. So the sum is 7, which is 4 +3 =7.\n\nAnother example: the notes are ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nLet's get their positions:\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nWait, let's list all the notes with their index:\n\nC: 0\nC#:1\nD:2\nD#:3\nE:4\nF:5\nF#:6\nG:7\nG#:8\nA:9\nB:10\nH:11\n\nSo C# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nIf we order them as B, C#, F: 10, 1, 5.\n\nCalculate the distance from B to C#: (1 -10) mod 12 → that's negative, but mod 12 gives us 1-10= -9 mod12= 3. So yes, 3 semitones. Then from C# to F: 5-1=4 semitones. So that's 3 and 4, making a minor triad.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Create a mapping from note names to their respective indices (0-11).\n\n2. Take the three input notes, convert them into their indices.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of these three indices.\n\n4. For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes.\n\n5. Check if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\n6. Once a permutation satisfies major, return 'major'. If any permutation satisfies minor, return 'minor'. Else, 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, how many permutations are there for three elements? It's 3! =6. So for each input, I have to check 6 possible orderings.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index dictionary.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, read the input line, split into three parts.\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\nnotes = [note_to_index[n] for n in input_notes]\n\nNow, generate all permutations of the notes.\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    # check if this permutation is major or minor.\n\nFor each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes.\n\nd1 = perm[1] - perm[0]\nd2 = perm[2] - perm[1]\n\nBut wait, since the order is circular, but in our case, we are considering the distance from lower to higher. So for the permutation, the order must be such that each note comes after the previous in the cycle.\n\nWait, no—because the permutation is just an ordering of the three notes, which could be in any order. So for example, a permutation could have the third note as lower than the second, which would wrap around the cycle.\n\nBut in that case, the distance calculation should account for the cyclic nature.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in the problem statement, the distance is measured as the forward direction. So for example, the distance from H to C is 1 semitone (since H is 11, C is 0: 0-11 = -11, but mod 12 is 1. Wait, but the problem says the distance is taken from the lower tone to the upper tone. So the distance between two notes is (y -x) mod 12. So for x=11, y=0, the distance is 1.\n\nYes, because from H (11) to C (0) is one semitone.\n\nSo, for any two notes, the distance is (y - x) mod 12.\n\nWait, let's test that.\n\nExample 1: C (0) to E (4): 4-0=4 mod12=4 → correct.\n\nE (4) to C (0): (0-4) mod12=8 → which is correct as per the problem description.\n\nSo, the distance function is (y - x) mod 12.\n\nSo, for a permutation (A, B, C), the distances are (B - A) mod 12 and (C - B) mod 12.\n\nSo in the code, for each permutation, compute d1 = (perm[1] - perm[0]) % 12, d2 = (perm[2] - perm[1]) % 12.\n\nIf d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nIf d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf either of these conditions is met, then the chord is major or minor.\n\nBut wait, what about other possibilities? Like, for a permutation, the sum of d1 and d2 could be 7, but the individual d's might not fit the major or minor pattern.\n\nFor example, d1 is 5, d2 is 2: sum is 7, but neither major nor minor.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we need to compute d1 and d2 and check if they are 4 and 3 or 3 and4.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each permutation of the three notes:\n   - Compute d1 = (next note - current note) mod 12\n   - Compute d2 = (next next note - next note) mod 12\n   - If d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → major\n   - elif d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor\n- Once any permutation satisfies, we can decide.\n\nWe can process permutations in order, and as soon as a major is found, return 'major', else continue. Same for minor.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nnotes = [note_to_index[n] for n in input().split()]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = (b - a) % 12\n    d2 = (c - b) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        found_major = True\n        break\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n        break\n\nif found_major and found_minor:\n    # According to the problem, this can't happen.\n    # So no need to handle.\nelif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. So there can't be a case where a chord is both major and minor. So the code can safely assume that.\n\nWait, but what if for a permutation, it's major, and another permutation is minor? Then the chord is both? But the problem says it's impossible. So the code can process all permutations until it finds one that fits, and if any of them fit, output accordingly.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem states that the answer will be unambiguous, so it's impossible for a chord to satisfy both major and minor conditions. So, the code can process each permutation, and once any major is found, output 'major' immediately. Otherwise, if any minor is found, output 'minor'. Else, 'strange'.\n\nBut in the code above, I'm looping through all permutations, and for each, checking if it's major or minor. So perhaps I should find all possible and see if any major exists, else see if any minor exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check each permutation and set flags accordingly, but only output based on whether any permutation leads to major or minor.\n\nWait, for example, if any permutation is major, then the chord is major. Because the notes are unordered, but in the problem statement, the order is considered for the chord. So even if a chord can be arranged into a major or minor, but according to the problem statement, this can't happen.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\nSo, the code can process all permutations, and if any permutation is major, output 'major'; else, if any permutation is minor, output 'minor'; else, 'strange'.\n\nBut in code, I can't just break early. Because maybe one permutation is minor, but another is major. But according to the problem, that's impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should check all permutations, and collect whether any is major or minor.\n\nWait, but that's inefficient, but since it's only 6 permutations, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for efficiency, process each permutation in order, and as soon as a major is found, output 'major' and exit. Else, after all permutations, check if any is minor, output accordingly.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nConvert to their indices.\n\nGenerate all 6 permutations.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   compute d1 and d2.\n\n   if d1 is 4 and d2 is3: mark as major, break and output.\n\nIf no major found after all permutations:\n\n   for each permutation:\n\n      compute d1 and d2.\n\n      if d1 is3 and d2 is4: mark as minor, break and output.\n\nIf no minor found after all permutations:\n\n   output 'strange'.\n\nThis way, the code handles cases where a chord may have more than one permutation satisfying the condition, but according to the problem statement, this won't happen.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nnotes = [note_to_index[n] for n in input().split()]\n\nmajor_found = False\nminor_found = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = (b - a) % 12\n    d2 = (c - b) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        major_found = True\n        break\n\nif major_found:\n    print(\"major\")\n    exit()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = (b - a) % 12\n    d2 = (c - b) % 12\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        minor_found = True\n        break\n\nif minor_found:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but this approach runs through all permutations twice. Maybe it's better to do it in a single loop.\n\nAlternatively, in a single loop, for each permutation, check for major first, then minor.\n\nSo:\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = (b -a) %12\n    d2 = (c -b) %12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but this approach would stop at the first permutation that satisfies either condition, which is correct.\n\nBecause the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so the first permutation that fits will determine the result, and there's no case where two different permutations fit both major and minor.\n\nWait, no. Suppose that a permutation satisfies major, and another permutation satisfies minor. According to the problem statement, this is impossible. So the code can safely process each permutation in order and return the first match.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if a permutation is major and another is minor, but according to the problem statement, this can't happen. So the code can process each permutation, and for each, check if it's major or minor. If any is major, output 'major' and exit. Else, if any is minor, output 'minor' and exit. Else, after all permutations, output 'strange'.\n\nWait, but in code, processing all permutations, and for each, check if it's major, then minor. So the code could be written as:\n\nfound = False\nresult = 'strange'\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = (b - a) %12\n    d2 = (c - b) %12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        result = 'major'\n        found = True\n        break\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        result = 'minor'\n        found = True\n        break\n\nif found:\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print('strange')\n\nThis way, it processes each permutation in turn. As soon as a permutation is found to be major, it sets result to 'major' and breaks, ignoring further permutations. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut wait, what if a permutation is major, but later another permutation is minor? Since the problem says this can't happen, the code can proceed as is.\n\nTesting this logic with examples.\n\nExample 1: Input is C E G.\n\nNotes: C (0), E (4), G(7).\n\nPermutations include (0,4,7): d1=4, d2=3 → major. So code returns 'major'.\n\nAnother permutation, like (4,0,7): d1=(0-4)= -4 mod12=8, which is not 4 or 3. So doesn't affect.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 'major'.\n\nAnother example: C# B F → which is minor.\n\nNotes: C# is1, B is10, F is5.\n\nIn permutation (10,1,5): d1= (1-10) mod12= (1-10)= -9 mod12= 3. d2=5-1=4. So 3 and4 → minor.\n\nSo the code will detect this and output 'minor'.\n\nThird example: A B H.\n\nNotes: A is9, B is10, H is11.\n\nPossible permutations:\n\nCheck (9,10,11): d1=1, d2=1 → no.\n\n(9,11,10): d1= (11-9)=2, d2= (10-11)= -1 mod12=11 → no.\n\n(10,9,11): d1= (9-10)= -1 mod12=11 → no.\n\n(10,11,9): d1=1, d2= (9-11)= -2 mod12=10 → no.\n\n(11,9,10): d1= (9-11)= -2 mod12=10 → no.\n\n(11,10,9): d1= (10-11)= -1 mod12=11 → no.\n\nSo no permutation satisfies major or minor. So output is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: What about a chord that is major in one permutation and minor in another?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, this can't happen. So the code can proceed without worrying about it.\n\nWhat about a chord where one permutation is major and another is minor? But according to the problem, such cases don't exist, so the code can process as is.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All three notes are the same. But the problem says that the input is three notes, but it's unclear if they can be the same. Wait, the problem says 'three notes', but it's not specified whether they are distinct. Wait, the problem says \"an unordered set of no less than three notes\". So in theory, the same note can be repeated. But in practice, a triad requires three distinct notes. So perhaps the input will have three distinct notes. Or perhaps the code should handle cases where some notes are the same.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor.\" So, perhaps the code should also handle cases where two or all three notes are same.\n\nWait, but the definition of a triad is exactly three notes. So if all three are same, then any permutation would have d1=0, d2=0. Which doesn't meet major or minor criteria. So output 'strange'.\n\nSimilarly, if two notes are same, say, C, C, E. Then in permutation (C,C,E), d1=0, d2=4 mod12=4. So d1 is 0, which is not 3 or4. So not a major or minor.\n\nSo the code handles this correctly.\n\nSo, the code as written should work.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index dictionary.\n\nThen read the input, split into three notes.\n\nConvert each note to its index.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nFor each permutation, compute d1 and d2.\n\nCheck if any permutation is major or minor.\n\nSet the result accordingly.\n\nPrint the result.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\nnote_indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nresult = 'strange'\n\nfor perm in permutations(note_indices):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = (b - a) % 12\n    d2 = (c - b) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        result = 'major'\n        break\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        result = 'minor'\n        break\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, no. Because in this code, for each permutation, it checks if it's major or minor. As soon as any permutation is found to be major, the code sets result to 'major' and breaks, and same for minor. But the problem says that the answer is unique, so the first permutation that meets the condition determines the result.\n\nBut wait, what if the first permutation is minor, but another permutation is major? According to the problem statement, this can't happen. So the code is safe.\n\nWait, but the code is checking all permutations in order, and for each, if it's major, it breaks and returns. So, for example, if the first permutation is major, it returns 'major' immediately. If not, the code proceeds to check the next permutation. But if a later permutation is minor, it will overwrite the 'strange' result.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code as written, it's setting result to 'strange' initially. Then, for each permutation, if any permutation is major, it sets result to 'major' and breaks. If not, it continues to check for minor.\n\nWait, no. Because the code is inside a loop that iterates over all permutations. For each permutation, it checks if it's major. If so, sets result to 'major' and breaks. Else, if it's minor, sets result to 'minor' and breaks.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the code:\n\nInitially, result is 'strange'.\n\nLoop over all permutations:\n\nfor perm in permutations(note_indices):\n\n   a, b, c = perm\n\n   compute d1 and d2.\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       result = 'major'\n\n       break\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       result = 'minor'\n\n       break\n\nSo, as soon as a permutation is found to be major, result is set to 'major' and loop breaks. So further permutations are not checked.\n\nSimilarly for minor.\n\nSo, in the code, the first permutation that satisfies either condition will cause the code to exit.\n\nBut this is incorrect because perhaps a later permutation would satisfy a condition, but according to the problem statement, such cases don't exist.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that the answer is unique. So, if a permutation is found to be major, then the chord must be major. Similarly for minor.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nWait, but let's think: suppose that in the first permutation, d1 is 3 and d2 is4. So minor is detected, and the code outputs 'minor' and exits. But another permutation may be major. But according to the problem statement, this can't happen.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nProcessing each line:\n\nFirst line: 'C E G' → notes are C (0), E (4), G (7).\n\nPermutation (0,4,7):\n\nd1=4, d2=3 → major. So code outputs 'major' and stops.\n\nSecond line: 'C# B F' → 1,10,5.\n\nLooking for a permutation that satisfies either condition.\n\nOne permutation is 10,1,5: d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nSo code will find this and output 'minor'.\n\nThird line: 'A B H' → 9,10,11.\n\nNo permutation satisfies the conditions, so code outputs 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: ['E G C'].\n\nE is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nPermutation (4,7,0):\n\nd1=3, d2= (0-7) mod12=5 → no.\n\nOther permutations: (4,0,7) → d1= (0-4) mod12=8 → no.\n\n(7,4,0) → d1= (4-7) mod12= 9 → no.\n\n(7,0,4) → d1= (0-7) mod12=5 → no.\n\n(0,4,7): d1=4, d2=3 → major. So code outputs 'major'.\n\nAnother test case: ['B D F'].\n\nB is10, D is2, F is5.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nOne permutation: 10,2,5.\n\nd1= (2-10) mod12= (2-10)= -8 mod12=4. d2= (5-2)=3.\n\nSo d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSo code outputs 'major'.\n\nWait, but let me verify.\n\nWait, the triad is B, D, F.\n\nB is 10, D is 2, F is5.\n\nIn the permutation B, D, F: 10,2,5.\n\nd1 = 2-10 = -8 mod12=4.\n\nd2=5-2=3.\n\nSo yes, major.\n\nSo code correctly outputs 'major'.\n\nAnother test case: ['E G C']: as before.\n\nAnother test case: ['A C E'].\n\nA is9, C is0, E is4.\n\nPermutation A, C, E: 9,0,4.\n\nd1= (0-9) mod12=3 → d1=3.\n\nd2=4-0=4 → d2=4.\n\nSo 3 and4 → minor.\n\nSo code would output 'minor'.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nAnother edge case: all same notes.\n\nInput: ['C C C'] → all three are C (0).\n\nEach permutation: 0,0,0.\n\nd1=0, d2=0 → no.\n\nSo output is 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: two same notes and one different.\n\nInput: ['C C E'].\n\nE is4.\n\nIn permutation (0,0,4):\n\nd1=0, d2=4 → no.\n\nIn permutation (0,4,0):\n\nd1=4, d2= (0-4) mod12=8 → no.\n\nIn permutation (4,0,0):\n\nd1= (0-4) mod12=8 → no.\n\nSo no major or minor.\n\nOutput 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code handles all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nWait, but in the initial code, the code is written as:\n\nresult = 'strange'\n\nfor perm in permutations(...):\n\n   if ...:\n\n       result = ...\n\n       break\n\nSo, for the first permutation that satisfies major or minor, it sets result and breaks.\n\nBut in the problem statement, this is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The problem is based on the cyclic nature of musical notes and their distances in semitones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Each note is assigned a numerical value based on its position in the musical scale. This allows us to calculate distances between notes easily.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated as the difference modulo 12, considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Triad Definition**: A major triad has consecutive distances of 4 and 3 semitones, while a minor triad has consecutive distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n4. **Permutation Check**: We generate all permutations of the three notes and check each permutation to see if it fits the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\nnote_indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nresult = 'strange'\n\nfor perm in permutations(note_indices):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = (b - a) % 12\n    d2 = (c - b) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        result = 'major'\n        break\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        result = 'minor'\n        break\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Conversion**: Convert each input note into its corresponding index using a predefined dictionary.\n2. **Permutation Generation**: Generate all possible permutations of the three notes to check each ordering.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes.\n4. **Triad Check**: Check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If a permutation matches, set the result accordingly and exit the loop.\n5. **Result Output**: Print the result based on the checks performed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the type of triad by leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes.",
