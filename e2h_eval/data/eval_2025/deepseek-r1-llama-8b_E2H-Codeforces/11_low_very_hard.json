A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some resources, and we need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given the available resources.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nWe are given the following variables:\n- n: number of friends.\n- k: number of bottles of soft drink.\n- l: milliliters per bottle.\n- c: number of limes.\n- d: slices per lime.\n- p: grams of salt.\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend.\n- np: grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n\nEach toast requires:\n- Each friend needs nl ml of drink.\n- One slice of lime.\n- np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, all friends together require n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt.\n\nHmm, right. Because each friend makes one toast, so each needs their own slice and portion.\n\nSo the total resources needed for t toasts would be:\n\nDrink: t * n * nl\nLime: t * n (since each toast uses one slice per friend)\nSalt: t * n * np\n\nBut let's calculate the maximum possible t based on each resource and then take the minimum.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of each resource available.\n\nTotal drink = k * l\nTotal limes available: c * d slices.\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\n2. For each resource, determine how many toasts they can support.\n\nFor drink: max_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\nBecause each toast requires n * nl ml.\n\nFor limes: each toast needs n slices. So max_toasts_limes = (c * d) // n\n\nFor salt: each toast requires n * np grams. So max_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThe actual maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three values.\n\nThen, each friend can make that many toasts.\n\nWait, wait. No, because if the maximum is t, then each friend can make t toasts. Because each toast is per friend.\n\nYes. So the answer is t divided by 1? No, wait, no. Because t is the total number of toasts that can be made across all friends. Since each friend makes t toasts, but each toast is per friend. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms.\n\nWait, each toast is a round where each friend makes one toast. So for t rounds, each friend makes t toasts.\n\nSo the number of toasts each friend can make is t.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the note in the problem statement.\n\nIn the example, the input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nk=4 bottles, each 5ml. Total drink: 20ml.\n\nEach toast per friend needs 3ml (nl=3). So for each toast round, each friend uses 3ml, so total per round is 3*3=9ml. But wait, the problem says that each friend needs nl per toast. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl. So for all friends, total drink used is t * n * nl.\n\nWait, the note says: 20ml is enough for 20 /3=6 toasts. But why? Because each toast requires 3ml per friend. So for 6 toasts, each friend has 6 *3=18ml, which is 3ml *6=18ml total. Wait, no: 3 friends, each making 6 toasts. So each toast is per friend, so 3 *6=18ml total.\n\nSo 20ml allows for 6 toasts in total.\n\nAh, right. So the drink allows t_drink = (total_drink) // (n * nl).\n\nSimilarly, limes: each toast needs one slice per friend, so per toast, n slices. So total slices needed for t toasts is t * n. So the maximum t for limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: each toast needs np grams per friend, so per toast, n * np grams. So maximum t_salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe overall maximum t is the minimum of t_drink, t_limes, t_salt.\n\nThen, each friend can make t toasts.\n\nWait, yes. So the answer is t.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCalculate the maximum possible t based on each resource, and the answer is the minimum of those.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\nRead the input as a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of each resource available:\n   - Total drink: The product of the number of bottles and milliliters per bottle.\n   - Total lime slices: The product of the number of limes and slices per lime.\n   - Total salt: Given directly as input.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Limits**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: The maximum number of toasts that can be made based on the drink. This is calculated by dividing the total drink by the product of the number of friends and the drink needed per toast per friend.\n   - **Lime Limit**: The maximum number of toasts that can be made based on lime slices. This is calculated by dividing the total lime slices by the number of friends (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt Limit**: The maximum number of toasts that can be made based on salt availability. This is calculated by dividing the total salt by the product of the number of friends and the salt needed per toast per friend.\n\n3. **Compute Maximum Toasts**: The actual maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the three computed limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_limes = c * d\ntoasts_limes = total_limes // n\n\ntoasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_limes, toasts_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: Compute the total available resources for drink, lime slices, and salt.\n- **Resource Limits Calculation**: Calculate how many toasts each resource can support based on the required per toast consumption per friend.\n- **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum value among the three resource limits gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all friends have the same number of toasts.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by breaking down the problem into manageable steps and using integer division to handle resource constraints.",
