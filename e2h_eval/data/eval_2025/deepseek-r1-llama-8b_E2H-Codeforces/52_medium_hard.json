Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But he's smart because he can take 'b' of these burnt candles and make a new one. And the question is, how many hours in total can he keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, let me think about the example they gave. The first sample input is 4 and 2. So he starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burnt ones. Since b is 2, he can make 4/2 = 2 new candles. He burns those, adding 2 more hours. Now he has 2 burnt candles again. He makes another 1 (because 2 /2 is 1), which gives another hour. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 =7.\n\nAnother example is 6 and 3. So initial burn:6 hours. Now 6 burnt, divided by 3 gives 2. So 2 more hours. After burning, 2 burnt. But 2 <3, so he can't make more. Total is 6+2=8.\n\nSo the approach is: every time after burning some candles, collect the remains, see how many new candles can be made, add that to the total, and repeat until you can't make any more.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Start with 'a' candles.\n2. Burn them all, add 'a' hours.\n3. Collect 'a' burnt candles.\n4. While the number of burnt candles is >=b:\n   a. Divide by b to get new_candles.\n   b. Add new_candles to the total.\n   c. The new burnt candles are new_candles (since each new candle burns for 1 hour and becomes one burnt).\n5. Repeat until no more can be made.\n\nWait, but wait. Because each time you create new candles, they are added to the total and their burnt versions are collected again.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\ntotal = a\nremnants = a\n\nwhile remnants >= b:\n    new = remnants // b\n    total += new\n    remnants = new  # because each new candle will burn and become one remnant\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nLet's test this logic with the examples.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal =4, remnants=4.\n\nLoop:\n4 >=2 → new=2, total=6. remnants=2.\n\nNext loop: 2 >=2 → new=1, total=7. remnants=1. Now 1<2 → stop. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, remnants=6.\n\n6>=3 → new=2, total=8. remnants=2. Now 2<3. Stop. Correct.\n\nWhat about a case where after making new candles, you can make more than once? Like a=10, b=3.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nInitial: total=10, remnants=10.\n\n10//3=3 → total=13, remnants=3.\n\n3//3=1 → total=14, remnants=1. Now stop. So total is 14.\n\nYes, because 10 +3 +1=14.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5.\n\nBurn 5, add 5. Make 1 from 5, add 1. Now remnants=1. Can't make more. So total is 6.\n\nWait, wait: 5 → burn, 5 hours. Then make 1, burn, 1 more. So 6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code needs to implement this loop.\n\nNow, in Python, how do we read the input? The input is two integers a and b on a single line.\n\nWe can read using input().split() and convert to integers.\n\nThen apply the algorithm.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute the initial total as a, and remnants as a.\n\nThen loop while remnants >=b:\n\n   new = remnants // b\n\n   total += new\n\n   remnants = new\n\nOnce the loop ends, print total.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase when a <b: then, no new candles can be made. So output is a.\n\nLike a=3, b=5: output 3.\n\nAnother case: a=0? But according to the constraints, a is at least 1.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nRead a and b:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nInitialize total = a, remnants = a.\n\nThen the loop:\n\nwhile remnants >= b:\n    new = remnants // b\n    total += new\n    remnants = new\n\nPrint(total)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nSample Input 1: 4 2 → 7.\n\nSample Input 2:6 3 →8.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=1000 → output 1.\n\nAnother case: a=1000, b=2.\n\nInitially total=1000, remnants=1000.\n\nnew =500, total=1500, remnants=500.\n\nnew=250, total=1750, remnants=250.\n\nnew=125, total=1875, remnants=125.\n\nnew=62, total=1937, remnants=62.\n\nnew=31, total=1968, remnants=31.\n\nnew=15, total=1983, remnants=15.\n\nnew=7, total=1990, remnants=7.\n\nnew=3, total=1993, remnants=3.\n\nnew=1, total=1994, remnants=1.\n\nNo more. So output 1994.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can reuse burnt candles to make new ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`. Each candle burns for one hour, so the initial number of hours the room can be lit is `a`.\n2. **Recycling Burnt Candles**: After burning all initial candles, collect the burnt ones. For every `b` burnt candles, Vasily can make a new candle. This process continues until the number of burnt candles is less than `b`.\n3. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Continuously convert burnt candles into new ones and add the resulting hours to the total. Update the count of burnt candles each time to reflect the newly burnt ones from the newly made candles.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop stops when the number of burnt candles is insufficient to make a new candle.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total hours by repeatedly converting burnt candles into new ones until no more conversions are possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nremnants = a\n\nwhile remnants >= b:\n    new = remnants // b\n    total += new\n    remnants = new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of burnt candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initial Hours Calculation**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n3. **Recycling Process**: Using a loop, the code repeatedly converts burnt candles into new ones. Each iteration calculates how many new candles can be made, adds the corresponding hours to the total, and updates the count of burnt candles.\n4. **Loop Termination**: The loop terminates when the number of burnt candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
