There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house contributes a squared value of its height to the total profit. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\nHmm. The input gives n spots, each can have a height between 0 and h. For each spot, if it's set to a, we gain a². The restrictions are that in each range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be <= x_i.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It feels like a problem where for each spot, I choose a height, but the constraints are that within any of the m ranges, the maximum is at most x_i. Also, each spot can't exceed h, but that's already covered by the x_i since x_i can be up to h.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem statement says the first line has h as the maximum height, and the restrictions' x_i are also up to h. So, each spot's height is automatically bounded by h, but the restrictions can further lower this for certain ranges.\n\nSo, the main task is to assign to each spot a height a_i such that:\n\n1. For every restriction i, max(a_l ... a_r) <= x_i.\n2. Each a_i is between 0 and h (but maybe the restrictions will enforce a stricter upper bound).\n\nAnd we need to maximize the sum of squares of a_i.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as an integer programming problem, but given the small constraints (n and m up to 50), perhaps a dynamic programming approach or some other method would work.\n\nBut wait, considering that n is up to 50, trying all possible combinations is impossible because each spot can have up to h+1 values, which could be up to 51. So 50^50 is way too big.\n\nAlternative approach: model the problem as a graph where each state represents the current position and the maximum allowed height for certain intervals. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where each spot's height is subject to certain constraints based on the overlapping ranges. Each restriction affects a range [l_i, r_i], requiring that all spots in that range have a_i <= x_i. But wait, no: the restriction is that the maximum in that range is <= x_i. So, all a_i in the range must be <= x_i, because the maximum can't exceed x_i. So, each spot in [l_i, r_i] must be at most x_i.\n\nWait, no! Wait, the problem says that the tallest house in the range must be at most x_i. So, for each spot in that range, a_i can be anything up to x_i, but at least one of them must be exactly x_i, right? Or no: the maximum is <= x_i, so each spot in the range can be up to x_i. Because even if none are x_i, the maximum is the highest one, which could be less than x_i. So, the constraints are that for each spot in [l_i, r_i], a_i <= x_i.\n\nAh, right. So, each restriction adds a constraint that for every spot in l_i to r_i, the a_i must be <= x_i.\n\nAdditionally, for each spot, a_i must be >=0 and <=h.\n\nWait, no: the problem says each house can have a height between 0 and h. So, 0 <= a_i <=h for each i.\n\nSo, putting it together, the constraints are:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\na_i <= x_j for all j where l_j <= i <= r_j\na_i <= h\na_i >= 0\n\nAnd the goal is to maximize the sum of a_i squared.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a_i for each spot, such that a_i is <= min over all x_j where the spot is in the restriction j's range, and <= h, and then maximize the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but what if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions? Like, suppose two restrictions both cover spot i. Then a_i must be <= the minimum of all x_j for those j that include i in their range, as well as <= h.\n\nYes. So, for each spot i, the maximum possible a_i is the minimum of x_j for all j where l_j <=i <=r_j, and h. But wait, because if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, the a_i must be <= all x_j for those j's. So the maximum a_i can be is the minimum of all x_j in the restrictions that include i, and h.\n\nWait, but some spots may not be covered by any restriction. For example, in the second sample input, the first spot is not covered by any restriction. So, its a_1 can be up to h, which is 10.\n\nSo, for each spot i, the maximum allowed a_i is the minimum between h and all x_j where i is in [l_j, r_j]. Because if any of the x_j's for restrictions covering i is less than h, then a_i can't exceed that.\n\nSo, the first step is to compute, for each spot i, the maximum possible a_i, which is min(h, min{x_j | l_j <=i <=r_j}).\n\nWait, but in the second sample, the first spot is not covered by any restriction, so the min is h, which is 10.\n\nSo, for each spot i, let's compute the upper bound u_i as follows:\n\nu_i = h\n\nFor each restriction j, if l_j <=i <= r_j, then u_i = min(u_i, x_j)\n\nSo, after processing all restrictions, u_i is the maximum allowed a_i for spot i.\n\nNow, the problem becomes choosing a_i <= u_i for each spot, with a_i >=0, to maximize sum(a_i²).\n\nThis is a classic optimization problem. Because the sum of squares is maximized when each a_i is as large as possible, given the constraints.\n\nBecause for each a_i, increasing it increases a_i², provided that the next increase doesn't violate any constraints.\n\nWait, but the constraints are on the maximum per spot. So, each a_i can be set to its maximum possible u_i, and the sum of squares will be maximized.\n\nWait, is that correct? Suppose a_i can be at most u_i. Then setting a_i = u_i will give the maximum possible contribution for that spot. Because the function f(a) = a² is increasing for a >=0. So, for each spot, the optimal choice is to set a_i as high as possible, given the constraints.\n\nSo, the solution is to compute u_i for each spot, then set a_i = u_i. Then, the sum of squares is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nBecause the sum of squares is a convex function. Maximizing each variable individually under their constraints should give the global maximum.\n\nLet me think of a simple case. Suppose two variables, a and b, with a <= 3, b <=3. Then the sum a² + b² is maximized when both are 3: 9+9=18. If a is constrained to 2 and b can be 3, then a² is 4, but b is 3, sum is 13, which is less than 18.\n\nAnother example: a can be at most 2, and b can be at most 3. Then a² + b² is 4+9=13, which is better than any other choices.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum sum is achieved when each a_i is as large as possible within their constraints.\n\nSo, the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute u_i, which is the minimum of h and all x_j where i is in [l_j, r_j].\n\n2. Set a_i = u_i for each i.\n\n3. Compute the sum of squares of a_i.\n\nThis seems too easy, but let's test it against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1-1: x=1 → spots 1's u_i is min(3,1)=1.\n\n2-2: x=3 → spot 2's u_i is min(3,3)=3.\n\n3-3: x=2 → spot 3's u_i is min(3,2)=2.\n\nSo, a = [1,3,2], sum is 1+9+4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2-3: x=8 → spots 2 and 3 have u_i min(10,8) =8.\n\n3-4: x=7 → spots 3 and 4 have u_i min(10,7,8) → wait, no: for spot 3, it's in both restrictions. So, for spot 3, the u_i is min(10, x of first restriction (8), x of second restriction (7)) → min(10,8,7) is 7.\n\nSimilarly, spot 4 is in the second restriction only, so u_i is min(10,7) =7.\n\nSpot 1: no restrictions, so u_i is 10.\n\nSo, a = [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 +64+49+49= 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, this approach works for the samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: No restrictions.\n\nEach spot can be h. Sum is n*h².\n\nCase 2: All spots are restricted to 0.\n\nThen sum is 0.\n\nCase 3: Some spots have conflicting restrictions.\n\nLike, spot 1 is covered by two restrictions: x=5 and x=3. So u_i is 3.\n\nAnother spot covered by x=4 and x=6: u_i is 4.\n\nSo, the algorithm correctly takes the min.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n, h, m.\n\n- For each of the m restrictions, collect l, r, x.\n\n- For each spot from 1 to n:\n\n   - Initialize u_i to h.\n\n   - For each restriction j:\n\n      - Check if l_j <= i <= r_j.\n\n      - If yes, set u_i = min(u_i, x_j).\n\n- Compute sum of squares of u_i for all i.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize for each spot i (1-based?), u[i] = h.\n\nFor each of m lines:\n\n   read l, r, x.\n\n   for i in l to r:\n\n      if u[i] >x:\n\n          u[i] =x\n\nThen sum the squares.\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the spots are 1-based. So, in code, we need to loop from 1 to n.\n\nIn Python, it's easier to index from 0, but since the spots are 1-based, perhaps it's better to make the array 1-based.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nu = [h]*(n+1)  # indexes 0..n; 0 unused.\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n        if u[i] > x:\n            u[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum( ai**2 for ai in u[1:n+1] )\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the output is 14, which is correct.\n\nYes, seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings, but in the sample, it's shown as two separate lines. Oh, no, looking back, the input is given as:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nWait, that's the input as a list, but in reality, the input is given as three lines for the first example. So, the code should process each line as a separate restriction.\n\nIn the code above, for each of m lines, read l, r, x.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nAfter processing:\n\nspot 1: min(3,1) → 1.\n\nspot 2: min(3,3) →3.\n\nspot 3: min(3,2) →2.\n\nsum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample 2:\n\nspot 1: 10.\n\nspot 2: min(10,8) →8.\n\nspot3: min(10,8,7) →7.\n\nspot4: min(10,7) →7.\n\nsum is 10² +8² +7² +7² = 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: no restrictions.\n\nn=2, h=5, m=0.\n\nEach spot can be 5.\n\nSum is 25 +25=50.\n\nAnother test case: all spots are covered by multiple restrictions.\n\nn=3, m=2:\n\nRestriction 1: 1-3, x=2.\n\nRestriction 2:1-3, x=3.\n\nSo, for each spot, the min is min(5, 2,3) →2.\n\nSum is 3*4=12.\n\nAnother test case: a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, some with lower x.\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-2, x=3.\n\nRestriction 2:1-1, x=1.\n\nSo, spot 1's u is min(5,3,1) →1.\n\nSpot2: min(5,3) →3.\n\nSum is 1+9=10.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible by building houses on a street with given height constraints. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared, and there are specific zoning restrictions that limit the maximum height in certain ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - We have `n` spots on a street where we can build houses.\n   - Each house can have a height between 0 and `h`.\n   - There are `m` restrictions, each specifying a range `[l_i, r_i]` and a maximum height `x_i`. The tallest house in each specified range must not exceed `x_i`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For each spot, the maximum allowable height is determined by the minimum of the heights allowed by all restrictions that cover that spot, as well as the global maximum height `h`.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize an array `u` where `u[i]` represents the maximum allowed height for the `i-th` spot.\n   - For each restriction, update the maximum allowed height for each spot within the restriction's range.\n   - Compute the total profit by summing the squares of these maximum heights.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - The algorithm processes each restriction and updates each spot within the restriction's range, resulting in a time complexity of O(m * (r-l+1)), which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nu = [h] * (n + 1)  # Using 1-based indexing\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if u[i] > x:\n            u[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum(ai ** 2 for ai in u[1:n+1])\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by initializing an array `u` with size `n+1` (1-based indexing) where each element is set to `h`, the maximum possible height for any spot without any restrictions.\n- **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, we iterate over the specified range and update the maximum allowed height for each spot in that range to be the minimum of the current value and the restriction's height.\n- **Calculating Profit**: Finally, we compute the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for all spots.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the profit while adhering to all given restrictions efficiently.",
