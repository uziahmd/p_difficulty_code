    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a nation called Panel with districts connected in such a way that there's exactly one path between any two districts. So the structure is a tree. Each district has a number of fans equal to 2^i, where i is the district number. The president wants to remove k contestants, but when he does that, those districts block all paths through them. So the remaining districts must form a connected component. Also, he wants to maximize the total number of fans of the remaining contestants.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to find which k districts to remove so that the remaining form a connected subgraph, and the sum of their 2^i is as large as possible.\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove a district, you're disconnecting its subtree. So the remaining districts must form a single connected component, meaning that if we remove certain nodes, the remaining should be connected.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you remove a node, all edges connected to it are effectively removed. So the remaining graph is what's left after removing those nodes and their edges. So the remaining districts must be connected in the original tree, but without the removed nodes.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a subtree (connected) of size n - k, which includes as many high-value nodes (high 2^i) as possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each node's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i. So higher-numbered districts are more valuable.\n\nSo the optimal approach would be to keep the highest possible districts and remove the ones with the least value, but ensuring that they are not necessary for connecting the kept districts.\n\nWait, but the tree structure complicates things. Because the decision to remove a node affects which parts of the tree are connected.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the structure of the tree. Since it's a tree, any two nodes have exactly one path between them. So when you remove a node, you split the tree into several disconnected subtrees.\n\nTo ensure that the remaining nodes are connected, we can't have any splits. So the remaining nodes must form a connected component. So the optimal way is to choose a subtree where all the nodes are in a chain, perhaps, but that might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by keeping a subtree that is connected and contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible, while allowing us to remove some low-numbered nodes.\n\nWait, but how do I model this?\n\nAnother angle: For each node, decide whether to keep it or not. But since the tree is connected, the kept nodes must form a connected subtree. So the problem is to select a connected subset S of the tree with size (n - k), such that the sum of 2^i for i in S is maximized.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the president wants to remove k contestants. So the size of S is n - k.\n\nSo the task is to find a connected subset S of the tree with size m = n -k, such that the sum of 2^i for i in S is as large as possible.\n\nSo the question becomes: How to find such a subset S.\n\nNow, since 2^i grows exponentially, the higher the i, the better. So we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut the tree structure may require including some lower-numbered nodes to connect the higher ones.\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal S is a path that includes the highest possible nodes. Because a path is connected and allows including as many high nodes as possible.\n\nWait, another thought: The sum is maximized when the selected nodes have the largest possible 2^i values. So perhaps the strategy is to find a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes, even if that means cutting off some smaller ones.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3. So m=3.\n\nThe tree is built from the edges:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nSo the tree looks like this:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1,3,4,6.\n\nDistrict 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nSo when the output is [1,3,4], which are the districts being removed.\n\nWait, wait. No: the output is the districts to remove. So the remaining districts are 2,5,6,3? Or wait, the output lists the districts to remove, which are 1,3,4. So the remaining districts are 2,5,6.\n\nWait, 2,5,6 are connected via the edges 2-6 and 6-5. So yes, they form a connected component.\n\nThe sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 +32+64=100.\n\nWhich is the maximum possible.\n\nSo why was 1,3,4 removed? Because including them would take up more than m=3 nodes, but perhaps they are not necessary for connecting the higher nodes.\n\nWait, but 2 is connected to 6 and 5, which are high. So including 2 is necessary because without it, 6 and 5 are disconnected.\n\nBut 1,3,4 are leaves connected to 2. Removing them allows us to have a subtree that includes 2,5,6.\n\nSo the key is that we can remove the children of 2 except those that lead to higher-numbered nodes.\n\nWait, but 3 and 4 are higher than 2? No, 3 is higher than 2, but 3 is a leaf connected to 2. So including 3 would allow including 2, but perhaps 3 isn't worth keeping if we can include higher nodes elsewhere.\n\nBut in the example, 3 is a child of 2, but 5 and 6 are also connected to 2. So including 2,5,6 gives us a connected component, which is sufficient.\n\nSo the approach is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, possibly cutting off branches that have lower-numbered nodes.\n\nSo perhaps the solution involves selecting a root, then choosing to keep the higher-numbered children and possibly their parents, and pruning the lower ones.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: For each node, compute the sum of its subtree. Then, determine which subtrees to keep.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the problem as choosing a connected subtree S with size m = n -k, and the sum is the sum of 2^i for i in S.\n\nWe need to maximize this sum.\n\nGiven that 2^i is exponential, the optimal is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo the strategy is to find a subtree that includes the m highest possible nodes, arranged in a connected way.\n\nWait, but the tree is arbitrary, so sometimes the m highest nodes may not be connected.\n\nFor example, suppose the tree is a straight line: 1-2-3-4-5, and m=3. The top 3 nodes are 3,4,5. Are they connected? Yes, they form a connected component. So including them is optimal.\n\nIn another case, if the tree is a star, with 1 in the center connected to 2,3,4,5, etc. Suppose m is 3. The highest nodes are 5,4,3. But they are all connected through 1. So including 1 is necessary. So the sum would be 2^1 +2^5+2^4+2^3, but wait, that's 4+32+16+8=60. But if instead, we could find a way to include 5,4,3 without 1, but that's impossible because they are all connected only through 1. So in that case, we have to include 1 as well. So the sum would be 4+32+16+8=60.\n\nWait, but if m is 3, then n=5, so we have to remove 2 nodes. Wait, n=5, k=2: m=3.\n\nBut in the star example, if m=3, the best is to include 5,4,3 and exclude 2,1. But that's not possible because 3,4,5 are connected through 1. So 1 is needed to connect them.\n\nSo the sum would be 2^1 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 = 4+8+16+32=60.\n\nBut wait, if m=3, then we can only have three nodes. So in that scenario, perhaps the optimal is to include 1,4,5, which is connected. Sum is 4+16+32=52, which is less than 60.\n\nWait, no: 1,4,5 sum to 52, which is less than 60. So perhaps the initial idea of including 1,3,4,5 is better, but that's four nodes, which is more than m=3. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal is to include 1,4,5, but that's 3 nodes. Sum is 4+16+32=52.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to get a higher sum?\n\nWhat if we can find a subtree that includes 2,4,5? But 2 is connected to 1, which is not included, so 2,4,5 are not connected. So that's invalid.\n\nHmm, so in this case, including 1 is necessary to have a connected subtree.\n\nSo the sum is 4+16+32=52.\n\nSo the point is, sometimes you have to include lower-numbered nodes to connect higher-numbered ones.\n\nSo the problem is to find a connected subtree S of size m, containing as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and including some lower-numbered nodes if necessary.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the tree as a hierarchy, and for each node, compute the size of its subtree and the sum of 2^i in its subtree.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to perform a greedy selection: for each node, determine whether to keep it or not based on whether its removal would allow us to include more high-numbered nodes elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model the problem as a priority queue, where for each node, we calculate the potential benefit of including it, considering the cost of including any necessary lower nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: Since the tree is connected, any connected subset is a subtree. So the problem reduces to selecting a subtree with exactly m nodes, and the sum is maximized.\n\nSo how to select such a subtree.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding a subtree with maximum sum, but constrained on the number of nodes.\n\nBut solving this for a general tree is computationally expensive unless we have a smart way.\n\nSo for large n (up to 1e6), we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about the tree's properties.\n\nEach node contributes 2^i to the sum. So higher i is better.\n\nThus, the optimal subtree S would consist of the m highest possible nodes, provided they form a connected subtree.\n\nIf the m highest nodes are connected, then that's the best choice.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the next best option.\n\nBut how to check if the m highest nodes are connected.\n\nWait, but the m highest nodes are n, n-1, ..., n-m+1.\n\nSo the problem is: can these m nodes form a connected subtree?\n\nIf yes, then the sum is sum(2^i for i in [n, n-m+1]).\n\nIf not, then we need to find a way to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal S is a path that starts at some high node and goes down to some lower nodes, but includes the maximum possible high nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the minimal set of nodes that can connect the m highest nodes, and then include as many of the higher nodes as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: The sum is maximized when we include the m highest nodes plus as few as possible lower nodes necessary to connect them.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Collect the m highest nodes.\n\n2. Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n   a. If yes, include them.\n\n   b. If not, find the minimal number of additional nodes needed to connect them.\n\n   c. If the number of required connections is <= (k - current_removed), then include those.\n\nBut wait, this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to model the problem as selecting a subtree that is a chain, with the highest possible nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal S is a path that includes the m highest nodes, and any lower nodes along the path.\n\nBut I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the centroid of the tree where the sum is maximized.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model the problem as finding a subtree where the sum of 2^i is as large as possible, with size m.\n\nSince each node's value is 2^i, the best way is to include as many high i's as possible.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that is a chain, starting from some node and going up to higher-numbered nodes.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the sample input.\n\nn=6, k=3, m=3.\n\nThe m highest nodes are 6,5,4.\n\nWait, but 6 is connected to 2, which is connected to 3 and 4.\n\nSo 6,5,4 are connected via 2.\n\nWait, 6 is connected to 2, which is connected to 4.\n\nSo 4,6, and 5 are connected through 2.\n\nSo the subtree includes 4,6,5.\n\nBut wait, 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5.\n\nSo yes, 4,6,5 are connected, forming a subtree of size 3.\n\nSo the sum is 16+32+64=112.\n\nWait, but that's higher than the sample's sum of 100.\n\nWait, but the sample's output is removing 1,3,4, leaving 2,5,6.\n\nSum is 4 +32 +64 = 100.\n\nHmm, so why isn't 4,5,6 included?\n\nBecause in that case, the subtree is 4,5,6. They are connected via 2 and 6.\n\nWait, 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So yes, it's a connected subtree.\n\nSo why isn't that chosen?\n\nBecause including 4 requires including 2 as well, right?\n\nWait, no. Because 4 is directly connected to 2, but if 2 is not included, 4 is a separate node.\n\nWait, no. Because the subtree must include 4,6,5. But 4 is connected only to 2, which is not included. So 4 is isolated, making the subtree disconnected. So including 4 without 2 is not allowed.\n\nAh, that's why. So to include 4, you must include 2 as well. So the subtree would be 2,4,6,5. That's four nodes, but m is 3. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo the subtree can't include 4,5,6 without 2, which would make the size 4, exceeding m=3.\n\nSo the optimal is to include 2,5,6.\n\nWhich is the sample's solution.\n\nSo the problem is not just about including the highest nodes, but also ensuring that they form a connected subtree of size m.\n\nThus, the challenge is to find the largest possible sum by selecting a connected subtree of size m, which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to think recursively. For each node, determine whether including it and some of its children can contribute to a larger sum, given the constraints on the number of nodes.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, recursion isn't feasible.\n\nPerhaps a dynamic programming approach can be used.\n\nWait, let's think about each node and its subtree.\n\nFor each node u, we can compute two things:\n\n- The maximum sum achievable in the subtree rooted at u, given that u is included.\n\n- The maximum sum achievable in the subtree rooted at u, given that u is excluded.\n\nBut even that may be tricky.\n\nWait, but the sum is determined by including as many high nodes as possible.\n\nSo perhaps for each node u, the best sum when including u is the sum of the best sums from each child, plus 2^u, but only if including that child's subtree doesn't exceed the size limit.\n\nBut again, for n=1e6, it's unclear how to manage this.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the optimal connected subtree S is a path that starts at some node and goes upwards, including as many high nodes as possible.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is to find the longest possible path in the tree that includes the highest possible nodes, and adjust its length to m.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Since higher-numbered nodes are better, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain that starts at some high node and extends down as needed.\n\nFor example, the chain would be something like a node u, connected to u-1, connected to u-2, and so on, until the chain reaches m nodes.\n\nBut again, this depends on the tree structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the minimal subtree that connects the top m nodes, and then include as many as possible.\n\nWait, but that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to select the m highest nodes and find the minimal subtree that connects them.\n\nIf the minimal subtree has size <=m, then we can include all m nodes and the connecting nodes.\n\nOtherwise, we have to include more nodes, but then the sum may not be optimal.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal subtree connecting the m highest nodes has a certain size. Let's call it s.\n\nIf s <= m, then the sum is the sum of the m nodes, because the subtree is already connected.\n\nIf s > m, then we need to find a way to include s nodes, but we can only include m. So we have to choose which s - m nodes to exclude to minimize the loss in sum.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a subtree S where the sum of 2^i is maximum, and |S|=m.\n\nGiven that each node's value is 2^i, perhaps the optimal S is a subtree where the nodes form a chain, and the sum is the sum of a consecutive sequence of high nodes.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, another observation: the sum of 2^i for a set of nodes is equal to the sum of 2^i for each node in the set. Since 2^i grows exponentially, the optimal S is the set of the m largest possible i's that can form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Identify the m largest nodes.\n\n2. Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n   a. If yes, include them. The sum is sum(2^i).\n\n   b. If not, find the minimal set of nodes needed to connect them.\n\n   c. If adding those nodes brings the total size within m, include them.\n\n3. If the total size after adding the connecting nodes exceeds m, then it's not possible. So we need to find a way to include the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find for each node u, the number of nodes in its subtree that are in the top m nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the tree in a way that allows us to find the best connected subtree.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints.\n\nWe can perform a post-order traversal of the tree, and for each node, compute the sum of the subtree, the size of the subtree, and the maximum depth.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering each node as a candidate root and determining the maximum sum for a connected subtree of size m.\n\nBut again, for n=1e6, this approach is not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached greedily.\n\nWe can think about the tree as a collection of paths. For each node, we can compute the sum of its subtree, and the size of the subtree.\n\nWe can then find the subtree with the maximum sum, given that the size is m.\n\nBut again, the issue is how to find this quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the node with the highest value (highest i) and include it. Then, find the largest possible connected subtree that includes this node and has size m.\n\nIf the subtree has size >=m, then take the top m nodes in it.\n\nIf the subtree's size is less than m, then perhaps expand to include adjacent nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the node with the highest value, and as many as possible higher nodes, and the minimal necessary lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the node u with the highest i.\n\n2. Include u in the subtree.\n\n3. Then, for each of its children, include the child with the highest i, and so on.\n\nBut this approach may not always work because sometimes excluding a child with a slightly lower i but allowing inclusion of higher nodes elsewhere may yield a better sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, regardless of their position in the tree.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n- Start with the highest node, add it to S.\n\n- Then, add the highest possible node in its subtree, ensuring that the size doesn't exceed m.\n\n- Continue this process until we've added m nodes.\n\nBut again, the implementation is unclear.\n\nAnother angle: Since the sum is maximized by including higher i's, the optimal connected subtree S must include as many high i's as possible.\n\nThus, for each node u, the optimal S either includes u or not, depending on whether including it and its necessary children contributes to a larger sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree where for each node, the sum of the subtree is as large as possible, and the size is m.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps it's time to look for similar problems or known algorithms.\n\nUpon reflection, this problem resembles the problem of finding a maximum weight subtree of size exactly m, where the weight of a node is 2^i.\n\nBut I don't know of a standard algorithm for this.\n\nAnother thought: Since each node's value is 2^i, which is exponentially increasing with i, the optimal subtree will include the highest possible nodes, and only include lower nodes if necessary to connect them.\n\nThus, the subtree will be a chain that starts at some high node and goes down to lower nodes as needed.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is to find the longest possible chain of high nodes that can form a connected subtree, and then trim it to size m.\n\nBut how to find this chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that includes as many high nodes as possible, and the sum is the sum of these nodes.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the optimal subtree includes 2,5,6. Which forms a path 2-6-5.\n\nSo the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 +32 +64=100.\n\nBut including 6,5,4 would require including 2 and 4, which would make the size 4, exceeding m=3.\n\nSo the solution is to include the highest possible nodes, but not too many.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: For each node, compute the sum of its subtree, and the size. We can then, for each node, see if the subtree can contribute to the solution.\n\nBut again, I'm not seeing the exact steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the node with the highest value, and then include as many of its ancestors as possible, forming a path.\n\nBut that may not capture all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding a path in the tree that contains the maximum sum of 2^i, with the length of the path being exactly m.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding a path in the tree where the sum of 2^i is as large as possible, and the path's length is m.\n\nBut again, how to find that.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a path in the tree where the sum is maximized, and the path's length is m.\n\nBut how to find such a path.\n\nWait, considering that each node's contribution is 2^i, the path that gives the maximum sum is the one that includes the m highest nodes along a path.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is to find the path in the tree that contains the m highest nodes.\n\nBut again, the details are unclear.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nSince the sum is 2^i, the optimal solution is to select a connected subtree S of size m, which includes the m highest possible i's. If those m i's are connected, then that's the best. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal number of lower i's to connect them.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Select the m highest i's (n, n-1, ..., n-m+1).\n\n2. Check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, include them. Sum is 2^n + ... + 2^{n-m+1}.\n\n3. If not connected, find the minimal set of nodes needed to connect them. Let's say the number of required connecting nodes is c. If c is zero, proceed. Otherwise, if (c + m) <= n, then include the connecting nodes and the m nodes. The sum will be the sum of all included nodes. However, since we can only remove k nodes, the number of nodes to include is m plus c, which must be <= n -k.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the sum is maximized, not necessarily the number of nodes. So perhaps including more nodes is better if their sum is higher.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum is 2^i, higher i's are better.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to include as many high i's as possible, and the minimal number of connecting nodes.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear way forward.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nWe can model the problem by considering each node as a potential part of the subtree. For each node u, compute the maximum sum of a connected subtree that includes u, with size exactly m.\n\nBut again, for n=1e6, this is computationally challenging.\n\nBut perhaps the solution can be found using a priority queue, processing nodes in descending order of i, and trying to build a connected subtree.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n- Compute for each node, the size of its subtree.\n\n- Sort all nodes in descending order of i.\n\n- Use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to track connected components.\n\n- Process nodes in order, adding them to the DSU if they can help connect the current components.\n\n- Keep track of the sum and the size.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. For each node, compute the size of its subtree (the number of nodes in its subtree, including itself). This can be done with a post-order traversal.\n\n2. Sort all nodes in descending order of their i value.\n\n3. Use a DSU to track connected components.\n\n4. Iterate through the sorted nodes, adding each node to the DSU.\n\n   a. When adding a node u, check if any of its children are already in the DSU.\n\n   b. For each child v of u, if v is in the DSU, merge the sets of u and v.\n\n   c. After merging, if the total size of the connected component becomes s, and the number of nodes is t, we can consider whether t is <= m. If s is the sum of 2^i for the nodes in the component.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is to find the connected component that, after including certain nodes, has a sum as large as possible, and size m.\n\nBut again, the exact steps are unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can represent the tree as an adjacency list. Then, for each node, we can compute the sum of its subtree, the size, and the maximum depth.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea Inspired by the Sample:\n\nIn the sample, the optimal subtree includes 2,5,6. These nodes are connected through 2-6-5.\n\nSo the path is 2->6->5.\n\nSo the subtree is a chain of 3 nodes.\n\nThe sum is 4+32+64=100.\n\nIf we had included 4,6,5, that's 4 nodes, which is more than m=3.\n\nSo the optimal is to include a shorter chain.\n\nThus, perhaps the solution is to find a path in the tree that contains the maximum possible sum, with the path's length being exactly m.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find all possible paths in the tree and select the one with the maximum sum, but that's computationally impossible for n=1e6.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nPerhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is formed by the node with the highest i, and as many as possible of its ancestors, plus some descendants.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the node with the highest i, then include as many of its children as possible, and then their children, etc., until the total number of nodes is m.\n\nBut this may not always give the optimal sum.\n\nAnother Idea: For each node, the subtree rooted at that node can contribute to the solution if the size is <=m.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree with the maximum sum among all subtrees of size m.\n\nBut again, how.\n\nWait, perhaps a way to model this is to find for each node u, the sum of its subtree, and the size, then for each u, see if the size is <=m.\n\nThen, for all such u, we can consider the subtree.\n\nBut this may not account for cases where including some parent nodes can create a larger sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to precompute for each node u, the sum of the subtree and the size, then collect all such subtrees, and find the one with the maximum sum.\n\nBut for large trees, this may not be efficient.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree with the maximum sum of 2^i, of size m, which is connected.\n\nBut I'm stuck on how to compute this.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the solution is to find the largest possible connected subtree S of size m, and the sum is the sum of 2^i for all i in S.\n\nThe approach is:\n\n1. Perform a BFS or DFS to find the connected subtree S with the maximum sum of 2^i, with size exactly m.\n\nBut for n=1e6, this is not feasible.\n\nThus, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that consists of the m highest nodes and includes the minimal necessary lower nodes to connect them.\n\nThus, the steps would be:\n\na. Collect the m highest nodes.\n\nb. Find the minimal number of lower nodes needed to connect them.\n\nc. Ensure that the total number of nodes (m + c) is <=n -k.\n\nd. If possible, include all m nodes and the c connecting nodes.\n\nBut how to find the minimal c.\n\nWait, the minimal c is the number of nodes needed to connect the m nodes.\n\nFor example, in the sample, the m=3 highest nodes are 6,5,4.\n\nBut 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5.\n\nSo the minimal c is 1 (node 2). Thus, the total nodes is 3+1=4.\n\nBut m is 3, so we can't include all 4. So we need to select a subset.\n\nWait, perhaps in this case, including 6,5,2.\n\nThat's 3 nodes. They form a connected subtree.\n\nSum is 64+32+4=100.\n\nWhich is the same as the sample.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nCollect the m highest nodes, find the minimal number of connecting nodes needed, then select the best subset.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe minimal number of connecting nodes is the number of \"gaps\" between the m nodes.\n\nFor example, if the m nodes are in a single path, then c=0. If they form a disconnected set, c is the number of bridges needed.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the solution is to find the subtree that contains the m highest nodes, and then include as few lower nodes as needed to connect them, but not more than k.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps it's time to look for hints or think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the node with the highest i, then include as much as possible of its subtree, but ensuring that the total size is m.\n\nBut I'm not certain.\n\nAnother Idea: The problem can be transformed into finding a subtree S of size m, such that the sum of 2^i for i in S is maximum. Since 2^i is exponentially increasing, the optimal S is the one that includes as many high i as possible.\n\nThus, the optimal S is a connected subtree that includes the m highest nodes, possibly including some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\n1. Find all the m highest nodes.\n\n2. Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n   a. If yes, include them.\n\n   b. If not, find the minimal set of nodes needed to connect them.\n\n3. Ensure that the total number of nodes in S (m + c) is <= n -k.\n\n   a. If yes, include them.\n\n   b. Else, find a subset of S with size m that can form a connected subtree.\n\nBut the challenge is step 2 and 3.\n\nBut for large n, we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nPerhaps, in code, the solution is to:\n\n- Generate the list of m highest nodes.\n\n- Find the minimal number of nodes needed to connect them.\n\n- If the minimal number plus m is <=n -k, then include those.\n\n- Else, find the best possible subset.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute the minimal number of nodes needed to connect them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the tree's structure and greedily building the subtree.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nFinal Idea:\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree consisting of the m highest nodes, and then include any necessary lower nodes to connect them, provided that the total nodes are <=m + c, and c is minimal.\n\nBut in code, how to do this.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that includes the m highest nodes, and then the minimal number of nodes needed to connect them.\n\nBut to compute this, we can think of the subtree as a union of the m nodes and the minimal number of connecting nodes.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nThus, perhaps the code should:\n\n- For each node, compute the size of its subtree.\n\n- Sort all nodes in descending order of i.\n\n- Try to find the earliest m nodes that form a connected subtree.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\n1. Read the tree, build an adjacency list.\n\n2. Compute the size of each subtree.\n\n3. Sort all nodes in descending order of i.\n\n4. For each node u in the sorted list:\n\n   a. If u is not visited yet:\n\n      i. Perform a BFS or DFS starting from u, collecting nodes in the order of highest i.\n\n      ii. Stop when the size reaches m.\n\n      iii. Check if the collected nodes form a connected subtree.\n\n      iv. If yes, compute the sum.\n\n      v. Keep track of the maximum sum.\n\n5. The result is the set of nodes that gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut for n=1e6, this approach is computationally infeasible.\n\nThus, perhaps the solution requires a different approach.\n\nAnother Idea Inspired by Greedy Approach:\n\nThe sum is maximized by including higher i's. So the best approach is to include as many as possible.\n\nThus, the solution is to find the connected subtree that includes the highest possible i's, and has exactly m nodes.\n\nThus, the solution is to find the connected subtree with the highest possible sum, size m.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree S with |S|=m, and sum of 2^i is maximum.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each possible connected subtree S with size m, compute the sum of 2^i and select the maximum.\n\nBut again, for n=1e6, this is not feasible.\n\nThus, I think the correct approach is to find the subtree that is a path of m nodes, including as many high i's as possible.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. For each node u, compute the maximum possible path length starting at u.\n\n2. For each possible path of length m, compute the sum.\n\n3. Select the path with the maximum sum.\n\nBut for n=1e6, this is also not feasible.\n\nThus, perhaps the solution is to find the longest path in the tree that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\n\nI think the problem is challenging, and given the time constraints, the solution likely involves finding the subtree that includes the m highest nodes, possibly connected via their lowest common ancestor, and ensuring that the size is m.\n\nThus, the code will involve:\n\n- Building the tree.\n\n- Finding the m highest nodes.\n\n- Checking if they form a connected subtree.\n\n- If not, find the minimal number of lower nodes needed to connect them.\n\n- If the total nodes is <=n -k, include them.\n\n- Else, find a subset.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\n- Read the tree, build adjacency list.\n\n- Compute for each node, the size of its subtree.\n\n- Sort nodes",
