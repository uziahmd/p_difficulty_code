The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a snowflake graph with n vertices exists. The snowflake graph is defined in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure.\n\nFrom the description: The snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices, where k > 1. So after the first step, we have 1 (initial) + k (new) = k+1 vertices.\n\nThen, each vertex that has only one edge (so degree 1) is connected to k new vertices. And this step is done at least once. So for each such node, we add k children. \n\nWait, but after adding, those new nodes will also become leaves. So each time we do this expansion, we are adding layers to the snowflake.\n\nHmm. So the structure is like a tree, right? Because every node except the leaves has more than one edge. So it's a rooted tree where each non-leaf node has exactly k children.\n\nWait, but the process is such that each leaf (node with degree 1) must undergo the expansion step at least once. So the initial step adds the first layer of leaves. Then, each of those must be expanded again. So perhaps the snowflake has multiple layers, but each expansion is done on all current leaves.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The initial step connects the root to k children. So the root has degree k, each child has degree 1. Now, according to the rules, each node with degree 1 must be expanded by adding k new nodes. So after the initial step, we have to perform this expansion step at least once.\n\nSo the initial step gives us 1 +k nodes. Then, each of those k nodes will have k new children. So after that, the total becomes 1 +k +k*k = 1 +k(k+1). But wait, because each of the k nodes adds k children, that's an addition of k*k nodes.\n\nSo the total number of nodes after two steps is 1 +k +k^2. Wait, but maybe not, because the root is connected to k nodes, each of which is then connected to k nodes. So yes, the root contributes 1, the first layer is k, the second layer is k^2. So total is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut wait, the initial step is the root connected to k nodes (step 1). Then, step 2 is expanding each of these k nodes into k more, which adds k² nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut what if we do another expansion step? Like, after the second step, all the leaves are the ones from the second layer (the k² nodes). Each of those would need to be expanded as well, adding k³ nodes each. So the third step adds k³ nodes, making the total 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the expansion step should be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when we have the initial step plus one expansion step. Or is it that the expansion step is done once, and that's enough?\n\nWait, the problem says: the initial step is done once, then each vertex that is connected by only one edge is connected to k new vertices, and this step is done at least once. So the expansion step is done once, and the initial step is done once.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\nThe initial step is connecting the root to k new nodes. Then, each vertex with degree 1 (the k nodes) must be connected to k new nodes. And this step is done at least once. So the minimal structure is when we perform the initial step and then perform the expansion step once on all the leaves. So the minimal snowflake has 1 +k +k² nodes.\n\nWait, but looking at the example input and output:\n\nFor example, when n=13, the output is YES. Let's see: 13 is 1 +3 +3²= 1+3+9=13. So for k=3, it fits.\n\nAnother example is n=255. Let's see: 255 could be 1 + 2 + 2² + 2³= 1+2+4+8=15, which is less than 255. Hmm, or maybe it's a different expansion. Wait, perhaps the snowflake can have multiple layers beyond the initial expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake can have m layers after the initial step. So for each expansion step, all the leaves are expanded.\n\nSo the structure is a rooted tree where the root has k children. Each of those children has k children, and so on, for some number of layers. But the key is that the expansion must be done",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with `n` vertices can exist. The snowflake graph is defined in a specific hierarchical structure where each node (except the root) must have exactly `k` children, and this expansion step must be performed at least once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with a root node connected to `k` nodes. Each of these `k` nodes must then be expanded by connecting them to `k` new nodes, and this process can continue for multiple layers.\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: The total number of nodes in the snowflake graph after `m` expansion steps is given by the sum of a geometric series. Specifically, it is `1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m)`, where `m` is the number of expansion steps.\n3. **Check for Valid `n`**: For each test case, we need to check if `n` can be represented as `1 + k * (k^m - 1) / (k - 1)` for some integer `k > 1` and `m >= 1`. This involves iterating over possible values of `k` and checking if `(n-1)` can be expressed as such a sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    for k in range(2, int((n-1)**0.5) + 2):\n        s = (k**(m+1) - 1) // (k - 1)\n        if (n - 1) % k != 0:\n            continue\n        m = 0\n        remaining = (n - 1) // k\n        while remaining > 1:\n            if remaining % k != 0:\n                break\n            remaining = remaining // k\n            m += 1\n        else:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nt = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    if n == 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    found = False\n    for k in range(2, int((n-1)**0.5) + 2):\n        s = (k**2 - 1) // (k - 1)\n        if (n - 1) % k != 0:\n            continue\n        m = 0\n        remaining = (n - 1) // k\n        while remaining > 1:\n            if remaining % k != 0:\n                break\n            remaining = remaining // k\n            m += 1\n        else:\n            found = True\n            break\n    print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple test cases and processes each one individually.\n2. **Checking for Snowflake Structure**: For each `n`, it checks if there exists a valid `k` such that the snowflake structure can be formed. This involves iterating over possible values of `k` and verifying if `n` can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: The approach efficiently narrows down possible values of `k` and checks for the required conditions using mathematical properties of geometric series, ensuring the solution handles large values of `n` efficiently.",
