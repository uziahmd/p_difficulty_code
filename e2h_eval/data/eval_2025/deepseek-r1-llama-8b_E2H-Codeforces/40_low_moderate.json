For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) that satisfy two conditions: p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than in q. We need to compute this modulo mod, which can be up to 1e9.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to understand what a permutation pair is. A permutation is just an arrangement of all numbers from 1 to n in some order. For each pair (p, q), both are permutations, and they must satisfy two things:\n\n1. p is lexicographically smaller than q.\n2. The inversion count of p is higher than that of q.\n\nInversion count is the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j and p_i > p_j.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, considering that n can be up to 500, we need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n^4) or better, but let's see.\n\nWait, n=500, O(n^4) would be 500^4 = 62.5e9 operations, which is way too much. So that's not feasible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties required for p and q.\n\nFirst, for p to be lex smaller than q. Lex order is determined by the first position where p and q differ. If at that position, p has a smaller element, then p is smaller.\n\nNow, the second condition is that the inversion count of p is larger than that of q.\n\nSo, perhaps for each possible pair of permutations (p, q), we need to check both conditions. But with n=500, the total number of permutations is 500! which is astronomically largeâ€”so that's impossible to process directly.\n\nSo, we need a dynamic programming approach or some combinatorial way to count without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe we can model the problem using DP states that track certain aspects of the permutations.\n\nLet me consider the problem from another angle. Let's think about all possible pairs (p, q). For each such pair, p < q lex-wise, and inv(p) > inv(q). How can we count these efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to represent the state in terms of the current position and some information about the elements chosen so far.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to realize that for each position k, the choice of p and q up to k determines whether p is lex smaller than q, and whether the inversion counts will satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but inversion counts depend on the entire permutation. So, perhaps it's difficult to model this directly.\n\nAnother thought: since the problem involves comparing p and q in lex order, maybe for each possible prefix of p and q, we can track some information that allows us to determine whether the rest of the permutations can satisfy the inversion count condition.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible pair of partial permutations (p', q'), where p' is a prefix of p and q' is a prefix of q, we can track the number of ways to complete them into full permutations p and q such that p < q lex-wise, and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nThis seems like a promising approach. Let's formalize this.\n\nWe can model the problem with a DP table where each state is defined by the current length of the prefixes (k), and for each possible pair of choices made so far (the current p and q up to position k), along with some additional parameters that help compute the required conditions.\n\nBut even this might be too memory-intensive because for each step, the number of possible states could be very large.\n\nWait, but perhaps the state can be compressed. Let's think about the state as being (k, a, b), where a represents the current state of p's permutation up to k, and b represents the current state of q's permutation up to k. But again, this might not be manageable for n=500.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mathematical insight that can help simplify the problem.\n\nLet me think about the properties of p and q. Since p is lex smaller than q, for the first position where p and q differ, p has a smaller element than q. Suppose this happens at position i. Then, for all positions before i, p and q must be equal.\n\nSo, for any i, if p and q agree on the first i-1 elements, and p[i] < q[i], then p is lex smaller than q.\n\nMoreover, beyond position i, the elements of p and q can vary, but for the inversion count condition, the rest of the permutation affects the inversion count.\n\nWait, but inversion count is a global property. So, even if p is lex smaller than q, their inversion counts can vary based on the entire permutation.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can split",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. The result should be computed modulo a given value.\n\n### Approach\nThe solution involves dynamic programming (DP) with a state representation that tracks the current length of the prefixes of permutations p and q, along with their respective inversion counts. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **State Representation**: Use a DP table where each state is represented by `(k, a, b, c, d)`, where:\n   - `k` is the current position being considered.\n   - `a` is the number of inversions in the prefix of permutation p up to position k.\n   - `b` is the number of inversions in the prefix of permutation q up to position k.\n   - `c` is the current state of permutation p at position k.\n   - `d` is the current state of permutation q at position k.\n\n2. **Transition**: For each state, consider all possible next elements for both permutations p and q. Update the inversion counts and transition to the next state accordingly.\n\n3. **Lexicographical Order Check**: Ensure that the current elements of p and q are such that p is lexicographically smaller than q. This is done by checking if the current element of p is less than that of q when they first differ.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, apply the modulo operation at each step to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n# We use a 4-dimensional DP: dp[k][a][b][c][d], but to manage memory,\n# we'll represent it as a dictionary of dictionaries.\n\n# Each state is (k, a, b, c, d), where:\n# -
