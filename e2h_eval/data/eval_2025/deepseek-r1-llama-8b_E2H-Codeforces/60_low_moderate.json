            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code and counting certain sequences after each modification to a string S. Hmm. So each character added to S is either a '0' or '1', representing dots and dashes respectively. After each addition, I need to find the number of non-empty substrings that correspond to valid English letters in Morse code.\n\nWait, but what's considered a valid Morse code letter here? Oh right, the problem says that some 4-length strings don't correspond to any letter. But for our problem, when a substring has a length from 1 to 4, we check if it's one of the valid Morse codes. And then, each such substring contributes to the count if it's valid.\n\nSo the task is, after each step, compute the sum over all possible non-empty substrings of S (each being a Morse code sequence) whether they are valid letters.\n\nBut how do I efficiently compute this after each addition?\n\nLet me think about the structure. Each time I add a new character to S, which is either '0' or '1', I can consider it as the last character of S. Then, for this new character, I need to look at all substrings ending with this character. These substrings could be of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, depending on the current length of S.\n\nWait, because each new character can only form new substrings that end at this character. So for each new character, I can process all possible substrings ending at this position.\n\nFor example, suppose the current string is \"111\". When I add another '1', making it \"1111\", the new substrings are the last 1 (length 1), last two 1s (length 2), last three 1s (length 3), and the entire string (length 4). For each of these, I need to check if it's a valid Morse code string that corresponds to an English letter.\n\nBut wait, for a given substring ending at position i (the new character), the length can be from 1 to min(4, i+1). Because the maximum substring length is 4.\n\nSo, for each new character, I can iterate through the previous positions, up to 4 steps back, and for each possible k (from 1 to 4), check if the substring s[i -k +1 ...i] is a valid Morse code.\n\nIf it is, then I need to add 1 to the total count for each occurrence.\n\nBut how do I keep track of this efficiently?\n\nHmm. So the main idea is to, for each new character, look at the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters, and for each possible length, check if that substring is a valid Morse code.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nWe can represent the current state of S as a list or a string. Each time a new character is added, we'll process it by checking all possible substrings ending at this new position with lengths 1,2,3,4.\n\nFor each length l (from 1 to 4), we need to extract the substring of length l ending at the new character, and check if it's a valid Morse code string.\n\nIf it's valid, we increment the total count.\n\nSo, the key is to have a way to quickly determine if a given substring of length l is a valid Morse code.\n\nWait, but how many valid Morse codes are there? The problem states that out of all possible 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30 possible strings, four are invalid. So 26 are valid.\n\nSo, for any substring of length 1-4, if it's not in the four invalid ones, it's valid.\n\nSo, perhaps we can precompute all the valid Morse codes, and for any given substring, check if it's in the set of valid codes.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, first, I need to create a set containing all the valid Morse codes except those four invalid ones.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the four invalid strings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". All other 4-length and shorter strings are valid.\n\nSo, the valid Morse codes are all possible 1,2,3,4-length binary strings except those four.\n\nSo, for each possible substring of length 1-4, I can check if it's one of those four invalid strings. If not, it's a valid Morse code.\n\nAlternatively, since the valid codes are all except those four, perhaps for a given substring, I can generate it as a string and see if it's in the invalid set. If it's not, then it's valid.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Precompute the set of invalid Morse code strings: {\"0011\",",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to a string `S`. Each modification appends either a '0' (dot) or '1' (dash) to `S`, and we need to count the valid Morse code sequences that can be formed from any non-empty substring of `S` after each addition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Valid Morse Codes**: Each Morse code letter is represented as a string of dots (0) and dashes (1). The valid Morse codes are all possible strings of length 1 to 4 except for four specific invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n2. **Track Substrings Efficiently**: For each new character added to `S`, we consider all possible substrings ending at this new character. These substrings can have lengths from 1 to 4. We check each substring to see if it matches any of the valid Morse codes.\n\n3. **Update Count Dynamically**: After each modification, we update the count of valid Morse code substrings by checking all possible substrings ending at the new character. This ensures we efficiently count only the valid substrings without redundant checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute the set of invalid Morse codes\ninvalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n    return s not in invalid\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\ntotal = 0\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    s.append(c)\n    max_len = min(4, len(s))\n    for l in range(1, max_len + 1):\n        # Get the last l characters\n        substring = ''.join(s[-l:])\n        if is_valid(substring):\n            total = (total + 1) % MOD\n    print(total % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Invalid Morse Codes**: We use a set to store the four invalid Morse code strings for quick lookup.\n- **Substring Check**: For each new character added to `S`, we generate substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at this character. Each substring is checked against the invalid set to determine if it is valid.\n- **Efficient Counting**: By dynamically updating the count after each modification and only considering relevant substrings, we ensure the solution is efficient even for the maximum constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid Morse code substrings after each modification, providing the required results modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).",
