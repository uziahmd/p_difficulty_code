The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the plate is w by h in dimensions. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that's smaller each time. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\nHmm, I think I should model each ring step by step. For each ring i (from 1 to k), I need to compute how many cells are in that ring, then sum all those up.\n\nLet's break it down. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). Because each ring reduces both width and height by 2 on each side, which is 4 in total. So for each i, the current width is w - 4*(i-1) and similarly for height.\n\nThe ring consists of the perimeter of this rectangle. The number of cells in the perimeter of a rectangle can be calculated as 2*(width + height) -4. Because each side contributes width or height, but the four corners are counted twice, so we subtract 4.\n\nWait, let me test this formula. For example, a 3x3 square: perimeter is 8. Using the formula: 2*(3+3)-4 = 6*2=12-4=8. Correct. Another example: 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the sample input where k=1 gives 28. And when k=2, the next ring is (7-4)=3 rows and (9-4)=5 columns. Perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12. Adding to 28 gives 40, which also matches the sample.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n   c. If either current_w or current_h is less than or equal to 0, this ring doesn't exist. But since the input constraints say k is valid, maybe we don't have to worry about that.\n   d. Compute perimeter cells: 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   e. Add this to the total.\n\nSo the code can loop from i=1 to k, compute each term, and sum them.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe input is three integers on one line. So, read the line, split into w, h, k.\n\nThen, initialize a total to 0.\n\nLoop for i in range(1, k+1):\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   if current_w <=0 or current_h <=0:\n       break? Or not, since k is within the allowed range.\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   total += perimeter\n\nWait, but wait. What about when current_w or current_h is 0? But according to the input constraints, k is such that the rings can be formed. So perhaps the loop will always have valid current_w and current_h.\n\nSo, proceed.\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3 1\nFor i=1:\ncurrent_w=3, current_h=3. perimeter=8. So output is 8.\n\nSample Input 2:\n7 9 1\nPerimeter is 2*(7+9)-4=32-4=28. Output is 28.\n\nSample Input 3:\n7 9 2\nFirst ring: 7,9 → 28. Second ring: 7-4=3,9-4=5 → 2*(3+5)-4=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if k is 3?\n\nSuppose w=11, h=11, k=3.\n\nRing 1: 11x11 → perimeter is 2*(22)-4=40.\n\nRing 2: 7x7 → 2*(14)-4=24.\n\nRing3: 3x3 → 8.\n\nTotal is 40+24+8=72.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nNow, coding:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\nCompute sum as described.\n\nPrint the sum as a string.\n\nSo the code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by bordering cells that are progressively inward from the edge of the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into `w x h` cells. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of an inner rectangle, which is smaller by 2 cells on each side compared to the previous ring. The number of cells in each ring can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted to avoid overcounting the corners.\n2. **Formula Derivation**: For each ring `i`, the dimensions of the inner rectangle are `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`. The number of cells in the perimeter of this rectangle is given by `2 * (width + height) - 4`, which accounts for the four corners being counted twice in the sum of the sides.\n3. **Summing Up**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the number of cells and accumulate the total.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height of the rectangle after accounting for the reduction due to previous rings.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: Use the derived formula to compute the number of cells in the current ring's perimeter.\n4. **Accumulate Total**: Sum the number of cells from all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells as a string.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and applying the perimeter formula, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the given constraints.",
