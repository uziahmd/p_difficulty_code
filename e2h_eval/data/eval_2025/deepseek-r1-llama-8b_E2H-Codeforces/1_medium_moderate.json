    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem called \"Golden Plate\". Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a plate. The plate is a rectangle split into w x h cells. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle inside. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nThe task is to compute the total number of gilded cells after adding k rings.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how each ring contributes to the total count.\n\nFor each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to calculate the number of cells in that ring and sum them all up.\n\nWait, what's the structure of each ring? The i-th ring is the border of a rectangle that's (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Because each ring reduces both width and height by 2 on each side, right? Because for each ring, we go in two cells on each side—left and right, top and bottom.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For example, the first ring is the outermost border. The rectangle is w x h. So, the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). Because for a rectangle with width w and height h, the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2) since the four corners are counted once each.\n\nWait no, wait. Wait, when you have a rectangle of w rows and h columns, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). Because for each row, it's h cells, but the top and bottom rows contribute h each, and the middle rows contribute 2 cells each (left and right). So total is 2*h + (w-2)*2 = 2(w + h - 2).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut then, for each subsequent ring, the rectangle is smaller by 2*(i-1) on each side. So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are w_i = w - 2*(i-1)*2? Or wait, maybe I should model it differently.\n\nWait, the i-th ring is based on the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Because each ring adds a border that's 1 cell thick, so each dimension decreases by 2*(i) for each ring before. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the first ring is the outermost. So the rectangle is w x h. The second ring is two cells away, meaning the inner rectangle is (w - 4) x (h -4), because subtracting 2 from each side (left and right) for each dimension. Wait, no: for each ring, both width and height decrease by 2 on each side, so for i rings, the width is w - 2*i*2? Or perhaps for the i-th ring, the dimensions are w - 2*(i)*2 and h - 2*i*2?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Let's say w=7, h=9, k=2. As per the sample input, the output is 28 for k=1, and 40 for k=2.\n\nFor the first ring (k=1), the perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThen, for the second ring, the rectangle is (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5. The perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So adding that to 28 gives 40, which matches the sample.\n\nSo yes, for each ring i, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)).\n\nThus, for each ring i, the number of cells is 2*( (w_i + h_i - 2 ) ), where w_i = w -4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1).\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. If either w_i or h_i is less than or equal to 0, then this ring can't exist. But according to the problem statement, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. So we don't need to handle that.\n   d. Compute the perimeter as 2*(w_i + h_i - 2)\n   e. Add this to the total.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps to code this.\n\nWe'll read the input as three integers: w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nLoop for i from 1 to k:\n   compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n   add perimeter to total\n\nFinally, output total.\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Because for a perimeter, you need at least 3 rows or columns. Because, for example, if w_i is 1, then the perimeter would be 2*(1 + h_i -2) = 2*(h_i -1). But that might not make sense because a single column can't have a perimeter. So in the problem statement, it says that k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. So our code doesn't need to handle cases where current_w or current_h are less than 3.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nLet's test it against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3 1\nFor i=1: current_w=3, current_h=3. perimeter= 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Output is 8.\n\nSample Input 2:\n7 9 1\ni=1: 2*(7+9-2)=28.\n\nSample Input 3:\n7 9 2\ni=1: 28, i=2: current_w=3, current_h=5. perimeter= 2*(3+5-2)= 12. Total 40.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. The perimeter is 2*(5+5-2)=16. So output is 16.\n\nWhat if k is more than possible? According to the problem statement, the constraints on k ensure that it's valid. So our code can proceed.\n\nNow, in Python, the code is straightforward.\n\nRead the input line, split into w, h, k.\n\nCompute the sum as described.\n\nPrint the sum as a string.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead the input as a single line, split into w, h, k.\n\nCompute the sum.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but in the problem statement, it says the input is a single line with three integers. So in the code, we can read the entire line, split into parts, and convert to integers.\n\nSo:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting it against the samples:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nYes.\n\nSample 2: 7 9 1 → 28.\n\nSample 3: 7 9 2 → 40.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=1 → 16.\n\nAnother case: w=11, h=15, k=3.\n\nRing 1: 11x15 → 2*(11+15-2)= 2*24=48.\n\nRing 2: 7x11 → 2*(7+11-2)=2*16=32. Total 80.\n\nRing 3: 3x7 → 2*(3+7-2)= 2*8=16. Total 96.\n\nSo output is 96.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring forms a border around a rectangle. The first ring is the outermost border, the second ring is two cells inside the first, and so on. Each ring reduces both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 units (2 cells on each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells can be calculated using the perimeter of the rectangle it forms. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by `2 * (w + h - 2)`.\n3. **Iterative Summation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring. The width and height decrease by 4 units for each subsequent ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases as specified.",
