His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about Vasya's Olympiad results. The teacher knows that Vasya's total points (sum of first and second tour) are at least x. But the teacher has the results of the two tours, but without knowing which participant got which result. The task is to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten based on how the points are combined.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is that the participants are ranked by their total points in a non-increasing order. If two people have the same total, the jury can arrange them in any order, so for the best and worst possible placements, we need to consider the scenarios where Vasya is placed as high as possible or as low as possible.\n\nThe input gives n participants. For each participant, there are a_i and b_i points from the two tours. But the a and b arrays are given in arbitrary order; we don't know which a corresponds to which b.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the a array is the first tour points, and the b array is the second tour points, but they're not necessarily aligned per participant. So, each participant i has a score a_i from the first tour and b_j from the second, but all possible pairings are possible except that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nWait no. No, wait. Wait, the problem says that each participant participated in both tours, but the results are given as two separate lists. So, the a list contains the first tour points of all participants, and the b list contains the second tour points, but not in any particular order. So, each participant's total is some a_i + b_j, but each a and b is used exactly once across all participants.\n\nSo, the problem is that the a and b arrays are given, and for each possible pairing (matching each a_i to a b_j), the sum a_i + b_j will be the total for that participant. Then, when all sums are computed, the participants are sorted in descending order, and we have to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve.\n\nBut wait, Vasya is one specific participant. So, among all possible permutations (pairings) of a and b, we need to find the minimal and maximal possible rank that Vasya could have, given that his sum is at least x.\n\nWait, no. Because the a and b are given in arbitrary order, but each a_i is assigned to exactly one b_j. So, the sum for each participant is a permutation where each a is matched to a unique b. So, the problem is to assign each a to a b such that the sum is a permutation of a's and b's.\n\nWait, but the a's and b's are given as separate lists. So, for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but each a and each b must be used exactly once. So, it's a bipartite matching: each a is paired with exactly one b.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is generate all possible valid pairings between a and b, compute the sum for each participant, sort them, and then for each possible pairing, determine where Vasya's sum would place him.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, so the number of possible pairings is n! which is way too big to handle directly. So, we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps we don't need to generate all possible pairings. Maybe there's a way to model this as a bipartite graph and find the optimal pairings that minimize or maximize Vasya's rank.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best and worst possible positions can be determined by considering certain properties of the a and b arrays, without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about what determines Vasya's rank. Vasya's total is s = a_i + b_j, where i and j are such that s >=x. We need to find the best possible rank (as high as possible) and the worst possible rank (as low as possible) over all possible pairings.\n\nFor the best rank, we want as few participants as possible to have a total higher than s, and as many as possible to have a total less than or equal to s.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst rank, we want as many participants as possible to have a higher or equal total, and as few as possible lower.\n\nBut since the a and b are not fixed per participant, it's challenging.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible assignment of a's to b's, calculate the sum for each participant, then compute Vasya's position. Then, find the minimal and maximal possible positions across all assignments.\n\nBut with n=105, this is impossible because the number of possible assignments is 105! which is way beyond anything.\n\nSo, we",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given as two separate lists, but we don't know which participant corresponds to which result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: Each participant's total score is the sum of their points from both tours. The goal is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have given that his total is at least `x`.\n\n2. **Pairing Points**: Each participant's first tour points (list `a`) must be paired with second tour points (list `b`). The challenge is to find the optimal pairing that either maximizes or minimizes Vasya's rank.\n\n3. **Maximizing Rank (Best Possible Place)**: To achieve the highest rank, we need to minimize the number of participants with a higher total score than Vasya. This can be done by ensuring Vasya's total is as high as possible while others' totals are as low as possible.\n\n4. **Minimizing Rank (Worst Possible Place)**: Conversely, to achieve the lowest rank, we need as many participants as possible to have a higher total score than Vasya.\n\n5. **Sorting and Pairing**: By sorting the lists `a` and `b`, we can efficiently find the optimal pairings that help us determine the best and worst ranks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n\n    # Generate all possible pairs and compute sums for each participant\n    # But since n can be up to 105, it's impossible, so we need a smarter approach.\n\n    # For the best possible rank:\n    # We want Vasya's total to be as large as possible, and others as small as possible.\n    # So, sort a and b in ascending order, and match smallest a with largest b, etc.\n    # Wait, no.
