Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about matching left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. Each boot has a color which is a lowercase letter or '?'. Two boots are compatible if they are the same specific color, or one is '?'.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible. Also, each boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\nThe input gives two strings, l for left boots and r for right boots, each of length n.\n\nI need to output the maximum number of pairs and list them in some order.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the constraints: n can be up to 150,000, so any O(n^2) approach is out of the question. We need something efficient, probably O(n) or O(n log n).\n\nSo, the challenge is to find as many compatible pairs as possible, ensuring that each left and right boot is used only once.\n\nWait, but how? Because for each left boot, we need to find a right boot that's compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut considering all possibilities directly would be too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: group the left and right boots by their color (or '?'), and then for each possible color combination, calculate how many pairs can be formed between lefts of that color and rights of another compatible color.\n\nWait, but that might not capture the maximum because the optimal solution could involve multiple different color combinations.\n\nAnother approach: model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right boots if they are compatible. Then, the problem reduces to finding a maximum matching in this bipartite graph. However, with n=150,000, the standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp would be too slow because the number of edges could be O(n^2), which is way too big.\n\nSo, that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps a greedy approach is needed, but what's the correct way to maximize the number of pairs?\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of pairs is determined by the sum of the minimum of counts for each compatible pair of colors. But that doesn't account for the fact that using a certain color in one pair might affect others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each color c on the left, how many rights of compatible colors are available.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Each left and right can be considered as nodes, and an edge exists if they are compatible. The problem is to select as many edges as possible such that no two edges share a left or right node. This is exactly the maximum bipartite matching problem. But again, with n=15e4, this isn't feasible with standard methods.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nWhat if we process the left and right arrays, and for each possible color c, count how many lefts are c and how many rights are compatible with c.\n\nWait, but the compatible rights for a left color c are those that are either equal to c or '?'. So for a left color 'a', the compatible right colors are 'a' and '?'.\n\nSo, for each left color c_l, the compatible right colors are c_r = c_l or '?'.\n\nSimilarly, for each right color c_r, the compatible left colors are c_l = c_r or '?'.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a set of pairs (l_i, r_j) where:\n\n- For each l_i, it is paired with exactly one r_j.\n- For each r_j, it is paired with exactly one l_i.\n- The colors are compatible.\n\nThis seems similar to a bipartite graph where edges are between compatible pairs, and we need to find a maximum matching.\n\nBut again, the size is too big.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a bipartitioned graph where we can represent the left and right nodes in a way that allows us to compute the maximum matching efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can think of the problem in terms of frequencies. For each color c on the left, we can collect all lefts with that color and find the maximum possible matches with rights that are either c or ?.\n\nBut how to manage this without overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps we can process the colors in a certain order, say, from the most frequent to least, and greedily match as many as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that would always yield the optimal result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a flow network where each left node is connected to right nodes that are compatible, and then compute the maximum flow. But with 15e4 nodes on each side, the network would be huge, making flow computation impractical.\n\nHmm, perhaps another angle: since the compatibility is based on colors, maybe we can represent the left and right nodes by their colors, and compute how much we can match between these color groups.\n\nFor",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots such that each pair consists of one left and one right boot with compatible colors.

This is done by checking each compatible right color in descending order of their potential to form pairs.\n5. **Tracking Usage**: We maintain boolean arrays to track which left and right boots have been used in forming pairs to ensure each boot is used at most once.\n6. **Output**: Finally, we print the maximum number of pairs and the pairs themselves.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently form the maximum number of compatible pairs by leveraging frequency counts and a greedy strategy to prioritize the most promising color combinations first.",
