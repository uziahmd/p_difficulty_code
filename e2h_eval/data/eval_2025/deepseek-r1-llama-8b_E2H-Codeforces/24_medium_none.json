She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has n tabs open in her browser. The tabs are numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right within the currently open tabs, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to model what actions she can take and figure out the optimal sequence to minimize time.\n\nLet me think about the steps she needs to take. There are a few possibilities here.\n\nFirst, she might need to move the cursor to certain positions to close the necessary tabs. For example, if some tabs to the left of l are open, she needs to get the cursor to a position where she can close them. Similarly for the right side beyond r.\n\nSo, the steps would involve:\n\n1. Moving the cursor to a position where she can close the left tabs.\n2. Closing those left tabs.\n3. Possibly moving again to another position to close the right tabs.\n4. Closing those right tabs.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes she can do both closures in one go without moving too much, depending on the initial position.\n\nI think the key is to calculate the minimal steps for each possible scenario.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nCase 1: All tabs outside [l, r] are already closed. Then the answer is 0.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if initially there are no such tabs, which isn't the case unless l=1 and r=n, and pos is within them. Or maybe not even that because maybe some tabs are already closed?\n\nWait no, the problem says she needs to leave exactly the tabs l to r open. So any other tabs must be closed.\n\nSo first, let's see if she needs to close tabs to the left of l or to the right of r.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- If there are tabs to the left of l, she needs to close them. To do that, she can move the cursor to l, then close left (which will close all tabs to the left of l). But wait, no—closing left when at l will close all tabs before l, which includes any that were previously open.\n\nSimilarly, for the right side, she needs to get to r+1 (but wait, no, after closing the left, the right may have changed. Hmm, this complicates things.)\n\nWait, perhaps we should model the process as two separate steps: first, closing the left, then closing the right, or vice versa, whichever is more efficient.\n\nBut the order matters because closing one side changes the available tabs, which affects the movement for the other side.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to determine the minimal steps required to close the left and the right, considering the movement and the closure actions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine whether we need to close tabs to the left of l. Let's call this condition left_needed = (l > 1).\n\nSimilarly, right_needed = (r < n).\n\nIf neither is needed, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for the left closure:\n\nTo close the left, she needs to move to position l and then perform the close-left action. But wait, perhaps she can be already in a position that allows her to close left without moving all the way.\n\nWait, no. Because when she's at position i, closing left will close all tabs to the left of i. So to close all the left tabs, she just needs to be at l, because any tabs left of l will be closed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, suppose l is 3, and she is at position 5. If she closes left, that would close tabs 1,2,3,4? Or does it stop at a?\n\nWait, according to the problem statement: When she closes left, all tabs from a to i-1 are closed. So a is the current minimum index of unclosed tabs.\n\nSo when she hasn't closed anything yet, a is 1, b is n.\n\nWhen she moves to l, and then closes left, all tabs from 1 to l-1 are closed.\n\nSimilarly, if she is at position r and closes right, all tabs from r+1 to n are closed.\n\nBut sometimes, she can close left and right in any order, but the movement required depends on which side she chooses first.\n\nSo the idea is to compute the minimal steps for both possible orders: first close left, then close right; or first close right, then close left.\n\nThen choose the minimal between the two.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think through the steps.\n\nFor each possible order:\n\nOrder 1: Close left first, then close right.\n\nSteps:\n\na) Move to l. The number of steps is |pos - l|.\n\nb) Close left: 1 step.\n\nc) Now, after closing left, the new a is l, and the b remains as original b unless some right tabs were closed. Wait, no—closing left doesn't affect the right side. So after closing left, the available tabs are from l to r, assuming that the right hasn't been closed yet.\n\nWait, no. The right hasn't been closed, so after closing left, the tabs are l, l+1, ..., r, r+1, ..., n.\n\nWait, no: because she hasn't done the right closure yet.\n\nWait, no. After closing left, the available tabs are l, l+1, ..., b, where b was the previous maximum. So after closing left, the a becomes l, and b remains the same until she closes the right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, when she closes left, all tabs to the left of current position are closed. So when she's at l, closing left will close 1..l-1. So after that, the available tabs are l, l+1, ..., current_b.\n\nBut current_b was initially n, but if she hasn't closed the right, then after closing left, the available tabs are l to n.\n\nThen, to close the right, she needs to be at r. But now, the current a is l, so the right closure when at r will close r+1 to current_b.\n\nWait, but current_b is still n. So she needs to move from l to r, which is |r - l| steps.\n\nThen, close right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps for this order: |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\nWait, no: because after closing left, the a is l, so when moving to r, it's (r - l) steps.\n\nWait, but after closing left, the available tabs are l, l+1, ..., n. So moving from l to r is (r - l) steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo total steps for this order: |pos - l| (to reach l) + 1 (close left) + (r - l) (move to r) + 1 (close right). Total: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, that's (r - l + |pos - l|) + 2.\n\nSimilarly, for the other order: first close right, then close left.\n\nSteps:\n\na) Move to r: |pos - r| steps.\n\nb) Close right: 1 step.\n\nc) Now, the available tabs are 1..r.\n\nd) Then, move to l: |l - r| steps (since a is now 1, so moving from r to l requires (r - l) steps? Wait, wait: after closing right, the available tabs are 1..r.\n\nSo the cursor is at r. To get to l, since a is 1, she can move left by (r - l) steps.\n\nSo step c is (r - l) steps.\n\ne) Close left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps for this order: |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\nWhich is (|pos - r| + (r - l)) ) + 2.\n\nWait, but wait: when you close right first, the a becomes 1, because the right tabs beyond r are closed.\n\nWait, no: when you're at r, and you close right, it closes r+1 to b (which was n). So after that, the available tabs are 1 to r.\n\nSo when moving to l, it's moving from r to l, which is (r - l) steps.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each possible order (left first, right first), compute the steps and choose the minimal.\n\nBut wait, what if l is equal to r? Then, she doesn't need to do anything. Because the segment is a single tab, and she doesn't need to close anything else.\n\nWait, yes. So that's an edge case.\n\nAnother edge case: when l = 1 and r = n. Then, she doesn't need to close any tabs. So output is 0.\n\nWait, but if the initial position is not l, but she has to close nothing. So yes, output 0.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nCheck if l == r. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, check if left_needed and/or right_needed.\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nElse, compute steps for both orders (left then right, right then left), and pick the minimal.\n\nBut also, sometimes it's better to not do both if one side is already covered.\n\nWait, no. Because she needs to close both sides, except when l is 1 and r is n.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\nLeft_needed: 2>1 → yes.\n\nRight_needed: 4<6 → yes.\n\nSo she has to do both.\n\nSo for the two orders:\n\nOrder 1: left then right.\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 step.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nThen, from 2 to 4: 2 steps.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother order: right then left.\n\nMove from 3 to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nNow, a is 1, and the current available tabs are 1-4.\n\nThen, move from 4 to 2: 2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSame.\n\nSo in that case, both orders give same steps.\n\nAnother sample: input 6 3 1 3.\n\nShe needs to close the right side (tabs 4,5,6).\n\nSo steps:\n\nOption 1: close right first.\n\nMove to 3: no steps needed (already there).\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nThat's it. Because after closing right, the available tabs are 1-3, which is the desired.\n\nSo total steps 1.\n\nWhich is the sample.\n\nSo the code needs to consider both options and choose the minimal.\n\nAnother test case: 5 2 1 5. She needs to leave all tabs open. So no steps needed.\n\nSo the code must handle these cases.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute whether left and right are needed.\n\nIf none, output 0.\n\nElse, compute steps for both orders and pick the minimal.\n\nBut wait, what if she can close both in a single movement? Like, perhaps she can first close left, then without moving, close right. Or vice versa.\n\nBut I think the two-step approach covers that.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a scenario where she can do both in less steps by combining some movements.\n\nBut I think the two-step approach is sufficient.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Check if l == r: output 0.\n\n2. Else, check if l > 1 (needs to close left) and r < n (needs to close right). If neither is needed, output 0.\n\n3. Else, compute steps for both orders:\n\n   a) Close left then right:\n\n      i. Steps to move to l: abs(pos - l).\n\n      ii. Close left: +1.\n\n      iii. Steps to move to r: (r - l) (because after closing left, the a is l, so moving from l to r is r-l steps.\n\n      iv. Close right: +1.\n\n      total_steps = (i + ii + iii + iv) = (abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2).\n\n   b) Close right then left:\n\n      i. Steps to move to r: abs(pos - r).\n\n      ii. Close right: +1.\n\n      iii. Steps to move to l: (r - l) steps (since after closing right, a is 1, so moving from r to l is r - l steps.\n\n      iv. Close left: +1.\n\n      total_steps = (i + ii + iii + iv) = (abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2).\n\n4. Choose the minimal of a and b.\n\nBut wait, in the sample where l is 2 and r is 4, and pos is 3, the steps for both orders are the same.\n\nBut what about cases where l and r are such that the steps differ.\n\nAnother test case: let's say n=7, pos=4, l=2, r=5.\n\nLeft needed: 2>1 → yes.\n\nRight needed:5<7 → yes.\n\nOrder 1: left then right.\n\nMove to 2: 4-2=2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nMove to 5: 5-2=3 steps.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal: 2+1+3+1=7.\n\nOrder 2: right then left.\n\nMove to 5: 5-4=1.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nMove to 2: 5-2=3 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal: 1+1+3+1=6.\n\nSo in this case, the second order is better.\n\nSo the code would compute both and pick the minimal.\n\nThus, the code needs to compute both possible orders and take the minimal.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nIf l == r: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   left_needed = (l > 1)\n\n   right_needed = (r < n)\n\n   if not left_needed and not right_needed: output 0.\n\n   else:\n\n      compute steps_order1 = (abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2)\n\n      compute steps_order2 = (abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2)\n\n      minimal_steps = min(steps_order1, steps_order2)\n\n      output minimal_steps.\n\nWait, but wait: in the first order, after closing left, the movement from l to r is (r - l) steps. But in the second order, after closing right, moving from r to l is (r - l) steps.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nWait, but what about when l is larger than r? No, because l <= r as per the input.\n\nSo, in the code, for the two steps, it's always (r - l) steps for the movement.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as outlined.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4.\n\nsteps_order1: |3-2|=1 + (4-2)=2 → 3 → +2 steps → total 5.\n\nsteps_order2: |3-4|=1 + (4-2)=2 → 3 → +2 steps → total 5.\n\nSo min is 5.\n\nSample Input 2:6 3 1 3.\n\nright_needed is true, left_needed is false.\n\nSo steps_order1: |3-1|=2 + (3-1)=2 → 4 → +2 → total 6.\n\nsteps_order2: |3-3|=0 + 2 → 2 → +2 → total 4.\n\nWait, but sample output is 1.\n\nWait, wait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, right_needed is true, left_needed is false. So she only needs to close the right.\n\nSo, she can directly close right without needing to close left.\n\nWait, in our earlier logic, we considered cases where both left and right are needed, but in this case, only right is needed.\n\nAh! So my initial approach was incorrect.\n\nBecause in this case, she only needs to close right, so the steps would be:\n\nmove to r (which is 3) → 0 steps.\n\nclose right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps 1.\n\nSo, my earlier approach, which assumes that both left and right need to be closed, is incorrect.\n\nSo I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nSo, the initial logic needs to be adjusted.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n\nWe need to close all tabs outside [l, r]. So:\n\n- For the left side: any tabs < l must be closed.\n\n- For the right side: any tabs > r must be closed.\n\nBut, Luba can close either side first, and perhaps not both.\n\nWait, but if l is 1 and r is 3, then she doesn't need to close any left tabs (since l is 1), but she needs to close the right.\n\nSo, in that case, she just needs to close the right.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nCompute whether left needs to be closed (if l > 1) and right needs to be closed (if r < n).\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nIf one, compute steps to close that side.\n\nIf both, compute steps for both orders.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nIf l == r: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   left_close = (l > 1)\n\n   right_close = (r < n)\n\n   if not left_close and not right_close: output 0.\n\n   elif left_close and right_close:\n\n       compute both orders and choose the minimal.\n\n   else:\n\n       if left_close:\n\n           steps = steps_to_close_left.\n\n       else if right_close:\n\n           steps = steps_to_close_right.\n\nSo, how to compute steps_to_close_left and steps_to_close_right.\n\nWait, when only left needs to be closed.\n\nShe needs to get to l, close left, then that's it.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the right side is still open, but she doesn't need to do anything about it because it's already within [l, r].\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Move from pos to l: steps = |pos - l|.\n\n2. Close left: 1 step.\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if only right needs to be closed:\n\n1. Move from pos to r: steps = |pos - r|.\n\n2. Close right: 1 step.\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the a is l, but that doesn't affect the right.\n\nWait, no, because after closing left, the right is still open unless she also closes right. But in this case, she doesn't need to.\n\nSo, in the case where she only needs to close left, the steps are simply |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, for right.\n\nSo, in the sample input 2: 6 3 1 3.\n\nOnly right needs to be closed.\n\nSo steps: move to 3 (0 steps), close right (1 step): total 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle four cases:\n\n1. Both left and right needed: compute both orders.\n\n2. Only left needed: compute steps to l and close left.\n\n3. Only right needed: compute steps to r and close right.\n\nSo, the code structure should be:\n\nif l == r:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needed = (l > 1)\n    right_needed = (r < n)\n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n    elif left_needed and right_needed:\n        # compute both orders\n        order1 = (abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2)\n        order2 = (abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2)\n        print(min(order1, order2))\n    elif left_needed:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    else:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\nWait, but in the case where only left is needed, is that all?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose l is 3, r is 5, n is 10. So she needs to close tabs 1,2,6-10.\n\nSo, she needs to close left.\n\nShe moves to 3: steps |pos -3|.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nAfter that, she doesn't need to do anything else, because the right is already within l and r.\n\nWait, no, she needs to close the right side as well, because r is 5 and n is 10.\n\nOh wait, right, because r <n. So in this case, right is also needed.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles the case when both are needed.\n\nBut what about when only left is needed and right is not needed.\n\nWait, right is not needed only when r >=n. But that can't happen because r <=n.\n\nWait, no, r can be n.\n\nIn that case, r <n is false, so right_needed is false.\n\nSo, for example, n=5, r=5.\n\nSo, in that case, if l is 2, then left_needed is true, right_needed is false.\n\nSo, she only needs to close left.\n\nSo, steps: |pos - l| +1.\n\nSo, the code correctly captures that.\n\nThus, the code seems to cover all cases.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=5.\n\nleft_needed: 2>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed: 5 <5 → no.\n\nSo steps: |3-2| +1 = 1 +1 =2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=4, l=1, r=3.\n\nleft_needed: 1>1 → no.\n\nright_needed: 3<5 → yes.\n\nSo steps: |4-3| +1=1+1=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=3, r=4.\n\nleft_needed: 3>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed:4<5 → yes.\n\nSo, both needed.\n\nCompute order1 and order2.\n\norder1: move to 3 (5→3: 2 steps) +1 → 3 steps. Then move to 4 (1 step) +1 → total 2+1+1+1=5.\n\norder2: move to 4 (5→4:1 step) +1 → 2 steps. Then move to 3 (4→3:1 step) +1 → total 1+1+1+1=4.\n\nSo min is 4.\n\nSo, the code would output 4.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nSo, now, implementing this in Python.\n\nThe code will read four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nHandle the cases as above.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input line as four integers.\n\nCheck if l == r: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   left_needed = (l > 1)\n\n   right_needed = (r < n)\n\n   if not left_needed and not right_needed: print 0.\n\n   elif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n       order1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n       order2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n       print(min(order1, order2))\n\n   elif left_needed:\n\n       print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n\n   else:\n\n       print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nTesting against the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4.\n\nBoth needed.\n\norder1: 3-2=1 + 2 + 2 → 5.\n\norder2: 3-4=1 + 2 + 2 →5.\n\nPrint 5.\n\nSample 2:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nOnly right needed.\n\nsteps: 3-3=0 +1 → 1.\n\nSample3:\n\n5 2 1 5.\n\nNo left or right needed. Print 0.\n\nAnother test case where both are needed but order2 is better.\n\nLike n=7, pos=4, l=2, r=5.\n\norder1: 4-2=2 +3 +2=7.\n\norder2: 4-5=1 +3 +2=6.\n\nSo code picks 6.\n\nAnother test case where only right is needed.\n\nn=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\nright_needed: 3 <5 → yes.\n\nsteps: 3-3=0 +1 → 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4.\n\nleft_needed: 2>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed:4<5 → yes.\n\norder1: 1→2 (1 step) +1 →2. Then 2→4 (2 steps) +1 →5 steps total.\n\norder2: 1→4 (3 steps) +1 →4. Then 4→2 (2 steps) +1 →7 steps.\n\nSo min is 5.\n\nSo code would correctly output 5.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",

The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and actions to minimize the time taken.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closing Tabs**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` or to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Handle Special Cases**: If `l` is equal to `r`, no tabs need to be closed, so the result is 0 seconds.\n3. **Calculate Steps for Each Scenario**:\n   - **Both Sides Need Closing**: Compute the steps required for both possible orders of closing (left first then right, and right first then left) and choose the minimal.\n   - **Only Left Side Needed**: Calculate the steps to move to `l` and close the left tabs.\n   - **Only Right Side Needed**: Calculate the steps to move to `r` and close the right tabs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == r:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needed = l > 1\n    right_needed = r < n\n\n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n    elif left_needed and right_needed:\n        order1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        order2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        print(min(order1, order2))\n    elif left_needed:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    else:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Special Case Handling**: If `l` equals `r`, no tabs need closing, so output 0.\n2. **Determine Tab Closure Needs**: Check if tabs exist before `l` or after `r`.\n3. **Compute Steps for Both Sides**: If both sides need closing, calculate steps for both possible orders and choose the minimal.\n4. **Single Side Closure**: If only one side needs closing, compute the steps required to move to the respective end and close the tabs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal steps required by considering all possible scenarios and choosing the optimal path.",
