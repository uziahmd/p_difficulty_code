Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The definition they give is specific. So, Valera's paper is a square with n x n letters, where n is odd. The letters form an 'X' if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, for each test case, I need to:\n\n- Check that the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is all the same character.\n- Check that the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) is all the same character.\n- Ensure that both diagonals have the same character. Wait, no: the problem says both diagonals are the same. So the diagonal and anti-diagonal must consist of the same letter each, but all the other cells must be another single letter.\n\nWait, let me re-read the condition.\n\nThe teacher thinks it's an \"X\" if:\n- On both diagonals, all letters are the same.\n- All other squares not on the diagonals contain the same letter, which is different from the diagonals.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Read n and the grid.\n2. For the grid, check the two diagonals:\n   a. Are all elements in the main diagonal (i == j) the same?\n   b. Are all elements in the anti-diagonal (i + j = n-1) the same?\n3. Also, check if the two diagonals have the same character. Because if they don't, then it's not an X.\n4. Then, for all the other cells (not on either diagonal), check if they are all the same character, which is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input provided:\n\nTest case 1: 5x5 grid. Let's see the first row is 'xooox', which is x o o o x. So main diagonal would be x, o, o, o, x. Wait, no, because for n=5, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). So the first row's last element is x, which is (0,4)—that's part of the anti-diagonal.\n\nBut in this test case, perhaps the diagonals are not all the same. Or maybe the other cells have a different pattern. So the output is NO.\n\nIn the second test case, n=3:\n\nThe grid is:\n\nw s w\ns w s\nw s w\n\nWait, no, wait the input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'. So the rows are 'wsw', 'sws', 'wsw'.\n\nMain diagonal is (0,0) = w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w. So all same.\n\nAnti-diagonal is (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w. So both diagonals are same, as 'w's.\n\nThen, the other cells are the ones not on the diagonals. So for a 3x3 grid, the cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Are they all the same? Looking at the grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w → cell (0,1) is s.\nRow 1: s w s → cells (1,0) is s, (1,2) is s.\nRow 2: w s w → cell (2,1) is s.\nSo all non-diagonal cells are s, which is different from w. So it's a valid X, so output YES.\n\nThird test case: n=3. Grid is x p x / p x p / x p e. Wait, no, the third line is 'xpe', so row 2 is x p e.\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) is x, (1,1) is x, (2,2) is e. So the main diagonal is x, x, e. Not all same. So condition fails. So output is NO.\n\nSo, how to approach coding this.\n\nFirst, read the grid. Since each line is a string, I can represent the grid as a list of lists or just a list of strings. Probably, for each row, we can process it as a string.\n\nNext, check the main diagonal: for i in 0..n-1, check grid[i][i] is the same as grid[0][0].\n\nSimilarly, check the anti-diagonal: for i in 0..n-1, check grid[i][n-1 - i] is the same as grid[0][n-1].\n\nAlso, the two diagonals must have the same character. So, after checking both, if the main diagonal's character is not equal to the anti-diagonal's, then it's invalid.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then check all other cells (not on either diagonal) to see if they are the same as each other and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n lines, each as a string. So grid is a list of n strings.\n3. Check main diagonal: collect all grid[i][i], check they are same. Let's call this diag_char.\n4. Check anti-diagonal: collect all grid[i][n-1-i], check they are same. Call this anti_diag_char.\n5. If diag_char != anti_diag_char, then return NO.\n6. Now, check that all non-diagonal cells are same as each other and not equal to diag_char.\n\nWait, but what about the non-diagonal cells? They must be all the same, and different from diag_char (since diag_char is same as anti_diag_char).\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j) where i !=j and i +j != n-1, check that grid[i][j] equals some common non-diagonal character, say 'other_char', which should be the same across all such cells.\n\nHow to find 'other_char'? Well, pick the first non-diagonal cell and assign it as 'other_char', then check all others.\n\nBut also, make sure that 'other_char' is not equal to diag_char.\n\nSo, steps:\n\na. Iterate through each cell in the grid.\nb. For each cell (i,j), if it's not on either diagonal, note its character.\nc. Collect all these characters. They should all be the same, and not equal to diag_char.\n\nBut wait, the non-diagonal cells could be empty. But since n is >=3, in a 3x3 grid, there are 4 non-diagonal cells (like a cross in the middle). So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4 in number.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if diag_char is None:\n        diag_char = grid[i][i]\n    else:\n        if grid[i][i] != diag_char:\n            # main diagonal not same, invalid\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nanti_diag_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n-1 -i\n    if anti_diag_char is None:\n        anti_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n    else:\n        if grid[i][j] != anti_diag_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nif diag_char != anti_diag_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check non-diagonal cells.\n\nnon_diag_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        non_diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diag_chars:\n    # This can only happen when n=1, but n is at least 3, so this won't occur.\n    pass\n\n# Check if all non_diag_chars are same, and not equal to diag_char.\n\nif len(set(non_diag_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif non_diag_chars[0] == diag_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but in the code above, for i and j loops, for each cell, we check whether it's on a diagonal. If not, we add to non_diag_chars.\n\nThen, check if all in non_diag_chars are same.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5, grid:\n\nxooox → row 0: x o o o x\noxoxo → row1: o x o x o\nsoxoo → row2: s o x o o\noxoxo → row3: o x o x o\nxooox → row4: x o o o x\n\nMain diagonal: grid[0][0] = x, grid[1][1]=x, grid[2][2]=x, grid[3][3]=x, grid[4][4]=x → all x.\n\nAnti-diagonal: grid[0][4] = x, grid[1][3] = x, grid[2][2] = x, grid[3][1] =x, grid[4][0] =x → all x.\n\nSo diag_char and anti_diag_char are same (x). Now check non-diagonal cells.\n\nFor each cell not on diagonals:\n\nFor example, cell (0,1) is 'o', (0,2)=o, etc.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nLooking at row 0: positions (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are o, o, o.\n\nRow1: (1,0)=o, (1,2)=o, (1,4)=o.\n\nRow2: (2,0)=s, (2,1)=o, (2,3)=o.\n\nRow3: (3,0)=o, (3,1)=x, (3,2)=o.\n\nWait, no, wait the grid for row3 is 'oxoxo' → indexes 0:o, 1:x, 2:o, 3:x, 4:o.\n\nSo for (3,1): x → which is on the main diagonal? No, because main diagonal is when i==j. i=3, j=1 → 3≠1, so it's a non-diagonal cell.\n\nWait, no, because (3,1) is on the anti-diagonal?\n\nWait, i + j = 3+1=4, which is n-1 is 4 (since n=5). So yes, it's on the anti-diagonal. So this cell is part of the anti-diagonal.\n\nWait, no: i=3, j=1. i +j =4, which is equal to n-1 (4). So it's on the anti-diagonal.\n\nSo, in the code, any cell where i==j OR i+j =n-1 is considered diagonal.\n\nSo in the code, for row3, column1: i=3, j=1. i != j, i+j =4 =n-1. So it's on anti-diagonal.\n\nThus, in the first sample input, the non-diagonal cells include:\n\n(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (1,4), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nWait, n=5, so for each cell:\n\nTotal cells:25.\n\nDiagonals: 5 +5 -1 (because center is counted once) → 9 cells.\n\nNon-diagonals: 25-9=16 cells.\n\nSo in the first sample, non_diag_chars includes 16 'o's and 's's.\n\nLooking back, for row0, (0,1) is 'o', (0,2) is 'o', (0,3) is 'o'.\n\nRow1: (1,0) is 'o', (1,2) is 'o', (1,4) is 'o'.\n\nRow2: (2,0) is 's', (2,1) is 'o', (2,3) is 'o'.\n\nRow3: (3,0) is 'o', (3,2) is 'o', (3,4) is 'o'.\n\nRow4: (4,0) is 'x' → wait no, (4,0) is x, but wait no, row4 is 'xooox' → indexes 0:x, 1:o, 2:o, 3:o,4:x.\n\nSo (4,0) is x. Is x on a diagonal? i=4, j=0: i !=j, i+j=4 → n-1 is 4, so yes, it's on anti-diagonal. So (4,0) is part of anti-diagonal.\n\nSo for non-diagonal cells in row4:\n\nj=1,2,3 → (4,1)=o, (4,2)=o, (4,3)=o.\n\nSo all these are 'o's except for (4,0) which is on anti-diagonal.\n\nSo in the non_diag_chars, what are the values?\n\nFrom row0: o, o, o.\n\nrow1: o, o, o.\n\nrow2: s, o, o.\n\nrow3: o, o, o.\n\nrow4: o, o, o.\n\nSo non_diag_chars has multiple 'o's and one 's' (from (2,0)).\n\nSo the set of non_diag_chars is {'o', 's'}, which means the condition fails. So output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample.\n\nn=3.\n\ngrid:\n\nwsw → row0: w s w.\n\nsws → row1: s w s.\n\nwsw → row2: w s w.\n\nMain diagonal: row0[0] =w, row1[1]=w, row2[2]=w. So diag_char is w.\n\nAnti-diagonal: row0[2]=w, row1[1]=w, row2[0]=w. So anti_diag_char is w. Same as diag.\n\nNow, non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nEach of these is s.\n\nSo non_diag_chars = ['s', 's', 's', 's'] → all same. So condition holds.\n\nThus, output is YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=3.\n\nGrid:\n\nx p x → row0: x p x.\n\np x p → row1: p x p.\n\nx p e → row2: x p e.\n\nMain diagonal: row0[0] =x, row1[1]=x, row2[2]=e. So diag_char is x and e → not same. So condition fails. Output is NO.\n\nSo code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=3, grid where main diagonal is 'a's, anti-diagonal is 'a's, and non-diagonals are all 'b's.\n\nThen, output is YES.\n\nCase 2: n=3, main diagonal is 'a's, anti-diagonal is 'b's. Then, since diag_char != anti_diag_char, output is NO.\n\nCase3: n=3, main diagonal is 'a's, anti-diagonal is 'a's, but non-diagonal cells have different letters. E.g., some 'b's and 'c's. Then, output is NO.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1? But according to the problem statement, n is >=3 and odd. So no need to handle n=1.\n\nWhat about when n is 5, and the diagonals are correct, but non-diagonals have varying letters?\n\nE.g., main and anti-diagonal are 'x's, but some non-diagonal cells are 'y's and others are 'z's. Then, non_diag_chars will have more than one unique value, so output is NO.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the non-diagonal cells can be any letter as long as they are all the same and not equal to diag_char.\n\nSo, in code, the steps are:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Read the grid.\n\n- Check main diagonal: all same. Else, NO.\n\n- Check anti-diagonal: all same. Else, NO.\n\n- Check if diag_char == anti_diag_char. Else, NO.\n\n- Collect all non-diagonal cells into a list.\n\n- Check if all are same, and not equal to diag_char.\n\nIf all these pass, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, the code structure is clear.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n: n = int(input())\n\nRead grid: grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\ndiag_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != diag_char:\n        if diag_char is None:\n            diag_char = grid[i][i]\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nWait, no. Because for each i, if it's the first element, set diag_char. For others, check. If any differs, output NO.\n\nSame for anti-diagonal.\n\nThen, compare diag_char and anti_diag_char.\n\nThen, collect non-diagonal cells.\n\nNow, code:\n\nAfter the above steps, the non-diagonal cells are collected.\n\nSo:\n\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if all are same.\n\nif not non_diag:\n    # impossible since n >=3\n    pass\nelse:\n    first = non_diag[0]\n    for c in non_diag:\n        if c != first:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    if first == diag_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but what if the non_diag list is empty? That's possible only if n is 1, which isn't allowed. So no need to handle.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\ndiag_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != diag_char:\n        if diag_char is None:\n            diag_char = grid[i][i]\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nanti_diag_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n - 1 - i\n    if grid[i][j] != anti_diag_char:\n        if anti_diag_char is None:\n            anti_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nif diag_char != anti_diag_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check non-diagonal cells\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diag:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check all same and not diag_char\nfirst = non_diag[0]\nfor c in non_diag:\n    if c != first:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\nif first == diag_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nHmm, that should work.\n\nLet me test it against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5.\n\ndiag_char is x.\n\nanti_diag_char is x.\n\nnon_diag has many o's and s.\n\nSo in the non_diag collection, the first is 'o'. Then, any cell that is not x and not on diagonal is checked.\n\nBut in the first sample, non_diag includes 'o's and 's'—so the code will detect that not all are same, so output is NO.\n\nSample 2: non_diag is all 's's. So code returns YES.\n\nSample3: main diagonal is x, e, x → no, so code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\naba\naaa\n\nWait, no. Main diagonal is a, a, a. Anti-diagonal is a, a, a.\n\nnon_diag cells are (0,1)=a, (1,0)=a, (1,2)=b, (2,1)=a.\n\nSo non_diag has a, a, b, a.\n\nThus, non_diag_chars are a, b, a. So len(set) is 2. Thus, condition fails, output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\ngrid:\n\naaa\nbbb\naaa\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, a → diag_char is a and b? Wait, no. For i=0: a, i=1: b, i=2: a. So diag_char is a for i=0, then i=1 is b → diag_char is initially a, then next cell is b, which is different. So code would print NO in the main diagonal check.\n\nSo code correctly handles this.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\ngrid:\n\naaa\naaa\naaa\n\ndiag_char is a, anti_diag_char is a.\n\nnon_diag cells are a, a, a, a. So code returns YES.\n\nYes, because all non-diagonal are same as each other, and same as each other.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in this case, non-diagonal cells are all a's. But diag_char is a. So code would check if non_diag's first (a) is equal to diag_char (a). So condition fails, output NO.\n\nAh right! Because in the problem statement, the non-diagonal cells must be a different letter from the diagonals.\n\nSo in this case, all cells are same as diag_char, which is invalid.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of strings. Each string is the row.\n\nSo in the code, reading via:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, for the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nThe code will process as follows:\n\nMain diagonal: all x's.\n\nAnti-diagonal: all x's.\n\nnon_diag includes various letters, including o and s.\n\nSo the non_diag list contains 'o's and 's's, so condition fails → output NO.\n\nSample2:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain and anti-diagonal are w's.\n\nnon_diag are all 's's → output YES.\n\nSample3:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, e → not same. So code exits early, output NO.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\naaa\naaa\naaa\n\nMain diagonal is a, a, a.\n\nAnti-diagonal is a, a, a.\n\nnon_diag is all a's.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nnon_diag is four a's.\n\nCheck: first is a.\n\nAll are a's.\n\nBut first (a) equals diag_char (a), so condition fails → output NO.\n\nWhich is correct, because the non-diagonal cells are same as the diagonals, which is invalid.\n\nSo, code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\naba\nbab\naba\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, a → not same. So code returns NO.\n\nThus, code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",

The grid must meet specific conditions for it to be considered as an \"X\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the size of the grid and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - Ensure that all elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are the same.\n   - Ensure that all elements on the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n3. **Compare Diagonals**: Check if the characters on both diagonals are the same.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Ensure that all cells not on either diagonal contain the same character, which is different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\ndiag_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != diag_char:\n        if diag_char is None:\n            diag_char = grid[i][i]\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nanti_diag_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n - 1 - i\n    if grid[i][j] != anti_diag_char:\n        if anti_diag_char is None:\n            anti_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nif diag_char != anti_diag_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check non-diagonal cells\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diag:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    exit()\n\nfirst = non_diag[0]\nfor c in non_diag:\n    if c != first:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\nif first == diag_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid size `n` and the grid itself are read from standard input.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: Iterate through each cell along the main diagonal and ensure all characters are the same.\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, iterate through each cell along the anti-diagonal and ensure all characters are the same.\n4. **Diagonal Comparison**: If the main and anti-diagonals do not have the same character, print \"NO\".\n5. **Non-Diagonal Cells Check**: Collect characters from cells not on either diagonal and ensure they are all the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n6. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, print \"YES\" if all conditions are met, otherwise print \"NO\".",
