Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. The string is ternary, consisting of '0's, '1's, and '2's. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1's, or between adjacent '1's and '2's. So, I can't directly swap a '0' with a '2', for example.\n\nHmm, the goal is to rearrange the string as much as possible using these swaps to get the smallest possible lex order. Let me think about what that implies.\n\nFirst, let's understand the allowed swaps. If I can swap '0' and '1's, then those two can be reordered among themselves. Similarly, '1's and '2's can be swapped. But '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped. So, how does this affect their positions?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem in terms of groups. Since '0's can only be swapped with '1's and vice versa, but not with '2's. So any '0's must stay in their relative order among themselves, but they can move past '1's. Similarly, '1's can move past '0's and '2's. Wait, no, because '1's can swap with '2's, so '1's can move past '2's as well. So perhaps the '0's can move past '1's, which can then move past '2's, allowing '0's to potentially reach positions after some '2's, but not the other way around.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because if there's a '0' followed by a '2', you can't directly swap them. But if there's a '1' in between, like '0 1 2', then the '0' can swap with the '1' to get '1 0 2', then the '1' can swap with '2' to get '1 2 0'. But wait, that's moving the '0' to the end, which is not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the '0' can move through '1's but not directly through '2's. Or maybe the '1's act as bridges.\n\nThis suggests that the relative order of '0's and '2's might matter. For example, if a '0' comes before a '2' in the original string, can we arrange them such that the '0' comes after the '2'? Probably not, because without a '1' in between, we can't swap them. So perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed, except when there are '1's in between.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the string is '0 1 2 0 2'. The first '0' can swap with '1's to get past them, but to get to the '2's, the '0' would need to move through '1's first. But once the '0' is after the '1's, it can't directly swap with the '2's. So maybe the '0's can only be reordered among themselves and with '1's, but '2's are separate unless there's a '1' involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps '0's and '2's are in fixed order relative to each other, but '1's can be moved anywhere. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the key is that '0's can only move past '1's, and '1's can move past '0's and '2's. So, the '0's can be arranged before all the '1's, and the '1's can be arranged before the '2's. But that might not capture the entire picture.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about this as a graph of possible swaps. Each character can be connected to others via the allowed swaps. So:\n\n- '0' can be swapped with '1' (adjacent), so they form a group.\n- '1' can be swapped with '2' (adjacent), so '1' is connected to both '0' and '2'.\n- Therefore, '0's, '1's, and '2's can be arranged in any order, as long as the relative order of '0's and '2's isn't changed unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, no. Because '0's and '2's can't be directly swapped. So, for example, if the string is \"02\", you can't swap them. So their relative order remains. But if the string is \"021\", then the '0' can swap with '2' via the '1' acting as a bridge. Let's see: \"021\" → can swap '2' and '1' to get \"012\", then swap '0' and '1' to get",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing allowed swap operations. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1's, or between adjacent '1's and '2's.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that '0's can only be swapped with '1's, and '1's can be swapped with '2's. This means that while '0's can move past '1's and '1's can move past '2's, '0's and '2's cannot directly swap positions. Therefore, the relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string must be preserved unless there's a '1' acting as a bridge. \n\nGiven this, the approach is:\n1. **Separate the characters into groups**: We can think of '0's, '1's, and '2's as separate groups where '0's can only move past '1's and '1's can only move past '2's.\n2. **Reorder within groups**: Since '0's can only be reordered among themselves relative to '1's, and '1's can be reordered relative to '2's, we can arrange each group to its optimal position in the final string.\n3. **Merge the groups optimally**: After arranging each group, we merge them in a way that results in the smallest lexicographical order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimal_ternary_string(s):\n    # Count the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n    count0 = s.count('0')\n    count1 = s.count('1')\n    count2 = s.count('2')\n    \n    # The minimal arrangement is 0s followed by 1s followed by 2s\n    # But since 0s can't directly swap with 2s, we have to interleave them through 1s\n    \n    # Create a list of all characters\n    arr = list(s)\n    \n    # Find all positions where 0s can be moved left or right through 1s\n    # Similarly for 2s moving right through 1s\n    \n    # The idea is to move all 0s as far left as possible, then 1s as far left as possible, then 2s\n    \n    # First pass: bring all 0s to the front, but they can only pass 1s\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == '0':\n            # Bring all 0s to the front, passing only 1s\n            j = i\n            while j < len(arr) and (arr[j] == '1' or (arr[j] == '0' and j == i)):\n                j += 1\n            # Now, from i to j-1, all are 0s or 1s\n            # Move the first 0 found to the current i\n            while j > i and (arr[j-1] == '1' or arr[j-1] == '0'):\n                # Check if current character is 0 and can be moved left\n                if arr[j-1] == '0':\n                    break\n                else:\n                    # Swap with previous character\n                    arr[j-1], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[j-1]\n                    i += 1\n                    j -= 1\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Second pass: bring all 1s to their position, considering 2s\n    # Wait, perhaps not.
