He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the 2n-2 strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of a certain string s of length n. The input gives all possible improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths from 1 to n-1), and I need to output a string where each character is 'P' or 'S', indicating whether the corresponding input string is a prefix or suffix.\n\nHmm, the key is that each string in the input is either a prefix, a suffix, both, or neither. But wait, according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that these strings form prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So each of them must be either a prefix or a suffix or both? Or maybe not, but the input is such that it's possible to find at least one possible s.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is exactly 2n-2 strings, which includes all the prefixes and suffixes. For each length l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So for each l, one is a prefix candidate, the other a suffix candidate.\n\nBut how do I determine which is which?\n\nI think the approach is to find all possible candidates for the full string s by considering the prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each possible s, check if all the given strings match the required prefixes and suffixes. Once I find an s that satisfies all conditions, I can assign the labels accordingly.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that the actual string s has length n. All the given strings are of length from 1 to n-1.\n\nEach possible s must have certain prefixes and suffixes. For example, the first character is a prefix, the last character is a suffix, the first two characters are a prefix, and the last two are a suffix, etc.\n\nSo for each possible s_candidate, I need to see if it correctly aligns with the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut trying all possible s_candidate might be feasible since n is up to 100. Wait, no, because n can be up to 100, but the number of possible s_candidate is 26^100, which is way too big. So that approach is impossible.\n\nAlternative approach: Find the minimal possible information that can determine s uniquely.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be determined by considering the longest possible common prefix among the candidates.\n\nWait, another idea: the prefixes and suffixes must form a consistent chain. For example, the prefix of length l must be a prefix of the prefix of length l+1. Similarly, the suffix of length l must be a suffix of the suffix of length l+1.\n\nWait, no. Because for a string s, the prefixes are s[0..l], and the suffixes are s[l..n-1]. So the longer prefixes must include the shorter ones as prefixes. For example, the prefix of length 3 must start with the prefix of length 2.\n\nSimilarly, the suffixes must also form a chain where longer suffixes are extensions of shorter ones.\n\nSo for all the given strings, the ones labeled as prefixes must form a chain where each is a prefix of the next, and similarly for suffixes.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the same string could be both a prefix and a suffix. Like, for example, \"aaa\" could have a prefix \"a\" and a suffix \"aa\".\n\nWait, but in the input, for each length l, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix, the other a suffix.\n\nSo the way to approach this is:\n\n1. For each possible l (from 1 to n-1), collect all the possible strings. For each l, choose one string as the prefix and the other as the suffix. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the possible s by considering the maximum possible prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s is the string whose prefixes and suffixes are exactly the given ones.\n\nWait, but how to reconstruct s.\n\nAnother approach: the prefixes must form a chain where each prefix of length l is a prefix of the prefix of length l+1, except for the last one. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nSo perhaps the correct s can be built by starting with the longest possible prefix and adding characters, or by ending with the longest possible suffix and adding characters.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let's consider all possible candidates for the full string s. For each possible s_candidate, check if all the given prefixes are indeed prefixes of s_candidate and all the given suffixes are indeed suffixes of s_candidate.\n\nBut again, n is up to 100, so this approach may not be feasible unless s_candidate can be determined in a smart way.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct s can be determined by finding the intersection of all possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be found by taking the longest possible prefix and the longest possible suffix and then seeing if they overlap correctly.\n\nWait, let me think about the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=5\n\nThe strings provided are:\n\n['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n\nWait, no, looking back, the input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nba\na\nabab\na\naba\nbaba\nab\naba\n\nWait, no, the input is given as 2n-2 lines. So for n=5, 8 lines. Each line is a string, possibly with newline characters.\n\nWait, in the first sample, the output is SPPSPSPS.\n\nWhich indicates that for each of the 8 strings, the first is a suffix, the second a prefix, third a prefix, fourth a suffix, fifth a prefix, sixth a suffix, seventh a prefix, eighth a suffix.\n\nThe note says that the only possible s is \"ababa\".\n\nSo for s = \"ababa\", the prefixes are:\n\na, ab, aba, abab, ababa.\n\nBut the given prefixes are 'a', 'abab', 'aba', etc. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, for the first sample, the prefixes provided are 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should group the strings by their lengths.\n\nFor n=5, the lengths go from 1 to 4.\n\nFor each l in 1..4:\n\nWe have two strings.\n\nFor l=1: 'a' and 'a' — so same string.\n\nFor l=2: 'ab' and 'ba'.\n\nFor l=3: 'aba' and 'aba'.\n\nFor l=4: 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nWait, but the input has 8 strings. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is 5.\n\nThen 8 lines:\n\nLine 2: 'ba'\n\nLine3: 'a'\n\nLine4: 'abab'\n\nLine5: 'a'\n\nLine6: 'aba'\n\nLine7: 'baba'\n\nLine8: 'ab'\n\nLine9: 'aba'\n\nWait, no, perhaps the input is:\n\nAfter n=5, 8 lines:\n\nStrings are 'ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba'.\n\nWait, but for l=1, we have two 'a's.\n\nFor l=2: 'ba' and 'ab' (since 'ab' is another string, but 'ab' is length 2).\n\nWait, but 'ab' is in the input, and 'ba' is another.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the two strings are the two possible options for that length.\n\nSo for l=1, the two are 'a' and 'a' — meaning that the only possible prefix and suffix for l=1 is 'a'.\n\nFor l=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'. So one must be the prefix of length 2, the other the suffix of length 2.\n\nWait, but how do I know which is which.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to find the correct s, then for each of the given strings, check whether it's a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut how to find s.\n\nWait, perhaps the s can be constructed as follows:\n\nFind all possible candidates for the full string s by considering the possible combinations of the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut that seems computationally intensive.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe correct s can be determined by considering the longest possible prefix and the longest possible suffix.\n\nBecause the longest prefix will be a prefix of all shorter prefixes, and the longest suffix will be a suffix of all shorter suffixes.\n\nSo, the process could be:\n\n1. For each possible l (from 1 to n-1), collect all the possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\n2. Among all the prefixes of length l, find the one that is the longest possible, i.e., the maximum length. Wait, but for l, the maximum possible is l itself. Wait, no, perhaps for each l, the correct prefix is the one that is a prefix of the longer prefixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to build s as follows:\n\n- Start by assuming that the longest possible prefix is the maximum among the given prefixes for each l. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, think about the entire set of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe correct s can be found by considering the fact that for each l, the prefix of length l must be a prefix of the prefix of length l+1, except for l = n-1.\n\nWait, but since the input provides for each l, two strings, one being the prefix, the other the suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, the prefix of length l is a substring of the prefix of length l+1.\n\nWait, but how can I find which one is the prefix and which is the suffix for each l.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the correct prefix is the string that is a prefix of some longer prefix for l+1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to construct s step by step.\n\nLet's think about building s.\n\nStart with the empty string.\n\nFor l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   The correct prefix of length l must be a prefix of the correct prefix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, the correct suffix of length l must be a suffix of the correct suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, the prefix is the first l characters of the s, and the suffix is the last l characters.\n\nSo, for l=1, the prefix is s[0], the suffix is s[-1].\n\nFor l=2, the prefix is s[0:2], the suffix is s[-2:].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each l, choosing the correct prefix and suffix such that for all l, the prefix of l is a prefix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l is a suffix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nMoreover, the full string s is built by concatenating the prefix of l=n-1 and the suffix of l=n-1, but ensuring that the suffix starts where the prefix ends.\n\nWait, yes! Because the prefix of l=n-1 is s[0:n-1], and the suffix of l=n-1 is s[n-1 - (n-1) + 1 : n] → wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the suffix of l is the last l characters of s.\n\nSo, the prefix of l=n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix is s[1...n-1]. Therefore, the prefix and suffix must agree on the overlapping part.\n\nAh, so for l = n-1, the suffix starts at position 1, while the prefix ends at position n-2. So the first character of the suffix (position 1) must be equal to the last character of the prefix (position n-2). Wait, no: the suffix of l=n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s, which is s[1 ... n-1]. The prefix of l=n-1 is s[0 ... n-2]. So the suffix's first character is s[1], and the prefix's last character is s[n-2]. These two must be the same because s is built as prefix + suffix, but wait, no.\n\nWait, no. Because the prefix is s[0 ... n-2], and the suffix is s[1 ... n-1]. So the entire s is prefix + suffix, but that would mean that the last character of the prefix is s[n-2], and the first character of the suffix is s[1], which may not be equal. Unless the entire string s is such that the prefix and suffix overlap correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s is the combination of the prefix of l=n-1 and the suffix of l=n-1, but the suffix starts after the prefix ends.\n\nWait, no. Because the prefix is s[0 ... n-2], and the suffix is s[1 ... n-1], which is overlapping. So the entire s is the prefix plus the suffix minus the overlapping part.\n\nWait, perhaps s = prefix + suffix, but the suffix starts at position 1. So the total length would be (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-2, but s has length n. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Because the suffix of l=n-1 is s[n-1 - (n-1) + 1 : n], which is s[1: n]. So the suffix is the substring from index 1 to n-1. So the prefix is s[0 ... n-2], and the suffix is s[1 ... n-1]. So when combined, s is the prefix followed by the suffix, but the suffix starts where the prefix ends.\n\nWait, but that would make s's length (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-2, which is longer than n. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the correct s.\n\nFor each l, the correct prefix of l is a prefix of the correct prefix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, for each l, the correct suffix of l is a suffix of the correct suffix of l+1.\n\nAdditionally, the prefix of l = n-1 must end with the suffix of l = n-1, but I'm not sure how.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s is the combination of the maximum-length prefix and the maximum-length suffix, ensuring that the suffix starts where the prefix ends.\n\nWait, but for the maximum-length prefix, it's the longest possible string that is a prefix for all the given prefixes of higher lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be built by taking the maximum possible prefix of l=n-1 and the maximum possible suffix of l=n-1, and then checking if they can form a valid s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s is such that the prefix of l is the same as the prefix of l+1 for all l < n-1.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, in the case where the string is 'ababa', the prefix for l=2 is 'ab', and for l=3 is 'aba', which is a prefix of 'abab' (but 'abab' is a prefix of l=4, which is 'ababa').\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be determined by considering the chain of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nHere's a plan:\n\n1. For each possible l (from 1 to n-1), collect all the possible strings. For each l, there are two strings, one of which is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\n2. The correct s must satisfy that for each l, the prefix of l is a prefix of the prefix of l+1 (if l+1 <= n-1), and the suffix of l is a suffix of the suffix of l+1.\n\n3. Also, the prefix of l=n-1 and the suffix of l=n-1 must combine to form s, but since the suffix of l=n-1 is the last n-1 characters, which starts at position 1 of s, the entire s is the prefix of l=n-1 followed by the suffix of l=n-1, but this would require that the suffix starts at position 1. So, the entire s is prefix + suffix, but this would imply that the length is (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-2, which is longer than n. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, the correct s is of length n. For l from 1 to n-1:\n\n- The prefix is s[0 ... l-1]\n\n- The suffix is s[n-l ... n-1]\n\nSo, for l=1, the prefix is s[0], suffix is s[n-1].\n\nFor l=2, prefix is s[0..1], suffix is s[n-2..n-1].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the correct s must satisfy that for each l, the prefix of l is a prefix of the prefix of l+1 (which is the same as s[0..l]), and the suffix of l is a suffix of the suffix of l+1 (which is s[n-l-1..n-1]).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the s_candidate by building it step by step, ensuring that each step adds a character that is compatible with the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s is uniquely determined by the given prefixes and suffixes. So, for each l, the correct prefix is the one that is the longest possible prefix for that l, and similarly for the suffix.\n\nWait, but how to find which of the two strings for each l is the prefix.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe correct s must have its prefixes and suffixes matching the given ones. So, for each possible l, the correct prefix is the string that is a prefix of the correct prefix of l+1.\n\nSo, for l=1, the correct prefix is s[0], which must be a prefix of the correct prefix for l=2.\n\nSimilarly, the correct prefix for l=2 must be a prefix of the correct prefix for l=3, and so on.\n\nSo, the correct prefix for l=1 is the one that is a prefix of the correct prefix for l=2, which is a prefix of the correct prefix for l=3, and so on until l=n-1.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffixes.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to find the maximal possible prefix and suffix chains.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   Collect all possible strings of length l.\n\n   For each possible string t of length l:\n\n      Check if t is a prefix of the correct prefix for l+1.\n\n      If yes, and t is in the given list for l, then it's a candidate.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nWe can construct the s by building it from the longest possible prefix and the longest possible suffix.\n\nBecause the longest prefix must be a prefix of all shorter prefixes, and the longest suffix must be a suffix of all shorter suffixes.\n\nSo, for each l, the correct prefix is the longest possible string that is a prefix of all the given prefixes for that l.\n\nWait, but for each l, the two given strings are the possible candidates for the prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a' (assuming the first sample), so the prefix is 'a'.\n\nFor l=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'. Which one is the prefix? It depends on the next level.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the correct prefix for l=n-1.\n\nOnce we have the correct prefix, then the correct suffix is determined by the constraints.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. For l = n-1, the two possible strings are the prefix and suffix. Let's call them p and q.\n\n2. We need to determine which is the correct prefix (p) and which is the correct suffix (q), such that when we combine them, they form a valid s.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the correct s is formed by taking the prefix p and the suffix q, but q must start where p ends.\n\nWait, no, because the suffix of l=n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s, which is from position 1 to n-1.\n\nSo, the prefix p is s[0 ... n-2], and the suffix q is s[1 ... n-1].\n\nSo, the entire s is p concatenated with q, but ensuring that the last character of p is the second character of q.\n\nWait, because s is p + q, but p is of length n-1 and q is of length n-1, which would make s of length 2n-2, which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, the correct s has length n.\n\nThe prefix of l is s[0:l], and the suffix of l is s[n-l: n].\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the prefix is s[0:n-1-1] = s[0:n-2], and the suffix is s[n-(n-1):n] = s[1:n].\n\nSo, the entire s is s[0:n-2] + s[1:n], which is s[0:n-1], but that's the prefix for l=n-1. So the s is the prefix of l=n-1 plus the suffix of l=n-1, but the suffix starts at position 1.\n\nSo, the entire s is s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-2] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1].\n\nWait, no, that would require that s[1] is equal to s[n-2], s[2] equals s[n-1], and so on. That's only possible if the prefix and suffix are the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me think of the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5\n\nThe strings for l=4 are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nAssuming that 'abab' is the prefix and 'baba' is the suffix.\n\nThen the prefix for l=4 is 'abab', which is s[0:4], and the suffix is 'baba', which is s[1:5].\n\nSo, the full s is 'abab' + 'baba' → but that's 8 characters, which is longer than n=5. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, no. Because for l=4, the prefix is s[0:4], and the suffix is s[1:5], which is 4 characters. So the full s is s[0:4] followed by s[1:5], but that makes s of length 8, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, this suggests that my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Because for l=4, the prefix is s[0:4], which is 4 characters. The suffix is s[1:5], which is 4 characters. So the full s must be s[0:4] + s[1:5], but that's 8 characters, which can't be.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, s has length n=5. So indexes are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nFor l=4, the prefix is s[0:4], which is 4 characters: s[0], s[1], s[2], s[3].\n\nThe suffix is s[1:5], which is s[1], s[2], s[3], s[4]. So the suffix is 4 characters, starting at index 1.\n\nSo the entire s is s[0] s[1] s[2] s[3] s[4].\n\nSo, the suffix for l=4 is s[1:5], which is s[1], s[2], s[3], s[4].\n\nThus, the entire s is s[0] s[1] s[2] s[3] s[4].\n\nSo, the prefix for l=4 is s[0:4], which is s[0], s[1], s[2], s[3].\n\nThe suffix is s[1:5], which is s[1], s[2], s[3], s[4].\n\nSo, for the entire s, the prefix of l=4 is s[0:4], and the suffix is s[1:5].\n\nBut the entire s is 5 characters, so the suffix s[1:5] is s[1], s[2], s[3], s[4], which is 4 characters.\n\nSo, the entire s is s[0] followed by s[1:5], which is s[0] + s[1:5], but s[1:5] is 4 characters. So s is 5 characters: s[0], s[1], s[2], s[3], s[4].\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the correct s is s[0] s[1] s[2] s[3] s[4].\n\nThe prefix for l=4 is s[0:4], which is s[0], s[1], s[2], s[3].\n\nThe suffix for l=4 is s[1:5], which is s[1], s[2], s[3], s[4].\n\nSo, the entire s is composed of the prefix and suffix, but the suffix starts at position 1 of s.\n\nThus, the entire s can be reconstructed as the prefix of l=4 followed by the suffix of l=4, but that would require that the suffix starts at position 1.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix is s[1:5], which is the last 4 characters. So the entire s is s[0] + s[1:5], which is s[0] followed by s[1], s[2], s[3], s[4], making a total of 5 characters.\n\nSo, the correct s is s[0] s[1] s[2] s[3] s[4], where s[0:4] is the prefix for l=4, and s[1:5] is the suffix for l=4.\n\nThis implies that s[0] can be any character, but s[1], s[2], s[3] must be equal to s[1], s[2], s[3] respectively, which is always true.\n\nSo, the key is that the prefix of l=4 and the suffix of l=4 must agree on the overlapping part.\n\nWait, the prefix is s[0:4], and the suffix is s[1:5], which is s[1], s[2], s[3], s[4].\n\nSo, the last character of the prefix is s[3], which must equal s[1] (the first character of the suffix).\n\nSimilarly, the second character of the suffix is s[2], which must equal s[2] (second character of the prefix), and so on.\n\nWait, this suggests that s[1] = s[3], s[2] = s[2], s[3] = s[3], s[4] = s[4].\n\nWait, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps for the entire s to be valid, the suffix of l=4 must be the same as the prefix of l=4 shifted by one.\n\nNo, that's not necessarily true.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find for each l, the correct prefix and suffix such that for l+1, the prefix is a prefix of the current prefix, and the suffix is a suffix of the current suffix.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-2:\n\n   Choose the correct prefix for l as the one that is a prefix of the correct prefix for l+1.\n\n- For l = n-1, the correct prefix is the one that is a prefix of the correct s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think recursively.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe correct s can be built by considering that for each l, the correct prefix for l must be a prefix of the correct prefix for l+1, except for l = n-1.\n\nSimilarly, the correct suffix for l must be a suffix of the correct suffix for l+1.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the correct suffix is s[1: n], which is the last n-1 characters.\n\nThus, the correct s can be determined by the following steps:\n\n1. Find the correct prefix for l = n-1. Let's say it's p.\n\n2. Find the correct suffix for l = n-1. Let's say it's q.\n\n3. Now, s must be p followed by q, but q starts at position 1. So, the entire s is p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-2], q[0], q[1], ..., q[n-2].\n\nWait, but q is the suffix of l = n-1, which is s[1:5], which for n=5 is 4 characters.\n\nSo, s is p[0] p[1] p[2] p[3] q[0] q[1] q[2] q[3], but that's 8 characters, which is longer than n=5.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should think differently.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nEach of the given strings is either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nSo, for each string t in the input, it must satisfy that either t is a prefix of s or a suffix of s.\n\nSo, the task is to assign each t to P or S, such that:\n\n- For every l, exactly one of the two strings of length l is assigned as P (prefix) and the other as S (suffix).\n\n- The assignments must be consistent with s being a string of length n.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each l from 1 to n-1, select one string as P and the other as S.\n\n2. Ensure that for all l, the P's form a chain where each is a prefix of the next.\n\n3. Similarly, the S's form a chain where each is a suffix of the next.\n\n4. Additionally, the P's for l = n-1 and S's for l = n-1 must form a valid s, i.e., the P ends with the S's first character.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-2:\n\n   Determine which of the two strings is the correct P and which is S, based on whether the P is a prefix of the P for l+1.\n\n- For l = n-1, determine which string is P and which is S, ensuring that the P is a prefix of s, and the S is a suffix of s, and that the P and S together form a valid s.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to find, for each l, which string is the correct P.\n\nOnce the P's are chosen, the S's are determined as the other strings.\n\nBut how to choose the P's and S's.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nFor each l, the correct P is the one that is a prefix of the correct P for l+1.\n\nSo, for l = n-2:\n\n   Suppose the two strings are a and b.\n\n   The correct P for l+1 is the correct P for l+1 = n-1.\n\n   So, the correct P for l must be a prefix of the correct P for l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, we can determine the correct P by checking which of the two strings is a prefix of the correct P for l+1.\n\nBut this requires knowing the correct P for l+1, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nSo, perhaps we can proceed from l = n-1 down to l=1.\n\nLet's try this.\n\nStarting with l = n-1:\n\n   The two strings are p1 and p2.\n\n   We need to determine which is the correct P and which is S.\n\n   But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct P for l = n-1 is the one that is a prefix of s, and the correct S is the one that is a suffix of s.\n\nBut s is unknown.\n\nSo, perhaps we can consider that the correct P for l = n-1 is the one that is a prefix of the correct S for l = n-1.\n\nWait, because s starts with the P and ends with the S.\n\nWait, no, because the S for l = n-1 is s[1: n], which starts at position 1.\n\nSo, the P for l = n-1 is s[0: n-1], and the S for l = n-1 is s[1: n].\n\nSo, the P for l = n-1 is a prefix of s, and the S is a suffix of s.\n\nBut how to determine which is which.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct P for l = n-1 is the string that, when combined with the S for l = n-1, forms a valid s of length n.\n\nSo, for each possible assignment (p as P, q as S or vice versa), we can check if p + q starts at position 0 and ends at position n-1, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible assignment, check if p is a prefix of the first n-1 characters of s, and q is a suffix of the last n-1 characters.\n\nBut without knowing s, this is difficult.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe correct s can be determined by the correct P and S for l = n-1.\n\nSo, s must be p concatenated with q, but such that q starts at position 1.\n\nBut that's impossible because p is of length n-1, and q is of length n-1, leading to a total length of 2n-2, which is longer than n.\n\nSo, this approach is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the P and S relate to s.\n\nThe P of l = n-1 is s[0 ... n-2], and the S is s[1 ... n-1].\n\nSo, the entire s is s[0] s[1] s[2] ... s[n-1].\n\nThe P of l = n-1 is s[0 ... n-2], which is the first n-1 characters.\n\nThe S of l = n-1 is s[1 ... n-1], which is the last n-1 characters.\n\nSo, the entire s is s[0] followed by s[1 ... n-1], which is the S of l = n-1.\n\nWait, so the entire s is the first character of the P of l = n-1, followed by the entire S of l = n-1.\n\nThus, the entire s is s[0] concatenated with the S.\n\nBut the S is of length n-1, so the entire s is s[0] + S, making it of length n.\n\nSo, for example, if the P is 'abc' and the S is 'defg', then the entire s is 'abcdefg' which is length 7.\n\nWait, but that would require that the S is of length 6 (n-1=6), but in this example, the S is 'defg' which is 4 letters. So perhaps I'm mixing up variables.\n\nWait, in any case, for l = n-1, the S is s[1 ... n-1], which is n-1 characters.\n\nSo, the entire s is s[0] followed by S, which is n-1 characters, giving a total of n.\n\nSo, s = s[0] + S.\n\nNow, the P is s[0 ... n-2], which is the first n-1 characters.\n\nBut the S is s[1 ... n-1], which is the last n-1 characters.\n\nSo, the P is s[0] s[1] ... s[n-2], and the S is s[1] s[2] ... s[n-1].\n\nThus, the entire s is s[0] followed by S.\n\nSo, the correct s is s[0] followed by the S.\n\nSo, for each possible assignment of P and S for l = n-1, we can compute s as s0 followed by S.\n\nThen, we can check whether all the given prefixes and suffixes are correctly assigned.\n\nWait, but how to find s0.\n\nBecause s0 is the first character of the P for l = n-1.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. For l = n-1, collect the two strings, p and q.\n\n2. For each possible assignment of p as P and q as S, or q as P and p as S:\n\n   a. Compute s as s0 followed by S.\n\n   b. s0 is the first character of P.\n\n   c. Check if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\n   d. If so, then this assignment is valid.\n\nOnce a valid assignment is found, proceed to assign the other l's.\n\nBut since the problem requires that the answer can be any possible assignment that is consistent with at least one s, perhaps we can proceed as follows.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For l = n-1, try both possibilities for P and S.\n\n   For each possibility, compute s as P[0] + S.\n\n   Then, for each l from 1 to n-2:\n\n      For each possible l, collect the two strings.\n\n      Determine which is the P and which is the S.\n\n      The P must be a prefix of the s computed earlier.\n\n      The S must be a suffix of s.\n\n      If this holds, proceed.\n\n   If all l satisfy this, then this is a valid s, and the assignment is correct.\n\nIf one of the possibilities for l = n-1 leads to a valid s, then assign the P and S accordingly.\n\nSo,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or suffix of a hypothetical string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all possible prefixes and suffixes of lengths from 1 to `n-1`, and our task is to classify each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S').\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The correct string `s` can be determined by considering the longest possible prefix and suffix for length `n-1`. For each possible assignment of these two strings (one as the prefix and the other as the suffix), we will construct a candidate string `s` and check if it satisfies all the given conditions.\n2. **Check Validity of Candidate String**: For each candidate string `s` constructed from the assignments of the longest prefix and suffix, verify if all other given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`. If they fit correctly, this candidate string is valid.\n3. **Classify Strings**: Once a valid string `s` is identified, classify each input string as 'P' or 'S' based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    strings = []\n    for _ in range(2*n - 2):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        strings.append(line)\n    \n    # Group the strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        groups[l].append(s)\n    \n    # Function to check if a string is a prefix of another\n    def is_prefix(a, b):\n        return a == b[:len(a)]\n    \n    # Function to check if a string is a suffix of another\n    def is_suffix(a, b):\n        return a == b[-len(a):]\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for the last length (n-1)\n    last_len = n-1\n    candidates = []\n    for p, q in groups[last_len]:\n        s0 = p[0] if p else ''\n        s_candidate = s0 + q\n        # Check if the candidate has correct lengths and structure\n        if len(s_candidate) != n:\n            continue\n        # Check all other lengths\n        valid = True\n        for l in range(1, last_len):\n            group = groups[l]\n            a, b = group[0], group[1]\n            # Determine which is P and which is S for this l\n            # P must be a prefix of the candidate's prefix of l\n            # S must be a suffix of the candidate's suffix of l\n            # Also, exactly one of a or b should be P\n            if is_prefix(a, s_candidate) and is_suffix(b, s_candidate):\n                p_l = a\n                s_l = b\n            elif is_prefix(b, s_candidate) and is_suffix(a, s_candidate):\n                p_l = b\n                s_l = a\n            else:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            # Check if the next level holds\n            if l < last_len -1:\n                expected_p = s_candidate[:l]\n                expected_s = s_candidate[-l:]\n                if not (is_prefix(p_l, expected_p) and is_suffix(s_l, expected_s)):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n        if valid:\n            # Record the assignment for this case\n            assignments = ['P' if t == p else 'S' for t in strings]\n            # But need to mark which are P and S correctly\n            # Wait, perhaps it's better to build the output based on the candidate s\n            output = []\n            for s_input in strings:\n                if is_prefix(s_input, s_candidate):\n                    output.append('P')\n                else:\n                    output.append('S')\n            candidates.append(output)\n    \n    # If no candidates found, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed to have at least one\n    # So pick the first valid candidate\n    if candidates:\n        print(candidates[0])\n    else:\n        # This case shouldn't happen as per the problem statement\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list of strings. These strings are grouped by their lengths to facilitate processing.\n2. **Checking Prefix and Suffix**: Functions `is_prefix` and `is_suffix` are used to determine if a string is a prefix or suffix of another string.\n3. **Constructing Candidate String**: For the longest possible prefix and suffix of length `n-1`, we try both possible assignments (which string is the prefix and which is the suffix). Each assignment constructs a candidate string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: Each candidate string is validated to ensure that all other given strings fit as either prefixes or suffixes.\n5. **Output**: Once a valid candidate string is found, each input string is classified as 'P' or 'S' and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct classification of each string while adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
