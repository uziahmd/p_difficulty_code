His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about Vasya's Olympiad results. The teacher knows that Vasya's total points (sum of first and second tour) are at least x. But the teacher has the results of the two tours, but without knowing which participant got which result. The task is to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten based on how the points are combined.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is that the participants are sorted by their total points in a certain way, but the order might vary if totals are equal. We need to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya given that his sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Let me think.\n\nEach participant has a score from the first tour (a_i) and the second tour (b_j). But the a and b arrays are given in arbitrary order. So, for each participant, their total is a_p + b_q, where p and q can be any permutation.\n\nBut since the a and b arrays are given in some order, but the actual assignment of a and b to each participant is unknown. So, the problem is to pair the a's and b's in such a way that when all the sums are computed, Vasya's sum is >=x, and then determine what's the best and worst possible rank he could have.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but not the names. So, the a array is the first tour points of all participants, but in arbitrary order. Similarly for the b array. So each participant's a and b are paired by their index, but the a and b arrays are given in any order, so we don't know which a corresponds to which b.\n\nSo, to find Vasya's possible best and worst ranks, we need to consider all possible ways to pair a_i with b_j, ensuring that for the pair (a_p, b_p), their sum is at least x (since Vasya must have participated in both tours).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem states: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such that ai + bj ≥ x.\" So, Vasya is one of these pairs. But how does this affect our approach?\n\nI think the approach is as follows:\n\nFor each possible pairing between the a and b arrays, compute the total for each participant. Then, sort these totals in descending order. Then, find Vasya's position in this sorted list. We need to find the best and worst possible positions across all valid pairings.\n\nBut wait, considering that n can be up to 105, and the a and b arrays can each be up to 105 elements, the number of possible pairings is (105)! / ( (n! )^2 ), which is way too big for brute force.\n\nSo, we can't generate all possible pairings. We need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: For each participant, the sum is a_i + b_j, but the pairing is unknown. So, perhaps for each participant, the maximum possible sum is when a_i is paired with the largest possible b, and the minimum sum is when a_i is paired with the smallest possible b.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the pairing must form a complete matching between the a and b arrays—each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to find the best possible rank for Vasya is to maximize his sum, and arrange others' sums to be as small as possible. Conversely, for the worst rank, minimize his sum, and arrange others' sums to be as large as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the best possible place for Vasya. To get the best possible rank, we want his total to be as high as possible. So, for each possible way to assign a_i and b_j to him, such that a_i + b_j >=x, and then see how many other participants can have higher or equal sums.\n\nWait, but this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each participant, including Vasya, we can compute the maximum possible sum they could have, given that Vasya's sum is >=x.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible scenario for Vasya is when his sum is as large as possible, and as many other participants as possible have smaller sums.\n\nSimilarly, the worst case is when his sum is as small as possible, but still >=x, and as many other participants as possible have larger sums.\n\nSo, to find the best possible rank:\n\n- Assign the highest possible sum to Vasya. That would be the sum of the maximum a and maximum b, provided that their sum is >=x.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because a and b can't be assigned independently. Once you pair a high a with a high b, that may leave lower a's and b's for others.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible a_i and b_j that sum to s >=x, assign that as Vasya's sum. Then, for the best rank, we want s to be as large as possible, and as many other participants as possible to have sums less than s.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst rank, s is the minimal possible (>=x), and as many others as possible have sums >=s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, let's think about the best possible rank.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of participants with sum < s, where s is Vasya's sum.\n\nTo maximize s, we can choose the maximum a and maximum b, but only if a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, but perhaps a_i is the maximum a, and b_j is the maximum b, and their sum is s_max = a_max + b_max. If this is >=x, then it's possible that Vasya's sum is s_max.\n\nIn that case, other participants will have sums as low as possible.\n\nWait, but no. Because the a and b arrays are all used up. So, for example, if a_max is paired with b_max, then the next highest a and b are a_second_max and b_second_max, etc.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the maximum possible s is a_max + b_max, which is the highest possible sum any participant can have.\n\nThen, for Vasya's best possible rank, he can have s = a_max + b_max, and all other participants have sums less than or equal to s.\n\nBut wait, if s is the maximum, then Vasya is in the first place.\n\nBut what if a_max + b_max is less than x? Then, Vasya cannot have that sum, so he must have a sum s >=x.\n\nWait, but the problem states that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x, so we don't have to worry about cases where x is higher than all possible sums.\n\nSo, the steps for the best possible rank:\n\n1. Find all possible s_vasya (sums a_i + b_j >=x) and choose the maximum possible s_vasya.\n\n2. Then, for the best case, assign the a's and b's in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum < s_vasya.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the best possible rank, the maximum s_vasya is a_i + b_j, and the other participants' sums are arranged to be as small as possible, thus making Vasya's rank as high as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nThe best possible rank for Vasya is when his sum is as large as possible, and the others' sums are as small as possible.\n\nSo, to find s_vasya_max, which is the maximum possible sum for any participant, including Vasya.\n\nWait, but if s_vasya_max is the maximum possible sum, then Vasya can be in first place.\n\nBut how to ensure that s_vasya_max >=x.\n\nWait, no. Because Vasya's sum can be s_vasya_max, but if that sum is >=x, then that's possible.\n\nSo, the steps for best case:\n\nFind the maximum possible s_vasya, which is the maximum a_i + b_j among all possible pairs where a_i and b_j are from different indices.\n\nWait, but in reality, the a and b arrays are each of size n, and each a is paired with exactly one b, and each b is paired with exactly one a.\n\nSo, for the best case, we need to pair a and b in a way that s_vasya is as large as possible, and the other participants' sums are as small as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to maximize Vasya's sum is to assign the largest a and largest b to him, but that depends on whether that sum is >=x.\n\nWait, for example, suppose a is [5,4], b is [4,5]. Then, the possible pairings are (5+4=9, 4+5=9) or (5+5=10, 4+4=8). So, the maximum possible sum for any participant is 10, but if Vasya takes that, he is first.\n\nSo, in this case, the best rank is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps for the best possible rank, we should assign the largest possible a and largest possible b to Vasya, provided that their sum is >=x.\n\nBut wait, what if a_max + b_max is less than x? Then, Vasya can't have that sum. So, we need to find the next best option.\n\nWait, but the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So, we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo, the approach for best possible rank:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n2. Among these pairs, find the pair with the maximum sum s_max.\n\n3. Now, in the best case, Vasya's sum is s_max.\n\n4. Then, arrange the remaining a and b into pairs such that the other participants' sums are as small as possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because when you pair the a's and b's, it affects the sums of other participants.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best case for Vasya is when his sum is the maximum possible, and the other participants have as small sums as possible.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe best possible rank for Vasya is 1, if and only if there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >=x, and the maximum possible sum s_max is achievable by some pair, which is >=x.\n\nBecause if s_max is >=x, then Vasya can take that pair, and the rest of the participants will have sums <= s_max. So, he is first.\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, all participants have the same sum, so Vasya can be first or last depending on the jury's decision.\n\nWait, the sample input's a and b are both [1,1,1,1,1], and x is 2. So, all possible pairings give a sum of 2. So, in the best case, he is first; in the worst case, he is last.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1, the worst is 5.\n\nSo, in that case, the maximum sum is 2, which is >=x.\n\nSo, the first part is correct.\n\nSo, the conclusion is: if the maximum possible sum (which is a_max + b_max) is >=x, then the best possible rank is 1.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the next best sum.\n\nWait, but no. Because it's possible that a_max + b_max is >=x, but other participants can have higher sums.\n\nWait, no. Because a_max and b_max are the largest a and b, so their sum is the maximum possible sum for any participant. So, if Vasya can get that sum, he is first.\n\nSo, in the best case, if a_max + b_max >=x, then best rank is 1.\n\nBut what if a_max + b_max is less than x?\n\nThen, Vasya can't have that sum. So, he must have a sum >=x, but less than a_max + b_max.\n\nSo, for the best case, he picks the maximum possible sum that is >=x, which would be less than a_max + b_max.\n\nWait, but if a_max + b_max is >=x, then why wouldn't he get that sum?\n\nSo, the first condition is: check if a_max + b_max >=x. If yes, then best possible rank is 1.\n\nElse, find the maximum sum s that is >=x, and then compute how many participants can have sums >=s, which would determine the best possible rank.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of another example.\n\nSuppose n=2.\n\na = [3, 1]\n\nb = [1, 4]\n\nx=5.\n\nWhat's the possible pairings?\n\nPossible pairings:\n\na[0] + b[0] = 3+1=4 <5 → invalid.\n\na[0]+b[1]=3+4=7 >=5.\n\na[1]+b[0]=1+1=2 <5.\n\na[1]+b[1]=1+4=5 >=5.\n\nSo, Vasya's possible sums are 7 and 5.\n\nSo, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is 7. So, in the best case, he has 7.\n\nThen, the other participant has a[1] + b[0] = 1+1=2, which is less than 7. So, Vasya is first.\n\nBut wait, in the pairing where Vasya gets 7, the other participant has sum 2.\n\nSo, yes, best rank is 1.\n\nIf x was 6, then a_max + b_max is 3+4=7 >=6. So, best rank is 1.\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\na = [4, 3, 2]\n\nb = [5, 1, 6]\n\nx=8.\n\nWhat's the maximum sum possible? 4+6=10.\n\nWhich is >=x.\n\nSo, Vasya can have 10, and the other participants have 3+5=8, 2+1=3. So, Vasya is first.\n\nSo, the best rank is 1.\n\nBut what if x=9.\n\na_max + b_max is 4+6=10 >=9.\n\nSo, Vasya can have 10, which is the maximum. So, best rank is 1.\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\na = [5, 1, 2]\n\nb = [3, 4, 1]\n\nx=6.\n\nThe maximum sum is 5+4=9 >=6.\n\nSo, Vasya can have 9, others have 3+3=6, 1+1=2. So, Vasya is first.\n\nSo, in all these examples, if a_max + b_max >=x, then best rank is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank:\n\nIf the maximum possible sum (a_max + b_max) is >=x, then the best rank is 1.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the maximum sum s >=x, and then see how many participants can have sum >=s.\n\nWait, but wait, if a_max + b_max <x, then it's impossible for Vasya to have that sum, so he must have a sum s where s >=x, but less than a_max + b_max.\n\nSo, in this case, the best possible rank is the number of participants whose maximum possible sum is >=s.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of a case where a_max + b_max <x.\n\nFor example, n=2.\n\na = [3, 3]\n\nb = [3,3]\n\nx=7.\n\nMaximum sum is 6 <7.\n\nSo, Vasya's sum must be >=7. But a_max + b_max is 6 <7. So, it's impossible. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, in this case, the example is invalid.\n\nSo, in our code, we can assume that a_max + b_max >=x, but wait, no.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that it's guaranteed that there exists i,j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, a_max + b_max may be >=x.\n\nWait, but wait, a_max is the maximum a_i, b_max is the maximum b_j. So, a_max + b_max is the maximum possible sum for any participant, including Vasya. So, if a_max + b_max >=x, then Vasya can have that sum, thus placing him first.\n\nTherefore, in the best case, if a_max + b_max >=x, then best rank is 1.\n\nElse, it's impossible, but the problem says it's always possible, so the best rank is 1 only if a_max + b_max >=x.\n\nSo, perhaps the first step is to compute a_max and b_max.\n\nCompute s_max = a_max + b_max.\n\nIf s_max >=x, then best_rank is 1.\n\nElse, the situation is impossible because even the maximum sum is less than x, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that Vasya has a sum >=x. So, perhaps this case cannot happen. So, the best rank is always 1.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is 1 and 5.\n\nSo, the best rank is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps for the best rank, it's always 1, as long as a_max + b_max >=x.\n\nSo, perhaps the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, all participants have sum 2, which is >=x=2.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is 2, but the best rank is 1 because he can be placed first.\n\nSo, the initial approach holds.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1, provided that s_max >=x.\n\nSo, now the task is to find the worst possible rank.\n\nThis is more complex.\n\nTo find the worst possible rank for Vasya, we need to assign a and b in such a way that Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and as many other participants as possible have sums >=Vasya's sum.\n\nThus, Vasya's sum is the minimal possible s_min >=x, and the number of participants with sum >=s_min is as small as possible.\n\nWait, no. Because the worst rank is determined by how many participants have sum >=s_vasya.\n\nSo, for the worst case, we want s_vasya as small as possible (but >=x), and as many other participants as possible have sum >=s_vasya.\n\nSo, to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible s_vasya (>=x) and compute how many participants can have sum >=s_vasya, and then Vasya's rank is that count.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the minimal possible s_vasya, and then compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >=s_vasya.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the minimal possible s_vasya, such that s_vasya >=x, and the number of participants who can have sum >=s_vasya is as large as possible.\n\nNo, perhaps not. Because the worst rank is determined by how many participants have a sum greater than or equal to s_vasya.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of participants with sum >= s_vasya, we need to choose s_vasya as small as possible (but >=x), and arrange the pairings such that as many others as possible have sums >=s_vasya.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nPerhaps the way to find the worst possible rank is to find the minimal possible s_vasya >=x, and then compute the number of participants that can have sum >=s_vasya when paired optimally.\n\nWait, but this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nLet me think of the sample input again.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo, all sums are 2.\n\nSo, in the worst case, Vasya is last (5th place).\n\nSo, the worst rank is 5.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause all participants have the same sum, so the jury can arrange them in any order, including putting Vasya last.\n\nSo, the worst case is when Vasya's sum is 2, and all others also have 2. So, the number of participants with sum >=2 is 5, so Vasya's rank is 5.\n\nSo, for the worst case, we need to find the minimal s_vasya >=x, and then count the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >=s_vasya.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, the maximum number is 5, which includes Vasya.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >=s_vasya, where s_vasya is the minimal possible >=x.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For the worst case, find the minimal s_vasya >=x, and then find the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >=s_vasya.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible s_vasya >=x, we can compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s_vasya.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is the minimal s_vasya >=x, and the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >=s_vasya is the maximum over all possible pairings.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of selecting s_vasya as the minimal possible (>=x), and then arrange the a and b pairings so that as many others as possible have sum >=s_vasya.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe worst possible rank is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and as many other participants as possible have sums >=s_vasya.\n\nSo, to find s_vasya, we need to find the minimal sum s >=x such that there exists a pairing where:\n\n- One participant (Vasya) has a sum s.\n\n- All other participants have sums >=s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible s >=x, we can check if it's possible to have a pairing where all other participants have sum >=s.\n\nThen, the minimal such s would give the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how to find this s.\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is the minimal s_vasya >=x, such that the maximum number of participants can have sum >=s_vasya.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as trying all possible s_vasya values and for each, compute the maximum possible number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s_vasya.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s in [x, max_sum], in increasing order, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nWait, but how to model the pairing.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is as follows:\n\nFor a given s_vasya, can we pair the a and b in such a way that Vasya's sum is s_vasya, and all other participants have sums >=s_vasya.\n\nIf yes, then s_vasya is a candidate, and the worst rank is the number of participants with sum >=s_vasya.\n\nWe need to find the minimal s_vasya (>=x) for which this is possible.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nLoop s from x up to s_max (a_max + b_max), in increasing order.\n\nFor each s, check if it's possible to have a pairing where:\n\n- There exists a pair (i,j) such that a[i] + b[j] == s.\n\n- All other pairs (k,l) have a[k] + b[l] >=s.\n\nIf such a pairing exists, then the worst rank is the number of participants whose sum is >=s.\n\nSo, for the sample input, s=2.\n\nIs it possible to pair such that all other participants have sum >=2?\n\nYes, because all a's are 1, and b's are 1. So, every sum is 2.\n\nSo, the number of participants with sum >=2 is 5.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 5.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=2.\n\na=[3,3]\n\nb=[3,3]\n\nx=5.\n\ns_max =6 >=5.\n\nSo, for s=5:\n\nCan we have a pairing where one participant has 5, and the other has >=5?\n\nYes: assign a[0] + b[1] =3+3=6 >=5.\n\nOther participant has a[1]+b[0]=3+3=6 >=5.\n\nSo, the number of participants with sum >=5 is 2.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 2.\n\nWait, but what's the worst possible rank for Vasya?\n\nIn this case, the worst case is when Vasya's sum is 5, but others have 6.\n\nSo, the sum is 5, others have 6. So, the rank is 2.\n\nBut wait, is that the worst possible?\n\nNo, because if Vasya has sum 6, he is first.\n\nSo, the worst case is when his sum is 5, and others have 6. So, he is second.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 2.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3.\n\na = [4,3,2]\n\nb = [5,1,6]\n\nx=8.\n\ns_max=4+6=10 >=8.\n\nSo, for s=8:\n\nCheck if it's possible to pair so that one participant has 8, others have >=8.\n\nPossible pairs for 8:\n\nLooking for a_i + b_j =8.\n\nPossible options:\n\na=3, b=5 → 3+5=8.\n\na=2, b=6→ 8.\n\nSo, let's pick a=3, b=5.\n\nThen, the other participants:\n\na=4 can be paired with 6 → 10 >=8.\n\na=2 can be paired with 1 → 3 <8. No, that's a problem.\n\nWait, that's an issue.\n\nSo, in this case, when s=8, can we pair the a and b such that all other participants have sum >=8?\n\nIf a=3 is paired with b=5 (sum 8), then a=4 is paired with b=6 (sum 10), and a=2 is paired with b=1 (sum 3 <8). This is invalid.\n\nSo, this pairing doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, can we pair a=2 with b=6 (sum 8), and a=4 with b=5 (sum 9), a=3 with b=1 (sum 4 <8). Again, invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps it's not possible to have all other participants >=8 when s=8.\n\nSo, s=8 is not feasible.\n\nSo, we need to try s=9.\n\nIs it possible to have a participant with sum 9, and all others >=9.\n\nLooking for a_i + b_j =9.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\na=4 + b=5=9.\n\na=3 + b=6=9.\n\na=2 + b=7=9 (but b doesn't have 7).\n\nSo, possible.\n\nLet's try a=4 paired with b=5 (sum 9).\n\nOthers:\n\na=3 can be paired with b=6 (sum 9).\n\na=2 can be paired with b=1 (sum 3 <9). No.\n\nSo, invalid.\n\nAnother option: a=3 paired with b=6 (sum 9).\n\nOthers:\n\na=4 paired with b=5 (sum 9).\n\na=2 paired with b=1 (sum 3 <9). Invalid.\n\nAnother option: a=4 paired with b=5 (sum 9).\n\na=3 paired with b=6 (sum9).\n\na=2 paired with b=1 (sum3 <9). Still invalid.\n\nHmm, so perhaps s=9 is not possible.\n\nWhat about s=10.\n\nYes, a=4 +b=6=10.\n\nOthers:\n\na=3 +b=5=8 <10: invalid.\n\na=2 +b=1=3 <10: invalid.\n\nNo, that's not acceptable.\n\nSo, in this case, s=10 is not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to pair is such that all other participants have sum >=s.\n\nSo, for s=8, let's see:\n\nIf Vasya is paired with a=3 and b=5 (sum 8).\n\nThen, the remaining a's are 4 and 2.\n\nRemaining b's are 6 and 1.\n\nWe need to pair 4 and 6 (sum 10 >=8), and 2 and 1 (sum 3 <8). So, that's invalid.\n\nBut what if we pair 4 and 1 (sum 5 <8) and 2 and 6 (sum8 >=8). Then, the participants are 5,8,8.\n\nSo, Vasya is 8, others are 5 and 8.\n\nSo, the other participants have sums >=8 (5 is less than 8). Wait, 5 is less than 8, so this arrangement is invalid because one of the participants has a sum less than s=8.\n\nThus, this pairing is invalid.\n\nSo, in this case, s=8 is not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal s_vasya is 9, but as shown earlier, it's also not feasible.\n\nWait, but in that case, perhaps the worst possible rank is 3.\n\nBecause, perhaps, Vasya can have a sum of 9, and the other two participants have sums 9 and 3.\n\nBut then, the other participants have one sum >=9 and one <9. So, Vasya's rank is 2.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nMaybe the worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s_vasya, where s_vasya is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nSo, to find this, we can iterate s from x to s_max, in increasing order, and for each s, check whether it's possible to have a pairing where:\n\n- Vasya's sum is s.\n\n- All other participants have sum >=s.\n\nIf such a pairing exists, then the worst rank is the number of participants with sum >=s.\n\nOnce we find the minimal s for which this is possible, we can compute the worst rank.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Compute s_max = a_max + b_max.\n\n2. For s in [x, s_max], in increasing order:\n\n   a. Check if there exists a way to pair a's and b's such that:\n\n      i. There exists a pair (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] = s.\n\n      ii. For all other pairs (k,l), a[k] + b[l] >= s.\n\n   b. If such a pairing exists, then compute the number of participants with sum >=s. Let this count be c. The worst rank is c.\n\n3. Return the first such c found.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Iterate s from x upwards.\n\n- For each s, check if it's possible to pair a and b so that all other participants have sum >=s.\n\n- Once the first s is found (smallest s), compute the count of participants with sum >=s.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nNow, the problem is, for each s, how to check if such a pairing is possible.\n\nAn efficient way is needed.\n\nLet me think of this as a bipartite graph matching problem.\n\nWe have a set of a's and a set of b's. We need to match each a to a unique b such that:\n\n- One a is matched to a b such that a + b = s.\n\n- All other a's are matched to b's such that a + b >=s.\n\nSo, the question is, for a given s, can we find a perfect matching in this bipartite graph where:\n\n- Exactly one edge connects to a node with a + b = s.\n\n- All other edges connect to nodes with a + b >=s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given s, the following must be true:\n\nThere exists a pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j = s.\n\nAnd for all other a_k and b_l, a_k + b_l >=s.\n\nAdditionally, for the remaining a's and b's, after choosing (i,j), the remaining a's must be matched to remaining b's such that their sum is >=s.\n\nBut checking this is computationally expensive for each s.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of considering each possible s, perhaps we can find the minimal s >=x such that:\n\nThe number of a's plus b's that are >= s - a_i and s - b_j is sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can model this as follows.\n\nFor a given s, the required condition is:\n\nThere exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = s.\n\nAnd for all other a's and b's, when paired, their sum is >=s.\n\nBut how to find if such a pairing exists.\n\nLet me think of it in terms of constraints.\n\nAfter choosing (a_i, b_j) = s, the remaining a's must be paired with remaining b's such that their sum is >=s.\n\nSo, the remaining a's are all a except a_i.\n\nThe remaining b's are all b except b_j.\n\nWe need to match each a in the remaining a's to a b in the remaining b's such that a + b >=s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: can the remaining a's and b's be matched in a way that all pairs have sum >=s.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that for the remaining a's and b's, their sum can be at least s.\n\nBut how to check this.\n\nWait, the sum of all remaining a's is sum_a_remaining = sum_a_total - a_i.\n\nThe sum of all remaining b's is sum_b_remaining = sum_b_total - b_j.\n\nWe need to have sum_a_remaining + sum_b_remaining >= s * (n-1).\n\nBecause each of the remaining (n-1) pairs must contribute at least s.\n\nIf sum_a_remaining + sum_b_remaining < s*(n-1), then it's impossible.\n\nBut this is a necessary condition, not sufficient.\n\nFor example, if sum is sufficient, but individual a's and b's can't be paired to meet the condition.\n\nBut it's a starting point.\n\nSo, for a given s, the steps are:\n\n1. Find all possible (i,j) where a_i + b_j = s.\n\n   For each such (i,j):\n\n   a. Compute the remaining a's and b's.\n\n   b. Check if the remaining a's can be paired with the remaining b's such that each pair sums to >=s.\n\n2. If any (i,j) satisfies this, then s is a candidate.\n\n3. The minimal such s is the one we need.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 105, and for each s, we may have up to n possible (i,j) pairs, this approach may be feasible.\n\nBut for each (i,j), how to check if the remaining a's and b's can be paired to meet the condition.\n\nThis seems challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between a's and b's if a + b >=s.\n\nWe need to select a perfect matching that includes at least one edge (i,j) where a_i + b_j =s.\n\nSo, for each s, we can:\n\n- Create a bipartite graph with a's on one side, b's on the other.\n\n- For each a in a's, connect to b in b's if a + b >=s.\n\n- Also, include at least one edge (i,j) where a_i + b_j =s.\n\n- Then, check if a perfect matching exists.\n\nBut checking for a perfect matching is computationally expensive for large n.\n\nBut for n=105, it's manageable with algorithms like the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm.\n\nBut implementing Hopcroft-Karp in Python is possible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a function that, given a list of a's and b's, and a target s, determines whether there exists a perfect matching where all pairs sum >=s, and at least one pair sums exactly s.\n\nSo, the steps for the worst possible rank are:\n\n- Iterate s from x to s_max in increasing order.\n\n- For each s:\n\n   a. Check if s is feasible, i.e., there exists a pairing as described.\n\n   b. If feasible, compute the number of participants with sum >=s. This is the worst rank.\n\n- Return the first such count.\n\nSo, the main challenge is to implement the function to check feasibility for a given s.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this function.\n\nFunction is_feasible(s, a_list, b_list):\n\n   - Find all possible (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] ==s.\n\n   - For each such (i,j):\n\n      - Create a bipartite graph where each a can be connected to a b if a + b >=s.\n\n      - Include (i,j) as an edge.\n\n      - Check",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing all possible pairings of participants' scores to find the optimal ranks.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Best Possible Rank**:\n   - The best possible rank for Vasya is determined by finding the maximum sum of points from the first and second tours. If the maximum sum (from pairing the highest scores) is at least `x`, Vasya can achieve the first rank.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**:\n   - The worst possible rank involves finding the smallest sum `s` that is at least `x` such that as many other participants as possible have sums greater than or equal to `s`.

If true, Vasya can be ranked first.\n  \n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: The worst rank involves iterating through all possible sums starting from `x` to the maximum sum. For each sum `s`, we check if it's feasible to pair the scores such that Vasya's score is `s` and all other participants' scores are at least `s`. The smallest feasible `s` gives the worst rank, which is the count of participants with sums at least `s`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the best and worst possible ranks by leveraging graph theory and bipartite matching to validate pairings.",
