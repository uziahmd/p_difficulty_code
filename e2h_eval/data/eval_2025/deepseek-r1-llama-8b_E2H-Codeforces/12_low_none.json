The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and also clockwise. So, moving from house i can only go to i+1 (mod n, but since it's a ring, it wraps around after n). \n\nXenia starts at house 1 and has m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at ai by the time she completes all tasks with numbers less than i. So, for example, the first task (i=1) requires her to be at a1, the second (i=2) requires her to be at a2 after completing the first task, and so on. \n\nOur goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to model this. Since the houses form a ring, the movement is circular. So, the optimal path would involve visiting each required house in such a way that we cover all necessary positions with minimal backtracking.\n\nWait, but the order of the tasks matters because each subsequent task depends on the previous ones. So, the sequence of a_i's determines the order in which she must visit these houses. For each i, she must reach a_i before or at the same time as the ith step.\n\nLet me consider the example given. In the first test case, the input is 4 3 with tasks 3,2,3. The output is 6.\n\nThe optimal path is 1 →2 →3 →4 →1 →2 →3. Let's see why. \n\nShe starts at 1. Then, for the first task (i=1), she needs to be at 3. Wait no, wait, the a_i's are the destination for each task. So for the first task (i=1), she must be at a1=3. How does she get there? Well, starting at 1, she can move clockwise to 2, then 3. That's two steps. But wait, the sample explanation says she goes 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's count: each arrow is a unit of time. So from 1 to 2 is 1, 2→3 is 2, 3→4 is 3, 4→1 is 4, 1→2 is5, 2→3 is6. So total 6 units. \n\nWait, why not take a shorter path? Like 1→2→3 directly? That would take 2 steps, but that would mean she hasn't completed the later tasks yet. Oh right, because the tasks are in order. She has to process them in the order given. So each task i must be done after all tasks j < i. \n\nSo, the idea is that for each task i, she must arrive at a_i after handling all the earlier tasks. Therefore, the arrival times for each a_i must be determined based on the previous steps.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model the time when she arrives at each a_i, ensuring that each subsequent a_i is handled in a way that minimizes the total time.\n\nWait, but how do the a_i's relate to each other? Maybe some are the same, some are in order, etc. \n\nLet me think about the steps. Suppose we process the tasks in the given order. For each task i, she must be at a_i at some point. But since the traffic is only in one direction, she can't go backward except by wrapping around the ring.\n\nSo, to minimize the time, she should arrange her path to cover all required a_i's in such a way that the distance between consecutive a_i's is as small as possible, considering the ring structure.\n\nBut what's the optimal path? Maybe the best approach is to sort the a_i's in the order they are visited, and calculate the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nWait, but the order in which she visits them is fixed by the order of the tasks. Because each task depends on the previous ones, she must visit a_1, then a_2, ..., a_m in that exact order. So, the path is a sequence where each step is from the current position to a_i, but she can choose any path that allows her to reach a_i as early as possible, possibly passing through other required points multiple times if needed.\n\nWait, but some a_i's may be revisited. For example, in the sample input, a_3 is 3 again. So she has to return there after the second task.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal time is the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, plus the distance from the last a_m back to the starting point (house 1) if needed. Or wait",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she starts at house 1 and must move clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task requires her to be at a specific house in the order they are given.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to visit several houses in a specific order. The key is to find the shortest path that allows her to visit each required house in the given sequence with minimal backtracking.\n2. **Movement Constraints**: Since the traffic is one-way and clockwise, Xenia can only move from house `i` to house `i+1` (mod `n`).\n3. **Task Order**: Each task must be completed in the given order. Thus, for each task `i`, Xenia must reach house `a_i` after completing all previous tasks.\n4. **Optimal Path Calculation**: The optimal path is determined by summing the distances between consecutive task locations, considering the circular nature of the ring. This involves calculating the shortest path on a circular array, which can be done by considering the positions modulo `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Convert to 0-based index for easier calculations\ntasks = [(x-1) % n for x in tasks]\n\ncurrent_pos = 0  # Starting position is 1, which is 0 in 0-based\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    next_task = tasks[i]\n    # Calculate the distance from current_pos to next_task\n    # If moving forward, it's (next_task - current_pos)\n    # If moving backward, it's (n - current_pos + next_task)\n    if next_task >= current_pos:\n        distance = next_task - current_pos\n    else:\n        distance = (n - current_pos) + next_task\n    total_time += distance\n    current_pos = next_task\n\n# After all tasks, return to starting point if necessary?\n# Wait, no. Because the last task is the last one, but perhaps she can stay where she is.\n# Wait, no, the problem doesn't require returning to start unless it's part of the path.\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of task locations.\n2. **Conversion to 0-based Index**: Convert the house numbers to 0-based indices for easier calculations.\n3. **Initialize Variables**: Track the current position and the total time taken.\n4. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the shortest path from the current position to the next task location. Update the total time and current position accordingly.\n5. **Output the Result**: Print the total time required to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia moves optimally between task locations, minimizing the total travel time by leveraging the circular nature of the ring road.",
