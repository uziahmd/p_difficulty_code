A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends wanting to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some amount of drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make, given the constraints on the available resources.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. All positive integers, not exceeding 1000.\n\nWait, what do these variables represent?\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles of drink. Each bottle has l milliliters. So total drink is k * l ml.\nc: number of limes cut into d slices each. So total lime slices are c * d.\np: grams of salt available.\nnl: milliliters of drink each friend needs per toast.\nnp: grams of salt each friend needs per toast.\n\nEach toast requires:\n- For each friend: one slice of lime.\n- Each friend: nl ml of drink.\n- Each friend: np grams of salt.\n\nSo for all friends making t toasts, the total required is:\n- Drink: n * t * nl ml.\n- Lime slices: n * t * 1 (since each toast per friend needs one slice). Because there are c*d total slices.\n- Salt: n * t * np grams. Because each toast per friend uses np grams.\n\nWe need to find the maximum t such that all three resources are sufficient.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l.\n2. total_lime_slices = c * d.\n3. total_salt = p.\n\nThen compute:\n\nmax_toasts_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\nmax_toasts_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n\nmax_toasts_by_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nThe maximum possible toasts t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, because for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for t toasts, each friend needs t slices. So total slices needed are n * t. So yes, max_toasts_by_lime is (c*d) // (n).\n\nSimilarly, drink required is n * t * nl, so t can't exceed (total_drink) / (n * nl). Same for salt: t can't be more than (p) / (n * np).\n\nSo the steps are correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the input line as integers.\n- Compute the three constraints.\n- Take the minimum of them, that's the maximum t.\n- Output t as an integer.\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. Each toast per friend is 3ml. So 3 friends need 3*3=9ml per toast. So 20 / 9 = 2.222... → 2 toasts.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = 10*8=80. Each toast needs 3 slices (3 friends * 1 slice each). 80 /3=26.666 → 26? No, wait, wait. Wait, no: each toast requires one slice per friend, so for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts, so each needs t slices. So for n friends, total slices used is n*t. So for total_lime_slices >= n*t.\n\nSo in the first sample, n=3, so 3t <= 80 → t <= 26.666 → 26.\n\nBut wait, but the sample says the answer is 2. Because the minimum of 6, 80/3=26.666, 100/1=100 is 6 divided by 3 gives 2? Wait, no. Wait the note says that in the first sample, the drink allows 20ml, which is enough for 20/(3) =6 toasts (each toast is 3ml per friend). But then they take the min of 6, 80, 100. Then divide by 3? Wait, why?\n\nWait, no. The note says: the drink is 20ml, which is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. The limes allow 80 toasts (because 80 slices, each toast needs 3 slices), and salt allows 100. So the minimal among these is 6, so each friend can make 6/3=2 toasts.\n\nAh, right! So the maximum number of toasts is the minimum of the three individual resource limits, and then since each toast requires one per friend, the per-friend toasts are that divided by n.\n\nWait no, wait. Or perhaps I should re-calculate:\n\nThe total toasts possible is the minimum of the three: (drink / (n * nl)), (limes / n), (salt / (n * np)).\n\nBecause:\n\n- For drink: each toast needs n * nl ml. So total drink is k*l. So t_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\n- For limes: each toast needs n slices (n friends each needing one). So t_lime = (c*d) // n.\n\n- For salt: each toast needs n * np grams. So t_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the maximum number of toasts is the minimum of t_drink, t_lime, t_salt.\n\nSo the initial approach was incorrect. The correct way is to compute t_drink, t_lime, t_salt, then take their min, which is the maximum possible toasts overall.\n\nThen, since each friend can make that number of toasts, the answer is that t.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample input, t_drink is 20/(3*3)=20/9=2.222→2.\n\nt_lime is 80 /3=26.666→26.\n\nt_salt is 100/(3*1)=33.333→33.\n\nSo the min is 2. So each friend makes 2 toasts. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct steps are:\n\nCalculate t_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nt_lime = (c*d) // n\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nt = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nOutput t.\n\nSo now, I need to code this.\n\nIn Python, I can read the input as a list of integers.\n\nLet me write the code structure.\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\nCompute total_lime_slices = c * d\n\nCompute t_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nt_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nt = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nPrint t as a string.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → drink=20.\n\nt_drink = 20/(3*3)= 2.222 → 2.\n\nc=10, d=8 → slices=80. t_lime=80//3=26.\n\np=100, np=1 → 100/(3*1)=33.333 →33.\n\nmin(2,26,33) →2. Output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nInput is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink=1000.\n\nt_drink = 1000/(5*4) = 1000/20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → slices=19. t_lime=19//5=3.\n\np=90, np=3 → 90/(5*3)=6.\n\nmin(50,3,6) is 3. So output is 3.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink=1,000,000.\n\nt_drink = 1e6/(10*50)=1e6/500=2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 → slices=575. t_lime=575//10=57.\n\np=1, np=1 → 1/(10*1)=0.1 →0.\n\nSo min is 0. So output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where any of the resources is zero.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says all inputs are positive integers. So we don't have to handle zero.\n\nAnother case: when n is larger than the available resources.\n\nFor example, n=10, but p=1, np=1. Then t_salt is 0.\n\nSo the output is zero.\n\nAnother case: when n is 1, then t_drink is drink/(1 * nl), t_lime is (c*d)/1, etc.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Requirements**: Each toast requires:\n   - A certain amount of drink per friend.\n   - One lime slice per friend.\n   - A certain amount of salt per friend.\n   \n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - Total drink available is calculated as the product of the number of bottles and the volume per bottle.\n   - Total lime slices available is the product of the number of limes and the number of slices per lime.\n   - Total salt available is given directly.\n\n3. **Determine Resource Limits**:\n   - Compute the maximum number of toasts possible based on the total drink available.\n   - Compute the maximum number of toasts possible based on the total lime slices available.\n   - Compute the maximum number of toasts possible based on the total salt available.\n\n4. **Find the Minimum Resource Limit**: The actual maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the smallest of the three computed values from the previous step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\nt_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\nt_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total drink available is computed by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle.\n3. **Drink Toasts Calculation**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on the drink is calculated by dividing the total drink by the required drink per toast per friend.\n4. **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is computed by multiplying the number of limes by the number of slices per lime. The maximum number of toasts possible based on lime slices is then found by dividing this total by the number of friends.\n5. **Salt Calculation**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on the salt available is computed by dividing the total salt by the required salt per toast per friend.\n6. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum value among the three computed values (drink, lime, salt) is taken as the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make without exceeding any resource constraints.",
