Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But he's smart because he can take 'b' of these burnt candles and make a new one. And the question is, how many hours in total can he keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, let me think about the example they gave. The first sample input is 4 and 2. So he starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burnt ones. Since b is 2, he can make 4/2 = 2 new candles. He burns those, adding 2 more hours. Now he has 2 burnt candles again. He makes another 1 (because 2 /2 is 1), which gives another hour. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 =7.\n\nAnother example is 6 and 3. So initial burn:6 hours. Now 6 burnt, divided by 3 gives 2. So 2 more hours. After burning, 2 burnt. But 2 <3, so he can't make more. Total is 6+2=8.\n\nSo the approach is: every time after burning some candles, collect the remains, see how many new candles can be made, add that to the total, and repeat until you can't make any more.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Start with 'a' candles.\n2. Burn them all, add 'a' hours.\n3. Collect 'a' burnt candles.\n4. While the number of burnt candles is >=b:\n   a. Divide by b to get new_candles.\n   b. Add new_candles to the total.\n   c. The new burnt candles are new_candles (since each new candle burns for 1 hour and becomes one burnt).\n5. Repeat until no more can be made.\n\nWait, but wait. Because each time you create new candles, they are added to the total and their burnt versions are collected again.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\ntotal = a\nremnants = a\n\nwhile remnants >= b:\n    new = remnants // b\n    total += new\n    remnants = new  # because each new candle will burn and become one remnant\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nLet's test this logic with the examples.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal =4, remnants=4.\n\nLoop:\n4 >=2 → new=2, total=6. remnants=2.\n\nNext loop: 2 >=2 → new=1, total=7. remnants=1. Now 1<2 → stop. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, remnants=6.\n\n6>=3 → new=2, total=8. remnants=2. Now 2<3. Stop. Correct.\n\nWhat about a case where after making new candles, you can make more than once? Like a=10, b=3.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nInitial: total=10, remnants=10.\n\n10//3=3 → total=13, remnants=3.\n\n3//3=1 → total=14, remnants=1. Now stop. So total is 14.\n\nYes, because 10 burn for 10 hours. Then 10/3=3 new, which adds 3 hours. Then the 3 new burn, adding 3, but now we have 3 remnants again? Wait no. Wait, after burning 3, they become 3 remnants. Wait, no: each new candle is 1, so when you make 3, you burn them, adding 3 to total, and then you have 3 remnants.\n\nWait wait, no. Let me re-examine the process.\n\nWhen you have remnants, you can make new candles. Each new candle is 1. So when you make 'new' candles, you burn them, so each contributes 1 hour, and each becomes a remnant.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Burn existing candles, collect remnants.\n- Make as many new candles as possible from remnants.\n- For each new candle, burn it (adding 1 to total) and add 1 to remnants.\nSo yes, the code correctly captures this.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, the task is to write a Python program that reads two integers a and b, and computes the total hours.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read the input line. It's given as a string like '4 2', so split into a and b.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of strings? Or is it just one string? Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo the input is a single line, which can be read via input().split().\n\nIn",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can reuse burnt candles to make new ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`. Each candle burns for one hour, so the initial number of hours is `a`.\n2. **Recycling Burnt Candles**: After burning all initial candles, collect the burnt remnants. For every `b` burnt candles, Vasily can create a new candle. This process continues as long as the number of burnt candles is at least `b`.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Each time new candles are created, they are burned, contributing to the total hours and adding to the count of burnt candles again. This iterative process continues until the number of burnt candles is less than `b`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nremnants = a\n\nwhile remnants >= b:\n    new_candles = remnants // b\n    total += new_candles\n    remnants = new_candles  # Each new candle becomes a remnant after burning\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`, which are read and converted into integers.\n2. **Initial Hours Calculation**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n3. **Recycling Loop**: While there are enough burnt candles (`remnants`) to create new ones, the loop continues. Each iteration calculates how many new candles can be made from the burnt ones, adds these to the total hours, and updates the count of burnt candles to the number of newly made candles (since each new candle will burn and become a remnant).\n4. **Output the Result**: Once the loop exits, the total number of hours is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iterating and reusing burnt candles until no more can be recycled, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
