He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Polycarp solving problems over k days. Each day he solves a contiguous sequence of problems from his list. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the maximums each day.\n\nHmm, right. So the idea is to split the array into exactly k contiguous parts, and for each part, take the maximum element. Then sum all those maxima, and we need to maximize that sum.\n\nWait, but how? Because each part must be a contiguous block, and they can't overlap or skip any elements. So for example, if n=8 and k=3, the splits are after some elements. Like in the sample, [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2]. So the first part is 3 elements, second 2, third 3.\n\nBut wait, n must equal t1 + t2 + ... + tk, where each ti is at least 1. So the approach is to find all possible ways to partition the array into k contiguous segments and compute the sum of maxima for each, then choose the maximum sum.\n\nBut with n up to 2000 and k up to 2000, a brute-force approach is impossible because the number of possible partitions is way too high. So we need a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet me think about the DP state. Maybe dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit when considering the first i elements and splitting them into j days.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each i and j, we want to compute the best way to split the first i elements into j days, maximizing the sum of maxima.\n\nHow to transition between states?\n\nWell, for each i and j, the last day could have ended at position m (m < i). So for each possible m, we consider the maximum of a[m+1...i], add it to the best value of dp[m][j-1], and take the maximum over all m.\n\nSo the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i][j] = max over m from j-1 to i-1 of (dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]))\n\nBut wait, the initial condition is dp[0][0] = 0. Then, for each j, we iterate through i, and for each i, we look back to all possible m that could be the end of the previous segment.\n\nBut what's the time complexity here? Let's see. For each i up to 2000, and j up to 2000, and for each i, m can be up to i-1. So the total steps would be roughly 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10, which is way too big. That won't work.\n\nSo we need to optimize this. How can we compute the max(a[m+1..i]) quickly for all m?\n\nWait, another thought: for a given j and i, the maximum in the current segment can be determined as the maximum of a certain range. If we precompute the maximums for all ranges, perhaps using a sparse table or something like that, then for each m, the max can be retrieved in O(1) time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a way to represent the current segment's maximum in a way that doesn't require checking every possible m each time.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure of the DP. For each j, we process i from 1 to n. For each i, we can track the maximum in the current segment, and update the DP accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the DP can be optimized by precomputing for all possible i and j the best way to split.\n\nAnother angle: the maximum for a segment is the maximum of the elements in that segment. So when we choose a split point m, the new segment is from m+1 to i. The maximum of this segment is the maximum of a[m+1..i].\n\nSo for each i and j, dp[i][j] = max over m in [j-1 to i-1] of (dp[m][j-1] + max_a(m+1, i)).\n\nThe problem is that for each i and j, iterating m from j-1 to i-1 is O(n) per step, leading to O(n^3) time, which is 2000^3 = 8e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nWait, maybe for each j, and for each i, the max of a[m+1..i] for varying m can be represented in a way that allows us to find the best m quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that for a particular j, the optimal m for i is non-decreasing as i increases. This is a common optimization in DP problems where you",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over a given number of days. Each day, Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The goal is to distribute the problems into exactly k contiguous segments to maximize the sum of these maxima.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total profit when considering the first `i` elements split into `j` days.\n2. **State Transition**: For each `i` and `j`, the last segment could end at any position `m` from `j-1` to `i-1`. The maximum profit for the current segment is the maximum value in the subarray `a[m+1..i]`.\n3. **Optimization with Sparse Tables**: To efficiently compute the maximum value for any subarray, we use a sparse table to preprocess the array and answer maximum queries in constant time.\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Segments**: For each possible end position `m` of the previous segment, compute the maximum value for the current segment and update the DP table accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Precompute the sparse table for range maximum queries\n    LOG = 17\n    st = [[0] * n for _ in range(LOG)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        st[0][i] = a[i]\n    for j in range(1, LOG):\n        for i in range(n - (1 << j) + 1):\n            st[j][i] = max(st[j-1][i], st[j-1][i + (1 << (j-1))])\n    \n    def get_max(l, r):\n        length = r - l + 1\n        k = length.bit_length() - 1\n        return max(st[k][l], st[k][r - (1 << k) + 1])\n    \n    # Initialize DP\n    dp = [[0] * (k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for j in range(1, k+1):\n        for i in range(j-1, n+1):\n            if j == 1:\n                current_max = get_max(i-1, i-1)\n                dp[i][j] = current_max\n            else:\n                max_val = 0\n                for m in range(j-1, i):\n                    prev = dp[m][j-1]\n                    current_max = get_max(m, i-1)\n                    total = prev + current_max\n                    if total > max_val:\n                        max_val = total\n                dp[i][j] = max_val\n    \n    # Now reconstruct the solution\n    t = [0] * k\n    ptr = n\n    for j in range(k, 0, -1):\n        m = ptr\n        while m >= j:\n            m -= 1\n        t[j-1] = ptr - m\n        ptr = m\n    \n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, t)))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Preprocessing with Sparse Tables**: We preprocess the array to allow efficient range maximum queries using a sparse table. This helps in quickly determining the maximum value of any subarray.\n2. **DP Initialization and Transition**: We initialize the DP table and iteratively fill it by considering all possible previous segment endings and computing the maximum profit for each possible current segment.\n3. **Reconstructing the Solution**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack to find the optimal segmentations that yield the maximum profit. This involves determining the lengths of each segment in reverse order based on the DP results.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible total profit while adhering to the constraints of the problem.",
