    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the plate is w by h in size, and we add k rings of gilding. Each ring is like a border around the inner rectangle. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, and so on. Each ring is 1 cell thick.\n\nHmm, the key is to figure out for each ring how many cells are added and sum them up until we reach k rings.\n\nLet's think about what each ring contributes. For the i-th ring (starting from 1), the dimensions of the rectangle it's bordering are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Because each ring reduces the width and height by 4 each time—since each side loses 2 cells (left and right, top and bottom).\n\nWait, no. Wait, each ring is one cell thick. So for each ring, the perimeter is the number of cells in that ring.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4, because each corner is counted once, not twice. Like, if you have a rectangle with w columns and h rows, the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). Because each side has length (w or h) but subtract 2 for the corners.\n\nWait, let me think. For a single row, say w=3, the top and bottom edges would be 3 cells each, but when you count all four sides, the corners are shared. So for a 3x3 square, the perimeter is 8: each side is 3, but subtract 4 for the corners. So 3*4 = 12, minus 4 gives 8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current width is w_i = w - 2*(i-1)*2? Or wait, maybe it's better to model it as for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Because each ring takes away two from each side (top, bottom, left, right). So after i rings, the width is w - 4*(i-1), same for height.\n\nSo for the i-th ring, the perimeter is 2*( (w_i) + (h_i) ) -4, where w_i is w - 4*(i-1), h_i is h -4*(i-1). But wait, only if w_i >=2 and h_i >=2. Because if it's 1x1, then the perimeter is 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, when w=7, h=9, and k=2.\n\nFirst ring: 7x9 → perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32.\n\nSecond ring: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4= 16.\n\nTotal is 32+16=48, but the sample output for '7 9 2' is 40. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait the sample input has '7 9 2' with output 40. Let's compute that.\n\nWait, the first ring: 7x9, perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4= 32-4=28?\n\nWait, wait, 2*(7+9) is 32, minus 4 gives 28. Oh right, that's correct. So first ring adds 28 cells.\n\nSecond ring: the inner rectangle is 7-4=3 columns and 9-4=5 rows. So perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4= 16-4=12. So total 28+12=40, which matches the sample.\n\nAh, okay, so my formula was wrong earlier. So for each ring, the perimeter is 2*(w_i + h_i) -4, where w_i and h_i are the current dimensions for that ring.\n\nSo the steps to compute the total gilded cells are:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. If w_i <2 or h_i <2: perhaps this ring isn't possible? But according to the constraints, k is chosen such that it doesn't exceed the maximum possible rings. So we can proceed without checking.\n\n2. For each ring, compute the perimeter as 2*(w_i + h_i) -4.\n\n3. Sum these perimeters for all k rings.\n\nSo the algorithm",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring reduces both the width and height of the plate by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells can be calculated using the perimeter of the current rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by `2 * (w + h) - 4`, which accounts for the corners being counted only once.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each of the `k` rings, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle, calculate its perimeter, and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    wi = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    hi = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (wi + hi) - 4\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` which represent the width, height, and number of rings respectively.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current dimensions `wi` and `hi` by subtracting 4*(i-1) from `w` and `h` respectively.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (wi + hi) - 4`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all `k` rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
