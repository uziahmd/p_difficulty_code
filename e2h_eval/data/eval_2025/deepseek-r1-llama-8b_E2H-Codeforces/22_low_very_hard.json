After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine the number of successful students in a group. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, each student has marks for m subjects. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best in that subject. Being the best means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to find which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the max in any of the subjects.\n\nWait, but how do I process each subject? For each subject across all students, find the highest mark and note which student(s) have it. Because only the students with the maximum mark in that subject can be the best for it.\n\nWait no. Because if multiple students have the same maximum in a subject, then none of them can be the best because there's another student (also) with the same maximum. So for a subject, only the students who have the unique maximum are the best for that subject.\n\nWait, right. For example, if in subject 1, student A has 5 and student B also has 5. Then neither is the best for subject 1 because there's someone else with the same maximum. So only if a student has a unique maximum in their subject, they can be considered as the best.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject:\n   a. Find the maximum mark in that subject across all students.\n   b. Count how many students have this maximum mark.\n   c. If the count is exactly 1, then that student is the best for that subject.\n   d. Otherwise, no student is the best for that subject.\n\n2. For each student, check if they are the best in at least one subject. The total count of such students is the answer.\n\nSo, the steps I need to implement are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read n lines, each representing a student's marks.\n- For each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n   - Collect all the marks from all students in this subject.\n   - Find the maximum mark in this subject.\n   - Count how many students have this mark.\n   - If count is 1, record which student(s) have this mark. But wait, actually, only one student will have it if the maximum is unique. So perhaps, for each subject, we can just store the student index(s) who have the maximum, but only if they are the sole maximum.\n\nWait, no. For each subject, after finding the maximum mark, if only one student has that mark, then that student is the best for that subject. So for each subject, we can find the best student (if any), and then for each student, keep track of whether they are a best in any subject.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize an array or a set for each student, indicating whether they are a best in any subject.\n\nFor each subject j:\n   - For each student i, collect their mark in j.\n   - Find the maximum mark in this subject.\n   - Check how many students have this mark.\n   - If count == 1:\n       - Find the student(s) who have this mark. Since only one, get that student.\n       - Mark this student as being a best in some subject.\n\nOnce all subjects are processed, count the number of students marked as best.\n\nSo, the key is to process each subject, determine if there's a unique maximum, and if so, add that student to the successful list.\n\nNow, how to represent the data.\n\nEach student's marks can be stored as a list of strings or integers. For each subject j, iterate through all students to collect their j-th character, convert to integer.\n\nBut since m can be up to 100, and n up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nWe can have a list of lists: students_marks[i][j] = the mark of student i in subject j.\n\nThen, for each j from 0 to m-1:\n\n   max_mark = max(students_marks[0][j], students_marks[1][j], ..., students_marks[n-1][j])\n\n   count = number of students whose mark in j is equal to max_mark.\n\n   if count == 1:\n\n       student_i = the index where students_marks[i][j] == max_mark.\n\n       add this student_i to a set of successful students.\n\nAt the end, the size of this set is the answer.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines. Each line is a string of m characters, each character is a digit.\n\nConvert each line into a list of integers. For example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nStore all these in a list called students_marks.\n\nThen, for each subject j (from 0 to m-1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the number of students and the number of subjects. Then, read each student's marks for all subjects.\n2. **Track Student Marks:** Store each student's marks in a list of lists where each sublist represents a student's marks across all subjects.\n3. **Determine Best Students per Subject:** For each subject, find the maximum mark. Check how many students have this maximum mark. If only one student has this maximum mark, that student is the best in that subject.\n4. **Count Successful Students:** Maintain a set of students who are the best in at least one subject. The size of this set gives the number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents_marks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students_marks.append(marks)\n\nsuccessful_students = set()\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    count = 0\n    best_student = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_mark = students_marks[i][j]\n        if current_mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = current_mark\n            count = 1\n            best_student = i\n        elif current_mark == max_mark:\n            count += 1\n    if count == 1:\n        successful_students.add(best_student)\n\nprint(len(successful_students))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The first line contains `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line represents a student's marks for each subject.\n2. **Storing Marks:** Each student's marks are stored in a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a student and contains their marks for each subject.\n3. **Processing Each Subject:** For each subject, we iterate through all students to find the maximum mark and count how many students have this mark. If only one student has the maximum mark, that student is marked as successful.\n4. **Counting Successes:** Using a set to track successful students ensures each student is counted only once, even if they are the best in multiple subjects. The size of this set gives the final count of successful students.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each subject and student, ensuring we accurately determine which students are successful.",
