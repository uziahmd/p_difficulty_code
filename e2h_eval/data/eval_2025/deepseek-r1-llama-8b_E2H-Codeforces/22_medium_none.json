After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine the number of successful students in a group. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, each student has marks for m subjects. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best in their group. Being the best means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the input. The input gives n students and m subjects. Each student's marks are given as a string of m characters. For example, if a student's line is '223', and m is 3, then their marks are [2, 2, 3] for subjects 1, 2, 3 respectively.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the order matters here. So the first character is subject 1, second subject 2, etc. So for each subject, we need to find which student has the maximum mark.\n\nSo, for each subject, I can track the maximum mark and which student(s) achieved it. Then, for each student, I check if they are the sole maximum in any subject.\n\nWait, but if multiple students have the same maximum in a subject, none of them would be the best. Because the definition says, a student is the best if there's no one with a higher mark. So if two students have the same max, neither is the best.\n\nWait no, wait. No. If in a subject, the highest mark is 9, and two students have 9, then for that subject, both are not the best. Because the condition is that there exists a student who got a higher mark. Since no one has higher, but more than one has the same max. So in this case, each of them is a best for that subject.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"A student is the best at a subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nSo if a student has the maximum mark for a subject, and no one else has a higher mark, then he is the best in that subject.\n\nSo for example, if in a subject, two students have 9, then both are best because no one has a higher mark than 9. Because 9 is the maximum. So both are the best in that subject.\n\nSo for each subject, we need to find all students who have the maximum mark in that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, if they are the best in at least one subject, they are considered successful.\n\nWait, no. Because if a student is the best in at least one subject, regardless of others, they are counted as successful.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject, determine the maximum mark among all students.\n2. For each subject, collect all students who have that maximum mark.\n3. For each student, check if they are in the best set of at least one subject.\n4. Count the number of such students.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo how do I implement this?\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nThe input has two lines: the first is n and m. Then, n lines follow, each representing a student's marks.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, it's given as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], which seems like it's a list of two test cases, but probably the actual input is from stdin.\n\nWait, no, perhaps in the problem statement, the input is given as a single line with n and m, followed by n lines each representing a student's marks.\n\nWait, the problem says: the first input line contains n and m. Then, the next n lines each describe the gradebook.\n\nSo for the first sample input, the first line is '3 3' meaning 3 students and 3 subjects. Then the next 3 lines are the marks.\n\nEach line is m characters, no spaces. So for example, the first student's line is '223' which is three characters, each being 2, 2, 3.\n\nSo, for each student, we'll process each character as their marks for each subject.\n\nNow, for each subject (from 0 to m-1), we need to find the maximum mark across all students, and collect all students who have that mark.\n\nBut wait, the subjects are per position in the string. So for subject j (0-based), the j-th character of each student's string is their mark.\n\nSo, for each j in 0..m-1:\n\n- Iterate through all students' marks for subject j.\n- Find the maximum value in that column.\n- Collect all students who have this maximum in that column.\n\nOnce we have, for each subject, the list of students who are the best in that subject, we can then count for each student whether they are in at least one of these lists.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read n strings, each of length m. These are the students' marks.\n3. For each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n   a. For each student, get their j-th mark (as integer).\n   b. Find the maximum mark in this subject.\n   c. Collect all students whose mark in this subject equals the maximum.\n4. For each student, check if they are present in any of the collected sets for any subject.\n5. Count the total number of such students.\n\nNow, how to represent this in code.\n\nWe can represent each student as a list of their marks, perhaps as integers. Or, perhaps keep their strings as is, since comparing characters is the same as comparing their numeric values.\n\nWait, the marks are from 1 to 9. So each character is '1' to '9', so when we compare, it's straightforward.\n\nBut in code, we can process each character as an integer.\n\nSo, for each student, we can store their marks as a list of integers.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject j, we can iterate over all students and extract the j-th character, convert to integer, and then find the max.\n\nSo, for each subject j:\n\nmax_mark = -1\nbest_students = []\nfor each student in students:\n    current_mark = int(student[j])\n    if current_mark > max_mark:\n        max_mark = current_mark\n        best_students = [student_index]\n    elif current_mark == max_mark:\n        best_students.append(student_index)\n    # else do nothing\n\nWait, but student indexes are 0-based or not? Well, in code, perhaps it's easier to track each student as their index.\n\nWait, perhaps for each student, we can assign an index (like 0 to n-1). Then, for each subject, we can track which indices are the best.\n\nSo, the data structure could be a list of sets, where for each subject j, the set contains the indices of the students who are best in that subject.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n- Read n, m.\n- Read n lines into a list called students.\n- For each j in 0 to m-1:\n   create a set for this subject's best students.\n   max_mark = 0\n   for i in 0 to n-1:\n       mark = int(students[i][j])\n       if mark > max_mark:\n           max_mark = mark\n           best = {i}\n       elif mark == max_mark:\n           best.add(i)\n   add best to the subjects_best list.\n\nOnce we have this, for each student i, check if i is in any of the sets in subjects_best. If yes, count +=1.\n\nSo, the code outline is clear.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All students have the same marks for all subjects.\n\nIn this case, each student is best in all subjects. So all students are successful.\n\nCase 2: Only one student. Then, he is best in all subjects, so successful.\n\nCase 3: Some subjects have multiple bests, others have one.\n\nAnother point: for each subject, the best students are those with the maximum. So for each subject, the best students are determined correctly.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nsubjects_best = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = 0\n    best = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        mark = int(students[i][j])\n        if mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = mark\n            best = {i}\n        elif mark == max_mark:\n            best.add(i)\n    subjects_best.append(best)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    in_any = False\n    for best in subjects_best:\n        if i in best:\n            in_any = True\n            break\n    if in_any:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo, the students' marks are:\n\nStudent 0: '2','2','3'\n\nStudent 1: '2','3','2'\n\nStudent 2: '1','1','2'\n\nFor each subject:\n\nSubject 0: j=0.\n\nmarks are 2, 2, 1.\n\nmax is 2. So students 0 and 1 are best.\n\nSo subject 0's best is {0,1}.\n\nSubject 1: j=1.\n\nmarks are 2,3,1.\n\nmax is 3. Only student 1 has it. So best is {1}.\n\nSubject 2: j=2.\n\nmarks are 3,2,2.\n\nmax is 3. Only student 0 has it. So best is {0}.\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent 0: in subject 0 and subject 2. So yes.\n\nStudent 1: in subject 0 and 1. Yes.\n\nStudent 2: nowhere. So count is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nWait, let's see each subject:\n\nWait, the students' marks are:\n\nStudent 0: '9','1','7','2','8'\n\nStudent 1: '1','1','8','2','8'\n\nStudent 2: '1','1','1','1','1'\n\nFor each subject j:\n\nj=0:\n\nmarks: 9,1,1. Max is 9. Only student 0.\n\nSo subject 0's best is {0}.\n\nj=1:\n\nall have 1 except student 0? Wait, student 0's j=1 is '1'.\n\nNo, wait all students' j=1 marks are 1,1,1. So all have same mark. So all are best.\n\nSo best is {0,1,2}.\n\nj=2:\n\nstudent 0:7; student1:8; student2:1.\n\nMax is 8. Only student1.\n\nj=3:\n\nall have 2. So all are best.\n\nj=4:\n\nstudent0:8; student1:8; student2:1.\n\nMax is 8. Both 0 and 1.\n\nSo for each subject, the bests are:\n\nsubject 0: {0}\n\nsubject1: {0,1,2}\n\nsubject2: {1}\n\nsubject3: {0,1,2}\n\nsubject4: {0,1}\n\nSo now, each student:\n\nStudent0: in subject0, subject1, subject3, subject4.\n\nSo he is successful.\n\nStudent1: in subject1, subject2, subject3, subject4.\n\nStudent2: in subject1, subject3.\n\nSo all three are successful. Hence output is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code should handle this correctly.\n\nNow, what about when a subject has no best students? Well, that's impossible because for every subject, there must be some maximum.\n\nBecause all marks are at least 1. So the maximum is at least 1, and at least one student will have that.\n\nThus, the code will always have some best students for each subject.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. So student is the best in only subject, so output is 1.\n\nWhat about when all students have same marks in all subjects? Like n=2, m=2, both students have '11' and '11'. Then, each is best in both subjects. So count is 2.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about how to read the input.\n\nIn Python, the input can be read via stdin. But sometimes, for programming competition problems, the input can be provided as a list of strings, but in this case, the input is via standard input.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of two strings, but that's probably just for illustration. In reality, the input is:\n\nFirst line: n m\n\nNext n lines: each line is a string of m digits.\n\nSo, for the code, the first line is read as n, m. Then, read n lines as the students' marks.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nSo, the code is ready.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nstudents = ['223', '232', '112']\n\nsubjects:\n\nj=0: 2,2,1 → max 2, students 0 and 1.\n\nj=1: 2,3,1 → max 3, student1.\n\nj=2:3,2,2 → max 3, student0.\n\nsubjects_best is:\n\n[{0,1}, {1}, {0}]\n\nFor each student:\n\nstudent0: in {0,1}? No, he's in subject0 and subject2.\n\nWait, wait, no, the subjects_best is for each j. So for j=0, the best is {0,1}; for j=1, {1}; j=2, {0}.\n\nSo for student0: j=0, he is in best, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, student1 is in j=0 and j=1, so yes.\n\nStudent2 is not in any.\n\nSo count is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3, m=5.\n\nstudents = ['91728', '11828', '11111']\n\nsubjects_best for each j:\n\nj=0: 9,1,1 → max 9, student0.\n\nj=1: all 1's → students0,1,2.\n\nj=2: 7,8,1 → max 8, student1.\n\nj=3: all 2's → students0,1,2.\n\nj=4: 8,8,1 → max 8, students0,1.\n\nSo subjects_best for each j:\n\nj0: {0}, j1: {0,1,2}, j2: {1}, j3: {0,1,2}, j4: {0,1}.\n\nEach student is in at least one of the sets.\n\nSo count is 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1.\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n5\n\nThe code should output 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n11\n\n22\n\nSo, for each subject j:\n\nj=0: 1 vs 2 → max 2, student1.\n\nj=1: 1 vs 2 → max 2, student1.\n\nSo for student0: no subjects where he is best.\n\nStudent1: best in both, so count is 1.\n\nSo code outputs 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",
