Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about matching left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. Each boot has a color which is a lowercase letter or '?'. Two boots are compatible if they are the same specific color, or one is '?'.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible. Also, each boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\nThe input gives two strings, l for left boots and r for right boots, each of length n.\n\nI need to output the maximum number of pairs and list them in some order.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the constraints: n can be up to 150,000, so any O(n^2) approach is out of the question. We need something efficient, probably O(n) or O(n log n).\n\nSo, the challenge is to find as many compatible pairs as possible, ensuring that each left and right boot is used only once.\n\nWait, but how? Because for each left boot, we need to find a right boot that's compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut considering all possibilities directly would be too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: group the left and right boots by their color (or '?'), and then for each possible color combination, calculate how many pairs can be formed between lefts of that color and rights of another compatible color.\n\nWait, but that might not capture the maximum correctly because some combinations could allow more pairs when considering '?' as a wildcard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right boots if they are compatible. Then, the maximum matching would give the answer. But with n up to 150,000, building such a graph isn't feasible.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps we need a way to count pairs efficiently without explicitly checking each possibility.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases:\n\nFor a left boot l_i and a right boot r_j, they are compatible if:\n\n- l_i == r_j, or\n- l_i is '?', or\n- r_j is '?'.\n\nSo, for each left boot, I can look for right boots that match either exactly, or are '?', or the left is '?'.\n\nWait, but even this seems tricky because for each left, I'd have to scan through all rights, which is O(n^2).\n\nSo, perhaps we need a way to count the number of possible pairs without checking each one.\n\nAnother thought: Let's consider all possible pairs of colors (c1, c2) where c1 is from left and c2 is from right. For each such pair, if they are compatible, we can take the minimum of the counts of c1 in left and c2 in right, but also considering the '?'.\n\nWait, but that's probably not sufficient because the '?' can match any other color.\n\nWait, let's break it down.\n\nLet me create frequency tables for left and right.\n\nFor left:\n- count_l[c] = number of times color c appears in left.\n- count_l[q] = number of '?' in left.\n\nSimilarly for right:\n- count_r[c] = number of times color c appears in right.\n- count_r[q] = number of '?' in right.\n\nNow, the total possible pairs can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each color c in left:\n- The number of rights that can pair with these lefts is the sum of:\n   - count_r[c], because those are exact matches.\n   - count_r['?'], because those can be matched by any left (including c).\nAdditionally, the '?' in left can be matched with any right (exact or '?').\n\nBut wait, this is getting complicated because the '?' in left can match any right, including their own '?', which may have already been counted.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem by considering all possible ways of pairing left and right, and then find the maximum matching.\n\nAlternatively, here's an alternative plan:\n\nWe can think of the problem as trying to pair left and right boots, considering the following:\n\nEach pair must consist of a left and a right boot where their colors are compatible.\n\nWe can model this as a bipartite graph, but again, with n=150,000, standard algorithms won't work.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution involves greedy matching, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: since each pair uses one left and one right, perhaps the maximum possible pairs is min(total left, total right). But that's not necessarily correct because some lefts and rights may not be compatible.\n\nBut in this problem, due to the compatibility rules, the maximum possible pairs is not simply the minimum of the two counts.\n\nWait, but maybe not. For example, if all lefts are 'a' and all rights are 'b', then no pairs can be formed. So the maximum is zero.\n\nSo, what",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots such that each pair consists of one left and one right boot with compatible colors. Each boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Frequency Counting**: First, we count the frequency of each specific color and the number of '?' in both the left and right boot strings. This helps us efficiently determine how many pairs can be formed for each color combination.\n\n2. **Compatibility Check**: For each possible color combination between left and right boots, we check if they are compatible. A pair is compatible if:\n   - Both boots have the same specific color.\n   - At least one of the boots has a '?', which makes it compatible with any other color.\n\n3. **Greedy Matching**: Using the frequency counts, we form pairs by iterating through each color and checking how many compatible rights can be paired with the left boots of that color. We also consider the '?' in left and right boots to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: After determining the maximum number of pairs and the specific indices, we output the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = input[1]\n    r = input[2]\n\n    # Precompute positions for each boot\n    left_pos = {c: [] for c in set(l)}\n    for idx, c in enumerate(l):\n        left_pos[c].append(idx+1)  # 1-based index\n    left_q = [i+1 for i, c in enumerate(l) if c == '?']\n\n    right_pos = {c: [] for c in set(r)}\n    for idx, c in enumerate(r):\n        right_pos[c].append(idx+1)\n    right_q = [i+1 for i, c in enumerate(r) if c == '?']\n\n    # Now, for each possible left color, find compatible right colors\n    # We'll process the left in a way that maximizes the pairs\n    # The key is to handle the '?' as a wildcard\n\n    # Let's collect all possible color combinations\n    # Also, process the '?' in left and right separately\n\n    max_pairs = 0\n    used_left = [False] * (n + 1)\n    used_right = [False] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Handle the '?' in left first\n    # They can match any right (including '?')\n    q_left = left_q.copy()\n    q_right = right_q.copy()\n\n    # Take the minimum of q_left and (sum of right's ? + all right colors)\n    # But since each right can be used only once, we need to find how many can be matched\n\n    # To handle this efficiently, we can model it as a bipartite graph and find maximum matching,\n    # but that's not feasible for n=150,000.

The maximum possible pairs is the sum over all compatible color pairs, but each left and right can be used once.\n\n    # So, perhaps the optimal approach is to collect all possible left and right compatible pairs and then find the maximum matching.\n\n    # Since this is impractical, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\n    # Let's think about the problem in terms of two separate parts: the non-'?' pairs and the '?' pairs.\n\n    # For non-'?' pairs:\n    # For each color c, the maximum possible pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\n    # For the '?' pairs:\n    # The left '?' can pair with any right, including the right's '?', but each can only be used once.\n\n    # So, the total maximum pairs would be the sum of non-'?' pairs plus the additional '?' pairs.\n\n    # But even this is not straightforward because some right boots may have been used in non-'?' pairs.\n\n    # So, perhaps the solution is to first compute the non-'?' pairs, subtract them from the available rights, and then compute the '?' pairs.\n\n    # Let me try this approach.\n\n    # Step 1: Compute non-'?' pairs\n    # For each color c, take the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c], add to the total.\n    # Mark these pairs as used.\n\n    non_q_pairs = 0\n    used_right_nonq = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in left_pos:\n        if c in right_pos:\n            min_count = min(len(left_pos[c]), len(right_pos[c]))\n            if min_count > 0:\n                non_q_pairs += min_count\n                # Mark these rights as used for non-q\n                used_right_nonq[c] += min_count\n\n    # Now, for the remaining rights, which are not used in non-q pairs:\n    # Collect the remaining rights\n    remaining_right = []\n    for c in right_pos:\n        if c in used_right_nonq:\n            remaining = len(right_pos[c]) - used_right_nonq[c]\n        else:\n            remaining = len(right_pos[c])\n        if remaining > 0:\n            remaining_right.extend([c]*remaining)\n        # Also, collect the remaining rights for '?'\n        if c == '?':\n            remaining_right.append(('?')*(remaining))\n        # Wait, no, better to track the actual counts.\n\n    # Wait, perhaps it's better to track for each color, how many are left after non-q pairs.\n\n    # Create a dictionary for remaining rights:\n    rem_right = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in right_pos:\n        if c in used_right_nonq:\n            rem_right[c] = right_pos[c][len(used_right_nonq[c]):]\n        else:\n            rem_right[c] = right_pos[c][:]\n\n    # Now, handle the '?' in left.\n    # For each left '?', it can match any remaining right (including '?')\n\n    # Also, the remaining rights can have their own '?', which can be matched by left's '?'.\n\n    # So, the number of '?' in left is len(left_q).\n\n    # The number of '?' in remaining right is rem_right['?'].\n\n    # The total additional pairs from '?' is the minimum of len(left_q) and sum(rem_right.values()).\n\n    # Because each left '?' can be matched with any remaining right, including those that are '?'\n\n    # Wait, but rem_right includes all remaining right colors, including '?'\n\n    # So, the maximum possible additional pairs from left '?' is min(len(left_q), sum(rem_right.values())).\n\n    # However, this might not capture cases where some rights are '?', which can be matched by multiple lefts.\n\n    # Hmm, but in reality, each right can be used only once, so the maximum number of pairs is the minimum of left_q and the total remaining rights.\n\n    # So, the additional pairs from left '?' is min(len(left_q), sum(rem_right.values())).\n\n    # But wait, some of the rem_right could be '?', which can also be matched by each other.\n\n    # So, the total additional pairs from '?' is min(len(left_q), sum(rem_right.values())).\n\n    # Let me denote this as q_pairs = min(len(left_q), sum(rem_right.values())).\n\n    # Then, the total pairs is non_q_pairs + q_pairs.\n\n    # But this might not be correct because some of the rem_right could be '?', which could be paired among themselves, but that's handled in the q_pairs.\n\n    # So, the approach is:\n\n    # 1.
