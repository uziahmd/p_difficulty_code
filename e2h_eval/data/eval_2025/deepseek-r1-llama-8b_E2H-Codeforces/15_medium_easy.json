They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. The tournament has 2^n -1 games in total. The structure is such that in each phase, the number of games halves each time. Like, first phase has 2^(n-1) games, then 2^(n-2), and so on until one game in the last phase.\n\nEach game results in one team being eliminated. The outcome depends on the string s provided. For each phase i (from 0 to n-1), if s[i] is '0', then in that phase, each match is won by the lower-skilled team. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nWe are given a permutation p of integers from 1 to 2^n. The task is to find all integers x such that there exists a permutation where x is the champion (the only remaining team).\n\nHmm, so for each x, we need to determine if it's possible for x to win the tournament given the rules based on the string s.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? It seems like a tree of possibilities, but for n up to 18, 2^18 is 262144. So brute-forcing all possibilities isn't feasible.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. Each phase is a round where matches happen between adjacent pairs. For example, in the first phase, the matches are 1v2, 3v4, etc. Then, the winners proceed to the next phase, which groups them into larger blocks.\n\nSo the key idea is to model the progression through each phase, ensuring that the chosen x can reach the final as the sole winner.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the tournament as a binary elimination tree, and for each position, determine the necessary conditions for x to win.\n\nBut since the order of the matches and the outcomes are determined by the string s, maybe we can precompute for each possible x whether it's possible for it to win under the given s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the tournament as a series of rounds, and for each round, determine the required arrangement of the teams that must lead to x winning.\n\nAnother approach: Since the tournament is a single-elimination bracket, each team must win all their matches along their path to the championship. So for x to be the champion, it must survive each phase until the final.\n\nWait, but the way the matches are structured is crucial. In each phase, the teams are grouped into blocks, and within each block, two teams compete. The winners then form a new block in the next phase.\n\nSo, for example, in the first phase, the teams are paired as (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2k+1, 2k+2). Then, the winners of these pairs form the next phase as (winner of first pair, winner of second pair), and so on.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the first phase, it's 2^{n-1} games. Then, each phase after that reduces the number of teams by half each time. So the grouping is a bit different.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure more carefully. Suppose n=3, so there are 8 teams. The phases are as follows:\n\nPhase 1: 4 games. Teams are 1v2, 3v4, 5v6, 7v8. Winners (4) proceed to phase 2.\n\nPhase 2: 2 games. The winners of 1v2 play against the winners of 3v4, and similarly for the other two initial matches. So four winners from phase 1 play, but wait, no—phase 1 has 4 games, resulting in 4 winners. Phase 2 has 2 games, each consisting of two winners from phase 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 2^{n-1} is the number of games in the first phase. So for n=3, phase 1 has 4 games, resulting in 4 winners. Phase 2 has 2 games, each involving two of those four, leading to 2 winners. Phase 3 has 1 game, determining the champion.\n\nWait, no. Because 2^n is 8 teams. After phase 1, 4 teams remain. Phase 2: 4 teams play in 2 games (each game produces one winner). So 2 winners go to phase 3, which is the final game.\n\nSo each phase k (starting from 0) has 2^{n-k} games, and the number of teams after phase k is 2^{n - k}.\n\nSo the tournament is structured as a binary tree. Each node represents a group of 2^m teams, and the leaves are the initial matches.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the tournament as a series of rounds, each with a certain grouping of teams.\n\nFor each phase, the teams are arranged into consecutive blocks of size 2^{current level}. For example, phase 0 (first phase) has groups of size 2, phase 1 has groups of size 4, phase 2 has groups of size 8, etc., but wait, no—because each phase reduces the number of teams by half.\n\nWait, perhaps each phase has a grouping size of 2^i, where i is the phase index. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIn the first phase, the groupings are of size 2, so 2^1. Second phase, groupings are of size 4, which is 2^2. Third phase, groupings are 8, which is 2^3. But wait, for n=3, the third phase is the final, with 2 teams. So perhaps the grouping in phase i is 2^{n-i}.\n\nWait, for phase 0, the number of games is 2^{n-1}, because 2^n / 2 = 2^{n-1}.\n\nYes, because each phase has 2^{n - i} games, and 2^{n - i} is equal to 2^{(n - i)}.\n\nSo for phase i, the groupings are of size 2^{i+1}. Because in phase i, each match is between two consecutive teams, grouped in blocks of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each phase as the teams being divided into blocks of 2^{i+1}, and within each block, two teams play, and the winner proceeds to the next phase.\n\nWait, no. Let's think for phase 0: each block is size 2, so 2 teams per block, 2^{n-1} blocks. Each block has a game, producing a winner, so 2^{n-1} winners.\n\nPhase 1: the 2^{n-1} winners are grouped into blocks of 2^{n-2} size each? No, wait, 2^{n-1} / 2^{n-2} = 2, so each block would consist of two winners from phase 0. So phase 1 has 2^{n-2} games, each involving two winners from phase 0, producing 2^{n-2} winners.\n\nWait, yes. So phase i has 2^{n-i} games, each in a block of 2^{i+1} teams, and each game produces one winner. So the number of teams after phase i is 2^{n - i}.\n\nSo, for phase i, the teams are grouped into blocks of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nWait, but for i=0, the group size is 2^{1}=2, which makes sense. For i=1, group size is 4, which when the previous phase had 4 winners, they are grouped into 2 blocks of 4, each containing 2 winners from phase 0. So each game in phase 1 is between two winners from phase 0.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and the number of games is 2^{n - i}.\n\nNow, the question is, for each x, can it be the champion given the string s.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial matches. Each internal node represents the winner of its child matches.\n\nSo, the root is the final match. Its left and right children are the winners of the two subtrees. Each of those has their own children, etc.\n\nSo, to determine if x can be the champion, we need to ensure that x is present in all the positions that could lead to the root of the tournament tree.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother idea: The tournament can be represented as a binary heap-like structure, where each non-leaf node represents a match between two winners from the previous phase.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of its own subtree, which covers a certain range of teams. For each phase, the grouping determines which teams can meet in the next phase.\n\nThus, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the matches in its path from the initial phase to the final.\n\nBut how do we model the constraints imposed by each phase's outcome based on s?\n\nEach phase i has a rule s[i]. For each match in phase i, if s[i] is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled wins.\n\nSo, for each match in each phase, we can model the required relative skill levels of the two teams involved.\n\nBut considering the entire tournament, it's a complex structure because each team's path to the final depends on the outcomes of all previous phases.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase, the groupings determine which teams can potentially meet in the next phase. So, for x to be the champion, it must be in a certain subset of the groupings.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to model the tournament as a series of decisions, where each phase imposes certain constraints on the ranks of the teams.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe a better way is to represent the tournament as a binary tree, where each node is a match. For each match, depending on the phase and the rule, we can determine the required relationship between the two participants.\n\nThen, for each x, we can see if there's a way to arrange the other teams such that x wins all required matches.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the structure of the tournament in terms of the phases and groupings.\n\nEach phase i corresponds to grouping the remaining teams into blocks of size 2^{i+1}, then each block plays an internal game, with the winner proceeding to the next phase.\n\nSo, the key is to determine, for each x, the earliest phase in which it must be the winner of its block, and enforce the rules for that phase.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the process recursively. For each phase, starting from the last one and moving backward, determine which teams can possibly be the winner of their respective sub-tournaments.\n\nWait, perhaps a dynamic programming approach where for each possible subset of teams and a current phase, we track which teams can be the winner.\n\nBut with n up to 18, 2^18 is 262,144, which is manageable but might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, we can determine the set of teams that must be in the same branch as x in each phase, based on the rules and the phase's s[i].\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the structure of the tournament:\n\nEach phase i has a certain grouping size. For phase i, the groupings are of size 2^{i+1}. Each group consists of 2^{i+1} consecutive teams.\n\nWait, no. Because in phase i, the groupings are formed by the winners from the previous phase, which themselves are already grouped. So, it's unclear whether the groupings are contiguous or not.\n\nWait, maybe the groupings are indeed contiguous. Because in phase 0, the groupings are 1v2, 3v4, etc. So, for phase 1, the groupings would be (winner of 1v2 vs winner of 3v4), (winner of 5v6 vs winner of 7v8). So, the groupings are in blocks of 4 consecutive teams.\n\nSimilarly, phase 2 would group the 4 winners into 2 blocks of 8 consecutive teams, each consisting of two previous winners.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because phase 2 would have 2^{n-2} games. For n=3, phase 2 has 2 games, each involving two winners from phase 1. Those winners come from phase 1, which were the winners of 4 games. So, for phase 2, the groupings are of size 4, and each group is made up of two winners from phase 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the groupings for phase i are of size 2^{i+1} and consist of consecutive 2^{i+1} teams in the initial list.\n\nSo, for phase i, the groupings are [1..2^{i+1}], [2^{i+1}+1..2^{i+2}], etc.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each phase i, the groupings are in blocks of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nThus, for each phase i, the teams are grouped into consecutive blocks of size 2^{i+1}, and within each block, a game is played between the two teams at positions 2k*2^{i+1} and 2k*2^{i+1} + 1.\n\nWait, perhaps. So for phase i, the groupings are in blocks of 2^{i+1} teams, and within each block, the first two teams play, then the next two, etc.\n\nBut in any case, the main point is that for each phase, the groupings are based on consecutive blocks of a certain size.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and the number of games is 2^{n-i}.\n\nThus, for phase i, each group is a set of 2^{i+1} consecutive teams, and within each group, the first two play, the next two, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because in phase 0, the group size is 2, so the initial matches are between 1v2, 3v4, etc.\n\nIn phase 1, the group size is 4, so the winners of 1v2 and 3v4 play against each other. Similarly, the winners of 5v6 and 7v8 play against each other. So, each group is a collection of two previous groups.\n\nSo, phase 1's groups are made by combining two phase 0 groups. So, each phase i's group is composed of 2^{i} groups from phase i-1.\n\nThis suggests that the grouping is hierarchical, and the structure is a perfect binary tree.\n\nGiven this structure, perhaps for each x, we can determine the set of required opponents in each phase, and model the necessary constraints on their skills based on s.\n\nWait, but for x to win, it must be the overall winner. So, for each phase, x must be the winner of its group in that phase.\n\nBut wait, in each phase, x's group may include other teams, and the way those teams are arranged affects whether x can win.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find, for each x, the minimal and maximal possible rank it can have, given the rules in each phase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, we can model the constraints on the other teams' ranks that must be satisfied for x to reach the final.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe we can model this as a bitmask problem, where each bit represents a team, and for each phase, we determine which bits must be in the same group as x, and what the rules imply about their relative rankings.\n\nWait, that's an interesting idea. Let's think about it.\n\nEach phase i requires that x is in a group of 2^{i+1} consecutive teams. Within that group, x must win its match, which depends on s[i].\n\nIf s[i] is '0', then in the group, the lower-ranked team wins. So, in the group, x must be the lowest-ranked among the two teams in its match.\n\nIf s[i] is '1', then x must be the highest-ranked among the two in its match.\n\nWait, but the group is split into pairs, and each pair plays. So, for a group of 2^{i+1} teams, the matches are 1v2, 3v4, ..., 2k-1 v 2k, where k is 2^i.\n\nWait, no, that's for phase 0. For phase i, the group is of size 2^{i+1}, so in phase i, the group is split into 2^i matches.\n\nSo, for phase i, the group of 2^{i+1} teams is split into 2^i matches, each between consecutive pairs.\n\nThus, for phase i, the two teams in each match are in adjacent positions within the group.\n\nTherefore, for each phase i, the group of x must be such that x is paired with some other team in the group, and depending on s[i], x must be either the lower or higher ranked.\n\nBut for x to win all phases, it must be able to pair with all the other teams in its group across all phases.\n\nWait, but x can only be in one group per phase. So, for each phase i, x is in a group of size 2^{i+1}, and the group is formed by 2^{i} consecutive matches.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to represent, for each phase i, the group that x is in, and determine the constraints on the other teams in that group.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, we can determine the positions it must be in for each phase, and for each phase, the necessary constraints on the other teams in its group.\n\nWait, perhaps the group for phase i is determined by the previous groupings. For example, the group in phase i is formed by grouping together the previous winners from phase i-1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that for x to be the champion, in each phase, it must be the winner of its group, which implies certain constraints on the other teams in that group.\n\nBut how to model the group for each phase.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the group that x is in is a set of 2^{i+1} consecutive teams, and x must be in a certain position within that group.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: For each phase, the group that x is in is determined by the previous phase's groupings.\n\nWait, perhaps the group for phase i is a subtree of the tournament structure, and the path from x to the root is fixed.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea: Think about the tournament as a series of layers. Each layer corresponds to a phase. For each layer, the teams are grouped into blocks of size 2^{layer+1}. Within each block, the teams are paired off, and the winners proceed to the next layer.\n\nSo, for each layer i, the group that x is in is a block of 2^{i+1} consecutive teams in the initial arrangement.\n\nWait, but the initial arrangement is a permutation. So, the group structure depends on the permutation p.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is given as a permutation of 1..2^n. So, the initial order is fixed as per p. So, the groupings for each phase are based on consecutive pairs in the permutation.\n\nWait, no! Because the initial arrangement is given by the permutation p. So, the initial matches are between p[0] and p[1], p[2] and p[3], etc.\n\nSo, the initial order is determined by the permutation p. So, the group structure for each phase depends on the order of the permutation.\n\nWait, but that complicates things because the group structure is determined by the permutation. So, for a given permutation p, the groupings for each phase are determined, and the rules s[i] dictate the outcome of each match.\n\nThus, the problem is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion, given the rules s.\n\nWait, but how do we model the permutation p? Because for each phase, the groupings are determined by the permutation, and the rules determine which teams win.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: For a given x, can we construct a permutation p such that x becomes the champion, following the rules s?\n\nPerhaps, for each x, we can try to determine if there's a way to arrange the permutation p such that x wins all necessary matches.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament again. For x to be the champion, it must win all matches in each phase. Each match in phase i is part of a group of 2^{i+1} teams.\n\nWait, but for phase i, the group is determined by the permutation p. So, in phase i, the group is a consecutive block of 2^{i+1} teams in p, and within that block, the first two play, then the next two, etc.\n\nThus, for x to win in phase i, it must be in a group where, according to s[i], x is the winner of its match.\n\nBut since the permutation p is arbitrary, perhaps we can arrange p such that x is positioned in a way that allows it to win all required matches.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is given as a permutation of 1..2^n. So, the initial order is p[0], p[1], p[2], ..., p[2^n-1].\n\nThus, the group structure is determined by the permutation.\n\nSo, the initial phase (phase 0) is grouping the first two, then the next two, etc. So, for phase 0, the groupings are (p[0], p[1]), (p[2], p[3]), etc.\n\nIn phase 1, the groupings are (winners of phase 0's first group, winners of phase 0's second group), etc.\n\nWait, no. Because phase 1's groupings are formed by the winners of phase 0. So, the groupings in phase 1 are determined by the winners of phase 0's matches.\n\nSo, the group structure for phase 1 is the winners of phase 0's groups, arranged in the same order as the original permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the winners of phase 0's groups are the winners of each pair in the initial permutation.\n\nSo, phase 1's groupings are in the same order as phase 0's groupings. For example, in phase 0, the groups are (p0, p1), (p2, p3), etc. The winners are w0, w1, w2, w3, etc. Then, in phase 1, the groupings are (w0, w1), (w2, w3), etc. So, the group structure is preserved.\n\nThus, for phase i, the group structure is the same as the initial permutation, grouped into consecutive blocks of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nSo, for phase i, the group is p[0..2^{i+1}-1], p[2^{i+1}..2^{i+2}-1], etc.\n\nWait, no. Because phase 0 is grouping into blocks of size 2, phase 1 into blocks of size 4, phase 2 into blocks of size 8, etc.\n\nSo, for phase i, the group is a block of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nThus, the group structure for phase i is the same as the initial permutation, just grouped into larger blocks.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the groups are of size 2^{i+1}, and within each group, the matches are played as before.\n\nThus, the group structure is determined by the initial permutation.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of its group in every phase, considering the rules s[i].\n\nSo, for each phase i, x must be in a group of size 2^{i+1}, and within that group, it must win its match according to s[i].\n\nBut how does this translate into constraints on the permutation p?\n\nPerhaps, for each x, we can model the necessary constraints on the permutation p such that x is the winner of each of its matches in all phases.\n\nBut since p is a permutation, it's a bijection, so each team appears exactly once.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can model the minimal and maximal possible ranks that x can have in the permutation, considering the rules s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the group structure is fixed by the permutation, perhaps for x to be the champion, it must be the case that in each phase i, the group that x is in must have x as the winner according to s[i].\n\nThus, for each phase i, x must be in a group of 2^{i+1} teams, and within that group, x's match must result in x winning.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the group is a block of 2^{i+1} consecutive teams in the permutation. So, for phase 0, the group is 2 teams, phase 1 is 4, etc.\n\nBut the permutation p is such that each group is a consecutive block. So, for phase i, the group containing x is a consecutive block of 2^{i+1} teams in p.\n\nThus, for x to win phase i, within that group, it must be the winner of its match. But the match is determined by the group's structure.\n\nWait, but the group is a block of 2^{i+1} teams. Within that block, the matches are between consecutive pairs.\n\nSo, for a group of size 2^{i+1}, the matches are between positions 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, ..., 2k-2k+1, where k = 2^i.\n\nThus, in the group, x is in some position, and must be paired with one other team in the group.\n\nDepending on s[i], x must be the lower or higher ranked.\n\nSo, for x to win phase i, it must be positioned in a way that, in its match within the group, it satisfies the rule.\n\nBut since the permutation p is under our control (we need to find any permutation that allows x to win), perhaps we can arrange p such that x meets all the required constraints.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the permutation p must also allow x to win all previous phases.\n\nSo, it's a cumulative effect.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps for each x, we can model the necessary constraints on the permutation p, such that in each phase i, x is placed in a group where it can satisfy the s[i] condition.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for x to be the champion, in each phase i, x must be the winner of its match in that phase, which depends on the s[i] rule.\n\nMoreover, the group structure for each phase is a consecutive block of 2^{i+1} teams.\n\nThus, for each phase i, the group that x is in is a consecutive block of 2^{i+1} teams in p.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to ensuring that, for each phase i, in the group of 2^{i+1} teams that x is in, x is paired with a team such that according to s[i], x wins.\n\nAdditionally, the permutation must be such that the winners of each phase form a valid tournament path leading to x.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, x must be in a group of 2^{i+1} teams, and within that group, x must be the winner of its match. This imposes certain constraints on the permutation p.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, suppose phase i has s[i] = 0. Then, in x's group, the team that x is paired with must have a lower rank than x. So, in the permutation p, the group must have x and this team in consecutive positions, with x being the higher-ranked.\n\nAlternatively, if s[i] = 1, then x must be the higher-ranked team in its pair.\n\nWait, but the group is of size 2^{i+1}, so the pairing is determined by the group's structure.\n\nSo, for phase i, the group is a consecutive block of 2^{i+1} teams in p. The matches are between consecutive pairs: (a0, a1), (a2, a3), ..., (a_{2^i-1}, a_{2^i}).\n\nThus, for x to be the winner of its match in phase i, x must be in one of the even positions, say j, and a_j must be less than a_{j+1} if s[i] is 0, or greater if s[i] is 1.\n\nWait, no. Because in the match, the two teams are a_j and a_{j+1}, and according to s[i], the winner is determined.\n\nSo, for s[i] = 0, the lower-ranked team wins. So, in the pair (a_j, a_{j+1}), the team with the lower value (smaller p value) is the winner.\n\nFor s[i] = 1, the higher-ranked team wins.\n\nThus, for x to win its match in phase i, it must be the case that either:\n\n- s[i] is 0 and x is the smaller of the two, or\n\n- s[i] is 1 and x is the larger of the two.\n\nSo, for each phase i, x must be in a group where, in its pair, it satisfies this condition.\n\nBut how do we model this across all phases?\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can model the required constraints on the permutation p. For each phase i, x must be in a group where, in the pair it's in during that phase, it meets the s[i] condition.\n\nBut since the permutation p must be consistent across all phases, this complicates matters.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the permutation p is a linear arrangement, perhaps for x to be the champion, the permutation must be such that in every phase i, x is placed in a specific way within its group.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the group that x is in is a consecutive block of 2^{i+1} teams. Within this block, the pairing is determined by the even indices.\n\nSo, x must be in an even position within its group for phase i. Because the pairs are (0,1), (2,3), etc.\n\nThus, for phase i, the group of x is of size 2^{i+1}, and x is in position 2k within this group.\n\nSo, in the permutation p, x is placed at position (start of group) + 2k.\n\nBut the start of the group depends on the previous phases.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternative Approach: Let's model the tournament as a binary tree where each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial matches. The root is the final match, and each internal node has two children representing the two matches that fed into it.\n\nFor x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the matches in its path from the root to the leaves.\n\nEach match has a rule (s[i]) that determines which team wins, based on their relative ranks.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be possible to assign ranks to all teams such that, for every match along x's path, the winner is determined correctly by the rule.\n\nWait, but this is similar to building a binary decision tree where each node's outcome depends on the relative ranks of the two teams.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to checking whether x can be the root of such a binary tree, given the rules for each match.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis feels like a graph problem where each match is a node, and the edges represent the possible winners based on the rules.\n\nBut with 2^18 teams, it's impossible to model directly.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps for each x, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible values of x such that it can win the tournament, given the rules s.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to compute that.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible x is 1, and the maximal is 2^n. But given the rules, certain x may not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the tournament as a series of constraints on the permutation p.\n\nEach phase i imposes certain constraints on the permutation p, such that x is the champion.\n\nBut how to represent these constraints.\n\nPerhaps, for each phase i, we can determine the possible positions of x within its group, and the relative ordering of x and its opponent in that match.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the tournament as a series of layers, where each layer corresponds to a phase. For each layer, we can determine which teams must be in the same subtree as x.\n\nWait, perhaps for x to be the champion, it must be the case that in each phase i, x is in a group where it can win according to s[i], and the other teams in that group are arranged in a way that allows x to proceed to the next phase.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should look for patterns or properties that can help.\n\nLooking at the example:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n\n101\n\nThe output is 4 5 6 7.\n\nWait, for n=3, 2^3=8 teams.\n\ns is '101'. So, phase 0: s[0] is '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nPhase 1: s[1] is '0' → lower skill wins.\n\nPhase 2: s[2] is '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nWait, but the output is 4,5,6,7.\n\nSo, the possible x's are 4,5,6,7.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat's special about these numbers? They are the top four teams in the higher half of the permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps for the given s, the champion must be in the upper half.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause phase 0 is s[0]='1', so higher-skilled teams win their matches. So, in phase 0, the higher-skilled teams proceed.\n\nThus, the group in phase 0 will have higher-skilled teams advancing. So, the initial matches in phase 0 will be between 1v2, 3v4, etc. With s[0]=1, higher-skilled teams win, so 2,4,6,8 proceed to phase 1.\n\nThen, in phase 1, s[1] is '0' → lower-skilled teams win. So, in phase 1, the group is 4 teams: 2,4,6,8. The matches are 2v4 and 6v8. Since s[1]=0, the lower-skilled team wins. So, 2 and 6 proceed to phase 2.\n\nIn phase 2, s[2] is '1' → higher-skilled wins. 2 and 6 play. Since 2 <6, but s[2]=1, higher-skilled (6) wins. So, 6 is the champion.\n\nWait, but the sample output says that 4,5,6,7 are possible. So perhaps my analysis is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps in phase 1, the group is 2,4,6,8. The matches are 2v4 and 6v8. So, for s[1] = 0, lower-skilled wins. So, in 2v4, 2 wins. In 6v8, 6 wins. Then, phase 2 is 2v6. Since s[2]=1, higher-skilled (6) wins. So, 6 is the champion.\n\nBut the sample output shows 4,5,6,7 as possible champions. So, perhaps there's a way to arrange the permutation such that 4,5,6,7 can be the champion.\n\nAh, perhaps the permutation p can be arranged in a way that allows different teams to reach the final.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial permutation p is such that in phase 0, higher-skilled teams win, but in phase 1, lower-skilled teams win, and in phase 2, higher-skilled teams win.\n\nSo, for x=4, can it be the champion?\n\nLet me try to see.\n\nSuppose p is arranged so that in phase 0, the higher-skilled teams are 2,4,6,8. Then, phase 1 groups them into 2 and 4 in one match, 6 and 8 in another.\n\nIn phase 1, s[1]=0 → lower-skilled wins. So, 2 and 6 proceed.\n\nIn phase 2, s[2]=1 → higher-skilled wins. So, 6 is the champion.\n\nBut that's not x=4.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to arrange the permutation differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation is arranged such that in phase 0, the winners are 2,4,6,8, but in phase 1, the group is 2,4,6,8. So, phase 1's matches are 2v4 and 6v8. Now, in phase 1, s[1] is 0 → lower-skilled wins. So, 2 and 6 proceed.\n\nThen phase 2: 2v6 → s[2]=1, higher-skilled wins → 6 is champion.\n\nSo, 6 is the champion, but how can 4 be a champion?\n\nWait, perhaps if in phase 1, the group is arranged differently.\n\nWait, maybe in phase 0, the winners are 4,5,6,7. How?\n\nNo, phase 0 has s[0]=1, so higher-skilled teams win their matches.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial permutation p",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which teams can be the champion of a playoff tournament given the results of each phase. The tournament structure and the results of each phase are determined by a string `s`, where each character indicates whether the higher-skilled or lower-skilled team wins in that phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in phases where each phase halves the number of teams until only one remains. Each phase's groupings are determined by consecutive blocks of size `2^(i+1)` for phase `i`.\n\n2. **Winning Conditions**: For each phase `i`, if `s[i]` is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins. We need to ensure that a team `x` can win all necessary matches across all phases to become the champion.\n\n3. **Permutation Constraints**: The permutation `p` must be arranged such that `x` can win each match it participates in, considering the rules of each phase. This involves checking if `x` can be positioned correctly in each phase's group to meet the winning conditions.\n\n4. **Recursive Check**: For each possible starting position of `x` in the permutation, recursively check if `x` can win all required matches. If any permutation allows `x` to win, then `x` is a winning integer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Precompute the mask for each possible group size\n    max_teams = 1 << n\n    possible_x = []\n    \n    def can_win(x, current_pos, current_group_size, phase):\n        if phase == n:\n            return True\n        group_size = 1 << phase\n        next_group_size = group_size << 1\n        # Determine the group x is in\n        group_start = (current_pos // current_group_size) * next_group_size\n        within_group_pos = current_pos - group_start\n        # Determine the match index within the group\n        match_index = within_group_pos // 2\n        # The opponent is at group_start + match_index * 2 + 1\n        opponent = group_start + (match_index * 2) + 1\n        # Now, determine if x can win against opponent in this phase\n        if s[phase] == '1':\n            # Higher skill wins\n            if x > opponent:\n                # Need to have x in an earlier position than opponent in this group\n                # So, their relative order in the permutation must be x before opponent\n                # But since we're building from higher groups down, perhaps we need to enforce this\n                # Wait, but in the permutation, how?\n                # Alternatively, perhaps the permutation must have x in an even position within the group\n                # Or perhaps we need to swap them.\n                # Since we can arrange the permutation, as long as x is higher than opponent, it's possible\n                return True\n            else:\n                # Opponent is higher, so x cannot win.
