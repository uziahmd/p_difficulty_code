Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. So, the minimal number of cards depends on how much the current sum is away from zero and the maximum possible contribution per card.\n\nLet me think: the sum of the found cards is S. We need to find K cards such that the sum of these K cards is equal to -S. But each of these K cards can be at most x in absolute value. So, what's the minimal K?\n\nSo, the key here is to find the minimal K where K * x >= |S|.\n\nBecause each card can add up to x towards the required sum. So, for example, if S is 5, and x is 3, then each card can contribute up to 3. So, we need at least 2 cards because 1*3=3 <5, 2*3=6>=5.\n\nBut wait, what if the required sum is negative? Like S is -7, x is 3. Then, the required sum is 7, so same as before, K is 3 because 3*3=9 >=7.\n\nSo, the minimal K is the ceiling of |S| / x.\n\nBut wait, is that always correct?\n\nLet me see some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nSample 1:\nInput: 3 2\nCards: -1, 1, 2\nSum S = (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2.\n\nWe need to make the total sum zero, so we need the sum of new cards to be -2.\n\nWhat's the minimal K?\n\nEach new card can be at most 2 in absolute value.\n\nSo the required sum is 2 (since S is 2, so needed is -2). So the sum of K cards must be -2. The minimal K is 1, because 1 card of -2 will do it.\n\nYes, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: Sample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4.\n\nSo required sum is 4. Each card can contribute up to 3.\n\nHow many cards needed? 4/3 is 1.333, so we need 2 cards. Because 1 card can give 3, but 3 is less than 4. So two cards: 3+1=4, but wait, no—each card can only contribute up to 3, but in any direction. Wait, no, the sum of the new cards needs to be exactly the required value, which is 4.\n\nWait, no. Because each card can be any value between -x and x. So the sum of K cards can be anything between -Kx and Kx. So, for K=2, the maximum sum is 6, which is enough to cover 4.\n\nSo, K is ceil(4/3) = 2.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to be K = ceil(|S| / x).\n\nBut wait, let's test some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: S is zero. Then no cards are needed. That's correct.\n\nCase 2: S is 0, but K is zero.\n\nAnother case: n=0? Wait, no, the problem says n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: what if S is 5, x is 5. Then K=1.\n\nIf S is 5, x is 4. Then K is 2, because 2*4=8 >=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the given cards.\n\n2. Compute the absolute value of S, say target = abs(S).\n\n3. If target is zero: return 0.\n\n4. Else, compute K = (target + x -1 ) // x. Which is equivalent to ceiling division.\n\nSo, for example, target=5, x=3: 5/3 is 1.666, so ceiling is 2. (5+3-1)=7 divided by 3 is 2.333, integer division gives 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the input.\n\n- Compute the sum of the given numbers.\n\n- Compute target = absolute value of sum.\n\n- If target is zero, output 0.\n\n- Else, compute K = ceil(target / x), which can be done as (target +x -1) //x.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nWait, but let's think about possible issues.\n\nWhat if the sum is zero? Then no need to find any cards. So output 0.\n\nWhat about when the sum is not zero, but x is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, x is at least 1, since x ≥1.\n\nWait, looking back: the input constraints say x is between 1 and 1000. So x is at least 1. So no problem with division by zero.\n\nWait, no, x can't be zero. So that's not an issue.\n\nSo, code structure:\n\nRead n and x from input.\n\nRead the list of n integers.\n\nCompute sum_s = sum of the list.\n\ntarget = abs(sum_s)\n\nif target ==0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (target + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but what about when the sum is positive or negative? It doesn't matter because target is absolute.\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, x=2, numbers are -1,1,2.\n\nsum is 2. target is 2.\n\nk=(2+2-1)/2=3//2=1.\n\nSample output is 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3, numbers -2,-2.\n\nsum is -4. target is4.\n\nk=(4+3-1)/3=6//3=2.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput: 1 10 → [5]. Sum is 5. target is5. x=10.\n\nk= (5+10-1)//10 →14//10=1. So output 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput: 2 5 → [3,3]. sum is6. target is6.\n\nk= (6+5-1)//5 →10//5=2. So output 2.\n\nBecause 2 cards of 3 each would sum to 6, but wait, wait. No, because each card can be up to 5. So 2 cards can sum to 6, which is exactly needed. So yes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nsum is 7, x=3.\n\nk= (7+3-1)/3 = 9/3=3. So 3 cards. Each can contribute up to 3, so 3*3=9 ≥7.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat if sum is 0? Output is 0.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nRead n and x from input.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute sum_s.\n\nCompute target.\n\nHandle as above.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_s = sum(cards)\ntarget = abs(sum_s)\nif target ==0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (target + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait the sample outputs were given as ['1', '2'], but in our code, the output is just 1 or 2, as integers.\n\nLooking back, the problem statement says to print the answer as a single number.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, I think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and new) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Vanya has found `n` cards, each with an integer value between -x and x.\n   - We need to find the minimum number of additional cards such that the total sum of all cards becomes zero.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Calculate the sum of the found cards, denoted as `S`.\n   - The target is to make the total sum zero, which means the sum of the additional cards needed should be `-S`.\n   - Each additional card can contribute at most `x` towards reducing the absolute value of the sum `|S|`.\n\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - Compute the absolute value of the sum of the found cards, `target = |S|`.\n   - The minimum number of additional cards required is the ceiling of `target / x`. This can be efficiently computed using integer arithmetic as `(target + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_s = sum(cards)\ntarget = abs(sum_s)\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (target + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`, followed by the list of integers on the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the found cards.\n- **Target Calculation**: The absolute value of the sum is computed to determine how much more we need to balance the sum to zero.\n- **Determine Minimum Cards**: Using the formula `(target + x - 1) // x`, the code computes the minimum number of additional cards needed to make the total sum zero. If the sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the result in constant time, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
