Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. Hmm. So, when he lights a candle, it burns for an hour and then goes out. But he can take 'b' of these burnt candles and make a new one. The question is to find out how many total hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nWait, so the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle gives one hour. Then, after burning them, he can collect the stubs (burnt out candles). For every 'b' stubs, he gets one more candle which can be burned again.\n\nSo, the process is: burn all a candles, then use the resulting stubs to create new ones, and repeat until he doesn't have enough stubs to make any more.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nLet's take the example given:\n\nSample input: 4 2.\n\nFirst, he burns 4 candles. That's 4 hours. Then, he has 4 stubs. He can exchange 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So, he burns those, adding 2 more hours. Now, he has 2 stubs from those. Since 2 >= b (which is 2), he can make one more candle. Burn that, another hour. Now, he has 1 stub left, which is less than 2, so he can't make anymore.\n\nTotal hours: 4 + 2 + 1 =7.\n\nAnother sample: 6 3.\n\nHe starts with 6. Burns them, 6 hours. 6 stubs. 6 /3=2 new. Burn them, +2. Now he has 2 stubs, which is less than 3, so no more.\n\nTotal: 6+2=8.\n\nSo the approach is to calculate how many times we can get more candles by exchanging stubs.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Start with a hours.\n2. Collect a stubs.\n3. Exchange stubs into new candles as much as possible: each exchange gives (number_of_stubs // b) new candles. Add this to the total hours.\n4. The new stubs will be (number_of_stubs % b) plus the new candles just burned, because each new candle will produce one stub when burned.\n\nWait, no. Because when you exchange stubs for new candles, you add their stubs after burning.\n\nSo for each step:\n\n- You have some stubs (let's say s).\n- You can make c = s // b new candles. These give c * 1 hours, so add c to total.\n- The new stubs from these candles are c, because each candle when burned gives one stub.\n- Also, any remaining stubs after making c are s % b, which become part of the next stubs.\n- So the next s becomes (s % b) + c.\n\nWe need to loop this until s < b, meaning no more candles can be made.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\ntotal = a\ns = a\n\nwhile s >= b:\n    c = s // b\n    total += c\n    s = (s % b) + c\n\nreturn total\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the code needs to read a and b, compute this, and output the result.\n\nNow, considering the constraints: a can be up to 1000, same with b. So the loop won't run more than log_b(a) times, which is manageable.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: a is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, a is at least 1, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nCase 2: b is larger than a. Then, the initial s is a, which is less than b, so no more candles. So total is a.\n\nCase 3: When after adding the new c, s becomes exactly b. Like a=5, b=5. Then:\n\nInitial s=5. c=1. total becomes 5+1=6. s is (5%5)=0 +1=1. Now 1<5, so stop. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nStart: s=10, total=10.\n\nc=3, total becomes 13. s=10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nNow, s=4 >=3. c=1. total=14. s=4%3=1 +1=2. Now s=2 <3. Stop. So total is 14.\n\nLet me compute manually: 10 hours, then 3 more (from 10 stubs: 3 used, 1 left). Those 3 give 3 more hours. Then, from 1+3=4 stubs: 3 used, 1 left. Then 1+1=2 stubs. So yes, 10+3+1=14.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nInitialize total = a.\n\ns = a.\n\nloop while s >=b:\n\n    c = s // b\n\n    total +=c\n\n    s = s % b + c\n\nOnce loop ends, print total.\n\nNow, in Python, the input is given as two integers in a single line.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into two integers.\n\nThen perform the steps as above.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 4 2.\n\nLoop:\n\ns=4 >=2.\n\nc=2, total=4+2=6.\n\ns=0+2=2.\n\nLoop again: 2>=2.\n\nc=1, total=7.\n\ns=0 +1=1 <2. Exit.\n\nPrint 7.\n\nSample 2:6 3.\n\ns=6 >=3.\n\nc=2, total=6+2=8.\n\ns=0 +2=2 <3. So done. Print 8.\n\nWhich matches the examples.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5.\n\ns=5 >=5.\n\nc=1, total=5+1=6.\n\ns=0 +1=1 <5. So done.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=3.\n\nInitial s=7.\n\nc=2, total=9.\n\ns=7%3=1 +2=3.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nc=1, total=10.\n\ns=0 +1=1 <3.\n\nTotal is 10.\n\nYes: 7 + 2 (from 7) +1 (from 3) =10.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has and the stubs from burned-out candles. The key insight is that Vasily can convert a certain number of burnt stubs into new candles, which can then be used to further illuminate his room.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Collect Stubs**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. Each candle burns for exactly one hour before it goes out, leaving one stub.\n3. **Recycle Stubs**: Convert the collected stubs into new candles by using `b` stubs to make one new candle. Each time new candles are made, they add to the total hours of illumination.\n4. **Repeat Process**: Continue converting stubs into new candles until there are not enough stubs left to make another new candle. Track the total number of hours in each iteration.\n\nThe algorithm efficiently computes the total illumination time by iterating through the process of converting stubs into new candles until no more conversions are possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    stubs = stubs % b + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of stubs needed to make a new candle).\n2. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` gives `a` hours of illumination.\n3. **Stub Collection**: After burning all initial candles, we have `a` stubs.\n4. **Conversion Loop**: While there are enough stubs to make at least one new candle (`stubs >= b`):\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made (`new_candles = stubs // b`).\n   - Add the time these new candles will provide to the total.\n   - Update the number of stubs to include both the remainder of the previous conversion and the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently use every possible stub to maximize the illumination time, adhering to the constraints and providing an optimal solution.",
