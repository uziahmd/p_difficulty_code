Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Valera's paper is checked to see if it forms an \"X\". Hmm. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the paper is a square of size n x n, and n is odd. The letters form an 'X' if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal ones.\n\nWait, so the two main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left) must be all the same character. And all the non-diagonal cells must be another single character, which is different from the diagonal one.\n\nSo my plan is to:\n\n- Read the grid of characters.\n- Check the two diagonals: are they all the same?\n- Then check all the other cells to see if they are all the same as each other and different from the diagonal.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for a given grid, get the length n. Then for each cell (i, j), determine if it's on either diagonal.\n\nFor example, in a 3x3 grid:\nIndices (0-based):\n(0,0) is on both diagonals.\n(0,1) is not on any diagonal.\n(1,0) is on the first diagonal.\n(1,1) is center, on both.\n(1,2) on first diagonal.\n(2,0) on second diagonal.\n(2,1) not on any.\n(2,2) on both.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the main diagonals are i == j and i + j == n-1. So for each cell, check if it's on either of these lines.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read the input grid. Each row is a string, so I can process each line as a list or keep them as strings.\n\n2. For each cell (i, j), check if it's on either diagonal. Collect the characters on both diagonals.\n\n3. Check if all characters on both diagonals are the same. If not, then it's already not an 'X', so output NO.\n\n4. If the diagonals are same, then check all the other cells. They must all be the same and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\nRead n.\nRead n lines into a grid (each line is a string).\nCheck the two diagonals.\n\nHow to collect the diagonal characters:\n\ndiagonal1 = []\ndiagonal2 = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j:\n            diagonal1.append(grid[i][j])\n        if i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal2.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if all elements in diagonal1 are the same and all in diagonal2 are the same, and that diagonal1 and diagonal2 have the same character.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letter. So, the first thing is to check if all the diagonal1 and diagonal2 are the same as each other.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that both diagonals are same. So, for example, all the cells on diagonal1 are 'x', and all on diagonal2 are also 'x'. Then, the other cells must be same, but different from 'x'.\n\nSo, first step:\n\nCheck that all cells in diagonal1 are same, and all in diagonal2 are same, and that those two sets are equal.\n\nIf that's not the case, output NO.\n\nOnce that's satisfied, then check the rest of the cells.\n\nFor the rest of the cells (non-diagonal), they must all be the same and different from the diagonal character.\n\nSo, the rest_cells will consist of all cells that are not on either diagonal.\n\nSo, collect all such cells:\n\nrest = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n            rest.append(grid[i][j])\n\nNow, check that all elements in rest are the same, and that this character is different from the diagonal character.\n\nSo, for the first condition:\n\nif len(set(diagonal1)) != 1 or len(set(diagonal2)) != 1:\n    print(NO)\nelse:\n    diag_char = diagonal1[0]\n    if diag_char != diagonal2[0]:\n        print(NO)\n    else:\n        # Now check the rest\n        if len(set(rest)) != 1:\n            print(NO)\n        elif rest[0] == diag_char:\n            print(NO)\n        else:\n            print(YES)\n\nWait, but wait: what if the rest has some varying characters? For example, some are 'a', others 'b'? Then, set would have more than one element, so condition fails.\n\nYes.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nWhat if n=1? But n is >=3, according to the problem statement. So no.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3. Like the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 5 xooox etc., output is NO because perhaps the diagonals aren't same.\n\nSample Input 2: 3, with all diagonals same, and others same.\n\nWait, the sample inputs:\n\nIn the first sample, the input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\nLooking at the first row, first column is 'x', last is 'x'.\n\nSecond row, second and fourth columns.\n\nThird row, third column.\n\nFourth row, third column.\n\nFifth row, first and fifth.\n\nWait, maybe the diagonals have different characters.\n\nIn the second sample input, it's 3:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo, the diagonals are 'w' and 'w' for both.\n\nThe other cells are 's's, which is different.\n\nSo output is YES.\n\nThird sample input is 3:\n\nx p x\n\np x p\n\nx p e\n\nWait, diagonals: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e. So the diagonal1 is x, x, e. So not same. So condition fails.\n\nSo output NO.\n\nSo, the code should handle these cases.\n\nPotential Issues:\n\n- How to read the input correctly? Because the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a row.\n\nBut in Python, when using input(), each line is read including the newlines. So for each line, we need to strip the newline character.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of strings, each being a row. So for example, the first element is '5\\nxooox\\n...' etc.\n\nWait, no, the input is actually given as multiple lines, each representing a row. So, when reading from stdin, each line is a row. So, in the code, after reading n, read n lines, each line is stripped of leading/trailing whitespace (like the newline), and stored as a list.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThat's correct.\n\nAnother thing: for the diagonals, the code correctly captures both diagonals.\n\nTesting the code on the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nDiagonals:\n\ngrid[0][0] = 'w'\n\ngrid[1][1] = 'w'\n\ngrid[2][2] = 'w'\n\nSo diagonal1 is ['w','w','w'], diagonal2 is ['w', 's', 'w']? Wait no.\n\nWait, for i=0, j=0: on both diagonals.\n\ni=0, j=2: 0+2=2 = n-1 (since n=3, 2=3-1). So it's on diagonal2.\n\ni=1, j=1: yes.\n\ni=1, j=1: yes.\n\ni=2, j=0: 2+0=2 = n-1. So on diagonal2.\n\nSo diagonal1 is [0][0], [1][1], [2][2] → 'w', 'w', 'w'.\n\nDiagonal2 is [0][2], [1][1], [2][0] → 'w', 'w', 'w'?\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, for i=0, j=2: grid[0][2] is 'w'?\n\nWait, the second line of input is 'wsw', which is index 0: 'w' 's' 'w' ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first line after n is 'wsw' which is three characters.\n\nSo grid[0] is 'wsw', which is indexes 0: 'w', 1:'s', 2:'w'.\n\nSimilarly, grid[1] is 'sws': indexes 0:'s', 1:'w', 2:'s'.\n\ngrid[2] is 'wsw': indexes 0:'w', 1:'s', 2:'w'.\n\nSo diagonal1:\n\ni=0, j=0 → 'w'\n\ni=1, j=1 → 'w'\n\ni=2, j=2 → 'w'\n\nSo diagonal1 is ['w','w','w'].\n\nDiagonal2:\n\ni=0, j=2 → 'w'\n\ni=1, j=1 → 'w'\n\ni=2, j=0 → 'w'\n\nSo diagonal2 is also ['w','w','w'].\n\nSo both diagonals are same.\n\nRest cells:\n\ni=0,j=1 → 's'\n\ni=1,j=0 → 's'\n\ni=1,j=2 → 's'\n\ni=2,j=1 → 's'\n\nSo all rest are 's's. So output is YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all 'x's.\n\nDiagonals are 'x's. Rest cells are 'x's. So it's invalid because rest must be different.\n\nSo output is NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nRow 0: x x x\n\nRow 1: a a a\n\nRow 2: x x x\n\nDiagonals are x's.\n\nRest cells are a's. So output is YES.\n\nWait no, because the rest cells are all a's, which is different from x.\n\nYes, output YES.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 1? Well, n is at least 3, per the problem statement.\n\nAnother point: the rest cells can't be empty. But since n is at least 3, and the diagonals have 2n-1 cells (since for n=3, diagonals have 3 each, but overlapping at center?), wait no: for n=3, each diagonal has 3 cells. But the center is shared between both diagonals. So total unique cells on diagonals is 5. So the rest is 4 cells.\n\nBut for n=5, the diagonals are 5 each, overlapping in the center cell, so 9 cells on diagonals. The rest is 25-9=16.\n\nSo in the code, the rest will have len >= (n^2 - (2n-1)) = n^2 -2n+1 = (n-1)^2.\n\nWhich is okay.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nWait, but for the diagonals, I'm checking if all elements are same in both. So for example, diagonal1 could be all 'a's, diagonal2 could be all 'b's. Then, it's invalid.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif len(set(diagonal1)) != 1 or len(set(diagonal2)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if diagonal1[0] != diagonal2[0]:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        # proceed to check rest.\n\nWait, but what if diagonal1 and diagonal2 have different lengths? No, because n is odd, so each diagonal has n elements.\n\nWait, no. Because for each i, j, each cell is considered once in diagonal1 and once in diagonal2. Wait no: for each cell, it's added to diagonal1 if i==j, and to diagonal2 if i + j = n-1. So for the center cell (i=j), it's added to both. So the length of diagonal1 is n, same for diagonal2. So their lengths are same.\n\nSo in code, after collecting the diagonals, if the sets of diagonal1 and diagonal2 are not same, then output NO.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCollect diagonal1 and diagonal2.\n\nCheck if all in diagonal1 are same, and same for diagonal2.\n\nCheck if diagonal1[0] == diagonal2[0].\n\nIf not, output NO.\n\nElse, collect rest cells.\n\nCheck if all rest are same and different from diagonal_char.\n\nIf yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nWait, but for the rest, the code needs to check that all elements are same.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndiag_char = diagonal1[0]\n\nif any(cell != diag_char for cell in rest):\n\nNo, because if any cell is different, then it's invalid.\n\nWait, but in code, we can check len(set(rest)) == 1 and rest[0] != diag_char.\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal1 = []\ndiagonal2 = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j:\n            diagonal1.append(grid[i][j])\n        if i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal2.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check if both diagonals are the same character\nif len(set(diagonal1)) != 1 or len(set(diagonal2)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif diagonal1[0] != diagonal2[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    diag_char = diagonal1[0]\n    rest = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n                rest.append(grid[i][j])\n    if len(set(rest)) != 1 or rest[0] == diag_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but what if the rest has length zero? That's impossible because n is at least 3. So for n=3, the rest has 4 cells, which is fine.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ndiagonal1 is ['w','w','w'], diagonal2 is ['w','w','w']. So diag_char is 'w'.\n\nrest is [ 's', 's', 's', 's' ].\n\nlen(set(rest)) is 1, and rest[0] is 's' != 'w'. So output YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\nn=3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiagonal1 is grid[0][0]=x, grid[1][1]=p, grid[2][2]=e. So diagonal1 is x,p,e. So len(set) is 3>1, so output NO.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5.\n\nLooking at the first sample, the diagonals may have different characters.\n\nSo the code will correctly output NO.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, all diagonals are 'x's, and the rest are 'y's.\n\nShould output YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'x's, rest are 'x's. Then rest[0] == diag_char, so output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'x's, rest are 'y's. Output YES.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think the code is correct.\n",
