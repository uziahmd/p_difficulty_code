Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm. So, the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d where every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The street is a line from 0 to l. Each lantern i is at position ai. The area it covers is [ai - d, ai + d], but we have to make sure that this doesn't go beyond 0 or l. Wait, no—actually, since the street is from 0 to l, any part of the coverage beyond those points is irrelevant. So for each lantern, its effective coverage is the maximum between 0 and (ai -d) as the start, and the minimum between l and (ai +d) as the end. But wait, actually, if a lantern is at ai, then its coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). But the entire street needs to be covered by the union of all these intervals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the street is from 0 to l. So each lantern's coverage is [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)]. For the entire street to be covered, the union of all these intervals must cover [0, l].\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal d such that the union of all [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)] intervals for each lantern covers [0, l].\n\nHow do I compute this minimal d?\n\nI think the approach is to find the maximum distance between consecutive points in a sorted list of lantern positions, but also considering the edges 0 and l.\n\nWait, here's an idea: sort all the lantern positions, including 0 and l. Then, for each pair of consecutive points, calculate the required distance between them, and the minimal d needed to cover that gap. The largest such required d will be our answer.\n\nFor example, suppose after sorting, the points are 0, x1, x2, ..., xn, l. Then, for each adjacent pair (xi, xi+1), the required d is (xi+1 - xi)/2, because the middle point would be the farthest from both ends. Alternatively, maybe it's (xi+1 - xi) / 2, rounded up or something. Or perhaps the maximum of (xi+1 - xi) / 2 across all consecutive pairs.\n\nWait, let's think with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=2, l=5\n\nPositions are 2 and 5.\n\nSo the sorted list is 0, 2, 5.\n\nWait, no, the lanterns are at 2 and 5, and the street is from 0 to 5.\n\nWait, but when considering the coverage, the first lantern at 2 with d=2 covers from 0 to 4, and the second at 5 covers from 3 to 5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nBut what's the minimal d? It was 2.\n\nWait, the distance between 2 and 5 is 3. So the required d is 2. Because the midpoint is 3.5, which is 1.5 away from 2 and 2.5 away from 5. Wait, no, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum of (xi+1 - xi)/2 for all consecutive points, including 0 and the first lantern, and last lantern and l.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nIn the sample, the sorted points are 0, 2, 5.\n\nConsecutive pairs: 0-2 (distance 2), 2-5 (distance 3).\n\nCompute (2/2)=1, and 3/2=1.5. The maximum is 1.5, but the required d is 2. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another way to think: each interval [a_i -d, a_i +d] must cover the entire [0, l]. So for each position x on [0, l], there exists at least one a_i such that |x - a_i| <=d.\n\nWe need to find the minimal d where this holds for all x.\n\nThis can be thought of as the maximum over all x of the minimal distance from x to any a_i. Because for each x, the minimal required d is the distance to the nearest a_i. Then, the overall d must be at least the maximum of these values.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of (the minimal distance from x to any a_i) for all x in [0, l].\n\nThat makes sense. So the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances from any point on the street to the nearest lantern.\n\nNow, how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nWell, the function f(x) = min_{i} |x - a_i|. The maximum of f(x) over [0, l] is the required d.\n\nSo, to find the maximum of f(x), we can consider the critical points where the minimal distance changes. These points are the a_i's and the midpoints between consecutive a_i's.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum occurs either at a point where two lanterns are equally distant, or at the ends 0 or l.\n\nWait, for example, if we have two lanterns at 0 and l, then the minimal distance at the midpoint (l/2) is l/2, so d must be l/2.\n\nAnother example: if lanterns are at 2 and 5 in a 5-length street. The minimal distance at x=3 is 1 (distance to 2 is 1, to 5 is 2). At x=4, it's 1 (distance to 2 is 2, to 5 is 1). Wait, no, for x=3, the minimal is 1 (to 2), for x=4, it's 1 (to 5). So the maximum of f(x) is 1.5? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, when x is 3, the distance to 2 is 1, to 5 is 2. So minimal is 1.\n\nWhen x is 3.5, the distance to 2 is 1.5, to 5 is 1.5. So minimal is 1.5.\n\nAh, right! So the maximum occurs at the midpoint between 2 and 5, which is 3.5. So the minimal d must be at least 1.5.\n\nBut in the sample, the output was 2.0. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, the sample input is 7 15 and lantern positions 15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nWait, the second sample is 2 5 and lantern positions 2 and 5. The output is 2.0.\n\nWait, but according to my previous reasoning, the maximum of f(x) is 1.5. So why is the output 2.0?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the note, the second sample says that at d=2, the first lantern (at 2) covers 0 to 4, and the second (at 5) covers 3 to 5. So together, they cover 0-5.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier reasoning, with d=1.5, the coverage would be:\n\nFirst lantern at 2: covers 0.5 to 3.5.\n\nSecond lantern at 5: covers 3.5 to 6.5, but since the street is only up to 5, it covers 3.5 to 5.\n\nWait, no—wait, 5 -1.5 is 3.5. So coverage is 3.5 to 5.\n\nSo the coverage from the two lanterns is 0.5 to 3.5 and 3.5 to 5. So they meet at 3.5, leaving a gap between 3.5 and 5? No, wait, 3.5 to 5 is covered by the second lantern. Wait, 5-1.5 is 3.5, so the second lantern covers 3.5 to 5.\n\nSo the first lantern covers up to 3.5, the second starts at 3.5. So together, they cover 0.5 to 5.\n\nWait, but that's the entire street from 0 to 5? No, because 0 to 0.5 is not covered.\n\nAh, right! Oh, I see. So the first lantern at 2 with d=1.5 covers from 0.5 to 3.5. The second at 5 covers 3.5 to 5.\n\nSo the street from 0.5 to 5 is covered, but 0 to 0.5 is not. So the entire street isn't covered until d=2.\n\nSo, the maximum of f(x) is 2.0, not 1.5.\n\nWait, so how does this fit into my earlier reasoning?\n\nBecause in this case, the maximum of f(x) occurs at x=0 and x=5, where f(x) is 2.\n\nWait, because at x=0, the nearest lantern is at 2. Distance is 2. Similarly, at x=5, the nearest is 5, distance zero. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, the lantern is at 5, so f(5) is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum occurs at x=0, which is 2 units away from the lantern at 2. Similarly, at x=0.5, the distance is 1.5, but at x=0, it's 2.\n\nSo in this case, the maximum of f(x) is 2. So d must be at least 2.\n\nOh, right! So the initial approach was incorrect. The maximum occurs at the endpoints, not in the middle of two lanterns.\n\nHmm, that's a crucial point. So I need to reconsider the approach.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- The distance from 0 to the nearest lantern.\n\n- The distance from l to the nearest lantern.\n\n- And for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum of (distance between them)/2.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nSo, let's formalize this.\n\nAfter sorting the lantern positions, we need to consider the following intervals:\n\n1. From 0 to the first lantern.\n\n2. Between consecutive lanterns.\n\n3. From the last lantern to l.\n\nFor each of these intervals, the maximum required d is the maximum of (distance between the endpoints of the interval) / 2.\n\nAdditionally, we need to compare with the distance from 0 to the first lantern and from the last lantern to l.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nSort all lantern positions, including 0 and l as virtual lanterns.\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive points in this sorted list, compute the required d as the midpoint of their distance.\n\nThe maximum of these d's across all consecutive pairs is the minimal required d.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nLanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted list is 0,2,5,l=5.\n\nWait, no, wait, l is 5, so the sorted list is 0,2,5.\n\nWait, wait, no—since the street is 0 to 5, the sorted list is [0,2,5].\n\nNow, the consecutive pairs are (0,2) and (2,5).\n\nFor (0,2): distance is 2. Midpoint is 1. So d >=1.\n\nFor (2,5): distance is 3. Midpoint is 1.5. So d >=1.5.\n\nBut the correct d is 2.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the approach is incomplete.\n\nWait, perhaps I should also include the distance from 0 to the first lantern and from the last lantern to l.\n\nSo, for the sample, 0 to 2 is 2, which would require d >=1 (because the midpoint is 1, but 0 is 2 units away from 2 when d=1, but 0 is covered by the lantern at 2 when d >=2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when d=1, the lantern at 2 covers 1 to 3. So 0 is not covered. So for x=0, the minimal d must be at least 2.\n\nSimilarly, for x=5, it's covered by the lantern at 5 with any d>=0.\n\nSo, the maximum of f(x) is 2, because at x=0, the minimal distance is 2.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute:\n\n- For each pair of consecutive points in the sorted list (including 0 and l), the required d is (distance between them) / 2.\n\n- Also, the distance from 0 to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to l.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance from 0 to the first lantern is (first_lantern_pos - 0). The minimal d must be at least (first_lantern_pos - 0)/2, because otherwise, the coverage of the first lantern won't reach 0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the first lantern at a, the coverage starts at a -d. To cover 0, a -d <=0 => d >=a.\n\nWait, wait no. If a lantern is at a, then to cover 0, a -d <=0 => d >=a. Because a -d <=0 → d >=a.\n\nSimilarly, to cover l, a +d >=l → d >= l -a.\n\nSo, for the first lantern, the required d must be at least a (so that 0 is covered) and at least (l - last_lantern) (so that l is covered).\n\nWait, but that's just the same as considering the distance from 0 to the first lantern and from l to the last lantern.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Sort all lantern positions, add 0 and l to the list.\n\nWait, no, because 0 and l may already be present.\n\nWait, perhaps create a list that includes all lantern positions, and then add 0 and l if they're not already there.\n\nWait, but 0 and l are the endpoints of the street, so the lanterns may not be there. So adding them ensures that we can compute the coverage for the ends.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Create a list that contains all a_i, plus 0 and l.\n\n- Sort this list.\n\n- For each consecutive pair in this sorted list, compute the distance between them, divide by 2. Take the maximum of all these values.\n\n- That maximum is the required d.\n\nLet's test this with the sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nOriginal a_i are 2 and 5. Adding 0 and 5 (but 5 is already there). So the sorted list is 0,2,5.\n\nConsecutive pairs:\n\n0-2: distance 2 → 2/2=1.\n\n2-5: distance 3 → 1.5.\n\nSo the maximum is 1.5.\n\nBut the correct d is 2. So this approach is not capturing the fact that the lantern at 2 needs to cover 0.\n\nWait, that's the issue. Because the coverage for 0 is handled by the first lantern, which is at 2. So to cover 0, d must be at least 2, because 2 -d <=0 → d >=2.\n\nSo in the current approach, the maximum of the consecutive pairs is 1.5, but the required d is 2.\n\nSo the approach is incomplete.\n\nWhat's the mistake here?\n\nAh, I think I need to include the distance from 0 to the first lantern and from l to the last lantern as possible candidates.\n\nSo, the steps should be:\n\n1. Sort all a_i, and add 0 and l.\n\nWait, but 0 and l may already be present.\n\nSo, create a list called points, which includes all a_i, then add 0 and l if they are not already present.\n\nSort this list.\n\n2. For each pair of consecutive points in the sorted list, compute the distance between them, and then take half of that as a candidate for d.\n\n3. Additionally, compute the distance from 0 to the first point, and from the last point to l, and take half of those as candidates.\n\nWait, no. Because, for 0 to the first point, the required d is (first_point - 0). Because to cover 0, the first lantern must have d >= first_point - 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the last point to l, the required d is (l - last_point).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first lantern is at a. To cover 0, a -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern is at b. To cover l, b +d ≥ l → d ≥ l -b.\n\nSo for the endpoints, the required d is the distance from the endpoint to the nearest lantern.\n\nBut in the case where the first lantern is at 2, the distance from 0 to 2 is 2. So d must be at least 2.\n\nSimilarly, for the last lantern at 5, the distance to l is 0, so nothing needed.\n\nSo, in addition to the consecutive pairs, we also need to consider the distance from 0 to the first lantern and from l to the last lantern.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Create a list of all a_i, add 0 and l.\n\n- Sort this list.\n\n- Compute for each consecutive pair (x, y) in the sorted list: (y -x)/2.\n\n- Compute the distance from 0 to the first element: (first - 0).\n\n- Compute the distance from last element to l: (l - last).\n\n- The required d is the maximum of all these computed values.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nLet me test this on the sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nAfter adding 0 and 5, the list is [0,2,5].\n\nConsecutive pairs:\n\n0-2: (2-0)/2 = 1.\n\n2-5: (5-2)/2 = 1.5.\n\nThen, the distance from 0 to first (0) is 0.\n\nDistance from last (5) to l (5) is 0.\n\nSo the maximum is 1.5. But the required d is 2.\n\nWait, that's still conflicting.\n\nWait, what's wrong here.\n\nBecause, for the first lantern at 2, to cover 0, d must be at least 2. So in this case, the required d is 2, which is larger than the maximum of 1.5.\n\nSo, the approach is not capturing that.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the approach is not sufficient.\n\nAlternative idea: the required d must be the maximum between:\n\n- The maximum of (y - x)/2 for all consecutive x, y in the sorted list.\n\n- The distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n\n- The distance from the last lantern to l.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample, the distance from 0 to first is 2, which is larger than 1.5.\n\nSo, the maximum is 2, which is the correct answer.\n\nSo, the approach is to compute the maximum of:\n\nmax_consec = maximum of (y -x)/2 for all consecutive x,y in the sorted list.\n\nmax_end = maximum of (first - 0, l - last).\n\nThen, d = max(max_consec, max_end).\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSample 2:\n\nmax_consec is 1.5.\n\nmax_end is 2 (from 0 to first lantern at 2).\n\nSo d is 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when lanterns are at 0 and l.\n\nSay, n=2, l=10. a_i = 0 and 10.\n\nsorted list is 0,0,10,10.\n\nConsecutive pairs: 0-0 (0), 0-10 (5), 10-10 (0).\n\nmax_consec is 5/2 = 2.5.\n\nmax_end: (0-0) and (10-10) → 0.\n\nSo d is 2.5.\n\nWhich makes sense because the midpoint is at 5, which requires d=5/2=2.5.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a_i=3.\n\nsorted list: 0,3,5.\n\nConsecutive pairs: 0-3 (3 → 1.5), 3-5 (2 →1).\n\nmax_consec is 1.5.\n\nmax_end: 3-0=3, 5-3=2.\n\nSo d is max(1.5,3,2) → 3.\n\nWhich is correct because the lantern at 3 must cover 0 (needs d=3) and 5 (needs d=2). The maximum is 3.\n\nSo, this approach seems to capture all cases.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, l.\n\n2. Read the list of a_i.\n\n3. Create a list 'points' that includes all a_i, then add 0 and l.\n\n4. Sort 'points'.\n\n5. Compute max_consec as the maximum of (y -x)/2 for consecutive x,y in the sorted list.\n\n6. Compute max_end as the maximum of (points[0] - 0) and (l - points[-1]).\n\n7. d = max(max_consec, max_end).\n\n8. Output d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, now, implementing this.\n\nBut wait, let's see another example.\n\nSuppose n=3, l=10.\n\na_i = [1,5,9].\n\nsorted points: 0,1,5,9,10.\n\nConsecutive pairs:\n\n0-1: 1 →0.5.\n\n1-5:4 →2.\n\n5-9:4→2.\n\n9-10:1→0.5.\n\nmax_consec is 2.\n\nmax_end: 1-0=1, 10-9=1. So max_end is 1.\n\nSo d is 2.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWith d=2, the coverage would be:\n\nLantern 1: 1-2= -1 (treated as 0) to 1+2=3.\n\nLantern5: 3 to7.\n\nLantern9: 7 to11 (treated as 10).\n\nSo coverage from 0 to3, 3 to7,7 to10. So the entire street is covered.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, a_i = [0,0,0], l=5.\n\npoints after adding 0 and 5: 0,0,0,5.\n\nConsecutive pairs:\n\n0-0:0 →0.\n\n0-0:0.\n\n0-5:5 →2.5.\n\nmax_consec is 2.5.\n\nmax_end: 0-0=0, 5-0=5.\n\nSo d is max(2.5,5) →5.\n\nBut wait, with d=2.5, the lanterns at 0 cover 0-2.5 and 2.5-0 (but that's not possible, since 0+2.5 is 2.5). So the coverage is 0-2.5.\n\nBut 2.5 is less than 5, so the entire street is not covered. Hence, the required d is indeed 5.\n\nWhich is captured by the max_end.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nThus, the plan is solid.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nCreate a list called points, which is a_i + [0, l], but ensuring that 0 and l are included regardless of whether they are already present.\n\nSort points.\n\nCompute max_consec as the maximum of (y -x)/2 for each consecutive x, y in the sorted points.\n\nCompute max_end as the maximum of (points[0] - 0) and (l - points[-1]).\n\nd is the maximum of max_consec and max_end.\n\nPrint d with 10 decimal places.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for handling floating points, perhaps it's better to use floats.\n\nImplementing steps:\n\nRead the input.\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\npoints = a.copy()\n\npoints.append(0)\n\npoints.append(l)\n\npoints = sorted(points)\n\nmax_consec = 0.0\n\nfor i in range(len(points)-1):\n\n    x = points[i]\n\n    y = points[i+1]\n\n    diff = y - x\n\n    half = diff / 2.0\n\n    if half > max_consec:\n\n        max_consec = half\n\nmax_end = max(points[0] - 0, l - points[-1])\n\nd = max(max_consec, max_end)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but in the sample input 2:\n\npoints after adding 0 and 5: [0,2,5]\n\nmax_consec is max(1, 1.5) →1.5.\n\nmax_end is max(2, 0) →2.\n\nd is 2.0 → correct.\n\nAnother sample, the first one:\n\nInput is ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, wait, the first line is n=7, l=15.\n\nThe second line is 15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nSo a = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]\n\npoints becomes [15,5,3,7,9,14,0, 0,15]\n\nWait, no. Wait, after adding 0 and 15, points is a + [0, 15], then sorted.\n\nWait, a is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0], adding 0 and 15 gives [15,5,3,7,9,14,0,0,15]. Sorting this gives 0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nSo consecutive pairs:\n\n0-0: 0.\n\n0-3:3 →1.5.\n\n3-5:2 →1.\n\n5-7:2 →1.\n\n7-9:2 →1.\n\n9-14:5 →2.5.\n\n14-15:1 →0.5.\n\nSo max_consec is 2.5.\n\nmax_end: points[0]=0 → 0-0=0.\n\npoints[-1] is 15 →15-15=0.\n\nSo max_end is 0.\n\nThus, d is 2.5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should output 2.5 and 2.0 for the two samples.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- All lanterns are at 0: then d must be l/2, but wait, no. Because the lanterns at 0 can cover from 0 to d. So to cover l, d must be l. So in that case, the max_consec would be (0-0)/2=0, max_end is l -0 = l. So d=l.\n\nAnother case: n=1, a_i= l/2.\n\nThen, the coverage is from (l/2 -d) to (l/2 +d). To cover 0, d must be >= l/2. To cover l, d must be >= l/2. So the maximum of (l/2, (l/2 - (l/2))/2=0, (l/2 - l/2)/2=0). So d=l/2.\n\nWait, but in this case, the coverage is from 0 to l, as long as d >= l/2. So yes.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a_i=0. l=10. Then, the coverage is from 0 to d. To cover l=10, d must be >=10. So d=10.\n\nYes, because max_end is 10-0=10.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a_i= l.\n\nThen, to cover 0, d must be l.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street can light the entire street. The street is represented as a straight line from 0 to \\( l \\), and each lantern lights all points within a distance \\( d \\) from it.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each lantern at position \\( a_i \\) lights an interval \\([a_i - d, a_i + d]\\). The goal is to find the smallest \\( d \\) such that the union of all these intervals covers the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimal \\( d \\) must be sufficient to cover the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, including the ends of the street. This involves:\n   - Considering the coverage between consecutive lanterns.\n   - Ensuring the start (0) and end (\\( l \\)) of the street are covered.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - Read input values and parse the positions of the lanterns.\n   - Include the endpoints 0 and \\( l \\) in the list of lantern positions.\n   - Sort the list of positions.\n   - Calculate the maximum required \\( d \\) by considering:\n     - The midpoint of each gap between consecutive sorted positions.\n     - The distance from the start (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end (\\( l \\)).\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the maximum gap between consecutive positions after sorting.\n   - Compute the distances from the start to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end.\n   - The result is the maximum of these computed values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\npoints = a.copy()\npoints.append(0)\npoints.append(l)\npoints = sorted(points)\n\nmax_consec = 0.0\nfor i in range(len(points) - 1):\n    x = points[i]\n    y = points[i + 1]\n    diff = y - x\n    half = diff / 2.0\n    if half > max_consec:\n        max_consec = half\n\nmax_end = max(points[0] - 0, l - points[-1])\nd = max(max_consec, max_end)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns \\( n \\) and the length of the street \\( l \\), followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n- **Including Endpoints**: We add 0 and \\( l \\) to the list of lantern positions to ensure the entire street is considered.\n- **Sorting**: Sorting helps in efficiently calculating gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Calculating Gaps**: For each consecutive pair of positions, compute the midpoint of the gap. The maximum of these midpoints gives the largest midpoint gap.\n- **End Points Check**: Ensure the start (0) and end (\\( l \\)) of the street are covered by checking the distance from these points to the nearest lantern.\n- **Result**: The maximum value from the above checks determines the minimum \\( d \\) needed to light the entire street.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine the minimum light radius required.",
