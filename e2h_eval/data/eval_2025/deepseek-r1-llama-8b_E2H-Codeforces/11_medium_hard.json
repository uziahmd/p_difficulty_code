A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1.

The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends wanting to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some amount of drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make, given the constraints on the available resources.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. All positive integers, not exceeding 1000.\n\nWait, what do these variables represent?\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles of drink. Each bottle has l milliliters.\nSo total drink is k * l ml.\n\nc: number of limes. Each lime is cut into d slices. So total slices are c * d.\n\np: grams of salt available.\n\nEach toast requires:\n- nl milliliters per friend. So for one toast, all n friends need n * nl ml in total.\nWait, no. Wait, each friend needs nl ml for a toast. So per toast round, total drink used is n * nl ml.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, you need n slices.\n\nAnd each toast also requires np grams of salt per friend. So per toast, total salt used is n * np grams.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of toasts T such that:\n\n1. The total drink is enough: T * (n * nl) ≤ (k * l)\n2. The total lime slices are enough: T * n ≤ (c * d)\n3. The total salt is enough: T * (n * np) ≤ p\n\nThen, T is the minimum of those three values divided by 1 (since T is the same for each constraint). Because for each resource, the maximum possible T based on that resource is (available / required per toast), and we take the smallest among those.\n\nWait, let me think again. For each resource:\n\n- Drink: total_drink = k * l\nEach toast uses n * nl. So max_T_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\nBut wait, if it's not divisible, then T could be floor(total_drink / (n*nl)). But since we're looking for integer toasts, yes.\n\nSimilarly, lime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast uses n slices. So max_T_lime = (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: total_salt = p. Each toast uses n * np. So max_T_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the actual maximum T is the minimum of these three: min(max_T_drink, max_T_lime, max_T_salt).\n\nWait no, because for each resource, the maximum T allowed is that value. So the overall T is the minimum of all three.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → drink is 20ml.\nEach toast per friend is 3ml, so per toast round, 3*3=9ml needed. Wait no, wait: no, each friend needs nl ml per toast. So for each toast, each of the n friends drinks nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl.\n\nSo in the sample, drink per toast is 3 * 3 =9ml. Wait no, wait, no. Wait the sample says:\n\nIn the note, they have 4*5=20ml. They say 20/3=6 toasts. Oh right, because each toast requires 3ml per person, so 3 friends: 3*3=9ml per toast. Wait, but 20 divided by 9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But in the note, it says 6 toasts? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait the note says: \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 /3 =6 toasts.\" Wait that suggests that each toast requires 3ml in total, not per friend. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the problem statement.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink for a toast. So for each toast, each of the n friends must have nl ml. So per toast, the total drink consumed is n * nl ml.\n\nSimilarly, each friend needs one slice of lime. So per toast, n slices are needed.\n\nEach friend needs np grams of salt. So per toast, n * np grams.\n\nSo for each toast, the resources used are:\n\n- drink: n * nl\n- slices: n\n- salt: n * np\n\nSo the total drink is k*l, so the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) / (n * nl), using integer division.\n\nWait, but wait, in the sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1']\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5 → drink is 20ml.\n\nnl=3: each friend needs 3ml per toast.\n\nSo per toast, drink needed is 3 *3 =9ml.\n\nTotal drink is 20, so 20//9=2 toasts.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows 20/3=6 toasts. That's conflicting.\n\nWait wait, perhaps I have a misunderstanding.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"the friends have 4 *5 =20ml, which is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts.\"\n\nWait 20ml divided by 3ml per toast (for all friends?) No, that doesn't add up. 3ml per toast for all friends would mean 6 toasts ×3ml=18ml used, leaving 2ml. So that's 6 toasts.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation says that each toast requires 9ml. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement says that each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for all n friends, each toast requires n * nl milliliters.\n\nSo for sample input 1:\n\nn=3, nl=3: per toast, 3×3=9ml.\n\nBut the note says 20ml allows 20/3=6 toasts, implying that each toast uses 3ml in total. So where's the confusion?\n\nWait the note says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait that suggests that each toast requires 3ml in total. But that can't be, because with 3 friends, each needs 3ml, so 3 ×3=9ml per toast. So why does the note say 20ml is enough for 6 toasts? 6 ×3=18ml, which is less than 20. So that makes sense. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe each toast requires n × nl, but perhaps the division is done differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the drink is calculated as (total_drink) / (n * nl). So 20/(3×3)=2.222, which is 2 toasts. But the note says 6 toasts.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait looking at the note again:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 ×5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait that's 20 divided by 3 equals 6 toasts. So each toast uses 3ml in total? But that can't be, because each of the 3 friends needs 3ml. So each toast uses 9ml. 6 ×9=54ml, which is way more than 20.\n\nThis is confusing. There must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the toast's drink requirement wrong. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of drink for a toast.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for n friends, the total drink per toast is n × nl.\n\nSo in sample 1, that's 3 ×3=9ml per toast.\n\nSo with 20ml, maximum number of toasts is 20//9=2.\n\nBut the note says 20/3=6 toasts. Which would imply that each toast uses 3ml in total. So 3ml per toast for all friends.\n\nThat can't be. So perhaps I've misread the problem.\n\nWait wait, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires n × nl milliliters of drink in total. Or perhaps the drink is per toast regardless of the number of people.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nWait, problem says:\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So per toast, each friend must have that. So per toast, n × nl is the total drink consumed.\n\nSo in the sample, 3 friends, each needing 3ml per toast. So per toast, 9ml. Total 20ml gives 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says 20/3=6 toasts. So perhaps the problem statement has a different interpretation. Maybe the drink is divided per toast, and each friend gets a part, but perhaps the total is just n × nl per toast.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial understanding is wrong. Maybe the drink is considered as a single pool, and each toast consumes n × nl ml.\n\nSo for the sample, 20ml / (3×3) = 2.222, so 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says that the drink allows 20/3=6 toasts, which would mean that each toast uses 3ml in total. So 3ml per toast, regardless of the number of friends.\n\nSo perhaps my initial understanding is incorrect. Maybe each toast only requires nl milliliters of drink in total, not per friend.\n\nWait, that would make more sense with the sample. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\". So per friend, per toast, it's nl ml. So per toast, n friends consume n × nl ml.\n\nSo in the note, 20ml is the total. 3 friends, each requiring 3ml per toast. So 3 ×3=9ml per toast. 20 /9=2. So 2 toasts. But the note says 6 toasts. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in reading the note.\n\nLooking back: the note says:\n\n\"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 =2.\"\n\nWait, so the maximum number of toasts possible based on drink is 6, based on lime is 80, based on salt is 100. So the minimum is 6, but then divided by 3? Why?\n\nAh, perhaps the toasts are per friend. So each toast is per friend. So for each friend, their own toast requires nl ml, one slice, and np salt.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense. Because making a toast is a group activity. So I think the original understanding is correct: each toast requires n × nl drink, n slices, and n × np salt.\n\nSo the note's explanation is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the drink is considered per toast, not per friend. So for each toast, the entire group drinks, and each drink is 1ml per friend. So per toast, n × nl ml is consumed.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the sample.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → drink is 20ml.\n\nc=10, d=8 → slices are 80.\n\np=100.\n\nnl=3, np=1.\n\nSo for each toast:\n\ndrink: 3 friends ×3ml =9ml.\n\nslices: 3 ×1 =3 slices.\n\nsalt:3 ×1=3g.\n\nSo how many toasts can each friend make?\n\nThe note says the drink allows 20 /3 =6 toasts. So 6 ×9=54ml, but 20 is less than 54. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is that each friend can make T toasts, but each toast is individual. So each friend can make T toasts, but each toast for a friend uses nl ml, a slice, and np salt. But then, for n friends, each making T toasts, the total drink is n*T*nl, total slices is n*T, total salt is n*T*np.\n\nSo the maximum T is the minimum of:\n\ndrink: (k*l) >= n*T*nl → T <= (k*l)/(n*nl)\n\nslices: c*d >= n*T → T <= (c*d)/n\n\nsalt: p >= n*T*np → T <= p/(n*np)\n\nSo T is the minimum of these three.\n\nIn sample input 1:\n\ndrink: 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈2.222 → T can be 2.\n\nslices: 80 /3 =26.666 → T can be 26.\n\nsalt:100/(3*1)=33.333 → T can be 33.\n\nSo T is min(2,26,33) → 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo the note in the problem must have an error. Because according to the note, it said that the drink allows 20/3=6 toasts, but according to this calculation, it's 2.\n\nSo perhaps the note is wrong or I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the note again.\n\nNote says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 *5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 *8=80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 /1=100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6,80,100) /3 =2.\"\n\nWait, so according to the note, the maximum toasts based on drink is 20/3=6. How?\n\nBecause for each toast, each friend needs 3ml, so per toast, 3ml ×3 friends=9ml. But 6 toasts would require 54ml, which exceeds 20ml.\n\nSo the note's reasoning seems incorrect.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the correct answer is 2, which aligns with our calculation.\n\nSo perhaps the note is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each friend makes their own toast, and the drink is per toast per friend. So each friend can make T toasts, and for each toast, they need nl ml, one slice, and np salt.\n\nIn that case, the total drink is n*T*nl, which must be <=k*l.\n\nTotal slices: n*T.\n\nSalt: n*T*np.\n\nSo the maximum T is min( (k*l)/(n*nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n*np) )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo for the sample, drink is 20/(3*3)=2.22 →2.\n\nSlices:80/3=26.66 →26.\n\nSalt:100/(3*1)=33.33 →33.\n\nMinimum is 2, so each friend can make 2 toasts.\n\nThus, the sample output is 2.\n\nSo the note must be wrong in its explanation. So perhaps the note is incorrect, but the code should follow the correct logic.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCalculate the maximum possible T as the minimum of:\n\n1. (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\n2. (c * d) // n\n\n3. p // (n * np)\n\nThen, the result is T.\n\nSo the code should compute these three values, take the minimum, and output it.\n\nNow, I need to write a Python program that reads the input line, parses the integers, and computes the above.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- When any of the denominators (n * nl, n, n * np) are zero. But according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers, so no division by zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when any of the resources are insufficient for even one toast.\n\nFor example, if n=1, and the drink is 1ml, and nl=2. Then drink allows 0 toasts.\n\nSo the code must handle that correctly.\n\nNow, how to structure the code.\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nParse each variable:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntoast_drink = n * nl\n\nmax_toasts_drink = total_drink // toast_drink\n\ntoast_slices = n * 1 per toast → total slices needed per toast is n.\n\nmax_toasts_slices = (c * d) // n\n\ntoast_salt = n * np per toast.\n\nmax_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen, T is the minimum of these three.\n\nOutput T as a string.\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the output is the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, each friend can make T toasts.\n\nWait, no. Because each toast is a group activity. So each friend can make T toasts, but each toast is for the group.\n\nWait, no. Because each friend makes T toasts. So the total toasts are T * n. But the drink, slices, and salt are all consumed per toast, regardless of the number of friends.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. The problem says:\n\nThe friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\nSo each toast is a single event where all friends participate. So for each toast, all friends make a toast.\n\nSo the drink, slices, and salt are consumed once per toast, regardless of the number of friends.\n\nThus, the maximum number of toasts T is determined by the resources.\n\nSo the code should compute T as the minimum of:\n\n- (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\n- (c * d) // n\n\n- p // (n * np)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → 20ml.\n\nnl=3 → per toast, 3 *3=9ml.\n\nc=10, d=8 →80 slices.\n\nd=8 per lime, so 10 limes give 80 slices.\n\np=100.\n\nSo:\n\nmax_toasts_drink = 20 //9 =2.\n\nmax_toasts_slices =80 //3=26.\n\nmax_toasts_salt=100 //3=33.\n\nmin is 2.\n\nThus, output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample in the input is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'.\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink=1000.\n\nnl=4: per toast, 5*4=20ml. 1000 /20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 →19 slices.\n\nper toast, 5 slices. 19 //5=3.\n\nsalt: p=90, np=3. per toast, 5*3=15g. 90//15=6.\n\nmin(50,3,6) →3.\n\nWhich is the second sample output.\n\nThird sample: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, drink=1000*1000=1e6 ml.\n\nnl=50: per toast, 10*50=500ml. 1e6 /500=2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 →575 slices.\n\nper toast, 10 slices →575 //10=57.\n\nsalt: p=1, np=1 → per toast 10 grams. 1 //10=0.\n\nso min(2000,57,0) →0.\n\nThus, output 0.\n\nWhich matches the third sample.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo now, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the four variables:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nmax_t_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nmax_t_slices = (c * d) // n\n\nmax_t_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nt = min(max_t_drink, max_t_slices, max_t_salt)\n\nPrint t as a string.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the input line, split into 8 integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink = k * l\n\ntoasts_drink = drink // (n * nl)\n\nlimes = c * d\n\ntoasts_limes = limes // n\n\nsalt = p\n\ntoasts_salt = salt // (n * np)\n\nt = min(toasts_drink, toasts_limes, toasts_salt)\n\nprint(t)\n\nWait, but in Python, division of integers with // is integer division, which is what we want.\n\nTesting this code against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\ndrink=20, toasts_drink=20//9=2.\n\nlimes=80, toasts_limes=80//3=26.\n\nsalt=100, toasts_salt=100//3=33.\n\nt=2.\n\nSample 2:\n\n5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\ndrink=1000, toasts_drink=1000// (5*4)=1000/20=50.\n\nlimes=19, toasts_limes=19//5=3.\n\nsalt=90, toasts_salt=90//(5*3)=90/15=6.\n\nt=3.\n\nSample3:\n\n10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\ndrink=1000000, toasts_drink=1000000 // (10*50) = 1000000 //500=2000.\n\nlimes=25*23=575, toasts_limes=575//10=57.\n\nsalt=1, toasts_salt=1 // (10*1) =0.\n\nt=0.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\ndrink: 1 // (1*1) =1.\n\nlimes:1//1=1.\n\nsalt:1//1=1.\n\nt=1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, drink=5, nl=2.\n\ntoasts_drink=5//4=1.\n\nIf slices are enough, salt is enough, then t=1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo now, the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Requirements**: Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - One lime slice per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - Total drink available is `k * l`.\n   - Total lime slices available is `c * d`.\n   - Total salt available is `p`.\n\n3. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - For drink: The maximum number of toasts is `(total_drink) // (n * nl)`.\n   - For lime slices: The maximum number of toasts is `(total_lime_slices) // n`.\n   - For salt: The maximum number of toasts is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Compute the Result**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the three values calculated above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate total resources\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\n# Compute maximum possible toasts based on each resource\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoasts_lime = total_lime_slices // n\ntoasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n# Determine the limiting factor\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution reads the input values and calculates the total resources available.
