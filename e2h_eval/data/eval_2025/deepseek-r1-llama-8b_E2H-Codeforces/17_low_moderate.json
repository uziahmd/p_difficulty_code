He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the 2n-2 strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of a certain string s of length n. The input gives all possible improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths from 1 to n-1), and I need to output a string where each character is 'P' or 'S', indicating whether the corresponding input string is a prefix or suffix.\n\nHmm, the challenge is that I don't know which is which, but I have to assign P or S such that exactly half of them are P and the other half S, and the assignments must be consistent with some possible string s.\n\nWait, but the problem says it's guaranteed that the given strings are indeed prefixes and suffixes of some existing string s. So my job is to find an assignment where each string is either a prefix or suffix of s, and the counts are equal.\n\nFirst, let me think about what makes a string a prefix or a suffix.\n\nFor a string t to be a prefix of s, it must be that t is the first k characters of s, for some k between 1 and n-1.\n\nSimilarly, for t to be a suffix of s, it must be the last k characters of s, for some k between 1 and n-1.\n\nNow, how can I determine which t's are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nI remember that in such problems, the correct approach often involves building the possible string s step by step, ensuring that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent the current state of the possible s, and edges represent adding a new character, either from a prefix or suffix.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use dynamic programming, tracking possible candidates for the next character.\n\nWait, another approach: for each possible length k, the strings of length k must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nLet's think about all the strings of a particular length. For each length l, there are two strings: one that is a prefix and one that is a suffix.\n\nBut wait, no. For each l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix. So for each l, among the two strings, one is a prefix candidate and the other is a suffix candidate.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily be the case because for a particular l, both could be prefixes or both could be suffixes? Or no, because the total number of prefixes and suffixes is 2*(n-1), but since for each l, there are two strings, which are one prefix and one suffix of the same length.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the input contains exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. And these are the prefixes and suffixes of some string s. So for each l, one of the two is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nNo, wait: for example, for l=1, both the first character and the last character of s are present as prefixes and suffixes. But if l=1, then the two strings are the first character and the last character of s. So one is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nThat's an important point. So for each l, among the two strings, one is P and the other is S.\n\nSo, when considering the structure of s, for each position, certain transitions must hold.\n\nAnother observation: the correct assignment must satisfy that for every l, the strings of length l are the first l characters of s and the last l characters of s, but arranged in such a way that their prefixes and suffixes align.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a trie. Each node represents a possible state of the string built so far. For each possible step, we add a character and see if the resulting string can be built from prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can build the string s step by step, choosing the correct character at each position based on the constraints.\n\nLet me think about the possible s. Let's denote the full string as s = c_1 c_2 ... c_n.\n\nFor each l from 1 to n-1, the two strings of length l are: one is the prefix s[0..l-1], and the other is the suffix s[l..n-1].\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of that length must satisfy that one is a prefix, the other a suffix.\n\nBut how do I determine which is which?\n\nOne approach is to try to find a string s that is consistent with the given strings. Since the problem says that the answer exists, there must be at least one such s.\n\nBut trying all possibilities is not feasible because n can be up to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or suffix of the unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, and our task is to classify each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S').\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Prefixes and Suffixes**: For any string `s` of length `n`, there are `n-1` proper prefixes and `n-1` proper suffixes. Each prefix is a substring starting from the first character up to some point, while each suffix is a substring ending at the last character up to some point.\n\n2. **Constraints on Input**: The input ensures that for each length from 1 to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings. One of these must be a prefix, and the other must be a suffix.\n\n3. **Constructing the String**: We can construct the string `s` by considering all possible valid transitions between characters. This involves checking if a string of length `l` can be extended by adding a character to form a valid string of length `l+1`.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) approach where we maintain a set of possible current states (strings) and update them by adding each new character from the input strings. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the possible valid strings.\n\n5. **Validating Transitions**: For each step, check if adding a character from the current set of valid strings results in a new string that can be formed by extending a prefix or suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lines = []\n    for _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        lines.append(line)\n    \n    # Group the strings by their lengths\n    groups = {}\n    for s in lines:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in groups:\n            groups[l] = []\n        groups[l].append(s)\n    \n    # For each length, the two strings must consist of one prefix and one suffix\n    # We'll try to find the correct assignment\n    # The answer must have equal number of 'P's and 'S's, which will be n-1 each\n\n    # Initialize the DP\n    dp = {0: ['']}\n    for l in range(1, n):\n        current_chars = []\n        for prev_str in dp[l-1]:\n            for candidate in groups.get(l, []):\n                if candidate[0:-1] == prev_str:\n                    current_chars.append(candidate)\n        dp[l] = current_chars\n    \n    # Now, after building all possibilities, check which ones are consistent\n    # But since the problem says there exists at least one solution, perhaps we can build the string step by step\n    # Alternative approach: find the possible next character at each step based on the constraints\n    # Let's try to build the string step by step\n\n    # Another approach: for each possible position, determine the possible next character\n    # Let's create a list of possible current candidates for each step\n    # Start with empty string\n    candidates = ['']\n    for i in range(n):\n        new_candidates = set()\n        for c in candidates:\n            for s in groups.get(i+1, []):\n                if s.startswith(c):\n                    new_candidates.add(c + s[-1])\n        candidates = list(new_candidates)\n    \n    # At this point, candidates contains all possible s that fit the given prefixes and suffixes\n    # Now, for each string in the input, determine if it's a prefix or suffix\n\n    result = []\n    for s in lines:\n        is_prefix = False\n        is_suffix = False\n        for candidate in candidates:\n            if s == candidate[:len(s)] and len(s) < n:\n                is_prefix = True\n            if s == candidate[-len(s):] and len(s) < n:\n                is_suffix = True\n        if is_prefix:\n            result.append('P')\n        elif is_suffix:\n            result.append('S')\n        else:\n            # This should not happen as per the problem statement\n            result.append('P')\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves reading the input and grouping the strings by their lengths. Using a dynamic programming approach, we iteratively build possible candidates for the unknown string `s` by checking valid transitions from shorter strings to longer ones. Finally, we classify each input string as a prefix or suffix based on whether it matches the corresponding parts of the candidate strings. This ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct.",
