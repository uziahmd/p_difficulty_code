    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about two progress bars when copying files. The first bar shows the percentage of a single file being copied, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both are updated after each byte is copied. We need to find all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) where both progress bars show the same value at some moment.\n\nHmm. So for each x (number of bytes copied so far), I can compute what the two progress bars would display. Then, check if they are equal. If they are, record that percentage. Finally, output all such percentages in order.\n\nWait, but how do I model the process? Let me think step by step.\n\nEach time a byte is copied, we update the progress bars. For the first progress bar (file i), it's the floor of (100 * x_i) / a_i, where x_i is the number of bytes copied so far for that file. For the second progress bar, it's the floor of (100 * total_x) / total_a, where total_x is the sum of all x_i across all files.\n\nBut since the copying is done sequentially, each byte affects exactly one file. So the process can be thought of as processing each byte one by one, updating the relevant x_i and then computing the progress bars.\n\nBut wait, processing each byte one by one might not be efficient, especially since a_i can be up to 1000 and n up to 100. That means the total number of bytes could be up to 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, no. Because for each file, say with size 1000, it would require 1000 steps. So for 100 files, it's 1e5 steps, which is manageable for Python.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Simulate each byte being copied, step by step.\n2. After each step, calculate the current progress for each bar.\n3. Check if they are equal. If yes, add to the result set.\n4. After all steps, collect all unique values and output them in order.\n\nBut how to represent the state? For each file, track how many bytes have been copied so far. The total bytes copied is the sum of all these individual bytes.\n\nLet me outline the variables needed:\n\n- A list 'x' where x[i] is the number of bytes copied for file i+1 (since the files are 0-based or 1-based? Hmm, depends on implementation). Initially, all are zero.\n\n- total_bytes: sum of all x[i], which is the total bytes processed so far.\n\nFor each step, from 1 to max_total_bytes (which is the sum of all a_i):\n\nWait, no. Because for each file, the maximum bytes it contributes is its own a_i. So the simulation should run for each possible x across all files.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to proceed is to simulate for each possible x, which is the cumulative bytes for each file. But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, process each byte one by one. For each byte, determine which file it's being copied from, increment that file's x, and then compute the two progress bars.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo let's think of the algorithm:\n\nInitialize a list x = [0] * n. This represents the number of bytes already copied for each file.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nresult = set()\n\nfor each byte in 1 to total_bytes_possible:\n    determine which file is being processed next. Since the files are copied in order, each file is processed for a_i bytes before moving to the next. Wait, no—each file is processed entirely before the next starts. So the process is sequential per file.\n\nWait, no. It's more like, for the first file, you process a_1 bytes, then the second a_2, etc. So the order is:\n\nFile 1, File 2, ..., File n.\n\nEach time, you process a block of a_i bytes. So the process isn't a single loop over each byte, but rather, for each file, copy all its bytes in order.\n\nOh right! Because the problem says that the files are copied \"последовательно в заданном порядке\". So the entire file 1 is copied first, then file 2, and so on.\n\nThis changes things. So instead of processing each byte one by one, it's better to process each file in order, and for each file, process each byte step by step.\n\nBecause processing each byte individually would be too slow for large a_i. Wait, but a_i is up to 1000, and n up to 100, which gives us 1e5 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the algorithm can be structured as:\n\nfor each file in the list of files:\n    for each byte in 1 to a_i:\n        increment x[file_index]\n        compute current percentages for both progress bars\n        if they are equal, add to the result set\n        also, keep track of all possible x's, but perhaps it's not necessary because each byte is processed.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that after each byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. So for each byte within a file, the progress bars change, and we must check after each step.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize x as [0]*n.\n\nresult = set()\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n    file_size = a[i]\n    for j in 1 to file_size:\n        x[i] += 1\n        # compute the first progress bar\n        pb1 = (100 * x[i]) // a[i]\n        # compute the second progress bar\n        total_x = sum(x)\n        pb2 = (100 * total_x) // (sum(a))\n        if pb1 == pb2:\n            result.add(pb1)\n        # Also, note that after each step, the progress bars change, even if pb1 and pb2 are not equal.\n\nWait, but that's not all. Because during the processing of a file, the total_x increases, but for pb2, it's based on the sum of all x's, which includes the current x[i]. So yes, for each step j, after adding 1 to x[i], we compute pb1 and pb2.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nOnce all bytes are processed, collect all the values in the result set, sort them, and output them in order.\n\nWait, but what about cases where multiple steps contribute to the same pb1 and pb2. For example, in the sample input given, the first test case has one file of size 6. So each time a byte is added, both progress bars show the same percentage. So all 6 steps will have pb1 equal to pb2. So the result will include 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is ['2\\n100 500'], so n=2, a=[100, 500].\n\nSo let's see:\n\nInitially, x = [0, 0]\n\nAfter processing each byte:\n\nFirst, process file 1 (size 100):\n\nj=1: x[0]=1\npb1 = 1*100/100 =1%\npb2 = (1)/(600) * 100 → 0.166... → 0%\nso pb1 != pb2.\n\nj=2: x[0]=2 → pb1=2% → pb2=(2)/600*100 → 0.333→0%. Still not equal.\n\n...\n\nj=100: x[0]=100 → pb1=100% → pb2= (100)/600*100 → 16.666→16% → 100 vs 16: no.\n\nThen process file 2 (500 bytes):\n\nFor j=1: x[1]=1 → pb1=0.01*100=0.1 → 0% → pb2 = (101)/(600)*100=16.833→16% → 0 vs 16: no.\n\nj=95: x[1]=95 → pb1=95*100/500=19% → pb2: (100 +95)/600 = 195/600=32.5 → 32% → 19 vs32: no.\n\nj=96: x[1]=96 → pb1=96*100/500=19.2→19% → pb2= (196)/600=32.666→32% → 19 vs32: no.\n\nj=97: x[1]=97 → pb1=19.4→19% → pb2= 197/600=32.833→32% → no.\n\nj=98: x[1]=98 → pb1=19.6→19% → pb2=198/600=33. →33% → 19 vs33: no.\n\nj=99: x[1]=99 → pb1=19.8→19% → pb2=199/600≈33.166→33% → no.\n\nj=100: x[1]=100 → pb1=20% → pb2=300/600=50% → 20 vs50: no.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the output is 0, 95,96,97,98,99,100. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the second test case in the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n2\n100 500\n\nSample Output:\n0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100\n\nSo let's process each step.\n\nProcessing file 1 (100 bytes):\n\nAt each step, after adding 1 byte to x[0], compute pb1 and pb2.\n\nAfter each byte:\n\nj=1:\n\nx = [1, 0]\n\npb1 = 1*100/100=1 → 1%\n\npb2 = (1) / (600) *100 = 0.166… → 0%.\n\nNot equal.\n\nj=2:\n\nx[0]=2 → 2% → pb2=2/600*100=0.333→0% → no.\n\nSimilarly, until j=100.\n\nAfter j=100:\n\nx[0]=100 → pb1=100% → pb2=100/(600)*100 = 16.666→16% → 100 vs16: not equal.\n\nSo no match during file 1 processing.\n\nNow, process file 2 (500 bytes):\n\nAt j=1:\n\nx becomes [100, 1]\n\npb1 = (1*100)/500 = 0.2 → 0%\n\npb2 = (101)/(600) *100 → 16.833→16% → 0 and16: not equal.\n\nj=2:\n\nx[1]=2 → pb1= (2*100)/500=0.4 →0%\n\npb2= (102)/(600)*100=17% → 0 and17: no.\n\n...\n\nWait, but in the sample, 95 is present. So when does pb1 equal pb2?\n\nWait, perhaps during the processing of file 2, when x[1] is 95, but pb1 is 19% and pb2 is 32.5→32%, but perhaps another point where pb1 equals pb2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's consider when after a certain number of bytes, the two progress bars coincide.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nFor each file i, the progress after k bytes is (k / a_i)*100 floored.\n\nThe global progress after processing m bytes (from all files) is (m / total_a)*100 floored.\n\nWe need to find all p where there exists a moment where both progress bars equal p.\n\nSo for each possible p, we need to check if there exists a step where:\n\nfloor( (x_i / a_i)*100 ) = p,\n\nand\n\nfloor( (sum_x / total_a)*100 ) = p.\n\nAdditionally, sum_x is the sum of all x_i, which is the sum of the individual x's.\n\nBut how to model this without simulating each step?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each p, check whether it's possible for p to be a common value.\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy, but perhaps manageable since p ranges from 0 to 100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simulation approach is manageable because the maximum number of steps is 1e5, which is acceptable.\n\nWait, but for each byte, the x for that file is incremented by 1, and the other files remain the same. So during the processing of a file, the sum_x increases by 1 each step.\n\nSo the simulation approach is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize x as [0] * n.\n\n- Compute total_a = sum(a).\n\n- Initialize a set to collect the matching p's.\n\n- For each file i in 0..n-1:\n\n   - For j in 1 to a[i]:\n\n      - x[i] += 1\n\n      - compute pb1 = (x[i] * 100) // a[i]\n\n      - compute sum_x = sum(x)\n\n      - pb2 = (sum_x * 100) // total_a\n\n      - if pb1 == pb2, add to the set.\n\n- After all steps, collect all elements in the set, sort them, and print each on a new line.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=1, a=[6]\n\nProcess file 0:\n\nj from 1 to6:\n\nAt j=1: x[0]=1 → pb1= (1*100)/6 = 16.666→16% → pb2= (1/6)*100=16.666→16% → equal. So p=16 is added.\n\nj=2: x=2 → (200/6)=33.333→33% → pb2= (2/6)*100=33.333→33% → add 33.\n\nj=3: x=3 → 50% → pb2= (3/6)*100=50% → add 50.\n\nj=4: x=4 → 66.666→66% → pb2= (4/6)*100=66.666→66% → add 66.\n\nj=5: x=5 → 83.333→83% → pb2= (5/6)*100=83.333→83% → add.\n\nj=6: x=6 →100% → pb2= (6/6)*100=100% → add.\n\nSo the result set is {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=2, a=[100,500]\n\nProcessing file 0 (100 bytes):\n\nFor j=1 to100:\n\nEach step, x[0] increases by 1.\n\npb1 is (j *100)/100 = j%.\n\npb2 is (j + 0) / 600 *100 = (j /6)*100 → integer division.\n\nSo after j=1:\n\npb1=1, pb2= 0 → no.\n\nj=6: pb1=6, pb2=6 → yes. So add 6?\n\nWait, wait, in the sample, 95 is part of the output. So perhaps during the processing of file 1, some steps match.\n\nLet's continue.\n\nAfter processing file 0, x is [100, 0].\n\nsum_x = 100.\n\nNow, process file 1 (500 bytes):\n\nFor j=1 to500:\n\nAt each step, x[1] increases by 1.\n\nSo for each j:\n\npb1 = (x[1] * 100)/500 → (j*100)/500 = j*0.2 → integer division.\n\npb2 = (100 + j) * 100 / (600) → (100 +j)*16.666...\n\nWe need to find j where pb1 == pb2.\n\nSo:\n\n(j * 100)/500 = floor( (100 +j)*100 /600 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nj * 0.2 = floor( (100 +j) * 100 /600 )\n\nWhich is:\n\nj * 0.2 = floor( (100 +j) * (5/3) )\n\nWait, (100 +j)*100 /600 = (100+j)* (1/6) ≈ 16.666 (100 +j).\n\nWait, 100 +j is multiplied by 100, then divided by 600. So 100*(100 +j)/600 = (100+j)/6.\n\nSo pb2 is the floor of (100 + j)/6 * 100 → wait no, pb2 is floor( (sum_x * 100) / total_a ), which is (100 + j)*100 /600 → (100 +j)* (100)/600 = (100+j)* (5/3)/10 → no, wait:\n\nWait, sum_x is 100 + j. So sum_x *100 = (100 + j)*100.\n\nTotal_a is 600.\n\nSo pb2 = ((100 + j)*100) // 600.\n\nWhich is equal to (100 +j) * 100 /600, floored.\n\nSimplify 100/600 = 1/6. So:\n\npb2 = (100 +j) * (1/6) → integer division.\n\nWait, 100 +j is multiplied by 100, then divided by 600. So (100 + j) * 100 = (100 +j) * 100.\n\nDivide by 600 → (100 +j) * (100/600) = (100 +j)*(5/30) = (100 +j)/6 *5 ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute (100 +j)*100 /600 = (100 +j)* (5/3) /10 → no, perhaps not.\n\nWait, let's compute for specific j.\n\nLooking for j where (j * 100) /500 == floor( (100 +j)*100 /600 )\n\nWhich is j*0.2 == floor( (100 +j)* (100/600) )\n\nSimplify 100/600 is 1/6.\n\nSo:\n\n0.2j = floor( (100 +j) * (1/6) )\n\nWe can write 0.2j = floor( (100 +j)/6 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\nj = 5 * floor( (100 +j)/6 )\n\nSo for j in 1..500.\n\nWe need to find j where this equality holds.\n\nLet me try j=95:\n\nleft side: 0.2 *95=19\n\nright side: floor( (100+95)/6 )=195/6=32.5 → floor is32.\n\n19 !=32 → no.\n\nj=96:\n\n0.2*96=19.2 →19\n\nright: (196)/6=32.666→32 → 19 !=32.\n\nj=97: 19.4→19; 197/6=32.833→32 → no.\n\nj=98: 19.6→19; 198/6=33 →33. So 19 !=33.\n\nj=99: 19.8→19; 199/6=33.166→33. No.\n\nj=100: 20; 200/6=33.333→33. No.\n\nj=101:20.2→20; 201/6=33.5→33. No.\n\nj=195: 39; (295)/6=49.166→49. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, for j=95, 0.2j=19. So we need (100 +95)/6 = 32.5 → floor is32. So 19 !=32.\n\nWhat about j=95*5=475? No, j is up to 500.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find j where 0.2j is equal to floor( (100+j)/6 ).\n\nSo:\n\nWe can express 0.2j = k, where k is an integer.\n\nThen, j=5k.\n\nAlso, k <= (100 +j)/6 <k+1.\n\nSubstituting j=5k:\n\nk <= (100 +5k)/6 <k+1.\n\nMultiply all terms by6:\n\n6k ≤ 100 +5k <6(k+1)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n6k ≤100 +5k → k ≤100.\n\nAnd 100+5k <6k+6 →100 <k+6 →k>94.\n\nSo k must be between 95 and 100 inclusive.\n\nSo for k=95: j=475.\n\nCheck:\n\npb1= 475*0.2=95.\n\npb2= (100 +475)/6=575/6=95.833→95.\n\nSo 95 ==95 → yes.\n\nSimilarly, for k=96: j=480.\n\npb1=96.\n\npb2= (580)/6=96.666→96 → yes.\n\nSimilarly, for k=97: j=485.\n\npb1=97.\n\npb2=585/6=97.5→97.\n\nYes.\n\nk=98: j=490.\n\npb1=98.\n\npb2=590/6=98.333→98 → yes.\n\nk=99: j=495.\n\npb1=99.\n\npb2=595/6=99.166→99 → yes.\n\nk=100: j=500.\n\npb1=100.\n\npb2=600/6=100 → yes.\n\nSo during the processing of file 2, j=475,480,485,490,495,500 all satisfy pb1=pb2=k.\n\nThus, the result includes 95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nPlus, during the processing of file1, any points where pb1 and pb2 are equal.\n\nWait, in the first file processing, when j=100, pb1=100, pb2=16.666→16. So no match.\n\nSo the only points where pb1=pb2 are during the processing of file2, for j=475,480,...,500.\n\nThus, the result includes 95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the first test case's output includes 0, which is correct because at the start, both are 0. So why is 0 included in the output?\n\nAh, right. At the very beginning, before any bytes are copied, both progress bars are 0. So 0 is always included.\n\nSo the result set for the second test case is {0,95,96,97,98,99,100}, but the sample output shows 0 followed by those numbers. So the sample output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nThus, the code needs to capture 0 as well.\n\nSo the initial state is x all zero, which gives pb1=0 and pb2=0. So 0 is added to the result.\n\nThus, in the simulation, the first step is j=1, but in the initial state, after processing j=0 steps, the 0 is captured.\n\nWait, no. Because the code as outlined processes each byte, but doesn't handle the initial state. So in the code, after initializing x to all zeros, before processing any file, the initial state is checked.\n\nWait, no. Because the code as written starts processing the first file, and for j=1 to a_i.\n\nThus, the initial state (before any bytes are processed) is not considered.\n\nAh, that's a problem.\n\nBecause the initial state (x all zero) is when both progress bars are zero.\n\nSo in the code, we need to add 0 to the result set.\n\nBecause at the very beginning, after 0 bytes have been copied, both are zero.\n\nSo the code should include 0.\n\nSo in the code, after initializing, add 0 to the result set.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nInitialize x as [0]*n.\n\nAdd 0 to result.\n\nCompute total_a = sum(a).\n\nThen, for each file, process each byte step by step.\n\nAfter each step, compute pb1 and pb2, and if equal, add to result.\n\nThus, the code will correctly capture 0.\n\nIn the second test case, 0 is included.\n\nSo the sample outputs make sense.\n\nThus, the code structure is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a list.\n\nCompute total_a.\n\nInitialize x as [0]*n.\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n    for j in 1 to a[i]:\n\n        x[i] +=1\n\n        pb1 = (x[i] *100) // a[i]\n\n        sum_x = sum(x)\n\n        pb2 = (sum_x *100) // total_a\n\n        if pb1 == pb2:\n\n            result.add(pb1)\n\nThus, the code captures all steps, including the initial 0.\n\nSo now, the code needs to handle all the steps correctly.\n\nTesting this logic with the third sample input:\n\nThird sample input is:\n\n4\n\n170 130 400 256 30 100\n\nWait, no, the input is:\n\n['4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\nWait, wait, the sample input is:\n\nThe user provided four test cases. The last one is:\n\n6\n\n170 130 400 256 30 100\n\nSo for this case, let's see.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed to code.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, we can read n from stdin, then the a list.\n\nThen, initialize x as [0]*n.\n\nAdd 0 to the result.\n\nLoop through each file index i, for j in 1 to a[i]:\n\nIncrement x[i], compute pb1 and pb2, check and add to result.\n\nFinally, sort the result and print each on a new line.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nx = [0]*n\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\ntotal_a = sum(a)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    ai = a[i]\n\n    for j in range(1, ai+1):\n\n        x[i] +=1\n\n        pb1 = (x[i] * 100) // ai\n\n        sum_x = sum(x)\n\n        pb2 = (sum_x * 100) // total_a\n\n        if pb1 == pb2:\n\n            result.add(pb1)\n\n# Now, collect and sort the result.\n\nres = sorted(result)\n\nfor p in res:\n\n    print(p)\n\nWait, but wait: in the third sample input, the output is:\n\n0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100\n\nWhich suggests that during the processing of the files, certain p's were matched.\n\nSo the code should correctly capture all p's.\n\nBut perhaps I should test the code.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps this approach is correct.\n\nThus, the final code is as above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the moments during which both progress bars show the same percentage value while copying files sequentially. The progress bars update after each byte is copied, and we need to find all such percentages from 0 to 100 inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Progress Tracking**: Use a list to track the number of bytes copied for each file.\n3. **Initial State**: Both progress bars start at 0%, so add 0 to the result set.\n4. **Simulate Copy Process**: For each file, simulate the copying process byte by byte:\n   - Update the progress bar for the current file.\n   - Calculate the overall progress bar for all files.\n   - Check if both progress bars show the same percentage and record it if they do.\n5. **Collect Results**: After processing all files, collect and sort the results.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nx = [0] * n\nresult = {0}\ntotal_a = sum(a)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    ai = a[i]\n    for j in range(1, ai + 1):\n        x[i] += 1\n        pb1 = (x[i] * 100) // ai\n        sum_x = sum(x)\n        pb2 = (sum_x * 100) // total_a\n        if pb1 == pb2:\n            result.add(pb1)\n\nfor p in sorted(result):\n    print(p)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their sizes.\n- **Tracking Bytes Copied**: We maintain a list `x` where each element represents the number of bytes copied for the corresponding file.\n- **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied, we calculate the progress for the current file and the overall progress across all files.\n- **Result Collection**: We use a set to store unique percentages where both progress bars match, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.\n- **Output**: Finally, we sort the collected percentages and print them in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the progress of each file and ensures that we capture all moments where both progress bars show the same percentage, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
