    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Array Stabilization. We are given an array of integers. The instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array. Our task is to remove exactly one element from the array such that the resulting instability is minimized. We need to find this minimum possible instability.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I think is, what's the approach here? Well, let's see.\n\nLet me think about the sample input. For example, in the first case, the array is [1,3,3,7]. If we remove 7, the new array is [1,3,3], so max is 3, min is 1, instability is 2. But if we remove 1, then the array becomes [3,3,7], max is 7, min is 3, instability is 4. So clearly, removing the max or min can help reduce the instability.\n\nWait, but sometimes that's not the case. Like in the second sample where the array is [1, 100000]. Removing either gives a single element, so instability is zero. So the idea is to find which element, when removed, leads to the smallest possible max - min of the remaining array.\n\nSo, how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe naive approach would be to try removing each element, compute the max and min of the remaining array, and track the minimum instability across all these possibilities. But with n up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow.\n\nI need a more efficient method.\n\nLet me think: the initial instability is (max(a) - min(a)). When we remove an element, the new instability can't be larger than that, but perhaps it's smaller.\n\nWait, but how? Because the max could decrease, the min could increase, both could change.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find for each possible element, what is the new max and new min after removing it.\n\nBut calculating that directly is expensive. So, maybe we can precompute some information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal choice is to remove either the current maximum or the current minimum. Because by doing so, the new max or min might be reduced, leading to a lower instability.\n\nIs that always the case? Let's think.\n\nSuppose the array has multiple elements. If the max is unique, then removing it will definitely reduce the max. Similarly, if the min is unique, removing it will reduce the min.\n\nBut what if the max occurs multiple times? Like in the first sample where the max was 7, but there were also 3s. Removing 7 leaves the max as 3, which reduces the instability.\n\nSimilarly, if the min occurs multiple times, removing one instance won't affect the min.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is:\n\n- Find the global max and see if it's unique. If it's not, then removing any one occurrence of the max might not reduce the max, but since there are others, the max remains. Wait, no—wait, if the max appears multiple times, then removing one doesn't change the max. So, in that case, removing the max might not help.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the array is [3,3,5], the max is 5. If we remove 5, the new array is [3,3], so max is 3, which reduces the instability.\n\nBut if the array is [3,5,5], the max is 5, but there are two 5s. Removing one 5 doesn't change the max. So the instability remains the same as before.\n\nAh, right. So, the key is to find whether the current max is the only occurrence. If yes, then removing it will decrease the max. Otherwise, it won't.\n\nSimilarly for the min.\n\nSo, perhaps the plan is:\n\nCompute the global max and min. Then, check if the max occurs more than once. If yes, then removing one occurrence of the max doesn't change the max, so the new max is still the same as the original. Similarly for the min.\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove an element, the new max could be the second largest element. So, if the max is present multiple times, then even after removing one, the max remains.\n\nWait, wait. Suppose the array is [5,5,6]. Max is 6, which occurs once. Removing 6 gives [5,5], max is 5. So the instability decreases.\n\nIf the array is [5,5,5], then removing any one 5 leaves the array as [5,5], which has the same min and max as before (5-5=0). So in that case, removing any element doesn't change the instability.\n\nWait, but the initial instability is zero. So in that case, any removal doesn't change anything.\n\nSo, back to the approach.\n\nWe need to find for each element, the new max and new min after removing it, and compute the instability. Then choose the minimum among all possibilities.\n\nBut computing this for each element is O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Find all possible candidates that could lead to a better instability.\n\nSince the initial instability is (max - min), perhaps the best way to minimize it is to either:\n\n1. Remove the current max, which could possibly lower the max.\n2. Remove the current min, which could possibly raise the min.\n3. Also consider other elements that are either near the max or min, but perhaps not the global ones.\n\nWait, but how to determine without checking all possibilities.\n\nAnother thought: The minimal possible instability after removing one element can be found by considering the next possible max and min after removing each candidate.\n\nBut again, calculating this for each element is O(n) per element, which is O(n^2).\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal instability can be achieved by removing an element that is either the current max or the current min. Because removing any other element may not significantly change the max or min.\n\nBut is that always the case? Let's think.\n\nSuppose the array is [2, 3, 4, 5, 10]. The initial max is 10, min is 2. Instability is 8.\n\nIf I remove 10, the new max is 5, min is 2. Instability is 3.\n\nIf I remove 2, the new min is 3, max is 10. Instability is 7.\n\nSo in this case, removing the max gives a better result.\n\nAnother example: [1, 4, 5, 7, 9]. Initial instability is 8.\n\nRemoving 9 gives instability 6 (max 7, min 1). Removing 1 gives instability 8 (max 9, min 4). So again, removing the max is better.\n\nWhat about a case where neither max nor min gives the optimal solution?\n\nHmm, suppose the array is [1, 2, 5, 6, 10].\n\nInitial instability is 9.\n\nIf I remove 10: new array is [1,2,5,6], max 6, min 1 → instability 5.\n\nIf I remove 1: new array is [2,5,6,10], max 10, min 2 → instability 8.\n\nBut what if I remove 5? New array is [1,2,6,10]. Max is 10, min is 1 → instability 9. Worse than removing 10.\n\nAlternatively, if the array is [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]. Initial instability is 5.\n\nIf I remove 9: new max is 8, min 3 → instability 5.\n\nIf I remove 3: new min is 4, max 9 → instability 5.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm, so in some cases, removing the max or min gives the same minimal instability.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal way is to consider all possible candidates that could be either the max or min, but perhaps in some cases, another element could lead to a better result.\n\nWait, but in the initial example where the array is [1,3,3,7], removing 7 gives a better result than removing 1, 3, or 3.\n\nSo, in that case, the max was the culprit.\n\nWait, but what if the array is [5, 6, 7, 8, 8], then initial instability is 3 (8-5=3). If I remove 8, the new array is [5,6,7,8], max 8, min 5 → instability 3. So same as before.\n\nBut if I remove 5, the new array is [6,7,8,8], max 8, min 6 → instability 2, which is better.\n\nAh! So in this case, removing the min gives a better result.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that sometimes removing the max, sometimes the min, and sometimes neither can yield the best result.\n\nSo, the approach needs to consider all possibilities.\n\nBut how?\n\nIdea: Compute the maximum and minimum, then for each occurrence of the maximum and minimum, compute what happens if that element is removed.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there are other elements that, when removed, could lead to a better result.\n\nWait, but that's too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Precompute the second maximum and second minimum, but that's tricky because they can vary depending on which element is removed.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal instability after removing any element a[i] is equal to (max of the array except a[i]) minus (min of the array except a[i]).\n\nSo, the goal is to find the minimal value of this for all i.\n\nBut computing this for all i is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nThus, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe maximum and minimum of the array can be affected when we remove an element. So, perhaps the best way is to find all possible candidates for the new maximum and new minimum.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's think about what happens when we remove an element:\n\n- The new maximum is either the same as the original maximum (if it occurred multiple times) or the second maximum.\n\n- Similarly, the new minimum is either the same as the original minimum (if it occurred multiple times) or the second minimum.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal instability can be found by considering the following possibilities:\n\n1. Remove an occurrence of the global maximum. Then, the new maximum is the second maximum, and the new minimum remains the original minimum.\n\n2. Remove an occurrence of the global minimum. Then, the new minimum is the second minimum, and the new maximum remains the original maximum.\n\n3. Remove an element which is neither the maximum nor the minimum, but perhaps it's the second maximum or something else.\n\nWait, but considering all possibilities seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability can be achieved in one of the following ways:\n\na) Remove the maximum element. The new instability is (second_max - min).\n\nb) Remove the minimum element. The new instability is (max - second_min).\n\nc) Remove the second_max. Then, the new max is the third_max, and the min remains the same. But this may not be better than a or b.\n\nWait, but this seems like a lot of possibilities.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, we can't compute all of them.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal instability can be found by comparing the scenarios where we remove the maximum, the minimum, and perhaps some other specific elements.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother Idea: The minimal instability after removing one element is at least the initial instability minus twice the difference between that element and the next higher or lower element.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is either:\n\n- The initial instability minus (max_element - second_max) if we remove the max.\n\nOr,\n\n- The initial instability minus (min_element - second_min) if we remove the min.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think with the first sample:\n\nOriginal array: [1,3,3,7]. Max is 7, min is 1.\n\nInstability is 6.\n\nIf we remove 7: new max is 3, min is 1. So instability is 2.\n\nWhich is 6 - (7-3) = 6 -4=2.\n\nSo in this case, it's correct.\n\nIn the second sample: [1, 100000]. Removing 1 gives a single element, so instability is 0. Which is 100000 - 1 is 99999, but removing 1 makes the new max and min 100000, so 0.\n\nAnother example: [3,4,5,7,8,9]. Max is 9, min is 3. If we remove 9, the new max is 8, min is 3. Instability is 5 (8-3). Original instability was 6.\n\nSo 6 - (9-8) =5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: [5,6,7,8,8]. Max is 8, min is5.\n\nIf we remove 5, the new min is 6, max is8. Instability is 2.\n\nWhich is (8-6)=2.\n\nWhich is 8-6=2.\n\nSo, in this case, removing the min gives a better result than removing the max.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to compute:\n\nCompute the initial instability.\n\nThen, compute the second_max and second_min.\n\nThen, calculate four possible options:\n\n1. Remove the max: new_instability = (second_max - min)\n\n2. Remove the min: new_instability = (max - second_min)\n\n3. Compute the third option: removing the second_max. What happens here? The new max is third_max, and the min remains. So new_instability is (third_max - min).\n\nWait, but how often does this happen? It's possible that the second_max is a better candidate than the max or min.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum of the following values:\n\n- (second_max - min)\n\n- (max - second_min)\n\n- (third_max - second_min)\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum of the initial instability minus the maximum of (max - second_max) and (min - second_min).\n\nBut I'm not certain.\n\nAnother Idea: The minimal instability is determined by the maximum and minimum after removing each element. But instead of considering all elements, perhaps the minimal instability can be found by considering the global maximum and minimum, as well as the second maximum and second minimum.\n\nWait, let's think.\n\nCompute all possible candidates for the new max and min when any element is removed.\n\nBut the number of candidates is limited. For example, the new max can be either the original max (if it's present multiple times) or the second_max.\n\nSimilarly, the new min can be the original min (if present multiple times) or the second_min.\n\nSo, the new instability can be one of the following:\n\nCase 1: Remove an occurrence of the original max. Then, the new max is the second_max, and the new min is the original min.\n\nSo, instability is (second_max - min).\n\nCase 2: Remove an occurrence of the original min. Then, new min is the second_min, and new max is original max.\n\nSo, instability is (max - second_min).\n\nCase 3: Remove an occurrence of the second_max. Then, the new max is the third_max, and min remains original min.\n\nSo, instability is (third_max - min).\n\nCase 4: Remove an occurrence of the second_min. Then, the new min is the third_min, and max remains original max.\n\nSo, instability is (max - third_min).\n\nBut wait, this is getting complicated. How many cases do I need to consider?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability can be found by considering the following possibilities:\n\n- The minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n   a) (second_max - min)\n\n   b) (max - second_min)\n\n   c) (second_max - second_min)\n\n   d) (max - min) - some delta.\n\nWait, no. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimal among:\n\n- (second_max - min)\n\n- (max - second_min)\n\n- (second_max - second_min)\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimal of:\n\n- The original instability minus (max - second_max) (i.e., removing the max)\n\n- The original instability minus (min - second_min) (i.e., removing the min)\n\nBut in the first sample:\n\noriginal instability is 6.\n\nmax is 7, second_max is 3. 7-3=4. So 6-4=2, which is correct.\n\nIn the second sample, original instability is 99999. min is 1, second_min is 1 (since there's only two elements). So min - second_min is 0. So 99999-0=99999, which is worse than the correct answer of 0.\n\nWait, so that approach isn't sufficient.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: For each element, the new instability is (max' - min'), where max' is the max of the array excluding that element, and min' is the min of the array excluding that element.\n\nSo, the minimal instability is the minimal of all (max' - min') for each possible element.\n\nBut calculating this for each element is O(n) per element, which is O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nThus, I need a way to compute this without checking each element.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the max' and min' can only change when we remove elements that are the current max or min, perhaps the minimal instability can be found by only considering these elements.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the global max and its count.\n\n2. Find the global min and its count.\n\n3. If the count of max is 1:\n\n   - Removing the max will make the new max the second_max.\n\n   So, the new instability is (second_max - min).\n\n4. Similarly, if the count of min is 1:\n\n   - Removing the min will make the new min the second_min.\n\n   So, the new instability is (max - second_min).\n\n5. Else:\n\n   - Removing a max or min won't change their status. So, the new instability is (max - min) (if we remove a max or min that has duplicates).\n\n6. Additionally, we need to consider if there are other elements that, when removed, could lead to a better result. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n- The original instability.\n\n- (second_max - min) if max can be removed.\n\n- (max - second_min) if min can be removed.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's take the earlier example where the array is [5,6,7,8,8]. Original max is 8, count is 2.\n\nSo, if we remove one 8, the new array's max is still 8, and min is 5. So, the instability remains the same as before.\n\nBut if we remove 5, the new min is 6, and max is 8. So, instability is 2, which is better.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal instability comes from removing the min, not the max.\n\nSo, in this scenario, considering only the max and min isn't sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to compute all four possibilities:\n\n- Remove a max occurrence (if possible)\n\n- Remove a min occurrence (if possible)\n\n- Remove the second_max\n\n- Remove the second_min\n\nAnd then, compute the minimal instability among all these possibilities.\n\nBut again, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, but for n=1e5, we can't process all of these for each possibility.\n\nSo, perhaps we can precompute the second_max and second_min.\n\nWait, how?\n\nTo compute the second_max, we can iterate through the array and find the maximum element that is less than the global max.\n\nSimilarly for the second_min.\n\nOnce we have these, perhaps the possible candidates for the minimal instability are:\n\n- (second_max - min)\n\n- (max - second_min)\n\n- (second_max - second_min)\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimal among:\n\n- (second_max - min)\n\n- (max - second_min)\n\n- (second_max - second_min)\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nTake the first sample:\n\nArray is [1,3,3,7].\n\nglobal_max=7, count=1.\n\nsecond_max=3.\n\nglobal_min=1, count=1.\n\nsecond_min=3.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n(second_max - min) → 3-1=2.\n\n(max - second_min) →7-3=4.\n\n(second_max - second_min) →3-3=0.\n\nBut in reality, the minimal instability is 2.\n\nSo, the minimal among 2,4,0 is 0. But that's not correct. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, the minimal instability comes from removing the max (7), leading to a new array with max 3 and min 1. So the candidate (second_max - min) is 2, which is the correct minimal.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal is the minimal of (second_max - min) and (max - second_min).\n\nIn this case, 2 and 4. So minimal is 2.\n\nAnother example: array [5,6,7,8,8].\n\nglobal_max=8, count=2.\n\nsecond_max=7.\n\nglobal_min=5, count=1.\n\nsecond_min=6.\n\nCandidates:\n\n(second_max - min) →7-5=2.\n\n(max - second_min) →8-6=2.\n\nSo, the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, as removing the min gives 2.\n\nAnother example: array [3,4,5,7,8,9].\n\nglobal_max=9, count=1.\n\nsecond_max=8.\n\nglobal_min=3, count=1.\n\nsecond_min=4.\n\nCandidates:\n\n(second_max - min) →8-3=5.\n\n(max - second_min) →9-4=5.\n\nSo, the minimal is 5.\n\nWhich is correct, as removing the max or min gives 5.\n\nAnother test case: array [5,5,5]. All elements are same.\n\nglobal_max=5, count=3.\n\nsecond_max=5.\n\nglobal_min=5, count=3.\n\nsecond_min=5.\n\nCandidates:\n\n(second_max - min) →5-5=0.\n\n(max - second_min) →5-5=0.\n\nSo, the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [2,1,3].\n\nglobal_max=3, count=1.\n\nsecond_max=2.\n\nglobal_min=1, count=1.\n\nsecond_min=2.\n\nCandidates:\n\n(second_max - min)=2-1=1.\n\n(max - second_min)=3-2=1.\n\nSo, the minimal is 1.\n\nBut what happens if we remove 2?\n\nThe new array is [1,3], so max=3, min=1, instability is 2. Which is worse than 1.\n\nSo, the approach correctly finds that removing the max or min gives better results.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nCompute the second_max and second_min.\n\nThen, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n- (second_max - min)\n\n- (max - second_min)\n\n- The original instability minus (max - second_max) (if the max was removed)\n\nWait, no, that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum between (second_max - min) and (max - second_min).\n\nBecause those are the two possible candidates when we remove either the max or the min.\n\nBut in the first sample, removing the max gives (3-1)=2, which is the correct minimal.\n\nIn the array [5,6,7,8,8], removing the min gives (8-6)=2, which is the correct minimal.\n\nIn the array [3,4,5,7,8,9], removing the max gives (8-3)=5, which is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum between (second_max - min) and (max - second_min).\n\nBut wait, let's think of another example.\n\nSuppose the array is [1,2,4,5,7,8,9].\n\nGlobal_max is 9, count=1.\n\nsecond_max is 8.\n\nglobal_min is 1, count=1.\n\nsecond_min is 2.\n\nSo, (second_max - min) = 8-1=7.\n\n(max - second_min) =9-2=7.\n\nSo, the minimal instability is 7.\n\nBut what if we remove 2, the second_min.\n\nThe new array is [1,4,5,7,8,9], max is9, min is1 → instability is8, which is worse than 7.\n\nSo, the minimal is indeed 7.\n\nAnother example: array [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\n\nGlobal_max=14, count=1.\n\nsecond_max=13.\n\nglobal_min=10, count=1.\n\nsecond_min=11.\n\nCandidates:\n\n13-10=3.\n\n14-11=3.\n\nSo, minimal is 3.\n\nWhich is correct, as removing 14 gives a max of 13, min 10.\n\nAlternatively, removing 10 gives max 14, min 11.\n\nSo, both give 3.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nAnother test case: array [4, 4, 4, 4, 4].\n\nAll elements are 4. So, the initial instability is 0.\n\nRemoving any element gives the same array, so instability remains 0.\n\nSo, the minimal is 0.\n\nIn this case, second_max and second_min are both 4.\n\nSo, (second_max - min) is 0, (max - second_min) is 0. So, minimal is 0.\n\nThus, the approach holds.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the global_max and its count.\n\n2. Compute the global_min and its count.\n\n3. Compute the second_max: the maximum element in the array that is less than the global_max.\n\n4. Compute the second_min: the minimum element in the array that is greater than the global_min.\n\n5. Then, compute two candidates:\n\n   a) (second_max - global_min)\n\n   b) (global_max - second_min)\n\n6. The minimal instability is the minimum between these two candidates.\n\nBut wait, what if the global_max occurs multiple times? For example, in the array [5,5,6], global_max is 6, count=1.\n\nSo, the second_max is 5.\n\nSo, the candidate (5-5) is 0, which is correct.\n\nBut another scenario: [5,5,5,6,6].\n\nglobal_max is 6, count=2.\n\nsecond_max is 5.\n\ncandidate a is 5-5=0.\n\ncandidate b is 6-5=1.\n\nso, minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct, as removing a 6 leaves the array with min 5, max 5.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nBut what if the global_max occurs multiple times, and the second_max is the same as the global_max?\n\nLike [5,5,6,6].\n\nglobal_max is 6, count=2.\n\nsecond_max is 5.\n\ncandidate a is 5-5=0.\n\ncandidate b is 6-5=1.\n\nso minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the approach seems solid.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute the global_max, count of global_max.\n\nCompute the global_min, count of global_min.\n\nCompute second_max (the maximum element less than global_max).\n\nCompute second_min (the minimum element greater than global_min).\n\nThen, compute the two candidates:\n\nc1 = second_max - global_min\n\nc2 = global_max - second_min\n\nThen, the minimal instability is the minimum of these two candidates.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has only two elements?\n\nFor example, [1, 100000].\n\nglobal_max is 100000, count=1.\n\nsecond_max is 1.\n\nglobal_min is 1, count=1.\n\nsecond_min is 100000.\n\nc1 = 1-1=0.\n\nc2=100000-100000=0.\n\nSo, the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: [5,5].\n\nglobal_max is 5, count=2.\n\nsecond_max is 5.\n\nglobal_min is 5, count=2.\n\nsecond_min is 5.\n\nc1=5-5=0.\n\nc2=5-5=0.\n\nSo, minimal is 0.\n\nAnother example: [2,3].\n\nglobal_max is 3, count=1.\n\nsecond_max is 2.\n\nglobal_min is 2, count=1.\n\nsecond_min is 3.\n\nc1=2-2=0.\n\nc2=3-3=0.\n\nSo, minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: [3,2,2].\n\nglobal_max is3, count=1.\n\nsecond_max is 2.\n\nglobal_min is 2, count=2.\n\nsecond_min is 2.\n\nc1=2-2=0.\n\nc2=3-2=1.\n\nso, minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the approach seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, now the plan is:\n\n- Compute the global_max and its count.\n\n- Compute the global_min and its count.\n\n- Compute second_max: the maximum value less than global_max.\n\n- Compute second_min: the minimum value greater than global_min.\n\nThen, compute the two candidates:\n\nc1 = second_max - global_min.\n\nc2 = global_max - second_min.\n\nThe minimal instability is the minimal of c1 and c2.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no second_max or second_min? Like when all elements are the same.\n\nIn that case, second_max is global_max, but since all are same, so second_max is same as global_max.\n\nWait, but in the code, when computing second_max, it should be the maximum value less than global_max. If all elements are same, then the maximum less than global_max is None, but in reality, when all elements are same, the second_max is same as global_max.\n\nWait, perhaps in that case, the second_max is same as global_max.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIn code, how to compute second_max.\n\nAn approach is:\n\nInitialize second_max to -infinity.\n\nIterate through all elements:\n\n   if a[i] < global_max:\n\n       if a[i] > second_max:\n\n           second_max = a[i]\n\nIf after processing all elements, second_max is not updated (i.e., all elements are global_max), then second_max is global_max.\n\nSimilarly for second_min:\n\nInitialize second_min to +infinity.\n\nIterate through all elements:\n\n   if a[i] > global_min:\n\n       if a[i] < second_min:\n\n           second_min = a[i]\n\nIf after processing, second_min is not updated, then set second_min to global_min.\n\nSo, in the case of all elements being same, the second_max is same as global_max, and second_min is same as global_min.\n\nThus, c1 and c2 become (global_max - global_min) and (global_max - global_min), which is same as the original instability.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the algorithm is as follows.\n\nNow, the steps to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and the array.\n\nCompute global_max and count.\n\nCompute global_min and count.\n\nCompute second_max.\n\nCompute second_min.\n\nCompute c1 = second_max - global_min.\n\nCompute c2 = global_max - second_min.\n\nCompute the minimal of c1 and c2.\n\nOutput that.\n\nBut wait, is this correct in all cases?\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].\n\nglobal_max=10, count=1.\n\nsecond_max=9.\n\nglobal_min=1, count=1.\n\nsecond_min=2.\n\nc1=9-1=8.\n\nc2=10-2=8.\n\nSo, minimal is 8.\n\nWhich is correct, as removing 10 gives 9-1=8.\n\nRemoving 1 gives 10-2=8.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10].\n\nglobal_max=10, count=6.\n\nsecond_max=10.\n\nglobal_min=10, count=6.\n\nsecond_min=10.\n\nc1=10-10=0.\n\nc2=10-10=0.\n\nThus, minimal is 0.\n\nCorrect.\n\nThus, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array as list of integers.\n\nCompute global_max = max(a).\n\ncount_max = a.count(global_max).\n\nCompute global_min = min(a).\n\ncount_min = a.count(global_min).\n\nCompute second_max:\n\nInitialize to -infinity.\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num < global_max:\n\n        if num > second_max:\n\n            second_max = num\n\nif second_max is not updated (all elements are global_max):\n\n    second_max = global_max\n\nCompute second_min similarly:\n\nInitialize to +infinity.\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num > global_min:\n\n        if num < second_min:\n\n            second_min = num\n\nif second_min is not updated:\n\n    second_min = global_min\n\nCompute c1 = second_max - global_min.\n\nCompute c2 = global_max - second_min.\n\nminimal = min(c1, c2).\n\nprint(minimal).\n\nWait, but in the case where all elements are same, second_max is global_max, second_min is global_min.\n\nThus, c1 = global_max - global_min.\n\nBut when all elements are same, the initial instability is 0, and removing any element leaves the array with same instability 0.\n\nThus, the code correctly returns 0.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2.\n\narray = [5,5]\n\nglobal_max=5, count=2.\n\nsecond_max=5.\n\nglobal_min=5, count=2.\n\nsecond_min=5.\n\nc1=5-5=0.\n\nc2=5-5=0.\n\nminimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, array [5,6].\n\nglobal_max=6, count=1.\n\nsecond_max=5.\n\nglobal_min=5, count=1.\n\nsecond_min=6.\n\nc1=5-5=0.\n\nc2=6-6=0.\n\nThus, minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [5,6,6].\n\nglobal_max=6, count=2.\n\nsecond_max=5.\n\nglobal_min=5, count=1.\n\nsecond_min=6.\n\nc1=5-5=0.\n\nc2=6-6=0.\n\nThus, minimal is 0.\n\nBut what's the actual result? If I remove 6, the array is [5,6], instability is 0.\n\nIf I remove 5, the array is [6,6], instability is 0.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: First, determine the global maximum and minimum values of the array. These values are crucial because removing them can potentially reduce the instability.\n2. **Compute Second Max and Min**: Calculate the second highest value (second_max) and the second lowest value (second_min) in the array. These values help us understand what the new maximum or minimum would be if the global max or min is removed.\n3. **Evaluate Candidates**: Compute two potential candidates for the minimal instability:\n   - If we remove the global maximum, the new maximum would be the second_max, and the minimum remains the same.\n   - If we remove the global minimum, the new minimum would be the second_min, and the maximum remains the same.\n4. **Determine Minimum Instability**: The minimum instability will be the lesser of the two candidates calculated above.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal element to remove without having to check each element individually, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nglobal_max = max(a)\ncount_max = a.count(global_max)\n\nglobal_min = min(a)\ncount_min = a.count(global_min)\n\n# Compute second_max\nsecond_max = -float('inf')\nfor num in a:\n    if num < global_max:\n        if num > second_max:\n            second_max = num\nif second_max == -float('inf'):\n    second_max = global_max\n\n# Compute second_min\nsecond_min = float('inf')\nfor num in a:\n    if num > global_min:\n        if num < second_min:\n            second_min = num\nif second_min == float('inf'):\n    second_min = global_min\n\nc1 = second_max - global_min\nc2 = global_max - second_min\n\nprint(min(c1, c2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values, including the size of the array and the array elements.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only one element, the instability is zero, and we print this immediately.\n3. **Finding Global Max and Min**: The global maximum and minimum values are found using Python's built-in functions.\n4. **Second Max and Min Calculation**: By iterating through the array, we determine the second highest and lowest values that are less than or greater than the global max and min, respectively.\n5. **Candidates Calculation**: We compute two candidates for the instability by considering the removal of the global max and min.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The minimum of these two candidates is printed as the result, giving us the minimal possible instability after removing one element.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem with a time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
