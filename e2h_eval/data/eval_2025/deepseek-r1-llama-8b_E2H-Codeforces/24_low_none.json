She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has n tabs open in her browser. The tabs are numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right within the currently open tabs, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to model what actions she can take and figure out the optimal sequence to minimize time.\n\nLet me think about the steps she needs to take. There are a few possibilities here.\n\nFirst, she might need to move the cursor to certain positions to close the necessary tabs. For example, if there are tabs to the left of l or right of r, she needs to close those.\n\nWait, no. Wait, she needs to leave exactly [l, r] open. So any tabs not in this range must be closed. So that includes any tabs to the left of l and any tabs to the right of r.\n\nSo, for instance, if l=2 and r=4, then she needs to close tabs 1 (if present) and tabs 5,6,...n (if any).\n\nSo, how do we approach this?\n\nI think the key is to determine whether she needs to close tabs on the left, the right, both, or neither. Then, for each case, calculate the minimal steps needed.\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\nCase 1: No tabs to close. That is, when l=1 and r=n. Then she doesn't need to do anything. So output 0.\n\nCase 2: Only left tabs need to be closed. So l>1, and r=n. So she needs to close all tabs before l.\n\nIn this case, she can move the cursor to l, then close left. But wait, maybe she can just close left immediately if she's already at l? Or perhaps she needs to move to l first.\n\nWait, the initial position is pos. So if she needs to close left, she must get the cursor to some position where closing left will remove all the unwanted tabs.\n\nSimilarly for the right.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps.\n\nShe needs to close all tabs left of l and all tabs right of r.\n\nTo close the left part:\n\n- She must be at a position i such that after closing, all tabs <i are closed. So i can be l, because closing left of l would remove everything before l.\n\nSimilarly, to close the right part, she must be at r, and close right.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Move to l (if needed), then close left.\n2. Move to r (if needed), then close right.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to close one side first, then the other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order doesn't matter as long as she covers both.\n\nWait, but moving between the two could add time.\n\nSo the steps involve:\n\n- Moving to the left closure point.\n- Closing the left.\n- Moving to the right closure point.\n- Closing the right.\n\nOr vice versa.\n\nAlso, sometimes, the initial position is already at l or r, so she doesn't need to move.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nCalculate the steps required to close the left side, then the steps to close the right side, considering the minimal path.\n\nBut also, sometimes you can combine movements.\n\nWait, perhaps she can move towards the closure points while handling one side, which could save steps.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given in the problem statement.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nSo n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\nThe optimal steps are:\n\n1. Move to 2 (from 3: one step left).\n2. Close left (tabs 1 are closed). This takes 1 sec.\n3. Then, she's at 2. Now, she needs to move to 4 to close the right. So from 2 to 4: two steps right.\n4. Close right (tabs 5 and 6 are closed). Total steps: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close) + 2 (move to 4) + 1 (close) = 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: input 6 3 1 3.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 4,5,6.\n\nShe starts at 3. She can close the right directly, because the current position is 3. Closing right would close 4,5,6. So that's one step: move to 3, close right. So total steps: 1 (just close right).\n\nThird example",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given position in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal steps to move the cursor and close the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need to Close Tabs**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` or to the right of `r` that need to be closed. If there are no such tabs, Luba doesn't need to do anything, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Calculate Movements and Closures**:\n   - **Close Left Side**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, calculate the steps required to move the cursor to `l` and then close the left tabs.\n   - **Close Right Side**: Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of `r`, calculate the steps required to move the cursor to `r` and then close the right tabs.\n3. **Optimize Movement Path**: Consider the optimal path for moving between the points where the left and right closures need to happen, minimizing the total number of steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If no tabs to close, output 0\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# Calculate steps for left closure\nleft_close = 0\nif l > 1:\n    # Steps to move from pos to l, then close left\n    steps_to_l = abs(pos - l)\n    left_close = steps_to_l + 1\n\n# Calculate steps for right closure\nright_close = 0\nif r < n:\n    # Steps to move from pos to r, then close right\n    steps_to_r = abs(pos - r)\n    right_close = steps_to_r + 1\n\ntotal = left_close + right_close\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **No Tabs to Close**: If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, all tabs are within the desired range, so no action is needed.\n- **Closing Left Tabs**: If `l > 1`, calculate the steps to move from the current position to `l` and then close the left tabs.\n- **Closing Right Tabs**: If `r < n`, calculate the steps to move from the current position to `r` and then close the right tabs.\n- **Total Steps**: Sum the steps required for both left and right closures to get the minimum number of seconds needed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps required by considering each necessary movement and closure separately and combining them optimally.",
