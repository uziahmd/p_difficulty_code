There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in.\n\nHmm, let me think about how the tournament structure affects this. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So for n players, there are n-1 games in total. But the order of these games matters because the winner's path depends on the matchups.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of games the winner can play isn't necessarily n-1. Because the structure of the bracket could limit that. For example, in a 3-player tournament, the winner plays two games: first against someone, then against the next. But wait, no—because with 3 players, there are two rounds. So the winner must play two games.\n\nBut in the sample input, when n=4, the output is 2. So the maximum is 2 games, not 3. Oh right, because after the initial two wins, the final would be the third game. Wait, no—wait, n=4 has 3 games total, but the winner can only play 2? Or am I misunderstanding the sample?\n\nWait the sample says n=10 gives output 4. So what's happening here.\n\nLet me try to model this. The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by how many layers of matches they can go through while respecting the rule that each new opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less than the winner.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the longest possible sequence of games where each step adds an opponent who has either played the same number of games as the winner or one less.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as building a Fibonacci-like sequence. Because each time the winner plays a new game, their number of games increases by one, and their next opponent must have played either k-1 or k games.\n\nAlternatively, think of the maximum number of games as the maximum possible value such that there exists a way to arrange the tournament where the winner plays exactly that many games, and each new game meets the condition.\n\nI remember that this kind of problem is similar to the \"maximum number of stones collected\" type, which often involves dynamic programming or mathematical patterns.\n\nLet me consider the problem recursively. Let's denote f(k) as the maximum number of games a winner can play if they have k opponents left to face.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m such that the (m+1)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, because each step requires that the next game's opponent could have been part of a chain that allows the maximum growth. So the maximum games form a Fibonacci-like progression.\n\nFor example, for m=1, you need 2 players (n=2). For m=2, you need 3 players (since 2+1=3). For m=3, you need 4 + 2 = 6. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, let's think in terms of the minimal number of players required for the winner to play m games.\n\nTo play m games, the winner must have beaten m opponents. Each of those opponents must have played either m-1 or m-2 games before facing the winner.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal n is the sum of the first m+1 Fibonacci numbers or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play m games is Fib(m+2). Because each new game branches off into requiring more players.\n\nWait, let me test this with some examples.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2 → Output 1. Fib(3)=2, which matches.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3 → Output 2. Fib(4)=3, which matches.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4 → Output 2. Fib(4)=3 <4, but the output is 2. Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc.\n\nWait, for m=3: the minimal n would be Fib(5) = 5. Because to have a maximum of 3 games, the winner needs to have beaten 3 opponents, each of whom had to have played 2 or 1 games before. So the structure would be like a binary tree, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n required for m games is Fib(m+2). Let's see:\n\nFor m=1, Fib(3)=2 → correct.\nm=2, Fib(4)=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in. The tournament follows a specific rule where two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the structure of the tournament must follow a Fibonacci-like sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires that their opponent has either played the same number of games or one fewer game. This leads us to model the problem using Fibonacci numbers to determine the minimal number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number such that the sum of the first `m` Fibonacci numbers (where `m` is the number of games) is less than or equal to `n` (the total number of players).\n\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: We compute the Fibonacci sequence iteratively until we find the largest number of games `m` for which the corresponding Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n3. **Determine the Result**: The result is the largest `m` such that the Fibonacci number at position `m+2` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_val)\n    m = len(fib) - 2\n    if m == 0:\n        return 0\n    for i in range(len(fib)-1, 0, -1):\n        if fib[i] <= n:\n            return i-1\n    return 0\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Initialization**: We start with the first two Fibonacci numbers, both set to 1.\n2. **Iterative Calculation Loop**: We generate subsequent Fibonacci numbers until the next value exceeds `n`.\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: The length of the Fibonacci list minus 2 gives the maximum number of games the winner can play. If the loop breaks without finding a valid Fibonacci number, we return 0, though this case should not occur given the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum number of games using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring an optimal and correct solution.",
