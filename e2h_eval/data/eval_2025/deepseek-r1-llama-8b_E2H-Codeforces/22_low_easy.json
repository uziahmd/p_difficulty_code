After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine the number of successful students in a group. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, each student has marks for m subjects. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best in that subject. Being the best means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to find which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the max in any of the subjects.\n\nWait, right. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read all the input data.\n2. For each subject, determine which student has the highest mark.\n3. For each student, count how many subjects they are the best in. If it's at least 1, they are successful.\n4. Sum up all such students.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, the input is n and m. Then n lines, each line has m characters representing the marks. For example, the first sample input has 3 students and 3 subjects. The first student's marks are '223', meaning subject 1: 2, subject 2:2, subject3:3.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1-9. So for a student, their marks are each character in the string. So for a line like '223', the student's marks are [2,2,3] for the three subjects.\n\nNow, for each subject j (from 0 to m-1), I need to track what the maximum mark is, and which student(s) have that mark.\n\nWait, but each subject is independent. So for each subject, I can find the maximum mark among all students, and then note which students have that maximum.\n\nThen, for each student, check if they are the top in at least one subject.\n\nSo how do I represent this?\n\nMaybe create a list for each subject, storing the maximum mark and the list of students who achieved it.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, iterate through all students and find the max, then collect all students with that max.\n\nBut since m can be up to 100, and n up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n strings, each of length m. Let's store them as a list of strings, say 'students_marks'.\n\nFor each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n    Find the maximum mark in that subject across all students.\n    Collect all students who have this maximum in subject j.\n\nOnce I have, for each subject, the set of students who are the best in that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, check if they are present in any of the subject's best sets. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each subject, find the max mark and the students who have it.\n- For each student, see if they are in any of these sets.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent each student as a list of their marks. For example, students_marks[i] is a string, and we can convert it into a list of integers or keep it as strings because comparing characters directly works.\n\nWait, because the marks are digits, comparing the characters as strings should work since '9' > '8' etc. But maybe converting to integers is more readable.\n\nYes, perhaps better to convert each student's marks into a list of integers.\n\nSo:\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nThen, for each subject j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_mark = -1\nbest_students = []\n\nfor each student in students:\n    if student[j] > max_mark:\n        max_mark = student[j]\n        best_students = [student index]\n    elif student[j] == max_mark:\n        best_students.append(student index)\n\nWait, but wait. That won't capture all students with the same max. Because suppose two students have the same max, but only the first one was processed.\n\nWait no. Let's see.\n\nSuppose for subject j, the max is 5.\n\nStudent A has 5, student B has 5.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nA is processed: max becomes 5, best_students is [A's index].\n\nB is processed: since B[j] is equal to max, add B's index to best_students.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each subject, after processing all students, best_students will contain all students who have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nSo now, for each subject j, we have a list of student indices who are the best in j.\n\nThen, for each student i, if i is present in any of the best_students",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the number of students and subjects, followed by the gradebook data.\n2. **Convert Grades:** Convert each student's grades from strings to integers for easier comparison.\n3. **Track Best Performers:** For each subject, identify the maximum mark and collect all students who achieved this maximum mark.\n4. **Determine Success:** Check each student to see if they are among the top performers in any subject. If they are, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_in_subject = [[] for _ in range(m)]\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = students[i][j]\n            best_in_subject[j] = [i]\n        elif students[i][j] == max_mark:\n            best_in_subject[j].append(i)\n\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    is_successful = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if i in best_in_subject[j]:\n            is_successful = True\n            break\n    if is_successful:\n        successful += 1\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The first line contains `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line represents a student's grades across `m` subjects.\n2. **Grade Conversion:** Convert each student's grades into integers to facilitate numerical comparisons.\n3. **Finding Top Performers:** For each subject, iterate through all students to find the maximum mark and record which students achieved this mark.\n4. **Checking Success:** For each student, check if they are in the list of top performers for any subject. If they are, increment the count of successful students.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the number of successful students by leveraging nested loops and list operations, ensuring that we handle up to the maximum constraints effectively.",
