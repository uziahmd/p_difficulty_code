The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and also clockwise. So, moving from house i can only go to i+1 (mod n, but since it's a ring, it wraps around after n). \n\nXenia starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be in ai by the time she completes all tasks before i. Wait, no—the description says she needs to be in ai for the i-th task and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that part. Oh right, because the tasks are given in order, so for the first task, she just needs to be at a1. For the second, she must be at a2 after finishing the first task and before the second. And so on. So, the sequence of positions is determined by the sorted order of the tasks.\n\nWait, but the tasks could be in any order. So the correct approach is to sort the list of tasks and then process them in increasing order of their indices. Because, for example, if the first task is at 3, then the second is at 2, she can't do that because she can't go back. So, processing in order of the earliest required position.\n\nSo, the initial step is to sort the list of a_i in non-decreasing order. Then, for each position in this sorted list, we calculate the minimal distance she needs to move from the current position to the next required position, considering that the ring is circular.\n\nWait, but what about when she has to return to the starting point after some steps? Like, in the first example: [3,2,3], sorted becomes [2,3,3]. She starts at 1. She goes to 2 (distance 1), then to 3 (distance 1, total 2), then to 3 again—wait, no, because the third task is also at 3. So she doesn't need to move, but perhaps she does because there might be more tasks later. Or wait, no—each task must be completed in order, but consecutive same positions don't require movement. But the way the problem is set up, she has to process each task in the order they come, but after sorting, the earliest comes first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the process as follows:\n\nAfter sorting the a array, the first element is the earliest she needs to be at. So she starts at 1. For each subsequent a_i, she needs to move from the previous position to a_i, which may involve going clockwise around the ring.\n\nEach step is moving from the current position to the next required a_i. The minimal time is the sum of these steps.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two points on the ring?\n\nFor two points x and y, the clockwise distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n if y >= x. Otherwise, it's (y + n - x). Alternatively, the minimal distance is min( (y -x) % n, (x - y) %n ). But since the ring is one-way and she can only move clockwise, the direction is fixed. So the distance from x to y is (y - x) if y >= x, else (y + n - x). Because she can't go counterclockwise.\n\nWait, but in the ring, moving clockwise is the only allowed direction. So, to get from x to y, the path is x → x+1 → ... → y. So the distance is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y + n -x).\n\nSo, for each consecutive pair in the sorted a's, we compute the distance between them and add to the total time.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is 1. So the first a_i is the first position she needs to reach. So the distance from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 -1) if a_1 >=1, else (a_1 +n -1). But since a_1 is between 1 and n, a_1 -1 is always correct.\n\nThen, for each next a_i, the distance is (a_i - prev_a_i) mod n, but since we're moving in a single direction, it's (a_i - prev_a_i) if a_i >= prev_a_i, else (a_i + n - prev_a_i).\n\nWait, but the sorted a array may have duplicates. For example, in the first sample input, the sorted a is [2,3,3]. So the steps are from 1→2 (distance 1), 2→3 (distance 1), 3→3 (distance 0). So total",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she can only move clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task requires her to be at a specific house in the order they are given.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Tasks**: The first step is to sort the list of tasks in non-decreasing order based on their house numbers. This ensures that we process each task in the correct order.\n2. **Calculate Distances**: Starting from house 1, we compute the distance to each subsequent task location. Since the ring is circular, moving clockwise from any house `x` to house `y` takes `(y - x) % n` units of time if `y >= x`, otherwise it takes `(y + n - x)` units of time.\n3. **Sum the Distances**: Sum up all the individual distances calculated in the previous step to get the total minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\ntotal_time = 0\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\nfor ai in a:\n    if ai > current_pos:\n        total_time += (ai - current_pos)\n    else:\n        total_time += (ai + n - current_pos)\n    current_pos = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Tasks**: By sorting the tasks, we ensure that we handle each task in the order they need to be completed, starting from the earliest required position.\n- **Distance Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of positions, we calculate the minimal clockwise distance, considering the circular nature of the ring.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently processes each task in O(m log m) time due to the sorting step, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimal time required for Xenia to complete all her tasks while adhering to the constraints of the ring road.",
