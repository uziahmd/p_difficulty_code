Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options, any will do. The output should be the three vertices v1, v2, v3.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to understand how to compute the possible angles that can be formed by selecting three vertices in a regular polygon.\n\nWait, in a regular polygon, all sides and angles are equal. So each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So for any three points, the angles depend on their positions.\n\nLet me think: For a regular n-gon, the central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So the possible angles that can be formed when selecting three points probably relate to these steps.\n\nFor example, in a triangle (n=3), each angle is 60 degrees, so any triplet is valid.\n\nIn a square (n=4), the possible angles are 90 degrees when the points are adjacent, but also 45 degrees when they are two apart? Wait no, maybe not. Or perhaps other configurations.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that in the sample where n=4 and a=67, the optimal angle is 45 degrees because |67-45|=22 < |67-90|=23. So how do you get 45 degrees?\n\nHmm, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon. Like, if v2 is fixed, then the angle depends on how many edges are between v1 and v3 in either direction.\n\nSo for a square, let's say v2 is vertex 1. Then the possible v1 and v3 can be:\n\n- v1=2, v3=3: then the points form an angle of 90 degrees.\nWait, no, wait: the angle inside the polygon would be 90 degrees. But the sample says that sometimes 45 degrees is possible. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle can be computed based on the arcs between the points. Like, for three points A, B, C arranged around the circle, the angle at B could be half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't contain B.\n\nWait, yes! Because in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So the angle at B is equal to half the measure of the arc from A to C, not passing through B.\n\nSo for a regular polygon, each side corresponds to a central angle of 2π/n radians or 360/n degrees. So the arc length between two vertices is k*(360/n) degrees, where k is the number of steps between them along the shorter path.\n\nWait, but for three points, the angle at B is half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't include B. So for a regular polygon, the angle can be calculated as (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of steps between A and C, but not counting the steps that go through B.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Let's think with examples.\n\nTake a square (n=4). The possible step counts between two points are 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is the same as 1 in the opposite direction). So for the angle at B, the arc AC is the one not containing B. So for example, if A is one step before B and C is two steps after B, then the arc AC not containing B is 3 steps (since the other way is 1 step). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at B is determined by the minimal step count between A and C. Let me see:\n\nIn a square, if B is at position 2, A is at 1, and C is at 4 (adjacent in the other direction), then the arc AC not containing B is from 1 to 4, which is 3 steps. So the angle is (3 * 360/4) / 2 = 135/2 = 67.5 degrees. Hmm, but that's not matching the sample.\n\nWait, the sample input for n=4 and a=67, the output is 45 degrees. So perhaps my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the angle is determined by the number of steps between A and C when moving in the direction that doesn't include B. So for example, if B is at 2, and A is 1, C is 3: then the arc from A to C is 2 steps (1 to 2 is one step, 2 to 3 is another). So the angle is (2 * 90)/2 = 90 degrees. But the sample shows 45 degrees being better.\n\nWait, maybe",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and calculating the possible angles efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular polygon, each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is `360/n` degrees. The angle at a vertex can be determined by the number of steps (edges) between the other two vertices.\n2. **Inscribed Angle Calculation**: The angle at vertex v2 can be calculated using the inscribed angle theorem, which states that the angle is half the measure of the arc intercepted by the points v1 and v3.\n3. **Possible Angles**: For each vertex v2, calculate the possible angles by considering different step counts between v1 and v3. These step counts determine the arcs and thus the angles.\n4. **Optimal Solution**: Iterate through all possible configurations to find the one that minimizes the absolute difference between the computed angle and the target 'a'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef compute_angle(v2, k):\n    # Calculate the angle for vertex v2 with v1 and v3 being k steps apart\n    step = 360 * k // n\n    return step // 2\n\ndef find_best(n, a):\n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_v = None\n    for v2 in range(1, n+1):\n        for k in range(1, (n//2)+1):\n            angle = compute_angle(v2, k)\n            current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n            if current_diff < best_diff or (current_diff == best_diff and angle < best_angle):\n                best_diff = current_diff\n                best_v = (v2, v1, v3)\n                best_angle = angle\n            # Check the same angle but with the other direction\n            angle_other = compute_angle(v2, n - k)\n            current_diff_other = abs(angle_other - a)\n            if current_diff_other < best_diff or (current_diff_other == best_diff and angle_other < best_angle):\n                best_diff = current_diff_other\n                best_v = (v2, v1, v3)\n                best_angle = angle_other\n    return best_v\n\n# Since the polygon is regular, we can fix v2 and try different k steps\n# Let's try all possible v2 and find the best angle\nbest_vertices = []\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    for k in range(1, (n//2)+1):\n        angle = (k * 360) // n // 2\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff == 0:\n            # Found exact match\n            best_vertices.append(f\"{v2} {v1} {v3}\")\n            break\n        else:\n            # Check the other direction\n            angle_other = ((n - k) * 360) // n // 2\n            diff_other = abs(angle_other - a)\n            if diff_other < diff:\n                best_vertices.append(f\"{v2} {v2 - k} {v2 + k}\")\n            elif diff_other == diff:\n                # Choose the one with smaller angle\n                if angle_other < angle:\n                    best_vertices.append(f\"{v2} {v2 - k} {v2 + k}\")\n    else:\n        continue\n    break\n\n# If not found yet, look for the minimal difference\nif not best_vertices:\n    # Try all possible k and find the best\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    result = None\n    for v2 in range(1, n+1):\n        for k in range(1, (n//2)+1):\n            angle = (k * 360) // n // 2\n            current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n            if current_diff < min_diff or (current_diff == min_diff and angle < best_angle):\n                min_diff = current_diff\n                result = (v2, (v2 - k) % n, (v2 + k) % n)\n                best_angle = angle\n            angle_other = ((n - k) * 360) // n // 2\n            current_diff_other = abs(angle_other - a)\n            if current_diff_other < min_diff or (current_diff_other == min_diff and angle_other < best_angle):\n                min_diff = current_diff_other\n                result = (v2, (v2 - k) % n, (v2 + k) % n)\n                best_angle = angle_other\n    v1, v2_res, v3 = result\n    v1 += 1  # Adjusting to 1-based index\n    v3 += 1\n    best_vertices.append(f\"{v1} {v2_res} {v3}\")\n\nprint(best_vertices[0])\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code iterates through each vertex as the potential vertex v2.
