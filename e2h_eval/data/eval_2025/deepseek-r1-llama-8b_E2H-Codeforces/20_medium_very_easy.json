For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for every binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me try to understand what a beautiful multiset is. So, a beautiful multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n. For each string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And we need to find the number of ways to choose all c_s such that the maximum size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So, the problem is asking for the number of c_s assignments where when you build the largest possible beautiful multiset based on these c_s's, its size is exactly f.\n\nI think the first step is to model the problem in terms of constraints on the c_s's and how they contribute to the maximum possible size of the multiset.\n\nLet me think about the structure. For each binary string s, the c_s represents an upper bound on how many times s can be a prefix of the strings in the multiset. But the multiset is built by choosing any number of strings of length exactly n, and for each s, count how many of those strings have s as a prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a trie structure. Each node in the trie corresponds to a prefix s. The children are the extensions of s. For example, \"0\" has children \"00\", \"01\", etc. The leaves are the strings of length n.\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset would then be determined by the sum over all nodes s of the minimum between c_s and the product of the counts of their children. Or wait, maybe it's more complex than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum over all possible prefixes s of min(c_s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix). But that doesn't directly help.\n\nWait, no. For each string t in the multiset of length n, it contributes +1 to all its prefixes s. So the total count for s is the number of such t's that start with s. Then, for each s, the count must be <= c_s. So the problem is to assign c_s's such that the sum of min(c_s, the number of t's in the multiset that have s as a prefix) is maximized, but the maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut we need to find the number of c assignments where the maximum possible size is exactly f.\n\nSo, the approach might involve considering the constraints on the c_s's such that the maximum beautiful multiset size is f, and then count the number of valid c assignments.\n\nHmm. To model this, perhaps we can model the problem as a tree where each node represents a binary string s. For each node s, the c_s must be at least the sum of the counts of its children, because each child is a longer string that starts with s. Because the count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix, which includes all the strings in the multiset that are in s's subtree.\n\nWait, no. Because for s, the count is the number of t's that start with s. So for s, the count is the sum of the counts of all its immediate children plus the count of s itself if it's included. Wait, no. Because s is a string of length less than n, but the multiset contains only strings of length n. So s is a proper prefix of any string t in the multiset.\n\nWait, actually, the strings in the multiset are of length n. So for any s of length l < n, the count for s is the number of strings t in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So for s, its count is the sum of the counts of all its children in the trie. Because each child of s is a string that starts with s, and thus contributes to s's count.\n\nWait, no. Because each t is a string of length n. For each t, it will contribute 1 to all of its prefixes s. So the count for s is the number of t's in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So for each s, the count is the sum of the counts of all its descendants (including itself if it's present, but since t's are of length n, s can't be in the multiset unless l = n). Oh right, because the multiset contains strings of length exactly n. So s is a prefix of t, and s is of length l ≤ n.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify: the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. So for a string s of length l, the count for s is the number of t's in the multiset where s is a prefix of t. Since t is length n, s must be a prefix of t. So for example, if s is \"0\", then all t's that start with \"0\" will contribute to s's count. Similarly, for s=\"00\", only t's that start with \"00\" contribute.\n\nSo the count for s is the sum of the counts of all its children in the trie.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for each node s in the trie, the count is the sum of the counts of its children. Because each child represents a longer string that starts with s, and thus contributes to s's count.\n\nTherefore, the count for s is equal to the number of t's in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So, for each s, the count is the sum of the counts of its children.\n\nWait, but that's recursive. Because for the children of s, their counts are also sums of their own children.\n\nSo, the count for s is the sum of the counts of all its children. So for example, for s being \"0\", the count is the sum of the counts of \"00\", \"01\", etc., up to the leaves (which are of length n).\n\nThis suggests that the count for s is the number of t's in the multiset that have s as a prefix. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the condition for the multiset to be beautiful is that for every s, the count of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWe need to assign c_s's such that the maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f.\n\nWait, but the maximum size is achieved by choosing the maximum possible counts for each s, given the c_s constraints. So the maximum size is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the maximum possible count for s under the constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because the counts are determined by the choices made for the children. So the maximum possible size is the sum of min(c_s, the number of possible t's that can have s as a prefix given the constraints). But I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of the c_s's, but subject to the constraints that for each s, the count for s is the sum of the counts of its children, and each count is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Maybe it's better to model the problem in terms of the constraints on the c_s's. For the maximum size, the counts are as large as possible, but subject to the constraints.\n\nSo, the maximum size is determined by the c_s's, and we want to find the number of c_s assignments where this maximum size is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So, the problem reduces to:\n\n- For each binary string s of length 1..n, assign c_s ∈ {0,1,...,k}.\n\n- We need to count the number of such assignments where the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nWait, but how do we model the maximum possible size? It seems that the maximum size depends on the c_s's in a way that's not straightforward.\n\nMaybe it's better to model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node represents a binary string s. The edges represent the inclusion of s as a prefix of another string.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem using dynamic programming on the trie structure, considering each node and the constraints imposed by the c_s's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size can be represented as the sum over all s of the minimal possible value of c_s minus something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the maximum size is determined by the c_s's in a way that for each s, the count is as large as possible without exceeding c_s, and the count is the sum of the counts of its children.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size can be computed recursively. For each s, the count is min(c_s, sum of the counts of its children). But no, because the count for s is the sum of the counts of its children, which themselves are constrained by their c values.\n\nSo, the maximum size is the sum over all s of the count for s, which is the sum of the counts of its children. And each count is the sum of its own children's counts, which are bounded by their c's.\n\nWait, that suggests that the maximum size is the sum of the c_s's, but adjusted for the hierarchy of the trie.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is equal to the sum of the c_s's, but with certain dependencies. For example, for a parent node s, its c_s must be at least the sum of the counts of its children. Because the count of s is the sum of the counts of its children, which cannot exceed c_s. So, for each s, c_s must be ≥ the sum of the counts of its children. Wait, no—because the count of s is the sum of the counts of its children, which are themselves ≤ c_{child}. So the count of s is the sum of the children's counts, which could be anything up to the sum of c_child. But the count of s must be ≤ c_s. So for each s, c_s must be ≥ the sum of the counts of its children.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the count for s is the sum of the counts of its children. So for s to have count ≤ c_s, we must have sum of children's counts ≤ c_s.\n\nBut in order to maximize the total size, for each s, the count is as large as possible given the c's. So, for each s, the count is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the children's counts.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the children's counts is dependent on their own c's. So the count for s is the sum of the children's counts, which may or may not be limited by c_s.\n\nSo, the count for s is min(c_s, sum of children's counts). But wait, no. Because the children's counts are determined by their own c's and their children's counts. So it's a recursive situation.\n\nThis seems tricky. Perhaps there's a way to model this with inclusion-exclusion or combinatorial methods.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the problem by considering that the maximum size is equal to the sum of the c_s's, but for each s, the c_s must be at least the sum of the counts of its children. But again, this is recursive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size can be represented as the sum of the c_s's, but with the condition that for each s, c_s is at least the sum of the c_t for all t that are direct children of s.\n\nWait, that might make sense because the count for s is the sum of the counts of its children. If we set c_s as the sum of the c_t's of its children, then the count for s would be exactly that sum. But if c_s is larger than that sum, then the count for s would be the sum of the children's counts, but c_s is not limiting. So to maximize the total size, we would set c_s to exactly the sum of the children's counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of the c_s's, but each c_s is at least the sum of the c_t's of its children.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting. Because for s, the count is the sum of the children's counts. So the count is sum of children's counts, which is ≤ c_s. To maximize the total, we want to set c_s as large as possible, but the count for s is limited by the sum of children's counts.\n\nHmm. Maybe the maximum size is the sum of the c_s's, but each c_s must be at least the sum of the c_t's for t in the children of s.\n\nWait, no. Because the count for s is the sum of the children's counts, which is independent of c_s beyond that constraint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of the c_s's, but for each s, c_s must be ≥ the sum of the c_t's for its children. Because the count for s is the sum of the children's counts, which can't exceed c_s.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So for each s, c_s ≥ sum of c_t for t in children(s). Because the count for s is sum of c_t for t in children(s), and that must be ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but the count for s is sum of the children's counts, which themselves depend on their own c_t's. So the sum of children's counts is the sum of min(c_t, ...). But in the maximum case, each c_t is set to the maximum possible, which would allow the sum of children's counts to be as large as possible.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe we need to model this as a system of inequalities.\n\nEach c_s must satisfy c_s ≥ sum of c_t for t in children(s).\n\nBecause the count for s is sum of c_t's of children, which must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case. Because the count for s is sum of the counts of its children, which are themselves the sum of their children's counts, etc. So the count for s is the sum of the children's counts, which may be limited by the c_t's.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of c_s's, but each c_s is the sum of the c_t's for its children. Because the count for s is sum of children's counts, which is limited by c_s.\n\nSo, for each s, c_s must be ≥ sum of c_t for t in children(s). Because the count for s is sum of children's counts, which must be ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems like a crucial insight. So, the c_s's must form a structure where each node's c is at least the sum of its children's c's.\n\nThus, the maximum size of the multiset is the sum of all c_s's, given that each c_s ≥ sum of children's c_t's.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the count for s is the sum of children's counts, which is the sum of their c_t's. So, if each c_t is as large as possible, then the count for s is sum of c_t's, which must be ≤ c_s. So c_s must be at least that sum.\n\nSo, the maximum size is the sum of all c_s's, under the constraint that for each node s, c_s ≥ sum of c_t for t in children(s).\n\nBut wait, that's a system of constraints. How do we model this?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the number of ways to assign c_s's such that for each node, c_s is at least the sum of the c_t's of its children. And the sum of all c_s's is exactly f.\n\nWait, no. Because the maximum size is the sum of all c_s's, but each c_s is constrained by the sum of their children's c_t's.\n\nSo, the problem now reduces to:\n\nFind the number of ways to assign c_s's (each between 0 and k) such that:\n\nFor each node s:\nc_s >= sum_{t is child of s} c_t\n\nAnd the sum of all c_s's is exactly f.\n\nThen, the answer is the number of such assignments.\n\nAh, okay! Now that makes sense.\n\nSo, the problem is transformed into a counting problem where we need to assign c_s's for all nodes in a trie, such that each c_s is at least the sum of its children's c_t's, and the sum of all c_s's is exactly f. Additionally, each c_s must be between 0 and k.\n\nSo, the next step is to model this as a dynamic programming problem on the trie, where we compute the number of ways to assign c_s's satisfying the constraints, and the total sum is exactly f.\n\nBut the trie can be quite large. For n=15, the number of nodes is 2^15 -1 = 32767. That's manageable, but for each node, we'll have a DP state.\n\nWait, but the trie is a full binary tree of depth n. Each node s can be represented by its binary representation, or as a path of bits.\n\nSo, let's model the trie as a binary tree, where each node has two children (left and right). The root is the empty string, and each level corresponds to adding a bit (0 or 1) to the prefix.\n\nThe DP state can be defined as dp[s][sum], representing the number of ways to assign c's to the nodes in the subtree rooted at s, such that the sum of their c's is 'sum', and all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, but for each node s, we have to consider its children. The constraints for s are that c_s >= sum of c_t for each t in children(s). So, in the DP, for each node s, we need to process its children first and then determine c_s based on their contributions.\n\nSo, the approach is to perform a post-order traversal of the trie, processing children before parents.\n\nThus, the DP state for each node s is the number of ways to assign c's to the subtree rooted at s, given that the sum contributed by s is some value, and the sum of the subtree is some other value.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP state should track two variables: the current sum of c's in the subtree, and the sum that needs to be allocated to the parent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP state can be designed as follows:\n\nFor each node s, and for each possible sum of the subtree rooted at s, dp[s][sum] represents the number of ways to assign c's to the subtree such that the sum of c's in the subtree is 'sum' and all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut considering that the sum can be up to f, which can be up to 2e5, and the number of nodes is 3e4, this might be feasible.\n\nSo, for each node s, we compute the possible sum contributions from its subtree. Then, for the node s, we can compute the possible c_s values based on the sum of the children's contributions.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nWhen processing node s, after processing all its children t1, t2, ..., tm, for each possible sum_c (the sum of c_t's for the children), we can compute the possible c_s for s.\n\nThe constraint is c_s >= sum_c. Also, c_s must be between 0 and k.\n\nMoreover, the total sum for s's subtree is c_s + sum_c.\n\nSo, for each node s, the DP transition is as follows:\n\nFor each possible sum_c from the children (summing the possible sums from each child), and for each possible c_s >= sum_c, c_s <=k, we add to dp[s][c_s + sum_c] the product of the ways from the children and the choice of c_s.\n\nWait, but the sum_c is the sum of the children's c's. So, for each child t, the sum of their c's is the sum of their DP[t][*], but how?\n\nWait, no. For each child t, the sum of c's in its subtree is variable, but in the context of s's subtree, the sum of c's for s's children is the sum of their individual c_t's. So, for each child t, the sum_c is the sum of their c_t's, which is part of the state.\n\nBut for the DP state of s, the sum of c's in s's subtree is c_s plus the sum of c_t's for the children.\n\nSo, for each node s, after processing all children, we need to combine the possible sum of c_t's from the children and the possible c_s.\n\nLet me think of the DP transitions:\n\nSuppose s has two children t1 and t2.\n\nFor each possible sum_t1 (sum of c's in t1's subtree), and sum_t2 (sum of c's in t2's subtree), the sum of the children's c_t's is sum_t1 + sum_t2.\n\nThen, for each possible c_s >= sum_t1 + sum_t2, c_s <=k, we add to dp[s][sum_t1 + sum_t2 + c_s] the product of dp[t1][sum_t1] * dp[t2][sum_t2] * 1 (for choosing c_s). But wait, no. Because for each way to assign the children, we can choose c_s in [sum_t1+sum_t2, k], and each choice adds a certain amount to the total sum.\n\nSo, the transition for s is as follows:\n\nFor each possible a (sum of c_t's in children), and for each possible c_s >= a, c_s <=k:\n\ndp[s][a + c_s] += (number of ways from children for sum a) multiplied by 1 (since c_s is chosen once).\n\nBut how do we compute the number of ways for the children to sum to a?\n\nWait, for s's children, each child t can contribute some sum of c's, say x and y. So the total sum from the children is x + y. But for each child t, we need to consider all possible sums x and y, and for each combination, ensure that c_s >= x + y.\n\nWait, but the sum from the children is the sum of their individual c_t's. So for each child t, the sum of c_t's in its subtree is the sum of all its own c's and the c's of its children.\n\nSo, for each child t, we can precompute the possible sums of c_t's in its subtree, along with the number of ways to achieve that sum.\n\nThen, for node s, we can compute the convolution of the possible sums of the children's c_t's, and for each possible a (sum of children's c_t's), and for each possible c_s >= a and <=k, we add the product of the ways to get a from the children and the ways to choose c_s.\n\nWait, but the sum a is the sum of the children's c_t's. So for each child t, we have a generating function that represents the possible sums of c_t's in its subtree. The generating function for s is the product of the generating functions of its children, and then for each possible a, we can choose c_s >= a, and add a term to s's generating function.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each node s, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root, compute the generating function for the sum of c_t's in s's subtree.\n\n2. For each node s, the generating function is constructed by taking the product of the generating functions of its children, then for each a in the resulting generating function, we can choose c_s >= a, c_s <=k, and add a new term to s's generating function with value a + c_s.\n\n3. Once we've processed the root node, the generating function for the entire trie will have a coefficient for f, which is the number of ways to assign the c's such that the sum of all c's is f, and all constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, but the root node is the empty string, which is a prefix of all strings. So the root's subtree includes all the nodes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Build the trie structure, representing each node as a binary string.\n\n- For each node s, in post-order (children processed before parent), compute the generating function for the sum of c_t's in s's subtree.\n\n- The generating function for a leaf node (length n) is just a single term: 1 for sum 0 (since a leaf node has no children, so a=0, and c_leaf can be chosen as any value >=0, but in our DP, we're focusing on the sum of the subtree, which for a leaf is just c_leaf).\n\nWait, no. For a leaf node, which is a string of length n, it has no children. So, the sum of c_t's in its subtree is zero, because it has no children. So, the generating function for a leaf node is the possible c_leaf values, but in our case, the sum of c_t's for the children is zero, so for a leaf node, the generating function is a polynomial where the coefficient for x^0 is the number of ways to choose c_leaf (but since it's a leaf, the constraints are c_leaf >= 0, which is always true, so the number of ways is min(k, ... )? Wait, no.\n\nWait, for a leaf node s (of length n), it has no children. So, the sum of the children's c_t's is 0. Thus, the constraint for s is c_s >= 0, which is always true. So, for a leaf node, c_s can be any integer from 0 to k, inclusive. So, the generating function for a leaf node is a polynomial where the coefficient for x^c is 1 for c in 0..k. But wait, for the subtree rooted at s, the sum of c_t's is zero, so the total contribution to the sum is c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the generating function for a node s is a function that, for a given sum, tells us how many ways there are to assign c's in s's subtree such that the sum of c's in s's subtree is equal to that sum.\n\nFor a leaf node s, which has no children, the sum of c_t's in its subtree is zero. So, the generating function is x^0 multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s. Since c_s can be any value from 0 to k, the generating function is sum_{c=0}^k x^c = (x^{k+1} - 1)/(x-1) if x !=1, else (k+1). But in terms of the DP, for a leaf node s, the sum of c_t's in its subtree is zero. So, the generating function for s's subtree is the possible c_s's, but in the context of s's subtree, the sum is just c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-express:\n\nFor a leaf node s, it has no children. So, the sum of the children's c_t's is zero. Therefore, the constraint on c_s is c_s >= 0. Since c_s can be any value from 0 to k, the generating function for s is x^c_s, summed over c_s from 0 to k. So, the generating function is x^0 + x^1 + ... + x^k = (x^{k+1} - 1)/(x-1) if x !=1, else (k+1).\n\nBut in our DP, for each node s, the generating function represents the possible sums of the c_t's in s's subtree. For s being a leaf, the sum is c_s, since it has no children. So the generating function is indeed the sum from c=0 to k of x^c.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the c_t's in s's subtree is c_s, because s is a leaf (no children). So the generating function is the sum of x^c for c in 0..k.\n\nYes.\n\nFor an internal node s, which has children t1 and t2, the sum of the children's c_t's is sum_children = sum_t1 + sum_t2. So, for each possible sum_children, the generating function for s is the convolution of the generating functions of t1 and t2, then for each possible a in the convolution, we can choose c_s >= a, c_s <=k. For each such c_s, we add a term x^{a + c_s} to s's generating function.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor node s, collect the generating functions of all children.\n\nCompute the product of these generating functions, which gives a new generating function G(x).\n\nThen, for each term a in G(x), we can choose c_s such that a <= c_s <=k. For each such c_s, we add a term x^{a + c_s} to s's generating function.\n\nSo, for each a, the contribution is the sum over c_s from a to min(k, ...) of x^{a + c_s}.\n\nWait, but c_s can be any value >= a and <=k. So, for each a, the possible c_s contributes terms x^{a + c_s} for c_s in [a, k].\n\nSo, the generating function for s is the sum over a of (G(x) evaluated at x^a) multiplied by (x^{a} * (x^{k - a + 1} - 1)/(x - 1))).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor each a, the number of ways to choose c_s is (k - a + 1) if a <=k, else zero.\n\nBecause c_s can be a, a+1, ..., k: that's (k -a +1) options.\n\nSo, for each a, the contribution to s's generating function is (k -a +1) * x^{a + a} ?\n\nWait, no. For each a, the sum is x^{a} multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s, which is (k - a + 1) if a <=k.\n\nSo, for each a, the contribution is (k -a + 1) * x^{a + c_s}, but c_s can vary.\n\nWait, no. For a given a, c_s can be any value from a to k. So, for each a, the possible sum added to the parent is a + c_s, where c_s ranges from a to k.\n\nSo, the possible sums for s's subtree are a + a, a + (a+1), ..., a +k.\n\nWhich is a consecutive range from 2a to a +k.\n\nBut the number of ways for each such sum is the number of ways to choose c_s, which is 1 for each c_s in [a, k], so the total is (k -a + 1) ways.\n\nSo, for each a, the contribution is (k -a + 1) multiplied by x^{(a + c_s)}, but that's not the right way to model it because for each a, c_s can vary, leading to multiple possible sums.\n\nWait, perhaps the generating function for s is the sum for a in the product of the children's generating functions, multiplied by the sum for c_s from a to k of x^{a + c_s}.\n\nSo, the generating function for s is:\n\nsum_{a} (ways_a) * sum_{c_s=a}^k x^{a + c_s}\n\nWhere ways_a is the coefficient of x^a in the product of the children's generating functions.\n\nBut sum_{c_s=a}^k x^{a + c_s} is equal to x^{a} * sum_{d=0}^{k -a} x^{d} } = x^{a} * (x^{k -a +1} - 1)/(x -1).\n\nBut that's only when a <=k. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nSo, the generating function for s is the product of the children's GFs, then for each a, multiply by x^a * (x^{m} -1)/(x-1), where m =k -a +1, but only if a <=k.\n\nWait, but when a >k, the term is zero, so it can be ignored.\n\nSo, for each node s, the generating function is:\n\nGF_s = (product of GF_t for all children t of s) * sum_{a=0}^{min(max_a, k)} (coeff(a) * x^{a + c_s}), where c_s can be a, a+1, ..., k.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact mathematical formulation here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node s, the generating function is the product of the children's GFs, and then for each a, the coefficient of x^a in that product is multiplied by (k -a +1) if a <=k, else 0. So, the new GF is the product of the children's GFs multiplied by the sum_{a} (coeff_a) * (max(0, k -a +1)) x^{a + c_s}, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s:\n\nGF_s = sum_{a=0}^{k} ( (sum over children's GF product for a) ) * (k -a +1) x^{a + c_s}, but c_s can be any value from a to k.\n\nWait, no. Because for a fixed a, c_s can vary, which affects the sum in the GF.\n\nAlternatively, for each a, the number of ways to choose c_s is (k -a +1), and each c_s adds a certain value to the sum. So, for a given a, the contribution to s's GF is (k -a +1) multiplied by x^{a + c_s}, summed over c_s from a to k.\n\nBut that's equivalent to x^{a} * sum_{c_s=a}^k x^{c_s} = x^a * (x^{k - a + 1} -1)/(x-1).\n\nBut since (x^{k - a +1} -1)/(x-1) is the same as the GF for c_s from a to k, which is a polynomial of degree (k -a).\n\nSo, for each a, the contribution is coeff_a * (x^{a} * (x^{k -a +1} -1)/(x-1)).\n\nBut this can be written as coeff_a multiplied by x^a multiplied by the sum_{d=0}^{k -a} x^d.\n\nWait, but this seems computationally intensive. How can we model this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to note that for each node s, the generating function can be computed as the product of the children's GFs, and then for each a in the product, the coefficient a is multiplied by (k - a +1) if a <=k, and 0 otherwise. Then, the resulting GF is the sum over a of (coeff_a) * (k -a +1) x^{a + c_s}, but c_s can be any value >=a.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because c_s can vary, leading to different exponents.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's better to model this as follows:\n\nAfter computing the product of the children's GFs, which gives a generating function P(x), the generating function for s is Q(x) = sum_{a=0}^{k} (P_a) * (k -a +1) x^{a + c_s}, but c_s can be a, a+1, ..., k.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't account for all possibilities. Because for a given a, c_s can be any value from a to k, which would contribute to the sum s_total = a + c_s.\n\nSo, for each a, the contribution is (k -a +1) * x^{a + c_s}, but c_s varies from a to k, so s_total can be from 2a to a +k.\n\nBut how do we express this as a generating function?\n\nWait, for each a, the number of ways to choose c_s is (k -a +1). For each such choice, the sum added is a + c_s.\n\nSo, for each a, the contribution is (k -a +1) * x^{a} * (x^{k -a +1} - 1)/(x -1).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute this efficiently.\n\nPerhaps we can precompute for each a, the contribution to the generating function as (k -a +1) * x^{a} * (1 - x^{k -a +1}) / (1 - x), but again, this is computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem with dynamic programming, where for each node, we maintain a list of possible sums and their counts, and for each possible sum, we compute the possible contributions.\n\nSo, for each node s, the DP is built by:\n\n- Processing all children.\n\n- For each child t, we have a list of possible sums and counts.\n\n- Compute the product of the children's sums, which is done via convolution.\n\n- For each possible sum a in the product, and for each possible c_s >=a and <=k, add the count to s's sum a + c_s.\n\nBut for n=15, the number of nodes is 32767, and for each node, the possible sum can be up to f (which is up to 2e5), so the total computation could be manageable.\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Build the trie structure, representing each node as a binary string.\n\n2. Perform a post-order traversal, processing each node after its children.\n\n3. For each node, compute the possible sums and their counts as follows:\n\n   a. For each child, get their possible sums and counts.\n\n   b. Convolve the sums of all children to get the sum of their contributions.\n\n   c. For each possible a in the convolved sum, and for each possible c_s >=a and <=k, add a + c_s to the node's sum and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut wait, the convolution step is for the sum of the children's c_t's. So,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose integers \\( c_s \\) for every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). A beautiful multiset is defined as one where for every binary string \\( s \\), the number of strings in the multiset that have \\( s \\) as a prefix does not exceed \\( c_s \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be modeled using a trie structure where each node represents a binary string. Each node must satisfy the condition that its count (number of times it appears as a prefix) does not exceed \\( c_s \\). The goal is to count valid assignments of \\( c_s \\) such that the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\).\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming on Trie**: We use dynamic programming (DP) on the trie structure. For each node, we maintain a generating function that tracks the number of ways to achieve a given sum of \\( c_s \\) values in its subtree.\n\n3. **Generating Functions**: For each node, the generating function is computed by convolving the generating functions of its children. This convolution accounts for the sum of \\( c_s \\) values from the children. Each node's \\( c_s \\) must be at least the sum of its children's \\( c_s \\) values and cannot exceed \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Post-order Traversal**: Nodes are processed in post-order to ensure that children are processed before their parent. This allows us to build up the solution from the leaves to the root of the trie.\n\n5. **Modulo Operations**: Since the result can be large, all operations are performed modulo \\( 998244353 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Represent the trie nodes as binary strings\n    from collections import deque\n\n    # Build the trie\n    trie = {}\n    root = ''\n    queue = deque()\n    queue.append(root)\n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        if '0' not in trie[current]:\n            trie[current + '0'] = {'children': [], 'dp': {}}\n        if '1' not in trie[current]:\n            trie[current + '1'] = {'children': [], 'dp': {}}\n        if '0' in trie[current]:\n            queue.append(trie[current]['0'])\n        if '1' in trie[current]:\n            queue.append(trie[current]['1'])\n\n    # Process the nodes in post-order\n    post_order = []\n    stack = [(root, False)]\n    while stack:\n        node, visited = stack.pop()\n        if visited:\n            post_order.append(node)\n            continue\n        stack.append((node, True))\n        if '0' in trie[node]:\n            stack.append(trie[node]['0'])\n        if '1' in trie[node]:\n            stack.append(trie[node]['1'])\n\n    # Initialize DP for each node\n    for node in post_order:\n        dp = {}\n        if '0' not in trie[node] and '1' not in trie[node]:\n            # Leaf node: can choose c_s from 0 to k\n            for c in range(0, k+1):\n                if c not in dp:\n                    dp[c] = 0\n                dp[c] = (dp[c] + 1) % MOD\n            trie[node]['dp'] = dp\n            continue\n        else:\n            children = []\n            if '0' in trie[node]:\n                children.append(trie[node]['0'])\n            if '1' in trie[node]:\n                children.append(trie[node]['1'])\n            # Compute the product of children's DP\n            product_dp = {}\n            for child in children:\n                new_dp = {}\n                for a in dp:\n                    for b in child['dp']:\n                        sum_ab = a + b\n                        if sum_ab in new_dp:\n                            new_dp[sum_ab] = (new_dp[sum_ab] + dp[a] * child['dp'][b]) % MOD\n                        else:\n                            new_dp[sum_ab] = (dp[a] * child['dp'][b]) % MOD\n                product_dp = new_dp\n            # Now, for each a in product_dp, compute the contribution\n            s_dp = {}\n            for a in product_dp:\n                max_c = min(k, f - a)\n                if max_c < 0:\n                    continue\n                ways = 0\n                for c in range(a, max_c + 1):\n                    total = a + c\n                    if total > f:\n                        continue\n                    if total in s_dp:\n                        s_dp[total] = (s_dp[total] + product_dp[a] * (max_c - a + 1)) % MOD\n                    else:\n                        s_dp[total] = (product_dp[a] * (max_c - a + 1)) % MOD\n            # Update the node's dp\n            trie[node]['dp'] = s_dp\n\n    # The root's dp contains the total sum\n    root_dp = trie[root]['dp']\n    print(root_dp.get(f, 0) % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Trie Construction**: The trie is built using a dictionary where each node has children '0' and '1'.\n- **Post-order Traversal**: Nodes are processed in post-order to ensure children are processed before their parent.\n- **Dynamic Programming**: Each node maintains a DP table that tracks the number of ways to achieve each possible sum of \\( c_s \\) values in its subtree.\n- **Generating Functions**: For each node, the generating function is computed by convolving the functions of its children and considering valid ranges for \\( c_s \\).\n- **Result Calculation**: After processing all nodes, the result is found in the root's DP table, which gives the number of valid assignments where the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\).",
