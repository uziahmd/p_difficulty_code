Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The definition they give is specific. So, Valera's paper is a square with n x n letters, where n is odd. The letters form an 'X' if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, for each test case, I need to:\n\n- Check that the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is all the same character.\n- Check that the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) is all the same character.\n- Ensure that both diagonals have the same character. Because if one is 'x' and the other is 'y', that's not acceptable.\n- Then, check that every cell not on either diagonal has the same character, and that this character is different from the diagonal ones.\n\nWait, right. So step by step:\n\n1. Read n and then read n lines each containing n characters.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first line after n is a string like '5\\nxooox', etc. So each line represents a row. So I'll need to split them into rows.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I can process each cell.\n\nNow, for each cell, I can categorize it as being on the main diagonal, the anti-diagonal, or neither.\n\nSo for a cell at (i, j):\n\n- Main diagonal: i == j\n- Anti-diagonal: i + j == n - 1 (since indices start from 0)\n- Neither: otherwise.\n\nSo first, let's collect all the diagonal characters.\n\nFor the main diagonal, iterate over i from 0 to n-1, j = i. Collect all characters and see if they are the same.\n\nSimilarly for the anti-diagonal: i from 0 to n-1, j = n-1 -i. Collect their characters.\n\nIf the main and anti diagonals don't have the same character, then it's automatically not an X.\n\nOtherwise, let's denote the common diagonal character as c.\n\nThen, for all cells not on any diagonal, check if they are equal to each other and also not equal to c.\n\nWait, but what about cells that are on both diagonals? Like when n is 3, the center cell is on both diagonals. But in that case, it's already covered by both checks.\n\nSo, how to proceed:\n\nCheck main diagonal: all same, say d1.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal: all same, say d2.\n\nIf d1 != d2: output NO.\n\nElse, check all other cells: they must all be same, say s, and s != d1.\n\nAdditionally, since n is odd, there's exactly one cell that is on both diagonals. For example, in 3x3, (1,1) is on both.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. Extract main diagonal (d1) and anti-diagonal (d2). Check if all elements in each are the same, and d1 == d2. If not, output NO.\n\n3. Now, for every cell that is not on either diagonal, check that it's the same character, and that this character is different from d1.\n\n4. If all those conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo now, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, read n, then read n lines, stripping any whitespace, perhaps.\n\nWait, the input is given as strings, each line is a row. So for example, the first sample input is '5\\nxooox\\n...' etc.\n\nSo for n=5, each line is 5 characters.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        # determine if it's on main, anti, or neither\n\nBut perhaps more efficient to collect all the diagonals first.\n\nLet me think.\n\nCollect the main diagonal characters:\n\nmain_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n\nCheck if all characters in main_diag are the same.\n\nSimilarly for anti-diagonal:\n\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n-1 - i\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nCheck if all in anti_diag are same.\n\nIf main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0], then return NO.\n\nElse, the diagonal character is c = main_diag[0]\n\nNow, for each cell (i,j), if it's on main or anti, check",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\". The grid must meet specific conditions for the letters to form an \"X\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the size of the grid `n` and then read the grid itself.\n2. **Extract Diagonals:** Extract the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n3. **Check Diagonals:** Ensure both diagonals consist of the same character and that they are the same as each other.\n4. **Check Remaining Cells:** Ensure all cells not on either diagonal contain the same character, which is different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\nmain_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\nd1 = main_diag[0]\nif not all(c == d1 for c in main_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n - 1 - i\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][j])\nd2 = anti_diag[0]\nif not all(c == d2 for c in anti_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif d1 != d2:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check all non-diagonal cells\nc = d1\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        if grid[i][j] != c:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check:** It extracts the main diagonal and checks if all its characters are the same.\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check:** Similarly, it extracts the anti-diagonal and checks if all its characters are the same.\n4. **Diagonal Consistency:** If the main and anti-diagonals do not have the same character, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n5. **Non-Diagonal Cells Check:** Every cell not on the diagonals must be the same character, different from the diagonal character. If any cell fails this check, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all conditions for forming the letter \"X\" are efficiently checked in a straightforward manner.",
