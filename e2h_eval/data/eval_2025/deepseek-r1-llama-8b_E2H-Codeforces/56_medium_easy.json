Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So it's a perfect matching between R ships and B bases.\n\nBut there's a catch: the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. The paths are straight lines in 2D space, and we need to make sure none of them cross each other.\n\nHmm, how to model this? I think this is similar to checking if a bipartite graph is matchable and whether the edges (representing non-intersecting paths) form a matching.\n\nWait, but how do we determine if two paths intersect? Because for any two pairs of points (ship A to base X and ship B to base Y), their line segments should not cross.\n\nSo, for a given matching, we need to ensure that all the corresponding line segments don't intersect with each other.\n\nThe approach I can think of is:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between R ships and B bases.\n2. For each matching, check if any two of the line segments (from ship to base) intersect.\n3. If any matching satisfies this condition, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, \"No\".\n\nBut wait, generating all possible matchings might be computationally intensive, especially since R and B can be up to 10. Oh right, because 10! is 3,628,800 which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read R and B.\n- Read R ship coordinates into a list.\n- Read B base coordinates into another list.\n- Generate all possible perfect matchings where the number of ships equals the number of bases (since R must equal B for a perfect matching, but wait, the input says 1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10. So R and B can be different? Wait no, because a perfect matching requires R = B. Wait, the first line says the first two integers are R and B, and then R ships and B bases. So for a matching to exist, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"the assignment is a perfect matching.\" So yes, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible, so output 'No'.\n\nSo first, check if R != B. If so, output 'No' immediately.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for the case when R == B.\n\nWe need to find a bijection (permutation) from ships to bases such that all the line segments (ship_i to base_p(i)) don't intersect any other such segment.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a permutation of the bases (as an assignment to the ships) such that all the line segments are non-crossing.\n\nHow to represent this?\n\nFor each permutation of the bases (each possible way to assign each ship to a base uniquely), we need to check whether all the corresponding line segments are non-intersecting.\n\nBut even for R=10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3.6 million. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments to see if any intersect.\n\nWait, but for each permutation, the number of pairs is C(R, 2) = 45 for R=10. So per permutation, 45 checks, each involving two line segments.\n\nEach check can be done using standard computational geometry techniques.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read R and B. If R != B, output 'No'.\n2. Read R ship points and B base points.\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the B bases. Each permutation represents a possible assignment of ships to bases.\n4. For each permutation:\n   a. Create a list of line segments, each connecting a ship to its assigned base.\n   b. Check if any two line segments in this list intersect.\n   c. If for any permutation, no two segments intersect, return 'Yes'.\n5. After checking all permutations, if none satisfy, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the main challenges are:\n\n- Implementing the line segment intersection check efficiently.\n- Generating all permutations correctly.\n\nFirst, let's handle the permutation part.\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can generate all possible orderings of the bases. So for each permutation, we can assign the i-th ship to the permutation's i-th base.\n\nThen, for each such permutation, we create a list of line segments.\n\nNow, the key is the line segment intersection function.\n\nImplementing an accurate and efficient line segment intersection check is crucial.\n\nI recall that two line segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- The points are arranged in a certain way around the plane.\n\nOne approach is to use the cross product to determine the orientation of points.\n\nThe algorithm I remember is as follows:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if and only if the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and\n2. The points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nAlternatively, the segments could be colinear, but in our problem statement, the third note says that no three points are on the same line. So, for our problem, all lines are either non-colinear or, if colinear, but wait, the note says \"no three points are on the same line.\" So each line segment will consist of two distinct points, and no three points in all the ships and bases lie on the same straight line. So, any two line segments will either not intersect or cross each other, but not overlap along a line.\n\nWait, no. The note says that no three points (from all the ships and bases) are on the same line. So, any line segment between a ship and a base cannot have another point (either a ship or a base) lying on it. So, two line segments can't be colinear and overlapping, except perhaps if they are the same line segment, but that's not allowed because each ship is assigned to exactly one base.\n\nWait, no. Suppose ship A is connected to base X, and ship B is connected to base Y, and both are on the same line. But the note says no three points are on the same line, so it's impossible for three points to be colinear, but two points are always colinear. So line segments can be on the same line, but they can't share any points except at the ends, but since each base is assigned to exactly one ship, the line segments can't share any intermediate points. So, in our case, two line segments can't lie on the same line unless they are the same, which isn't possible in a permutation.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose we have two ships S1 and S2, and two bases B1 and B2. If S1 is assigned to B1, and S2 is assigned to B2, and S1, S2, B1, B2 are all on the same straight line. Then the line segments S1B1 and S2B2 would be on the same line, but they're separate segments. So, they might either be overlapping (if S1 is on one end, S2 on the other, and B1 and B2 in between) or not. However, according to the problem statement, no three points are on the same line. So any line can have at most two points from the entire collection of ships and bases.\n\nWait, no. The note says, \"it is guaranteed that no three points are on the same line.\" So any three points (either all ships, all bases, or mix) cannot be colinear. So, any line segment between a ship and a base cannot have any other point (either a ship or a base) lying on it. So, two line segments can't cross each other except at their endpoints, but since each endpoint is unique (each ship is assigned to exactly one base), the line segments can't share an endpoint. So, two line segments can't share a common point except possibly if a ship is connected to two bases, but that's not allowed in a permutation.\n\nTherefore, for our problem, two line segments either don't intersect or cross each other, but they can't overlap or touch at any point except the endpoints, which are unique.\n\nThis simplifies things because for any two line segments, they either cross each other (once) or don't cross.\n\nSo, the intersection function can be implemented as checking whether two segments cross each other.\n\nImplementing the line segment intersection function is critical.\n\nI remember that the standard approach uses the orientation of the points to determine if two segments intersect.\n\nHere's a plan for the line segment intersection function:\n\nGiven two line segments, p1q1 and p2q2.\n\nCompute the orientations of (p1, q1, p2), (p1, q1, q2), (p2, q1, p1), etc., to determine whether the segments cross.\n\nThe algorithm can be found in various computational geometry resources.\n\nAn alternative is to use the cross product method.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps.\n\nFunction to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect:\n\n1. Compute the cross product of vectors AB and AC. This gives the orientation of point C relative to AB. Similarly, compute for other points.\n\n2. The line segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n   - The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and\n   - The points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nIf both conditions are true, the segments cross.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute whether the segments straddle each other.\n\nBut implementing this correctly is tricky.\n\nLet me look for a reliable implementation.\n\nI found this resource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-two-line-segments-intersect/ which provides a detailed method.\n\nAccording to that, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the four orientations needed to determine if the segments intersect.\n\nDefine a helper function ccw(A, B, C) which returns:\n\n- 1 if C is counter-clockwise from A->B,\n- -1 if clockwise,\n- 0 if colinear.\n\nThen, the two segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n1. The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB. So ccw(A,B,C) * ccw(A,B,D) <= 0.\n2. The points A and B are on opposite sides of CD. So ccw(C,D,A) * ccw(C,D,B) <= 0.\n\nBut since in our problem, no three points are colinear, the cases where the product is zero can be ignored because that would imply that two points are on the same line, but not overlapping.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the cross products can't be zero except in specific cases.\n\nWait, no. Since no three points are colinear, any three points won't lie on the same line. So the ccw function will never return zero when considering any triplet of points in the problem.\n\nWait, no. The note says that no three points (from all ships and bases) are on the same line. So any three points can't be colinear. So for any triplet (A, B, C), they are not colinear. So, the ccw function will always return either 1 or -1.\n\nSo, in our case, the function can safely assume that the cross product is non-zero.\n\nSo, the condition for two line segments AB and CD to intersect is:\n\n(ccw(A, B, C) * ccw(A, B, D) < 0) AND (ccw(C, D, A) * ccw(C, D, B) < 0)\n\nBecause if the product is less than zero, the points are on opposite sides.\n\nSo, let's implement this.\n\nNow, the code outline.\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No' and exit.\n\nRead R ship points as a list.\n\nRead B base points as another list.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation, create a list of line segments.\n\nCheck for all pairs of line segments in this list whether they intersect.\n\nIf any pair does not intersect, this permutation is invalid.\n\nWait, no. We need to check that all pairs of line segments do NOT intersect. So for the permutation to be valid, no two line segments should cross each other.\n\nSo for each permutation, iterate through all pairs of line segments (i, j) where i < j. For each pair, check if their segments intersect. If any pair does, the permutation is invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because if any pair of segments intersects, the entire permutation is invalid because the paths cross.\n\nSo, for a permutation to be acceptable, all pairs of segments must not intersect.\n\nWait, no. Because the path is a set of line segments, and any two of them must not intersect. So, for the permutation, if any pair of segments in the list intersects, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for each permutation:\n\n   create a list segs = [ (ship_0 to base_perm[0]), (ship_1 to base_perm[1]), ... ]\n\n   for i in 0 to len(segs)-1:\n\n      for j in i+1 to len(segs)-1:\n\n          s1 = segs[i]\n\n          s2 = segs[j]\n\n          if s1 and s2 intersect:\n\n              mark permutation as invalid and break.\n\n   if permutation is still valid after all pairs:\n\n       return 'Yes'\n\nIf no permutation is valid, return 'No'.\n\nSo, the code structure is clear.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nShips and bases are stored as lists of tuples. Each tuple represents (x, y).\n\nPermutations can be generated using itertools.permutations(base_list).\n\nEach permutation is a tuple of B elements, representing the order of assignment.\n\nNow, for each permutation, create a list of line segments.\n\nEach line segment is a pair of points: (ship_i, base_perm[i]).\n\nWait, no. For each permutation, it's a mapping from ship index to base index. So for each i in 0..R-1, the i-th ship is connected to the perm[i]-th base.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose the permutation is a list like [base0, base1, base2]. Then for each ship in order, it's assigned to the corresponding base in the permutation.\n\nSo, for the first ship (index 0), it's assigned to base0. Second ship (index1) to base1, etc.\n\nSo the line segments are [(ship0, base0), (ship1, base1), ..., (shipp, basep)].\n\nThus, for the permutation, the list is created by zipping the ship list with the permutation.\n\nWait, no. Because the permutation is a list where the i-th element is the index of the base to assign to the i-th ship.\n\nSo, for each i in 0..R-1, the line is (ships[i], permutation[i]).\n\nSo, to get the line segments for the permutation, we can do something like:\n\nsegments = []\nfor i in range(R):\n    segments.append( (ships[i], permutation[i]) )\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for each pair of segments in segments, we need to check if they intersect.\n\nSo, for each permutation:\n\nvalid = True\n\nfor i in range(len(segments)):\n\n    for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n\n        s1 = segments[i]\n\n        s2 = segments[j]\n\n        if segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n\n        break\n\nif valid:\n\n    return 'Yes'\n\nSo, the code would proceed accordingly.\n\nNow, the key is to implement the segments_intersect function correctly.\n\nImplementing the CCW function:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n\n    # Returns 1 if C is counter-clockwise from AB, -1 if clockwise.\n\n    # Compute (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\n    val = (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\n    if val > 0:\n\n        return 1\n\n    elif val < 0:\n\n        return -1\n\n    else:\n\n        # Colinear, but according to problem statement, this can't happen.\n\n        return 0\n\nBut according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so the function can safely assume that val is not zero.\n\nSo, the segments_intersect function:\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n\n    # s1 is (A, B), s2 is (C, D)\n\n    A, B = s1\n\n    C, D = s2\n\n    # Check if the two segments cross.\n\n    # Check if (C and D) are on opposite sides of AB.\n\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2) <= 0:\n\n        # One on left, the other on right, or one is on the line.\n\n        # Now check if (A and B) are on opposite sides of CD.\n\n        ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n\n        ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n\n        if (ccw3 * ccw4) <= 0:\n\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but in our problem, the product can't be zero. So, the condition is if (ccw1 * ccw2) < 0 and (ccw3 * ccw4) < 0.\n\nWait, no, because the problem allows for colinear points? Or not.\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, no three points are on the same line. So, no three points can be colinear. So, any four points involved in a line segment pair must not have any three colinear. Thus, the cross product can't be zero for any of these points.\n\nSo, the function can safely use strict inequalities.\n\nThus, the segments_intersect function can be written as:\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n\n    A, B = s1\n\n    C, D = s2\n\n    # Check if C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\n    c1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n\n    c2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n\n    if (c1 * c2) <= 0:\n\n        # They are on opposite sides or colinear.\n\n        # Now check if A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\n        c3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n\n        c4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n\n        if (c3 * c4) <= 0:\n\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but in our problem, since no three points are colinear, the product can't be zero. So, the condition can be simplified to:\n\nif (c1 * c2 < 0) and (c3 * c4 < 0):\n\n    return True\n\nelse:\n\n    return False\n\nBecause the possibility of c1*c2 being zero is eliminated.\n\nSo, now the code can be written.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output 'No'.\n\nElse, read R ships and B bases.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   create segments as list of tuples (ship[i], base_perm[i])\n\n   for i in 0 to len(segments)-1:\n\n       for j in i+1 to len(segments)-1:\n\n           if segments[i] and segments[j] intersect:\n\n               mark permutation as invalid.\n\n   if any permutation is valid, output 'Yes' and terminate.\n\nAfter checking all permutations, output 'No'.\n\nNow, handling the permutations.\n\nIn Python, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(bases).\n\nBut wait, the permutation is a tuple of base indices? Or the actual points?\n\nNo, the permutation is a tuple of the base points in the order they are assigned.\n\nWait, the base points are read as a list, say, bases = [b1, b2, ..., bB], where each b is a tuple (x, y).\n\nSo, a permutation of the bases is a tuple that represents the order of assignment. For example, for B=3, a permutation (b2, b0, b1) means ship 0 is assigned to b2, ship 1 to b0, ship 2 to b1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nbases = [...] # list of B points.\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n\n    # create segments as (ship[0], perm[0]), (ship[1], perm[1]), etc.\n\n    segments = []\n\n    for i in range(R):\n\n        segments.append( (ships[i], perm[i]) )\n\n    # Now check all pairs.\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n\n            if segments_intersect(segments[i], segments[j]):\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            break\n\n    if valid:\n\n        print(\"Yes\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"No\")\n\nWait, but this is O(R^2 * number_of_permutations * R^2), which for R=10 is 10! * 100 * 100 = 3,628,800 * 10,000 = ~36,288,000,000 operations. That's way too much for Python; it would take too long.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because 36 billion operations would not be feasible within the time constraints of a programming competition.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the brute-force approach may not be efficient enough for R=10. So what can we do?\n\nWait, R can be up to 10, and B is also up to 10. So for R=10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, we need to check C(10,2) =45 pairs. So for each permutation, 45 checks. So total operations are 3.6e6 *45 = 162,840,000 operations. That's about 160 million operations, which is manageable in Python.\n\nWait, because 1e8 operations take about a second, 1e9 is about 10 seconds. So 1.6e8 is about 0.16 seconds, which is acceptable.\n\nWait, no. Because each operation involves multiple steps: for each pair of segments, we have to compute the cross products twice (for each segment). So perhaps 3.6e6 * 45 = 162 million segment pairs. But each segment pair requires computing four cross products.\n\nEach cross product is a simple arithmetic operation, but multiplied by 4 per pair, that's 648 million operations. Hmm, that's getting close to the limits of Python's speed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's manageable. Let's compute:\n\nEach cross product is a multiplication and subtraction.\n\nBut for 648 million operations, in Python, which is generally considered to run about 1e6 operations per second, this would take about 648 seconds, which is over 10 minutes. That's way too slow.\n\nSo, the brute-force approach may not be feasible for R=10.\n\nWait, but in practice, the problem says it's an easy question, so perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: instead of checking all permutations, perhaps find a way to model this as a bipartite graph matching problem with some geometric constraints.\n\nWait, but the problem is about non-crossing paths, which complicates things.\n\nAnother idea: sort the ships and bases in a particular way to reduce the number of permutations to check.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem as finding a non-crossing perfect matching. How?\n\nIn computational geometry, there's a concept called geometric matching, but I'm not familiar with the details.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can fix the order of the ships and bases based on their positions.\n\nWait, for example, arrange the ships and bases in a convex position and then find a non-crossing matching.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of the ships and bases as points in the plane, and the matching as a set of non-crossing edges.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as finding a permutation where the line segments form a non-crossing matching. So, perhaps the permutation must be such that when the ships are ordered in a certain way, the bases are ordered in a compatible way.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear path here.\n\nPerhaps the problem can be reduced to checking whether the bipartite graph, where edges connect a ship to a base only if the line segment doesn't cross any other such edge, has a perfect matching.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach is manageable with optimizations.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute all possible pairs of ships and bases, and for each pair, note whether the line segment between them crosses any other segment in the current permutation.\n\nBut that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps memoization can help. But in this case, each permutation is unique, so it's unlikely.\n\nAnother thought: for each permutation, during the checking phase, as soon as any pair of segments is found to intersect, we can break early and proceed to the next permutation.\n\nWhich is already handled in the code.\n\nBut for R=10, even with this, it's 3.6e6 permutations, each requiring 45 checks.\n\nWait, let's calculate:\n\nEach permutation requires 45 segment pairs.\n\nEach segment pair requires two calls to ccw and two comparisons.\n\nEach ccw is two subtractions and a multiply, plus checking.\n\nBut in Python, each of these operations is quite fast.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nLet me consider that each segment pair check takes about 1e-6 seconds (which is optimistic). Then 45 * 3.6e6 = 162 million checks, taking 162 seconds. That's 2.5 minutes, which is beyond the usual time constraints.\n\nSo, the code would not pass within the time limits.\n\nHence, we need a more efficient approach.\n\nAlternative approach: realize that the problem is equivalent to finding a non-crossing perfect matching between the ships and the bases.\n\nIn computational geometry, a non-crossing perfect matching is known as a non-crossing bipartite matching.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to model this as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the line segments don't cross each other. Then, the problem is to find a perfect matching in this graph.\n\nBut finding such a matching is non-trivial.\n\nAnother idea: if we can order the ships and bases along a convex hull, perhaps the matching can be found via dynamic programming.\n\nBut I'm not familiar enough with this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem of arranging the ships and bases in a certain order and then finding a matching that doesn't cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nSort the ships in a certain order (like clockwise along the convex hull), and similarly sort the bases. Then, the matching can be found by comparing the sorted lists.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a bipartite graph where edges are only present if the line segments are non-crossing. Then, the problem becomes finding a perfect matching in this graph.\n\nBut finding such a graph and then finding a perfect matching is the same as the initial approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps the number of edges in the graph is manageable.\n\nBut for R=10, it's possible that each ship is connected to many bases, leading to a dense graph.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother thought: for each ship, precompute the bases it can be connected to without crossing any other edges in the current partial matching.\n\nBut this seems similar to a backtracking approach, which might not be better than the initial brute-force.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find a way to reduce the number of permutations to check.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the line segment between ship i and base j doesn't cross any other such edges. Then, the problem is to find a perfect matching in this graph.\n\nBut again, this brings us back to the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartitioned graph where the edges are allowed only if the line segments are non-crossing, and then the problem reduces to finding a maximum matching.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps another observation: for the permutation to be valid, the ordering of the ships and bases must be such that the line segments form a non-decreasing sequence in some radial order.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as matching ships to bases in such a way that the resulting line segments form a non-crossing set.\n\nIn computational geometry, a non-crossing set of line segments is called a non-crossing matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding a non-crossing matching between the ships and bases.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to model this as a bipartite graph and find a non-crossing perfect matching.\n\nBut how?\n\nUpon some research, I recall that in computational geometry, the problem of finding a non-crossing perfect matching between two sets of points is a known problem.\n\nBut I'm not familiar with the exact algorithms for this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem of matching points on a convex polygon.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the line segments are non-crossing, and then find a maximum bipartite matching.\n\nBut for R=10, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm can find a maximum matching in O(E*sqrt(V)) time, which is manageable.\n\nBut how to construct the bipartite graph.\n\nEach ship is connected to a base if the line segment between them does not cross any other line segments in the matching.\n\nWait, but that's not directly applicable because the edges depend on the other edges in the matching.\n\nSo, it's unclear.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding a non-crossing matching that is a perfect matching.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nSo, perhaps I should proceed with the initial brute-force approach, but optimize it as much as possible.\n\nTo optimize, perhaps precompute all possible pairs of ships and bases, and for each pair, precompute whether their line segment would cross any other line segment in the permutation.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, for each permutation, we are checking all pairs of segments in that permutation.\n\nBut perhaps, for each pair of ships, we can precompute which bases can be assigned to them without causing a conflict.\n\nBut that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the problem as a bipartite graph where each edge (ship, base) is allowed only if the line segment between them does not cross any other line segment in the matching.\n\nBut again, this is circular.\n\nAnother Idea: To model the problem as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the line segment between the ship and base is non-crossing with all others in the matching. Then, the problem is to find a perfect matching in this graph.\n\nBut how to build this graph.\n\nWait, perhaps the bipartite graph can be built by adding an edge from ship i to base j if the line segment between i and j doesn't cross any other such edge. But again, this depends on the other edges.\n\nThis seems challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph with edges only between ships and bases whose connecting line segments don't cross each other. Then, the problem is to find a perfect matching in this graph.\n\nBut this graph may not have a perfect matching, even though a permutation exists, because some edges may have been excluded due to crossings with others.\n\nBut again, this is the same as the initial approach.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem of finding a non-crossing bipartition.\n\nWait, perhaps if we can arrange the ships and bases in a certain way, the non-crossing condition can be automatically satisfied.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by sorting the ships and bases in a certain order, and then checking if a matching exists in that sorted order.\n\nFor example, sort the ships in increasing x-coordinate, and the bases in increasing x-coordinate. Then, for each ship, connect it to the earliest possible base that doesn't cause a crossing.\n\nBut this is just a heuristic and may not work.\n\nAnother Idea: For the permutation to be valid, the order in which the ships are assigned to the bases must correspond to a non-decreasing order in some property, like the polar angle around a certain point.\n\nThis is similar to the approach used in some geometric problems where points are sorted by their angles.\n\nFor example, choose a point (like the origin) and sort the ships and bases based on their polar angle. Then, the matching must be such that the order of assignment is non-decreasing in both the ship and base orderings.\n\nBut how to choose the point and ensure that the non-crossing condition is met.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the initial approach is manageable with optimizations.\n\nLet me try to write the code as per the initial approach and see if it can be optimized.\n\nPossible optimizations:\n\n1. Precompute all pairs of ships and bases, and for each pair, precompute whether the line segment would cross any other line segments.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\n2. Prune the permutations as early as possible.\n\nIn the code, for each permutation, as soon as any pair of segments is found to intersect, the permutation is marked as invalid and moved on.\n\nSo, in the code, for each permutation:\n\n   for i in 0..len(segments)-1:\n\n       for j in i+1..len(segments)-1:\n\n           if segments i and j intersect:\n\n               valid = False\n\n               break\n\n       if not valid:\n\n           break\n\nSo, as soon as any pair is found to intersect, the loop breaks and proceeds to the next permutation.\n\nThis is efficient because it stops checking as soon as a conflict is found.\n\nAnother optimization: for each permutation, before checking all pairs, sort the segments in a certain way to minimize the number of checks.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Represent the segments in a way that allows us to quickly find potential conflicts.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother optimization: For each permutation, group the segments into order and then compare adjacent segments.\n\nWait, but in that case, perhaps the segments are ordered in such a way that adjacent segments don't cross. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in a convex hull ordering, the segments are such that adjacent ones don't cross.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem is to find a non-crossing matching, perhaps the matching can be represented as a tree-like structure, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps it's best to proceed with the initial approach and see if it's efficient enough.\n\nBut for R=10, it's 3.6e6 permutations, each with 45 pairs. Each pair requires two cross products.\n\nBut perhaps with Python's speed, it's manageable.\n\nAnother Idea: Precompute all the possible pairs of segments that can't coexist, and then for each permutation, check against this precomputed list.\n\nBut that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of ships and bases, precompute whether their line segment would cross any other line segment.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps memoize the segment intersection function.\n\nBut the function is already simple, so it's unlikely to help.\n\nWell, perhaps it's time to proceed.\n\nSo, the code structure is as follows:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No' and exit.\n\nRead R ships.\n\nRead B bases.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   create a list of segments.\n\n   for i in 0 to R-1:\n\n       segments.append( (ships[i], permutation[i]) )\n\n   for all pairs (i,j) in segments:\n\n       if segments i and j intersect:\n\n           mark permutation as invalid.\n\n   if permutation is valid:\n\n       print 'Yes' and exit.\n\nIf all permutations are checked and none are valid, print 'No'.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSample Output: Yes.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nOutput: No.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the sample input was misrepresented in the problem description. But regardless, the code should handle it.\n\nNow, test case 1: R=3, B=3.\n\nShips:\n\n(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\nBases:\n\n(3,1), (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2).\n\nWait, wait, the input has 3 ships and 3 bases.\n\nWait, the sample input seems to have 3 ships, then 3 bases.\n\nWait, the first input line is '3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1', which is the ships.\n\nThen the next 3 lines are the bases: '3 1', '-2 1', '0 3', '2 2'? Or wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, the input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, that's perhaps two lines, but each line has multiple entries.\n\nWait, perhaps the first line is the R and B: 3 3.\n\nThen, 3 lines for the ships.\n\nThen, 3 lines for the bases.\n\nSo, ships are:\n\nLine 1: 0 0\n\nLine 2: 2 0\n\nLine 3: 3 1\n\nBases are:\n\nLine 4: 3 1\n\nLine 5: -2 1\n\nLine 6: 0 3\n\nLine 7: 2 2\n\nWait, but that's 7 lines, which is not matching the problem statement.\n\nAh, the problem statement's input format says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers R, B.\n\nThen, R lines follow for the ships.\n\nThen, B lines follow for the bases.\n\nSo, in the first sample, the input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWait",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Perfect Matching**: The first step is to check if the number of spaceships (R) matches the number of bases (B). If they do not match, it is impossible to form a perfect matching, and we immediately return \"No\".\n\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each possible permutation of the bases, we create a mapping where each spaceship is assigned to a base. This permutation represents a potential assignment.\n\n3. **Check for Non-Intersecting Paths**: For each permutation, we generate a list of line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base. We then check if any two line segments intersect. If any intersection is found, the permutation is invalid.\n\n4. **Intersection Check Using Cross Product**: To determine if two line segments intersect, we use the cross product method. This helps us determine the orientation of points relative to each other, allowing us to check if segments cross.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    val = (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n    if val > 0:\n        return 1\n    elif val < 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return 0  # According to the problem statement, this case won't occur\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n    A, B = s1\n    C, D = s2\n\n    # Check if C and D are on opposite sides of AB\n    c1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    c2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    if (c1 * c2) > 0:\n        return False  # Same side, no intersection\n\n    # Check if A and B are on opposite sides of CD\n    c3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    c4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    if (c3 * c4) > 0:\n        return False  # Same side, no intersection\n\n    # If all checks pass, the segments intersect\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    R = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    B = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            segments.append( (ships[i], perm[i]) )\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(len(segments)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n                if segments_intersect(segments[i], segments[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values for the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by the coordinates of each spaceship and base.\n\n2. **Checking for Perfect Match**: If R does not equal B, the function immediately returns \"No\" as a perfect matching is impossible.\n\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, the function generates all possible permutations of the bases.\n\n4. **Creating Segments**: For each permutation, it creates a list of line segments representing the connections from each spaceship to its assigned base.\n\n5. **Checking for Intersections**: For each permutation, it checks every pair of line segments to see if they intersect using the cross product method.
