He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, which must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C added them. The count can be equal to both, but that's also allowed.\n\nThe string I'm given must satisfy these conditions. So, I need to verify:\n\n1. The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order is strictly a's first, then b's, then c's.\n\n2. The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\n3. Also, the string must have at least one of each character, because after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nSo, the steps to check are:\n\nFirst, check the structure of the string. It should have a's, then b's, then c's without any mixing.\n\nHow to do that? Well, we can scan the string and make sure that once a character changes from 'a' to 'b', it can't go back to 'a' again. Similarly, once it changes to 'c's, it can't go back to 'a' or 'b's.\n\nSo, for example, the string 'aabba' is invalid because after 'bb', it goes back to 'a's.\n\nSo, first condition: the string must be of the form a+b+c+ (in order), with no overlaps.\n\nSecond, check that there are all three characters present. Because after B's step, the string has at least one 'a' and 'b', so after C's step, the string must have at least one 'c' as well. So the string must contain 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nWait, but what about cases where only two steps are done? For example, A adds 'a's, B adds 'b's, but C doesn't add any 'c's? No, because the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. So the string must have all three letters.\n\nSo, the string must have at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nThird, the count of 'c's must be equal to the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSteps to check:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form a^+ b^+ c^+. That is, the string starts with one or more 'a's, then one or more 'b's, then one or more 'c's. If any other order or interleaving, it's invalid.\n\n2. Ensure that the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are all at least 1.\n\n3. Check that the number of 'c's equals either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, processing the string:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and track the current expected characters. Once a transition is made (from 'a' to 'b', or 'b' to 'c'), we shouldn't go back.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nInitialize state as 'a'. As we iterate each character:\n\n- if current char is same as current state: continue.\n- else, if it's the next expected state (e.g., from 'a' to 'b' or 'b' to 'c'): switch to that state.\n- else: invalid.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nstate = 'a'\n\nfor char in S:\n    if char == state:\n        continue\n    elif char == next_state:\n        state = next_state\n    else:\n        return False\n\nBut wait, the next state after 'a' is 'b', then 'c'. So, perhaps:\n\nstates = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\ncurrent_state = 0  # index into states\nfor char in S:\n    if char == states[current_state]:\n        continue\n    elif char == states[current_state + 1]:\n        current_state += 1\n    else:\n        # invalid character in wrong order\n        return False\n\nSo, for example, if the string is 'aabba', the second 'b' is fine, but then the third 'a' is not allowed because current_state would be 'b' (index 1), and 'a' is not states[1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific process involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order with certain constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and end with one or more 'c's. This means the string should not have any interleaving or out-of-order characters.\n2. **Check Presence of All Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n3. **Count Check for 'c'**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is empty\nif not s:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Define the expected order: a -> b -> c\nexpected_order = ['a', 'b', 'c']\ncurrent_char = 0  # current position in expected_order\n\nfor c in s:\n    if c == expected_order[current_char]:\n        continue\n    elif c == expected_order[current_char + 1]:\n        current_char += 1\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\n# Now check if all three are present and count of c matches\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\n# Must have at least one of each\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check if c equals a or b\nif count_c != count_a and count_c != count_b:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: We iterate through each character in the string and ensure that they follow the sequence 'a' -> 'b' -> 'c'. If any character breaks this sequence, the string is invalid.\n2. **Character Presence Check**: After ensuring the correct order, we count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' to ensure each is present at least once.\n3. **Count Validation**: Finally, we check if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If all conditions are met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions in a single pass through the string, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum input size.",
