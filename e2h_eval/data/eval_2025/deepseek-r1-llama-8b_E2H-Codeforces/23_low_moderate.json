            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). \n\nLet me break down the problem. The input is three tiles, each represented by a string like \"1m\". I need to find for each possible way of adding tiles, the minimal number required to form a mentsu in any of the suits.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that Tokitsukaze has three tiles and can draw any tiles, including duplicates. So after drawing some tiles, she'll have more than three, but as long as there's at least one mentsu in the entire set, it's sufficient.\n\nHmm, but wait, when considering what she has after adding some tiles, we have to see if any subset of four tiles (since she starts with three and adds one or more) forms a mentsu. Or wait, no— the problem says that after adding, she must have a mentsu. So her total tiles after adding will be 3 + k, where k is the number of tiles drawn. And within those 3 +k tiles, there exists at least one mentsu.\n\nSo for example, if she draws zero tiles, then she just checks if the initial three tiles form a mentsu. If not, she needs to draw more.\n\nSo the approach is: for each possible way of adding tiles (0, 1, 2, etc.), check if the new set of tiles includes at least one mentsu, and find the minimal such k.\n\nBut since the number of possible draws is potentially infinite, we can't try all possibilities. So we need a smarter way.\n\nI think the key here is to consider all possible mentsu options, and for each, compute how many additional tiles are needed beyond the current ones to complete that mentsu.\n\nFor example, suppose in her current hand, she has two tiles of a certain kind that are part of a triplet. Then she just needs one more of that tile to form a triplet.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences, if she has two consecutive tiles in a suit, she needs the third.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), check how many tiles she already has in that mentsu.\n\n2. For each such mentsu, determine how many tiles she needs to add to complete it.\n\n3. Find the mentsu that requires the smallest number of additional tiles.\n\n4. The minimal k across all possible mentsus is the answer.\n\nWait, but each mentsu is a group of exactly three tiles. So for each mentsu, we can calculate how many of its tiles are present in the current hand. The number of tiles needed to complete this mentsu is 3 minus the count of existing tiles. But since she can have multiple copies, for a triplet, she needs at least three, so if she already has two, she needs one more.\n\nFor example, let's say the current hand is [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then, for the triplet 1m, she has two, so needs one more. For the sequence 1m,2m,3m, she has two, so needs one more. The minimal is one, so she can draw 1m, making the triplet, or 3m, making the sequence.\n\nSo for each possible mentsu, compute the number of tiles missing, and take the minimal across all mentsus.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Enumerate all possible mentsus.\n\nEach mentsu can be of two types:\n\n1. Triplet: three identical tiles.\n\n   For each suit, there are 9 possible triplets (1m, 1p, 1s; 2m, etc.)\n\n2. Sequence: three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n   For each suit, there are 7 possible sequences (1-2-3m, 2-3-4m, ..., 7-8-9m).\n\nSo total mentsus are 9 (triplets) + 3*7 (sequences) = 9+21=30.\n\nWait, 3 suits, 7 sequences each: 21. Plus 9 triplets makes 30.\n\nSo for each of these 30 mentsus, we can compute how many tiles are present in the current hand, and the required number of tiles to add is max(0, 3 - current_count). Because if she has all three, she doesn't need to add anything.\n\nThen, among all 30 mentsus, find the one with the smallest required tiles, and that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. Because after adding the necessary tiles, she might have more than one ments",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Mentsu Types**: There are two types of mentsu:\n   - **Triplet (Koutsu)**: Three identical tiles.\n   - **Sequence (Shuntsu)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n2. **Enumerate All Possible Mentsus**: For each suit (m, p, s), there are 9 possible triplets and 7 possible sequences, resulting in a total of 30 mentsus.\n\n3. **Check Current Hand Against Each Mentsu**: For each possible mentsu, count how many of its tiles are present in Tokitsukaze's current hand. The number of additional tiles needed to complete the mentsu is `3 - count`.\n\n4. **Find Minimum Tiles Needed**: Among all possible mentsus, find the one that requires the fewest additional tiles. This gives the minimum number of extra tiles needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_extra_tiles():\n    from itertools import product\n\n    def is_sequence(t1, t2, t3):\n        return (t1[0] == t2[0] and t2[0] == t3[0]) and (int(t1[0]) + 2 == int(t3[0]))\n\n    tiles = input().split()\n    current = {tile: True for tile in tiles}\n\n    # Generate all possible triplets and sequences\n    suits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    min_needed = float('inf')\n\n    # Check all triplets\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        for suit in suits:\n            tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n            count = current.get(tile, False)\n            needed = 3 - count\n            if needed < min_needed:\n                min_needed = needed\n\n    # Check all sequences\n    for suit in suits:\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            t1 = f\"{start}{suit}\"\n            t2 = f\"{start+1}{suit}\"\n            t3 = f\"{start+2}{suit}\"\n            count = sum(current.get(t, False) for t in [t1, t2, t3])\n            needed = 3 - count\n            if needed < min_needed:\n                min_needed = needed\n\n    print(min_needed)\n\nmin_extra_tiles()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three strings representing the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n2. **Current Tiles Tracking**: Use a dictionary to track which tiles are currently present.\n3. **Triplet Check**: For each possible triplet (e.g., 1m, 1p, 1s, etc.), count how many tiles are present and determine how many more are needed.\n4. **Sequence Check**: For each possible sequence (e.g., 1m-2m-3m, 2p-3p-4p, etc.), count how many tiles are present and determine how many more are needed.\n5. **Determine Minimum Extra Tiles**: Track the minimum number of extra tiles needed across all possible mentsus and print the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible mentsus and ensures that the solution is both optimal and efficient.",
