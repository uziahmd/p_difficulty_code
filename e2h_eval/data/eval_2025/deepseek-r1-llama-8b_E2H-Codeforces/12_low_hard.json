The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be at house ai, and all tasks with numbers less than i must be completed before the i-th task. So, the order matters as per their indices, not their values.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the note says that she can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So, for each task, it's about being in the correct position when needed. But the way it's phrased, the i-th task requires her to be at ai, and all tasks with j < i must be done before. So, she must process the tasks in the order 1 to m. So the first task is 1, then 2, etc., regardless of their positions.\n\nSo the approach is to find the earliest time she can finish all the tasks, considering that each task depends on the previous ones.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because moving along the ring takes time. Each move between adjacent houses is one unit of time. And the ring is circular, so from house n, you can go back to 1, which would take n-1 steps perhaps.\n\nWait, but the ring is such that each step moves to the next house in clockwise direction. So, the distance between two houses is the minimal number of steps to go from one to the other in the clockwise direction. Or wait, maybe it's just the minimal path, but since it's a ring, the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod n, but considering that the minimal step is either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Wait, but in this case, traffic is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So, Xenia can only move in the clockwise direction. So, she cannot move counterclockwise.\n\nOh right! Because the ringroad is one-way, and also is clockwise. So, she can't go the other way. So, movement is only possible in the clockwise direction. So, the only way to get from house a to b is by going around the ring in the clockwise direction. So, the distance is (b - a) mod n, but that's if b >=a. Otherwise, it's (n - a + b) mod n.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ring is 1, 2, ..., n arranged in a circle. Moving clockwise from 1 goes to 2, then 3, etc., up to n, then back to 1.\n\nSo, the distance between a and b in the clockwise direction is (b - a) if a <= b, else (n - a + b). So, for example, from 4 to 1 in a 4-house ring would be 4 → 1, which is 1 step.\n\nWait, no, because the ring is circular. So, 4 to 1 is just 1 step. So, the formula for the distance is (b - a) % n. Because (1 -4) mod 4 is 1, right? Because 1 -4 = -3, mod 4 is 1. Yes.\n\nSo, the minimal time to get from a to b is the minimal number of steps moving clockwise, which is (b - a) mod n. Because she can't go the other way.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: find the order of visiting the required houses a1, a2, ..., am, such that each step is moving from a_i to a_{i+1} in the clockwise direction, and the total steps are minimized, considering that the starting point is 1.\n\nWait, no. Because she has to perform all tasks in order. So, the first task is a1, second is a2, etc. So, she must be at a1 at some point before a2, which must be after a1, etc.\n\nWait, but the order of processing the tasks is fixed as 1,2,...m. So, for each i from 1 to m, she must be at ai at the time when she's processing that task.\n\nBut the initial position is 1. So, for the first task (i=1), she is already there. So, she doesn't need to move. Then, for i=2, she must be at a2. So, she can leave a1 and go directly to a2 in the minimal steps. Then, after that, she's at a2, and for the third task, she needs to be at a3, which could require moving from a2 to a3, possibly via other steps.\n\nWait, but after completing a task, she can choose to do other things. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks while moving along a ring of houses in a clockwise direction. Each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete tasks in the order they are given. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she can only move clockwise around the ring.\n2. **Movement Constraints**: Since movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, the distance between two houses `a` and `b` is calculated as `(b - a) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n3. **Task Completion Order**: Tasks must be completed in the given order, meaning Xenia must move from the current task's house to the next task's house in the minimal clockwise steps possible.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: We can compute the total time by summing the minimal steps required to move from each task's house to the next, starting from house 1.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor task in tasks:\n    # Move from current_pos to task\n    if current_pos == task:\n        continue\n    else:\n        steps = (task - current_pos) % n\n        total_time += steps\n        current_pos = task\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n2. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the minimal steps needed to move from the current position to the task's house using the formula `(task - current_pos) % n`.\n3. **Update Position and Time**: Add the calculated steps to the total time and update the current position to the task's house.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ring and the constraints on movement direction, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
