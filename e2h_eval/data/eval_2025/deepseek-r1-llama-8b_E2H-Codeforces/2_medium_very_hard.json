Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The definition they give is specific. So, Valera's paper is a square with n x n letters, where n is odd. The letters form an 'X' if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, for each test case, I need to:\n\n- Check that the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is all the same character.\n- Check that the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) is all the same character.\n- Ensure that both diagonals have the same character. Wait, no: the problem says both diagonals are the same. So the diagonal and anti-diagonal must consist of the same letter each, but all the other cells must be another single letter.\n\nWait, let me re-read the condition:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nOh right, so the two diagonals must each consist of the same letter, but perhaps different between the two? Or wait, no. Because the first part says both diagonals are the same. So the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must be the same character.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me see the example:\n\nIn the sample input, the second test case is 3x3:\n\nw s w\ns w s\nw s w\n\nSo the main diagonal is w, s, w? No, wait, no. Wait, for n=3, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So the characters are 'w', 'w', 'w'? Because the first row is 'wsw', so position (0,0) is 'w', (1,1) is 'w' (since the second row is 'sws'), (2,2) is 'w'. So main diagonal is all 'w's.\n\nAnti-diagonal is positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Looking at each row, (0,2) is 'w', (1,1) is 'w', (2,0) is 'w'. So both diagonals are 'w's.\n\nThen, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from 'w'. So in this case, the non-diagonal cells are 's's. So it's a valid 'X'.\n\nSo for the code, steps are:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. For each grid, check the following:\n\n   a. All elements on the main diagonal are the same character. Let's call this char 'd'.\n\n   b. All elements on the anti-diagonal are the same character. Let's call this char 'a'.\n\n   c. 'd' must equal 'a'? Because both diagonals must be the same letter.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says both diagonals are the same. So 'd' should be equal to 'a'. Otherwise, the condition fails.\n\nWait, the wording is: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same.\" So the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must each have the same letter, but they can be different from each other? Or do they have to be the same?\n\nWait, no, because in the example, both are 'w's. So the condition is that both diagonals are the same, but their own letters must be consistent within themselves. But do they have to be the same as each other?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"on both diagonals... all letters are the same\". So for each diagonal, all letters are the same, but maybe the two diagonals could have different letters. But then, the problem also states that \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nWait, no. Let me read the condition again:\n\nThe condition is:\n\n1. Both diagonals consist of the same letter.\n\nWait, no. The first part says \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So for both diagonals, all their letters are same. So the main diagonal has same letters, say 'd', and the anti-diagonal has same letters, say 'a'. Then, the other condition is that all non-diagonal cells are the same letter, say 'o', which is different from both 'd' and 'a'?\n\nWait, no. The problem says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells must be the same, and this letter must be different from both 'd' and 'a'? Or just different from whichever 'd' and 'a' are.\n\nWait, if 'd' and 'a' are the same, then the non-diagonal cells must be different from 'd'/'a'.\n\nIf 'd' and 'a' are different, then the non-diagonal cells must be a third letter, different from both.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, in the example, the diagonals are same (both 'w's), and the non-diagonal cells are all 's's, which is different from 'w's.\n\nSo, in code, I need to:\n\n- Check that all cells on the main diagonal are the same character (call this d).\n- Check that all cells on the anti-diagonal are the same character (call this a).\n- Check that d equals a.\n- Then, check that all non-diagonal cells are the same character o, which is not equal to d.\n\nWait, but if d equals a, then o must be different from d.\n\nSo steps:\n\nFor each grid:\n\n1. Extract the main diagonal and check all are same (d).\n\n2. Extract the anti-diagonal and check all are same (a).\n\n3. If d != a, condition fails.\n\n4. Then, collect all cells not on any diagonal and check they are all same (o).\n\n5. Also, o must not be equal to d (and since d == a, o must not equal a).\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, read n lines, each line is a string of length n. So we can store this as a 2D list or a list of strings.\n\nThen, for each grid:\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nFor i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   cell = grid[i][i]\n\nCheck if all are same.\n\nSimilarly for anti-diagonal:\n\nFor i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   cell = grid[i][n-1 -i]\n\nCheck if all are same.\n\nAlso, ensure that d == a.\n\nIf any of these checks fail, return NO.\n\nElse, collect all the non-diagonal cells.\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif i != j and i + j != n-1 (since j = n-1 -i would be the anti-diagonal).\n\nWait, no. Because for a cell to be on the anti-diagonal, j must be n-1 -i. So, for a cell (i,j), if j == n-1 -i, it's on anti-diagonal.\n\nSo, non-diagonal cells are those where i !=j and j != n-1 -i.\n\nWait, but for a cell to be on both diagonals, it can only happen when i = j and j = n-1 -i. Which implies 2i = n-1 -i → 3i = n-1 → i = (n-1)/3. But since n is odd, n-1 is even, so (n-1)/3 may not be integer. So for odd n >=3, the main diagonal and anti-diagonal only intersect at the center cell if n is 3 or higher.\n\nWait, for n=3: 3i = 2 → i=2/3, which is not integer. So the center cell is (1,1). For i=1, j=1, which is on main diagonal, and j= n-1 -i = 1 as well. So for n=3, the center cell is on both diagonals.\n\nWait, for n=5: the center is (2,2). For i=2, j=2, which is on main diagonal. For j=5-1-2=2, so same cell. So for n=5, the center is on both.\n\nSo for n=3, the center is on both.\n\nThus, when collecting the non-diagonal cells, we need to exclude all cells that are either on main diagonal or anti-diagonal.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j):\n\nif i == j or j == (n-1 -i): it's on a diagonal, so skip.\n\nElse: include in non-diagonal.\n\nWait, but for cells on both diagonals (like the center in n=3 and n=5), they will be included in both main and anti-diagonal. But since they are on diagonals, they are excluded.\n\nSo, to collect all non-diagonal cells, for each cell, check whether it's on either diagonal.\n\nOnce collected, all these cells must have the same character, and that character must be different from d.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid as list of strings.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nd = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    if grid[i][i] != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        proceed to next test case.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal:\n\na = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    if grid[i][n-1 - i] != a:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        proceed to next test case.\n\nIf d != a, print \"NO\".\n\nElse, collect all non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diagonal = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or j == (n-1 -i):\n            continue\n        else:\n            non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\nNow, check if all elements in non_diagonal are same, and that they are different from d.\n\nif len(non_diagonal) == 0: # which happens only when n=1, but n >=3.\n\nBut for n>=3, non_diagonal is non-empty.\n\nSo, first_char = non_diagonal[0]\n\nfor c in non_diagonal[1:]:\n    if c != first_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        proceed.\n\nCheck if first_char != d.\n\nIf yes, then output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nWait, but what if non_diagonal is empty? That can't happen since n is at least 3, so non_diagonal has (n^2 - 2n +1) = (n-1)^2 elements, which is positive.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=3.\n\nAll main diagonal and anti-diagonal are 'x's.\n\nOther cells are 'o's.\n\nWhich is the sample input 2, which outputs YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nMain diagonal is 'a's, anti-diagonal is 'b's. So condition fails, since d != a.\n\nAnother case: main and anti-diagonal are 'a's, but non-diagonal includes a mix of 'a's and 'b's. So condition fails.\n\nAnother case: main diagonal is 'a's, anti is 'a's, non-diagonal all 'a's. So condition fails because non-diagonal is same as d.\n\nAnother case: main diagonal is 'a's, anti is 'a's, non-diagonal all 'b's. So this is correct, output YES.\n\nWhat about n=1? Well, n is given as >=3 and odd.\n\nNow, code-wise, let's plan.\n\nIn Python, read n as integer.\n\nThen read n lines. Each line is a string. So, for example, in the sample input, the first test case is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox'\n\nWait, no, the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a line. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWait, each element is a string, starting with n, then the next n lines.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first line is the integer n. Then, the next n lines are the grid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, process the grid.\n\nSo, now, step through each grid.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, each grid is represented as a single string, but the actual input is split into multiple lines.\n\nWait, no. For example, the first input is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox' — which represents 5 lines. So in code, reading grid as [input().strip() for _ in range(n)] is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, in the sample input, the first element is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox' — which is a string containing multiple newlines. So when you split by '\\n', it's incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Oh wait, perhaps the way the input is presented is confusing. Because in the problem statement, the input is a list of strings, each representing a test case. But each test case is a multi-line string.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each test case is a single string, which contains n lines, each separated by \\n.\n\nSo for example, the first test case is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox' — which is 6 lines, but wait, n is 5, so that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is a single string, but the actual input is provided via standard input as multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the sample is written is misleading. Because in the problem statement, the input is:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo, the input is:\n\nn\n\nline1\n\nline2\n\n...\n\nlinen\n\nSo, for the sample input:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nWhich is three test cases.\n\nSo, the sample input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo, the input is read as n, followed by n lines.\n\nThus, in code, we can read n, then read n lines, each being a string of n characters.\n\nSo, in code, the grid is a list of n strings, each of length n.\n\nSo, the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, stripping whitespace, each as a string.\n\nThen, for each grid:\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nd = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   if grid[i][i] != d → invalid.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal:\n\na = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   if grid[i][n-1 -i] != a → invalid.\n\nIf d != a → invalid.\n\nCollect all non-diagonal cells.\n\nIf any non-diagonal cell has a different character than the first → invalid.\n\nAnd, the first non-diagonal cell's character must be different from d.\n\nIf all conditions met → output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, let's think about some possible bugs.\n\nWhat about when the grid is such that d is not present elsewhere, but the other conditions are met.\n\nWait, no, because the non-diagonal cells must all be same as each other and different from d.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, grid is:\n\naba\n\nbab\n\naba\n\nWait, main diagonal is a, a, a.\n\nanti-diagonal is a, a, a.\n\nSo d = a, a = a.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: positions (0,1)=b, (1,0)=b, (1,2)=a, (2,1)=a, etc. Wait, no:\n\nWait, for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (0,2?), wait no.\n\nWait, for n=3:\n\ncells:\n\n(0,0) → diagonal.\n\n(0,1) → not diagonal.\n\n(0,2) → anti-diagonal.\n\n(1,0) → not diagonal.\n\n(1,1) → diagonal.\n\n(1,2) → anti-diagonal.\n\n(2,0) → anti-diagonal.\n\n(2,1) → not diagonal.\n\n(2,2) → diagonal.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (2,1).\n\nIn this example, the non-diagonal cells are b, b, b. So it's a valid X.\n\nWait, but the anti-diagonal includes (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). In this example, (0,2) is 'a', (1,1) is 'a', (2,0) is 'a' → all same as a.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\nHere, all diagonals are a, but non-diagonal are a as well. So the condition fails because the non-diagonal is same as d. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\na a b\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\nMain diagonal: a, a, a → ok.\n\nAnti-diagonal: b, a, a → not all same. So condition fails.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\na a a\n\nb b b\n\na a a\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, a → not same. Condition fails.\n\nSo, code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Off-by-one errors in the loops.\n\n- Handling the anti-diagonal correctly.\n\n- Making sure that the main and anti-diagonal are same.\n\n- Handling the case where n=1, but n is >=3.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nImplementing in Python.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nLoop over each grid:\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nd = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   if grid[i][i] != d → invalid.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal:\n\na = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   j = n-1 -i\n\n   if grid[i][j] != a → invalid.\n\nif d != a → invalid.\n\nThen, collect non-diagonal:\n\nnon_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   for j in range(n):\n\n       if i == j or j == (n-1 -i):\n\n           continue\n\n       non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(non_diag) == 0:\n\n   # Not possible since n>=3.\n\nelse:\n\n   first = non_diag[0]\n\n   for c in non_diag[1:]:\n\n       if c != first:\n\n           invalid.\n\n   if first != d → valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, code.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSample Output: YES.\n\nIn code:\n\nn=3.\n\ngrid is:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nCheck main diagonal: (0,0) = 'w', (1,1) = 'w', (2,2) = 'w' → same.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,2)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,0)='w' → same.\n\nd=a='w'.\n\nnon_diag cells: (0,1) = 's', (1,0)='s', (2,1)='s' → all 's' and 's' != 'w' → valid. So output YES.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nMain diagonal: x, o, o, o, x → not all same. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nThird sample:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: x, p, x → same?\n\nWait, grid is:\n\nx p x\n\np x p\n\nx p e\n\nWait, no, wait the third row is 'xpe' → j ranges 0,1,2.\n\nSo (0,0) = 'x', (1,1) = 'x' (second row is 'pxp'), (2,2) = 'e'.\n\nSo main diagonal is x, x, e → not same. So condition fails. So output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3:\n\naba\n\nbab\n\naba\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, a → not same. So condition fails.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nMain and anti-diagonals are a. Non-diagonal are a. So condition fails.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\nbbb\n\naaa\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, a → not same. So condition fails.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nMain diagonal: a, a, a → ok.\n\nAnti-diagonal: a, a, a → ok.\n\nNon-diagonal: (0,1)=a, (1,0)=a, (2,1)=a.\n\nSo all same as a. So condition fails.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\nbaa\n\naaa\n\nMain diagonal: a, a, a → ok.\n\nAnti-diagonal: a, a, a → ok.\n\nNon-diagonal: (0,1) = a, (1,0) = b, (2,1) = a.\n\nSo non-diagonal has a, b, a → not same. So condition fails.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3:\n\naba\n\nbab\n\nbab\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, b → not same. So condition fails.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=5.\n\nMain diagonal: a.\n\nAnti-diagonal: a.\n\nNon-diagonal: all b.\n\nSo condition is met.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=5.\n\nMain diagonal: a.\n\nAnti-diagonal: a.\n\nNon-diagonal: some are a, others are b.\n\nSo condition fails.\n\nThus, code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nSo, the code will read n, then read n lines.\n\nThen, for each grid, perform the checks.\n\nIf any check fails, output NO.\n\nElse, after all checks, output YES.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    # Check main diagonal\n    d = grid[0][0]\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n    \n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    a = grid[0][n-1]\n    for i in range(n):\n        j = n - 1 - i\n        if grid[i][j] != a:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n    \n    if d != a:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n    \n    # Collect non-diagonal cells\n    non_diag = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or j == (n-1 -i):\n                continue\n            non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n    \n    if not non_diag:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n    \n    first = non_diag[0]\n    for c in non_diag[1:]:\n        if c != first:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n    \n    if first != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n    \n    # All conditions satisfied\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but in code, the variable 'valid' is reused. So after checking main diagonal, it's set to True if all are same. Then, if any check fails, it's set to False. So, after each check, the code breaks and prints NO.\n\nBut in the code, after checking main diagonal, if invalid, print NO and break. Then, the loop continues to the next grid.\n\nWait, no: because in the code, for each grid, it's inside a for loop that runs n times. So for each grid, the code checks and decides whether it's valid.\n\nWait, no. The code structure is:\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n   process grid\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, each test case is a separate grid. So the code is wrong because it's processing all grids as a single loop, not per test case.\n\nWait, no. Because the input is n test cases.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, the problem says the first line is n. Then, the next n lines describe Valera's paper. So each test case is one grid. So the code above reads n grids, but the problem expects us to process each grid as a test case and output YES/NO for each.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because the code is written as for _ in range(n): process(grid), but in the problem, each grid is a separate test case.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo, the input is n lines, each line being a grid.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first line is n. Then, the next n lines are the grids. So each of the next n lines is a single grid.\n\nSo, the code should process each grid as a test case, and for each, output YES or NO.\n\nSo, the code should read n, then read n grids, each consisting of n lines, each line being a string.\n\nWait, no, the input is n lines, each being a string of n letters.\n\nSo, the code should read n grids, each being a single line, but the problem says that each grid is n lines.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is that the input is a list of test cases, each consisting of n lines.\n\nNo, the problem says the input is:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo, the code should read n grids, each as a single line of n letters.\n\nWait, no. No, that's not correct. Because each grid is n x n letters, so each grid is represented by n lines, each of n letters.\n\nSo, for example, the first test case is a 5x5 grid, which is represented by 5 lines, each of 5 letters.\n\nThus, the code must read n, then read n lines, each line being a string of n letters. Then, for each of these n grids, process them.\n\nSo, the code in the previous approach is wrong because it's processing all n grids as a single loop, not as separate test cases.\n\nSo, the code structure is incorrect.\n\nAh, that's a big mistake. So the code needs to process each grid as a separate test case, outputting YES or NO for each.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen, for _ in range(n):\n\n   read a grid (n lines, each of length n)\n\n   process the grid.\n\n   output YES or NO.\n\nSo, the code should have a loop that runs n times, each time reading a grid.\n\nSo, the corrected code:\n\nn = int(input())\nfor _ in range(n):\n    grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n    # process grid\n    # check main diagonal\n    d = None\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i >= len(grid) or len(grid[i]) < i+1:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        c = grid[i][i]\n        if d is None:\n            d = c\n        else:\n            if c != d:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    # check anti-diagonal\n    a = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        j = n-1 -i\n        if i >= len(grid) or len(grid[i]) < j+1:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        c = grid[i][j]\n        if a is None:\n            a = c\n        else:\n            if c != a:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    if d != a:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    # collect non-diagonal\n    non_diag = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or j == n-1 -i:\n                continue\n            non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n    \n    if not non_diag:\n        # impossible for n >=3\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    first = non_diag[0]\n    for c in non_diag[1:]:\n        if c != first:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    if first != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but what if a grid has varying row lengths? Like some rows are longer than others. So, in the code, when accessing grid[i][j], it's assumed that each row is exactly n characters. So, perhaps in the code, we should check that each row is length n.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's given that each line is n letters.\n\nSo, perhaps the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps add checks.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the inputs are correct.\n\nSo, in the code, for each grid, read n lines, each line is stripped. So, for each grid, len(grid) is n, and each row is len(row) = n.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nThus, the code now processes each grid as a test case, and for each, performs the checks.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo, the code will process each grid in turn.\n\nFirst grid:\n\nn=5.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\ngrid[0][0] = 'x'\n\ngrid[1][1] = 'o' → different → condition fails. So output NO.\n\nSecond grid:\n\nn=3.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\ngrid[0][0] = 'w'\n\ngrid[1][1] = 'w'\n\ngrid[2][2] = 'w' → same.\n\nAnti-diagonal:\n\ngrid[0][2] = 'w'\n\ngrid[1][1] = 'w'\n\ngrid[2][0] = 'w' → same.\n\nd == a → 'w' == 'w'.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1) = 's', (1,0) = 's', (2,1) = 's' → same, and 's' != 'w' → output YES.\n\nThird grid:\n\nn=3.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\ngrid[0][0] = 'x'\n\ngrid[1][1] = 'p'\n\ngrid[2][2] = 'e' → different → condition fails → output NO.\n\nSo, the code produces the sample output correctly.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\". The grid must meet specific conditions for it to be considered as an \"X\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the integer `n` and the subsequent `n x n` grid.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: For each grid, check if both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) consist of the same character.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Ensure all cells not on either diagonal contain the same character, which is different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nfor _ in range(n):\n    grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    valid = True\n    \n    # Check main diagonal\n    d = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        if d is None:\n            d = grid[i][i]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][i] != d:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    a = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        j = n - 1 - i\n        if a is None:\n            a = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != a:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    if d != a:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    # Collect non-diagonal cells\n    non_diag = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or j == n - 1 - i:\n                continue\n            non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n    \n    if not non_diag:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    first = non_diag[0]\n    for c in non_diag[1:]:\n        if c != first:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    if first != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    \n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n` and then reads `n` lines to form the grid.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: It iterates through the main diagonal to ensure all elements are the same.\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, it checks the anti-diagonal for uniformity.\n4. **Diagonal Consistency**: If the main and anti-diagonals do not have the same character, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n5. **Non-Diagonal Check**: All non-diagonal cells are collected and checked to ensure they are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n6. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, the code prints \"YES\" if the grid meets all conditions, otherwise \"NO\".",
