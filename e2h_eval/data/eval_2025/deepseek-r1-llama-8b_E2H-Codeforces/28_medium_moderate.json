String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of \"beautiful\" strings based on certain criteria. The beautiful string has to meet specific conditions related to the counts of '0's and '1's, as well as how modifications can be applied to reach a certain state.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the string s consists only of 0s and 1s. It must have exactly n zeros and m ones. So the total length is n + m. \n\nAdditionally, we can perform some modifications to get to a target character g (which is either 0 or 1). Each modification is replacing the last two characters with one character. For example, if the last two are both 0, replace them with a single 0. If they're different, replace them with 0.\n\nWait, no: the problem says, \"exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" Oh right, so if the two last characters are both 0, they become a 1. Wait, wait. Let me recheck:\n\nNo, wait. Wait the description says: the character is 1 if it replaces two zeros, else 0. So for two zeros, replace with 1; otherwise, replace with 0.\n\nSo each modification reduces the length by 1, since two characters are replaced by one.\n\nBut the initial string can't be modified if its length is less than two.\n\nNow, the goal is to find the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string where the last character is g, possibly after some modifications.\n\nWait, no. The problem says, \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\"\n\nAh, so the final string after modifications must end with g. So the original string can be modified any number of times (including zero) such that the resulting string ends with g.\n\nWait, but each modification changes the last two characters into one. So the process is: repeatedly modify the string by looking at the last two characters and replacing them as per the rule, until you can't modify anymore (because the string length is less than two).\n\nWait, but each modification is optional. So for a given beautiful string, we can choose to perform some number of modifications, and after all those modifications, the last character must be g.\n\nSo the problem is to count all beautiful strings (with exactly n 0s and m 1s) such that there exists a sequence of modifications leading to a string whose last character is g.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final string must end with exactly g. So regardless of how many modifications are done, the end result should have last character g.\n\nBut how do the modifications affect the last character?\n\nLet me think about how the last character changes with each modification.\n\nEach modification affects the last two characters. So for each step, the new last character depends on the previous two.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf the string is '00', modifying it gives '1'. So the last character becomes 1.\n\nIf the string is '01', modifying it gives '0' because the two are different, so the replacement is 0.\n\nWait, no: the replacement is 1 only if the two are both 0. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nSo for '01', the last two are 0 and 1, which are different. So replacing them with 0. So the string becomes '0'.\n\nAnother example: '10' → last two are 1 and 0 → different → replace with 0. So the string becomes '0'.\n\nWait, but what about a longer string? Like '0100' → after one modification, it becomes '0100' minus the last two (0 and 0) → replaced by 1. So now it's '0101'? Wait no, wait: when you modify, you remove the last two and add one. So '0100' has four characters. After modification, it becomes '010' (since the last two 0s are replaced by a 1).\n\nWait, no: '0100' → the last two are '0' and '0', so they become '1'. So the new string is '010' (length 3). Then, since the length is still ≥2, you can perform another modification. The last two are '1' and '0' → different, so replaced by 0. So the string becomes '00' (length 2). Another modification: the two 0s are replaced by 1 → string becomes '1'. Now it can't be modified further.\n\nSo the last character changes through the process.\n\nHmm, the key is to model how the last few characters evolve after each modification.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe we can model the possible endings of the string.\n\nWait, the problem requires that after some modifications, the last character is g. So perhaps we can model the possible ways the last character can end up as g after a certain number of modifications.\n\nBut considering all possibilities may be tricky. Maybe we can model the process in reverse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the possible last characters after any number of modifications and see whether g is among them.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given beautiful string, we can simulate the possible last characters after all possible numbers of modifications and see if any of them is g.\n\nBut for a string of length L, the maximum number of modifications is floor(L/2), because each modification reduces the length by 1. So for a string of length L, the possible number of modifications is 0, 1, ..., up to (L-1)/2 steps.\n\nWait, no: each modification reduces the length by 1. So starting with length K, after k modifications, the length is K -k. We can perform k from 0 up to K-1, because K-k must be ≥1.\n\nWait, but the modifications are applied in a way that each time, the last two characters are replaced. So the order of modifications matters. But perhaps for our purposes, we can model the possible end states based on the initial last two characters and their transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the parity of the number of possible modifications, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the crucial insight is that the last character after any number of modifications can only be 0 or 1, depending on the initial string's last few characters.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the problem can be broken down into finding all possible beautiful strings where, after any number of allowed modifications, the last character is g.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a beautiful string s, the minimal number of modifications needed to reach a string ending with g is considered. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the last character after any number of modifications depends on the initial last two characters and the way modifications are applied.\n\nWait, let's think about the process. Each modification takes the last two characters and replaces them according to the rule. So, each modification effectively reduces the length by 1 and changes the last character based on the previous two.\n\nBut perhaps the process can be represented as a state machine, where each state is the current last two characters.\n\nWait, but the process is deterministic once the last two characters are known. Because each step modifies them into a new character, which becomes the last character of the new string.\n\nSo, for a string, the last character after k modifications is determined by the initial string's last two characters and the sequence of modifications.\n\nWait, but each modification is optional. So perhaps for a given string, the possible last characters after any number of modifications could form a set. We need to check if g is in this set.\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy if we have to consider all possible beautiful strings, especially since n and m can be up to 105.\n\nHmm, but n and m can be up to 105, so the total number of beautiful strings is C(n+m, n), which can be as big as around 1e20 for n=m=105. That's way too big to handle directly.\n\nSo we can't generate all beautiful strings and process each one. We need a dynamic programming approach.\n\nSo, the approach needs to model the possible transitions in the last characters as modifications are applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled by tracking the last character after each possible number of modifications, and whether it can reach g.\n\nWait, but how does the initial string's structure influence this? Because the initial string has a certain number of 0s and 1s, but the way the last characters change depends on the initial last two.\n\nHmm, maybe the idea is to model the possible last two characters of the string after each possible number of modifications.\n\nWait, but the number of modifications is variable, so perhaps we can model the state as the last two characters and the current length.\n\nBut again, considering the large possible n and m, this might not be feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about what possible sequences of modifications can lead to a string ending with g.\n\nEach modification replaces the last two characters with one, which depends on their values. So, the last character after each step is determined by the previous two.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the last character after any number of modifications depends on the initial last two characters and the number of modifications applied.\n\nWait, maybe we can model the possible last characters for each possible initial pair of last characters.\n\nFor example, suppose the initial last two are '00'. Then, the first modification will replace them with '1', making the last character '1'. Since the new string has length L-1, we can perform another modification if possible.\n\nWait, but the new last two would be the third last and the new last. Hmm, but this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process can be considered as a series of steps where each step depends on the current last two bits.\n\nBut this might get complicated quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps the process can be represented as a finite state machine, where each state is the current last two bits. Each transition represents a modification, leading to a new state (the last two bits after modification). \n\nBut for a string of length up to 200 (since n and m are up to 105 each, sum up to 210), the number of possible states is manageable.\n\nSo, for each possible pair of last two bits (00, 01, 10, 11), and for each possible number of modifications, we can track whether it's possible to reach a state where the last character is g.\n\nWait, but the number of possible steps is up to 105, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible initial pair (a, b), compute all possible reachable last characters after any number of modifications.\n\nBut how does this help us count the number of beautiful strings that can reach a last character of g?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each beautiful string, we can compute the possible last two bits after zero or more modifications, and see if any of these options leads to the last character being g.\n\nBut considering that each beautiful string has exactly n 0s and m 1s, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the counts of 0s and 1s in the prefix of the string, and the last two bits.\n\nWait, but the beautiful string has fixed counts of 0s and 1s. So the problem is to find the number of such strings where, after any number of allowed modifications, the last character is g.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the possible last two bits of the string after zero or more modifications, and whether any of those can result in a last character equal to g.\n\nBut then, the problem reduces to determining for each beautiful string whether the initial last two bits can reach a state where the last character is g via some modifications.\n\nBut again, considering all beautiful strings is impossible due to their quantity.\n\nSo perhaps we can model the problem by considering the possible last two bits of the beautiful string, and for each possible pair, determine if there's a way to modify it to end with g.\n\nThen, for each beautiful string, the last two bits can be any possible pair, and if any of the possible modified versions ends with g, then the string is counted.\n\nSo the problem becomes: count the number of beautiful strings where, for their last two bits, there exists a sequence of modifications that leads to a last character of g.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the possible transitions between the last two bits and the resulting last character after each modification.\n\nEach modification step can be thought of as replacing the last two bits (a, b) with a new bit c, which is 1 if a == b == 0, else 0.\n\nSo for each possible state (a, b), applying a modification gives a new state (b, c), where c is determined by a and b.\n\nBut wait, after a modification, the last two bits become (b, c). Or, perhaps, the new last two bits are (b, c) if the string was longer than two.\n\nWait, perhaps the state after a modification is (b, c), because the last two bits are now the previous second last and the new last.\n\nWait, no: When you have a string S of length L, and you take the last two bits (a, b), replace them with c. The new string has length L-1. The last two bits of this new string are (b, c), since the new string is S[0..L-2] followed by c.\n\nSo the state transitions are as follows:\n\nFrom state (a, b):\n\n- If we perform a modification, the next state is (b, c), where c is 1 if a == b == 0, else 0.\n\nWait, but wait: when you perform a modification, you're replacing the last two bits with one. So the new string's last two bits would be the previous last bit before the two, and the new bit c. So yes, the new state is (b, c).\n\nSo for example:\n\nOriginal state: 01 → a=0, b=1.\n\nAfter modification, since a and b are different, c is 0. So the new state is (1, 0).\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Let me think: if the string is '01', the last two are 0 and 1. Modify them: since they are different, replace with 0. So the new string is '0', which has length 1, so no more modifications can be done. So the last character is 0.\n\nWait, but in the state transition, the new state is (b, c) = (1, 0). But the string is now length 1, so no more modifications. So the last character is 0, which is the same as the 'c' in this case.\n\nWait, perhaps the state (a, b) represents the last two bits. But the last character is b, and the new state after modification is (b, c). However, when the length is 1, the state can't transition further.\n\nBut for the problem, the important thing is whether, through any number of modifications, the last character can be g.\n\nSo for each state (a, b), we can model the possible last characters after any number of modifications.\n\nWait, perhaps for each state (a, b), the last character can be determined based on how many modifications are applied.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. For a given state (a, b), what can be the last characters after any number of modifications.\n\nCase 1: perform 0 modifications. Then, the last character is b.\n\nCase 2: perform 1 modification. Then, the last two are a and b, which are replaced by c (as per the rules). The new state is (b, c). The last character is c.\n\nCase 3: perform 2 modifications. Then, after the first modification, the state is (b, c1), and after the second, the state is (c1, c2), and the last character is c2.\n\nWait, but each modification reduces the length by 1. So after k modifications, the length is L - k, where L is the initial length.\n\nWait, but for our problem, the initial beautiful string has length n + m. So the maximum possible number of modifications is (n + m) - 1. But that's a lot.\n\nBut for the last character to be g, perhaps it's sufficient to find whether there exists a k such that, after k modifications, the last character is g.\n\nBut how to model this for all possible beautiful strings.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a finite automaton, where each state represents the current last two bits, and transitions represent the effect of a modification. Then, for each state, determine whether it's possible to reach a state where the last character is g, possibly after any number of modifications.\n\nOnce we have this information, we can count the number of beautiful strings that have an initial last two bits that can reach a state ending with g.\n\nBut how do we model the initial last two bits for a beautiful string?\n\nWait, for a beautiful string, the entire string consists of exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the last two bits can be any possible pair, as long as the rest of the string satisfies the counts.\n\nSo perhaps we can precompute for each possible pair (a, b) whether it's possible to reach a state where the last character is g, and then multiply by the number of beautiful strings that end with (a, b).\n\nBut then, for each (a, b), we need to determine if it's possible to reach a state where the last character is g.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each possible pair (a, b) (a and b are 0 or 1) whether there exists a sequence of modifications that leads to a string ending with g.\n\n2. For each such (a, b), calculate the number of beautiful strings that end with (a, b). Multiply this by whether (a, b) can reach g, and sum all these products.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n- Determine for each (a, b) whether it can reach g.\n\n- For each (a, b), compute the number of beautiful strings that end with (a, b).\n\n- Sum over all (a, b) pairs where (a, b) can reach g, multiplied by their counts.\n\nBut how to compute the count of beautiful strings ending with (a, b).\n\nWait, a beautiful string is a binary string of length N = n + m, containing exactly n 0s and m 1s. So, for a string ending with (a, b), the rest of the string (positions 0 to N-2) must contain n - (a == 0 ? 1 : 0) 0s and m - (b == 0 ? 1 : 0) 1s.\n\nWait, yes. So for a given ending (a, b), the number of beautiful strings ending with (a, b) is equal to the number of ways to arrange the remaining n' 0s and m' 1s in the first N-2 positions.\n\nWhere:\n\nn' = n - (a == 0 ? 1 : 0)\n\nm' = m - (b == 0 ? 1 : 0)\n\nBut wait, only if a is 0 and b is 0, then n' = n-1, m' = m-0.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the last two are 00, then the total number of 0s is 2. So the remaining part has n - 2 0s and m 1s.\n\nSimilarly, if the last two are 01, then the remaining part has n-1 0s and m-1 1s.\n\nSo, the count is C( (N-2) , (n' ), m') ), but only if n' >=0 and m' >=0.\n\nOtherwise, the count is zero.\n\nSo, for each (a, b), compute the number of beautiful strings ending with (a, b) as:\n\nif (n >= a_0 and m >= b_1) and (n - a_0 + m - b_1) == N - 2,\n\nwhere a_0 is 1 if a is 0, else 0.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the last two characters contribute 2 to either 0s or 1s, but it's possible that a and b are the same or different.\n\nSo, the total number of 0s in the entire string is n, so the number of 0s in the first N-2 characters is n - (a == 0 ? 1 : 0) - (b == 0 ? 1 : 0).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the last two are a and b. So for 0s: if a is 0, it contributes 1, and if b is 0, it contributes another 1. So the total 0s is (a==0) + (b==0).\n\nThus, the number of 0s in the first N-2 positions is n - (a == 0 ? 1 : 0) - (b == 0 ? 1 : 0).\n\nSimilarly for 1s.\n\nWait, but for a beautiful string, n and m are the exact counts. So, in the first N-2 positions, the 0s count must be n_total_0 - (number of 0s in last two), and similarly for 1s.\n\nSo, for a given (a, b), the number of 0s in the first N-2 positions is:\n\ncount_0 = (a == 0) ? 1 : 0 + (b == 0) ? 1 : 0\n\nWait, no. Because the last two are a and b, so the total 0s is (a == 0) + (b == 0). So the remaining is n - (a == 0) - (b == 0).\n\nSimilarly for 1s: m_remaining = m - (a == 1) - (b == 1).\n\nWait, no: for 1s, it's (a == 1) + (b == 1). So m_remaining = m - (a == 1) - (b == 1).\n\nWait, no. Because in the last two, the count of 1s is (a == 1) + (b == 1). So m_remaining = m - (a == 1) - (b == 1).\n\nBut for a beautiful string, the total 0s is n, so the remaining is n_remaining = n - (a == 0) - (b == 0).\n\nSimilarly for 1s: m_remaining = m - (a == 1) - (b == 1).\n\nAnd the total length of the remaining part is N-2.\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the remaining 0s and 1s is C( (N-2), n_remaining, m_remaining ), but only if n_remaining >=0 and m_remaining >=0.\n\nOtherwise, it's zero.\n\nSo for each (a, b), compute:\n\nn_rem = n - (a == 0) - (b == 0)\n\nm_rem = m - (a == 1) - (b == 1)\n\nif n_rem < 0 or m_rem < 0, then count is 0.\n\nelse, the count is comb(n_rem + m_rem, n_rem) mod MOD.\n\nBecause the number of ways to arrange n_rem 0s and m_rem 1s in N-2 positions is C(n_rem + m_rem, n_rem).\n\nBut wait, what if n_rem + m_rem != N-2? Because N = n + m, so n_rem + m_rem = [n - (a0 + ab0)] + [m - (a1 + ab1)] = (n + m) - (a0 + ab0 + a1 + ab1).\n\nBut a0 is 1 if a is 0, else 0. Similarly for others.\n\nWait, a0 is (a == 0), a1 is (a == 1). Similarly for b.\n\nSo a0 + a1 = 1. Same for b.\n\nSo a0 + ab0 + a1 + ab1 = (a0 + a1) + (b0 + b1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThus, n_rem + m_rem = (n + m) - 2 = N-2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, for each (a, b), the count is C(n_rem + m_rem, n_rem) = C(N-2, n_rem) = C(N-2, m_rem).\n\nBut wait, n_rem + m_rem is N-2, so choosing n_rem is the same as choosing m_rem.\n\nSo, for each (a, b), if the required n_rem and m_rem are non-negative, then the count is C(n_rem + m_rem, n_rem), else 0.\n\nSo, the next step is to precompute all possible combinations, and for each (a, b), compute this count.\n\nBut n and m can be up to 105, so N can be up to 210, and N-2 can be up to 208.\n\nSo, we can precompute combination numbers up to 210 choose 105, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nNow, the next part is to determine for each (a, b) whether it's possible to reach a state where the last character is g.\n\nSo, for each (a, b), we need to see if, through any number of modifications, the last character can become g.\n\nTo model this, perhaps we can represent this as a graph where each node is a state (last two bits) and edges represent the modification steps.\n\nWe can model the transitions and see if there's a path from (a, b) to any state where the last character is g.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, each modification changes the state (a, b) to (b, c), where c is 1 if a and b are both 0, else 0.\n\nSo, for a state (a, b), performing a modification leads to (b, c).\n\nSo, for each state, we can explore all possible paths, keeping track of whether any path leads to a state where the last character is g.\n\nBut for the problem, the last character after any number of modifications must be g.\n\nWait, but each modification reduces the length by 1. So, for the initial string, after k modifications, the length is L - k, where L is the initial length.\n\nBut for a string of length L, after k modifications, the last character is determined by the state after k steps.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the process as a finite state machine, where each state is (last_two_bits), and transitions are the possible modifications.\n\nFor each state, we can track whether it's possible to reach a state where the last character is g.\n\nSo, for each (a, b), we can compute whether there exists a number of modifications that can lead to a state where the last character is g.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the last character after each modification is determined by the new state's last bit.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nInitial state (a, b): last character is b.\n\nAfter one modification, the state is (b, c): last character is c.\n\nAfter two modifications: the state is (c, d): last character is d.\n\nWait, no. Because each modification changes the last two bits, but the last character is the last bit of the current state.\n\nSo, the last character is always the second element of the state.\n\nThus, for each state (x, y), the last character is y.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: starting from (a, b), can we reach any state (x, y) where y == g, via any number of modifications.\n\nSo, for each (a, b), we can model this as a graph where nodes are the possible states (00, 01, 10, 11), and edges are the possible modifications.\n\nWe can model this as a graph and for each node, determine whether it can reach a node where the second bit is g.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For each (a, b) in {00, 01, 10, 11}, determine if there exists a path from (a, b) to any state (x, y) where y == g.\n\n- Once we have this information, multiply each (a, b) by its count (the number of beautiful strings ending with (a, b)), and sum all such products.\n\nSo, the first step is to compute for each (a, b) whether it can reach a state ending with g.\n\nThis can be done with BFS for each (a, b), but since there are only 4 possible states, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each state whether it can reach a state ending with g.\n\nSo, let's create a function can_reach_g(s), where s is a state (a, b), returns True if there's a way to reach a state where the last character is g.\n\nWe can precompute this for all 4 states.\n\nHow?\n\nWe can model this as a graph where each node is a state, and edges are the possible transitions after a modification.\n\nThen, for each node, we can determine if there's a path to a node where the last character is g.\n\nSo, for each state s, can_reach_g(s) is True if any of the states reachable from s via any number of modifications have y = g.\n\nWait, but the last character is the second bit of the state. So, for a state (x, y), y is the last character.\n\nSo, for each state (x, y), if y is g, then can_reach_g(s) is True.\n\nSo, for each state s, if s's y is g, then yes.\n\nOtherwise, if any modification from s leads to a state t where can_reach_g(t) is True, then s can reach g.\n\nSo, this is a recursive definition.\n\nWe can implement this using memoization or BFS.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each state (a, b), check if b == g. If yes, then can_reach_g is True.\n\n2. Else, for each possible modification (i.e., perform the modification step), which leads to a new state (b, c), check if can_reach_g on that new state is True. If any of them is True, then can_reach_g for the current state is True.\n\n3. This is a standard reachability problem in a graph, which can be solved with BFS.\n\nSo, for each state, we can compute whether it can reach a state with last character g.\n\nOnce we have this information, we can proceed to calculate the total number of beautiful strings.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the can_reach_g for each of the four states.\n\n- For each state (a, b), compute the count of beautiful strings ending with (a, b) as C(n_rem + m_rem, n_rem), provided n_rem and m_rem are non-negative.\n\n- Sum all counts where can_reach_g is True.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this correctly, handling all edge cases.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 1 1 0\n\nBeautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\".\n\nFor each of these, can they reach a state ending with 0.\n\nWait, the initial last two bits are '01' for \"01\", and '10' for \"10\".\n\nWait, let's compute can_reach_g for each state.\n\ng is 0.\n\nFor state '01' (a=0, b=1):\n\nb is 1 != 0. So need to see if any modification can lead to a state where the last character is 0.\n\nWhat's the modification:\n\nTake a=0, b=1. They are different, so c is 0.\n\nSo the new state is (1, 0). Now, the last character is 0, which is g. So yes.\n\nThus, can_reach_g('01') is True.\n\nFor state '10' (a=1, b=0):\n\nb is 0 == g. So can_reach_g is True.\n\nThus, both states can reach g.\n\nSo, for each beautiful string, the count is 2.\n\nBut wait, the sample output is 2, which matches.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: 2 2 0.\n\nThe beautiful strings are \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\n\nEach of these strings can reach a state ending with 0.\n\nSo, for each of their last two bits, can they reach 0.\n\nLet's see:\n\nTake \"0011\": last two are '11'.\n\nIn state '11', can_reach_g is whether after any modifications, the last character is 0.\n\nState '11' → b is 1. So, perform a modification: since a=1 and b=1, c=0. New state is (1, 0). Now, last character is 0 → which is g. So yes.\n\nSimilarly, for other states.\n\nThus, all four beautiful strings are counted.\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput: 1 1 1.\n\nPossible beautiful strings are \"01\", \"10\". But can they reach 1 as last character?\n\nFor '01' → last two are '0','1'. After modification, becomes '0' (last character is 0). So cannot reach 1.\n\nFor '10' → last two are '1','0'. After modification, becomes '0' (last character is 0). So cannot reach 1.\n\nThus, the answer is 0.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nNow, the implementation steps:\n\n1. Precompute the combination numbers up to 210 choose 105.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming to compute this. Since n and m can be up to 105 each, the maximum N is 210.\n\nCompute a 2D array C where C[k][r] is the combination of k choose r mod MOD.\n\nBut since for each (a, b), we need to compute C(n_rem + m_rem, n_rem), which is C(N-2, n_rem), and N is up to 210, we can precompute all C(k, r) for 0 ≤ r ≤ k ≤ 210.\n\n2. Precompute can_reach_g for each of the four states.\n\nImplement this as a function for each state (a, b).\n\nFor each state (a, b), if b == g, then return True.\n\nElse, for each possible modification, compute the new state (b, c) where c is 1 if a and b are 0, else 0.\n\nCheck if can_reach_g(new_state) is True. If any of them is True, then current state can reach g.\n\nWe can memoize this function.\n\n3. For each state (a, b), compute the count of beautiful strings ending with (a, b).\n\nThis is done as follows:\n\nn_rem = n - (a == 0) - (b == 0)\n\nm_rem = m - (a == 1) - (b == 1)\n\nIf n_rem < 0 or m_rem < 0, count is 0.\n\nElse, count is C(n_rem + m_rem, n_rem) mod MOD.\n\nSum all counts where can_reach_g(a, b) is True.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n, m, g.\n\nMOD = 10^9 +7.\n\nPrecompute combinatorial numbers C up to 210.\n\nCompute can_reach_g for each of the four states.\n\nFor each state (a, b):\n\n   compute n_rem and m_rem.\n\n   if n_rem <0 or m_rem <0: continue.\n\n   count = C[n_rem + m_rem][n_rem]\n\n   if can_reach_g(a, b):\n\n       total += count\n\ntotal %= MOD\n\nprint(total)\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the can_reach_g function.\n\nImplementing can_reach_g for each state:\n\nWe can represent each state as a tuple (a, b), where a and b are 0 or 1.\n\nWe can precompute for each state whether it can reach a state where the last character is g.\n\nOne way is to model this as a directed graph and perform BFS for each state.\n\nAlternatively, since the state space is small (only 4 states), we can precompute for each state whether it can reach a state ending with g.\n\nLet's precompute a dictionary or a list where for each state, we store whether it can reach g.\n\nWe can model this using BFS.\n\nSo, for each state, we can mark whether it can reach g.\n\nLet's see:\n\nDefine the four states as 00, 01, 10, 11.\n\nFor each state s, define the possible next states after a modification.\n\nFor example:\n\nState 00:\n\nModification leads to 0 (since both are 0 → replaced by 1). So new state is (0, 1).\n\nState 01:\n\nDifferent, so replaced by 0. New state is (1, 0).\n\nState 10:\n\nDifferent, replaced by 0. New state is (0, 0).\n\nState 11:\n\nBoth are 1 → replaced by 0. New state is (1, 0).\n\nSo, for each state, the next state is determined.\n\nSo, the transitions are:\n\n00 → 01\n\n01 → 10\n\n10 → 00\n\n11 → 10\n\nWait, no: wait, for state 00, the last two are 0 and 0. Modification replaces them with 1. So the new state is (0, 1).\n\nSimilarly:\n\nstate 00 → (0, 1)\n\nstate 01 → (1, 0)\n\nstate 10 → (0, 0)\n\nstate 11 → (1, 0)\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nWhen state is 00: a=0, b=0 → c=1. So new state is (b, c) = (0, 1).\n\nYes.\n\nState 01: a=0, b=1 → different → c=0. new state is (1, 0).\n\nState 10: a=1, b=0 → different → c=0. new state is (0, 0).\n\nState 11: a=",
