He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I need to output how many such numbers there are and the list of those numbers in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, and higher multiples contribute more. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division result is zero.\n\nSo the task is to find all n where this sum equals m. But how do I find the possible n's?\n\nWait, the function that counts trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases. That means once n crosses a certain point, the count jumps by more than one. So for a given m, there might be either zero, one, or multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me think again. For example, when you increase n by 1, the trailing zeros can either stay the same or increase. So for each m, there's a range of n's that could have the same trailing zero count.\n\nWait, no. For instance, let's take m=5. Looking at the example: n=5 gives 1 zero (since 5/5=1, others are zero). Wait, no, the example says m=5? Or wait, the input was '1' and '5', so the first case is m=1, which corresponds to n=5,6,7,8,9. So the function is not strictly increasing. So for some m, there may be multiple n's.\n\nSo the approach is to find the minimal n that gives m trailing zeros, then check if adding 1 to n also gives the same count. If so, we can include all consecutive n's up to the point where the count increases.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal n with exactly m zeros? And then determine the maximum n such that the count is still m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a binary search approach would work here. Because the function is monotonic, for a given m, there exists a lower bound and an upper bound on n.\n\nWait, yes. So for a given m, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the number of trailing zeros is at least m. Once I find that, I can see how many consecutive numbers after that also have the same count.\n\nWait, but wait: the minimal n where the count is >=m is the first occurrence where the count reaches m. But maybe the next numbers also have the same count.\n\nFor example, n=5: trailing zeros is 1. n=6: 720 has one zero. Wait, no, wait: 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1 zero), 7! is 5040 (1 zero), 8! is 40320 (1 zero), 9! is 362880 (1 zero). Then 10! is 3628800, which adds another zero. So for m=1, the numbers are 5-9 inclusive, which are 5 numbers.\n\nSo for m=5, the count of trailing zeros would be:\n\nLet's calculate for n=24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0, total 4. Not enough.\n\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So for m=5, the minimal n is 25? Wait, no, because 24 gives 4, 25 gives 6. So m=5 is between 24 and 25. So there are no n's with exactly 5 trailing zeros. So the answer is 0.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's compute for n=20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0 → total 4.\n\nn=21: same, 4.\n\nn=22: 4.\n\nn=23:4.\n\nn=24:4.\n\nn=25:5+1=6.\n\nSo yes, for m=5, there's no n such that the trailing zeros are exactly 5. So the output is 0.\n\nSo the approach is to find the lower and upper bounds for n where the trailing zeros equal m.\n\nHow can I find these bounds efficiently?\n\nIdea: use binary search to find the minimal n where the trailing zeros are >= m. Then check if it's exactly m. If not, there's no solution. Otherwise, find the maximal n where the trailing zeros are m. The difference between these two plus one is the count.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's say the minimal n is x where count(x) = m. Then the maximal n is y where count(y) = m, and count(y+1) > m.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n1. Find the smallest n where count(n) >= m. Let's call it low.\n\n2. Check if count(low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the largest n where count(n) == m. Let's call it high.\n\n4. The numbers from low to high (inclusive) are the solutions.\n\nWait, but wait. How to find high? Because after low, as n increases, the count may increase by more than 1.\n\nWait, for example, when n increases from 24 to 25, the count goes from 4 to 6, skipping 5. So for m=5, there are no solutions.\n\nBut when n increases from 5 to 6, the count remains 1. So high is 9, since 10! has 2 zeros.\n\nSo how to find high?\n\nOnce low is found, we can increment n until count(n) exceeds m. The last n before that happens is high.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nOnce we find low, which is the minimal n with count(n) = m, we can then try to find the next n where count(n) increases beyond m. All n from low to high (where high is the first n where count(n) > m) will be included.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Compute the count for n using the formula.\n\n2. Binary search for the minimal n where count(n) >= m.\n\n3. Check if count(n) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n4. Now, find the largest n where count(n) <= m.\n\nWait, no. Because after low, the count could increase beyond m, but perhaps some numbers in between have the same count.\n\nWait, but for the count function, once you pass a multiple of 5, the count increases.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 all have the same count (1), but 10 adds another. So between 5 and 9, all have the same count.\n\nSo for a given m, the numbers with exactly m trailing zeros form a continuous range starting at low, and ending at high, where high is the first number where count(high) > m.\n\nThus, the process is:\n\n- Use binary search to find the minimal n where count(n) >= m. Call this low.\n\n- If count(low) != m, return 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n where count(n) > m. Let's call this high.\n\n- The number of solutions is high - low.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample where m=1:\n\nlow is 5, because count(5)=1.\n\nhigh is 10, because count(10)=2>1.\n\nSo the solutions are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, write a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >=5:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nThen, perform binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nBut wait, the minimal n might be less than the current value, so binary search is needed.\n\nWait, the minimal n is the smallest integer where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nBut how? Because for n=low, count_zeros(low) could be >=m, but for n=low-1, it's <m.\n\nSo, the binary search should find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nOnce we have that, we need to check if it's exactly m.\n\nIf count_zeros(low) !=m, then there's no solution.\n\nElse, proceed to find the high.\n\nTo find high, we can start from low and increment until count_zeros increases beyond m.\n\nBut for large m, this could be time-consuming.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible n? For m=1e5, n can't be larger than 5e5, because 5e5//5=1e5, so count_zeros(5e5) is 1e5 + ... but let's see:\n\nWait, 5e5 /5 = 1e5, 5e5/25=2e4, 5e5/125=4e3, 5e5/625=800, etc., which adds up to about 1e5 + 2e4 +4e3 + ... which is way more than 1e5. So for m=1e5, the low is around 5e5, but the actual n where count_zeros(n) =1e5 could be somewhere around that.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, the minimal n could be around 5e5.\n\nBut to find high, perhaps it's better to find the first n where count_zeros(n) >m, and then high is that n.\n\nSo, after finding low, we can start checking from low onwards, and find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >m. All numbers from low to (n-1) are part of the solution.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently find high.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m. Let's call it high.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nAfter finding low, set current = low, and while count_zeros(current) == m, increment current. Once it's >m, stop. Then high is current-1.\n\nWait, but that's O(m) in the worst case, which is not acceptable for m up to 1e5.\n\nWait, but for m up to 1e5, each iteration of the while loop would take O(log n) time, which is manageable because even for 1e5 iterations, each step is O(1) because the count_zeros function is O(log n).\n\nWait, but 1e5 is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a binary search approach can be used to find high.\n\nWait, because once count_zeros(n) is greater than m, any n higher than that will also have a higher count (since the count is non-decreasing). So, the first n where count_zeros(n) >m is the high point.\n\nSo, for the binary search to find high:\n\nWe can binary search between low and some upper limit (like 5*(m+1)).\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Implement the count_zeros function.\n\n2. Binary search to find the minimal low where count_zeros(low) >=m.\n\n   - If count_zeros(low) !=m, return 0.\n\n3. Now, find the minimal high where count_zeros(high) >m.\n\n   - Then, the numbers from low to high-1 are all the solutions.\n\n   - The count is high - low.\n\n4. Output the count and the list.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low via binary search.\n\nIf count(low) !=m: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Compute high via binary search as the first n where count_zeros(n) >m.\n\n   Then, the numbers are [low, low+1, ..., high-1].\n\n   Output the count and the numbers.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement the binary search for low.\n\nThe initial low can be 0.\n\nWe want to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nThe binary search can be done as follows:\n\nleft = 0\n\nright = 5 * m  # since for n=5*m, count is at least m.\n\nWait, but perhaps 5*m is not sufficient. For example, if m is 5, 5*5=25, which gives 6 zeros. So the initial right can be 5*(m+1) or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the right can be 5e6, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, 5e5 is 500000. For that, count_zeros(5e5) is 100000 (from 5e5//5) + 20000 (5e5//25) + 4000 (5e5//125) + 800 (5e5//625) + 160 (5e5//3125) + 32 (5e5//15625) + 6 (5e5//78125) + 1 (5e5//390625) = 100000 + 20000=120000, +4000=124000, +800=125k, +160=125,160, +32=125,192, +6=125,198, +1=125,199. So that's way more than m=1e5.\n\nSo perhaps setting right as 5e5 is enough for m=1e5.\n\nSo, during the binary search for low:\n\nWhile left < right:\n\n   mid = (left + right) //2\n\n   current_count = count_zeros(mid)\n\n   if current_count <m:\n\n       left = mid +1\n\n   else:\n\n       right = mid\n\nAt the end, low is left.\n\nThen check if count_zeros(low) ==m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed to find high.\n\nNow, for high, find the first n where count_zeros(n) >m.\n\nAgain, binary search.\n\nInitialize left_high = low\n\nright_high = 5e5 (or another upper limit)\n\nIn each step:\n\nmid = (left_high + right_high)//2\n\nif count_zeros(mid) >m: then we can try to find a smaller n.\n\nso set right_high=mid.\n\nelse: set left_high=mid+1.\n\nContinue until left_high >= right_high.\n\nAt that point, the high is left_high.\n\nOnce high is found, the numbers are from low to high-1.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is high - low.\n\nIf high is low, then it's 0.\n\nWait, but no, because if high is low, then count_zeros(high) is >m, but low was the first n where count >=m. So if count(low) ==m, then high must be > low.\n\nSo, the count is high - low.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input: m=1.\n\nBinary search for low:\n\nLooking for the smallest n where count >=1.\n\nStarts with left=0, right=5.\n\nMid=2: count_zeros(2)=0 <1 → left=3.\n\nMid=4: count_zeros(4)=0 <1 → left=5.\n\nNow, left=5, right=5. Exit loop.\n\ncount(5)=1 ==m → proceed.\n\nNow, find high: first n where count>1.\n\nSet left_high=5, right_high=5e5.\n\nMid= (5+5e5)/2 → but let's see.\n\nWait, but perhaps binary search can find high quickly.\n\nWait, let's see: for m=1, looking for high where count>1.\n\nWe can start with low=5, high=5.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the initial right_high should be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set the initial right_high as 5*(m+1) or something.\n\nBut perhaps in code, the right_high can be set to 5e18 initially, which is a very high number, but the binary search will handle it efficiently.\n\nSo, for m=1:\n\nAfter finding low=5.\n\nNow, find the first n where count_zeros(n) >1.\n\nWe know that count(5) is 1, count(6)=1, ..., count(9)=1, count(10)=2.\n\nSo the high is 10.\n\nSo, the numbers from 5 to 9 are 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the code should output 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nFind low:\n\nbinary search for smallest n where count >=5.\n\nCompute count(24): 24//5=4, 24//25=0 → 4 <5.\n\ncount(25)=5+1=6 ≥5. So low=25.\n\nCheck count(25)=6 !=5 → so output 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nlow=25, since count(25)=6.\n\nFind high: find first n where count>6.\n\nWhat's count(25)=6, count(26)=6, count(29)=6, count(30)=7.\n\nSo high is 30.\n\nNumbers from 25 to 29: 5 numbers.\n\nSo output 5 and 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nSo the code needs to correctly find these.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nBut wait, what about when m=0? According to the problem statement, m starts from 1, so we don't need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nFirst, read m from input.\n\nThen, define the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement binary search for low.\n\nCheck if count(low) !=m → output 0.\n\nElse, binary search for high.\n\nCompute the list from low to high-1.\n\nOutput the length and the list.\n\nBut wait, what about when high is 0? No, because if low is found, then count(low) =m, so high must be at least low+1, which has count>m.\n\nSo the list is from low to high-1 inclusive.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nDefine count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n >=5:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nImplement binary search for low.\n\nleft =0, right=5*m.\n\nBut wait, perhaps 5*m is not sufficient. Because for m=5, 5*5=25, which is correct, but for higher m, perhaps 5*m is too small.\n\nSo, perhaps setting right to 5*m is insufficient. Maybe set it to 5*(m+1) or 5e18.\n\nAlternatively, in code, set right to a large value, say 5e18.\n\nBecause for m up to 1e5, 5e18 is manageable in binary search.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    res = 0\n    while n >=5:\n        n = n //5\n        res +=n\n    return res\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\n# Find low\nleft = 0\nright = 5 * 10**18  # A very large number\nlow = 0\nwhile left < right:\n    mid = (left + right) //2\n    cz = count_zeros(mid)\n    if cz < m:\n        left = mid +1\n    else:\n        right = mid\nlow = left\nif count_zeros(low) !=m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Find high\n    left_high = low\n    right_high = 5 * 10**18\n    high = 0\n    while left_high < right_high:\n        mid = (left_high + right_high) //2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz > m:\n            right_high = mid\n        else:\n            left_high = mid +1\n    high = left_high\n    numbers = list(range(low, high))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    if numbers:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n    else:\n        print()\n\nWait, but for high=0, it would print nothing. But in our case, since low is found, high is at least low+1, so numbers will have at least one element.\n\nWait, no: when m=0, but the problem says m starts from 1.\n\nSo, the code should be fine.\n\nTesting for m=1:\n\nlow is 5.\n\nhigh is 10.\n\nnumbers = [5,6,7,8,9] → len 5.\n\nOutput: 5\\n5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test: m=5.\n\nlow is 25.\n\ncount is 6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nAnother test: m=6.\n\nlow is 25.\n\nhigh is 30.\n\nnumbers 25-29 → 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about m=2.\n\nlow is 6 (since 5 gives 1, 6 gives 1, 7 gives 1, 8 gives 1, 9 gives 1, 10 gives 2).\n\nWait, no: count(5)=1, count(6)=1, count(7)=1, count(8)=1, count(9)=1, count(10)=2.\n\nSo for m=2, low is 10.\n\nhigh is 14.\n\nBecause count(10)=2, count(11)=2, count(12)=2, count(13)=2, count(14)=2, count(15)=3.\n\nSo high is 15.\n\nNumbers are 10,11,12,13,14 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would output 5 followed by 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the output.\n\nIn Python, for the list, if there are k numbers, we need to print k, followed by the space-separated numbers.\n\nIf there are zero numbers, just print 0.\n\nOtherwise, print the count and then the numbers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprint(len(numbers))\nif len(numbers) >0:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but in the sample, the first output line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So for the first line, it's the count, then a new line, then the space-separated numbers, then a new line.\n\nWait, no: the sample output shows:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the first line is the count, followed by the space-separated numbers, and the second line is the count for the second case. So for the first case, the output is:\n\n5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is 5 followed by the numbers on the same line.\n\nWait, but in the sample output description, it's written as:\n\nOutput:\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that for the first case, the output is a single line containing the count and the numbers. For the second case, it's a single line with 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the output format.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nOutput:\n\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\nWait, but the sample input is ['1', '5'], meaning that the input has two cases. Wait, no, the input is a single line with one integer m. So each run of the program handles a single m.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is showing the output for two different runs. For example, the first run has m=1, outputting 5 numbers, and the second run has m=5, outputting 0.\n\nSo, for each run, the output is:\n\nThe count on the first line, followed by the numbers on the next line, separated by spaces.\n\nSo in code, for the numbers list:\n\nif len(numbers) >0:\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but in the sample, for m=1, the first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is 5 followed by the numbers on the same line.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a single line, which is the count, followed by a space-separated list of numbers, but only if there are numbers. Otherwise, output 0.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\nSo, the first line is k, then the next line is the list.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that for the first case, the output is two lines: the first line is 5, the second line is 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample output is shown as a list, indicating that perhaps it's a formatting thing. So perhaps in code, it's better to print k on the first line, then on the next line, print the numbers separated by spaces.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprint(k)\n\nif k >0:\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nelse:\n\n    print()\n\nWait, but in the sample, for m=5, the output is 0, which is a single line.\n\nSo, in code, the structure is:\n\nif k >0:\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n...\n\nif len(numbers) ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but in the sample, the first case is m=1, the output is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo two lines.\n\nWait, no, the sample's output is presented as a list, but perhaps it's just the way it's represented. In reality, the output is two lines: the first is 5, the second is the numbers.\n\nSo the code should print the count, then the numbers on the next line.\n\nSo the code:\n\nprint(len(numbers))\n\nif len(numbers) >0:\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but in the case where len(numbers) is zero, it's 0, and we just print 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: m=1 → 5 numbers.\n\nTest case 2: m=5 → 0.\n\nTest case3: m=6 →5 numbers.\n\nTest case4: m=2 →5 numbers.\n\nTest case5: m=0 →not allowed.\n\nTest case6: m=10^5.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, the code should find the low and high correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: m=7.\n\nCompute count(24)=4, 25=6, 26=6, ..., 29=6, 30=7.\n\nSo for m=7, low=30.\n\nhigh is 35.\n\nBecause count(35) =35//5=7, 35//25=1, 35//125=0. Total 8.\n\nSo the numbers are 30,31,32,33,34 → count is 5.\n\nWait, no: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 6+1=7.\n\n30:7.\n\n31: same as 30.\n\n32: same.\n\n33: same.\n\n34: same.\n\n35: 7+1=8.\n\nSo high is 35.\n\nSo numbers are 30-34: 5 numbers.\n\nSo code would output 5 followed by 30 31 32 33 34.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nCount for 14:14//5=2, 14//25=0 → 2 <3.\n\n15:3.\n\nSo low=15.\n\nhigh is 19.\n\nBecause count(19)=3.\n\ncount(20)=4.\n\nSo numbers 15-19:5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves efficiently finding these integers using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) (factorial of \\( n \\)) is determined by counting the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 = 2 * 5 and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**:\n   - **Lower Bound (low)**: Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeroes is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound (high)**: After finding the lower bound, use another binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeroes exceeds \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: The valid integers \\( n \\) are those between the lower bound (inclusive) and the upper bound (exclusive). The count of such integers is the difference between the upper and lower bounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    res = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n = n // 5\n        res += n\n    return res\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\n# Binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m\nleft_low = 0\nright_low = 5 * 10**18  # A large enough upper bound\nlow = 0\nwhile left_low < right_low:\n    mid = (left_low + right_low) // 2\n    cz = count_zeros(mid)\n    if cz < m:\n        left_low = mid + 1\n    else:\n        right_low = mid\nlow = left_low\nif count_zeros(low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) > m\n    left_high = low\n    right_high = 5 * 10**18\n    high = 0\n    while left_high < right_high:\n        mid = (left_high + right_high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz > m:\n            right_high = mid\n        else:\n            left_high = mid + 1\n    high = left_high\n    numbers = list(range(low, high))\n    k = len(numbers)\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input integer \\( m \\) is read.\n2. **Counting Function**: The helper function `count_zeros` computes the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\).\n3. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: Using binary search, we find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the trailing zero count is at least \\( m \\).\n4. **Check Validity**: If the count at the lower bound is not exactly \\( m \\), output 0.\n5. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) where the trailing zero count exceeds \\( m \\).\n6. **Output Results**: Generate the list of valid integers and print the count followed by the integers.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of possible values for \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
