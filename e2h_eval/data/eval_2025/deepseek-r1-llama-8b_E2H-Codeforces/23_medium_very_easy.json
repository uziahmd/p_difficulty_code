In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Japanese mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, and she needs to draw the minimum number of extra tiles to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence). \n\nHmm, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' means suit s, number 1. The output should be three integers: for each of the three input tiles, the minimal number of draws needed so that after adding those, the entire collection contains at least one mentsu. Or wait, no—wait, the output is three numbers corresponding to each input line, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, looking back, the sample input is three lines, but the output is three numbers, like ['0', '0', '1'], which seems to correspond to each of the three initial hands. So I think the problem is, for each of the three initial hands, compute how many more tiles are needed to form a mentsu in that particular hand. Or wait, perhaps not. Maybe the problem is that we need to find, for all possible combinations of tiles she could have by adding some, whether any of them includes a mentsu. But the output requires for each of the three initial hands, what's the minimal number of draws needed such that the new hand (the original plus the drawn tiles) includes a mentsu.\n\nWait, no, the problem says: she must have at least one mentsu in her hand after drawing. So for each of the three initial hands, what is the minimal number of tiles to add so that the resulting four-tile collection (original three plus added ones) has at least one mentsu.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is three numbers: for each of the three initial hands, the minimal number of draws. So the first initial hand is ['1s 2s 3s']—so she already has a shuntsu, so zero draws. Second initial hand is three 9m's, which is a koutsu, so zero. Third initial hand is 3p, 9m, 2p—so she has two p's? No, 3p, 2p—so only two p's. So she needs one more to form a triplet or a sequence. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the task is: for each of the three given hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add so that the total collection (including the original and added) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nHmm. So the approach would be: for each of the three initial hands, simulate adding 0,1,2,3,... tiles and check if any of the possibilities results in a mentsu.\n\nBut considering that the maximum possible tiles she might need to add is 4, since with 3 tiles, adding 4 will give 7, which is enough to form a mentsu somewhere. But perhaps we can find a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible possible mentsu that can be formed with the existing tiles plus some added, find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nWait, let's think about how to model this.\n\nEach initial hand is three tiles. We can represent them as a dictionary or a counter, counting how many of each tile there are. Then, for each possible mentsu type (either koutsu or shuntsu), we can see what tiles are needed beyond the current hand, and find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut since a mentsu can be any combination of tiles, including ones not in the hand, we need to consider all possibilities.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\nFor each of the three initial hands:\n\n1. Generate all possible ways to form a mentsu (either triplet or sequence) using any combination of tiles, possibly including tiles not in the hand.\n\n2. For each possible mentsu, calculate how many tiles are missing from the current hand, and thus determine how many need to be added.\n\n3. Find the minimal number of additions across all possible mentsu options.\n\nSo for each initial hand, the minimal number is the smallest number of tiles to add to cover any possible mentsu.\n\nBut how do we efficiently generate all possible mentsu options?\n\nFirst, let's think about all possible triplets (koutsu) and sequences (shuntsu).\n\nA triplet is three identical tiles. So for each suit and number, there's a possible triplet.\n\nSo for example, 1m,1m,1m is a triplet.\n\nA sequence is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for each suit, the possible sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., up to 7-8-9.\n\nSo for each suit, there are 7 possible sequences.\n\nSo for each initial hand, we can consider all possible triplets and sequences, and for each, compute how many tiles are already present in the initial hand, and then the number of additional tiles needed.\n\nBut wait, the initial hand may have some tiles that are part of a triplet or sequence, but not enough to form one. So for each possible mentsu, calculate how many tiles are needed beyond the current hand.\n\nSo for example, if the initial hand is ['1s', '2s', '3s'], then the triplet 1s x3 is already covered, but the sequence 1s,2s,3s is also covered. So zero tiles needed.\n\nAnother example: initial hand is ['3p', '9m', '2p']. So for the suit p, she has 3p and 2p. So to form a sequence 1p,2p,3p, she's missing 1p. So adding one p tile of 1p would complete the sequence. Alternatively, forming a triplet of 2p would require two more 2p tiles, which is worse than adding one. So the minimal is one.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each initial hand:\n\n- Create a counter (like a frequency map) of the current tiles.\n\n- For each possible triplet (all possible suits and numbers):\n\n   - Check how many tiles are already present in the current hand for that triplet.\n\n   - The required count is 3. So if current count >=3, then no need to add. Else, the number of tiles to add is 3 - current count.\n\n- For each possible sequence (all possible suits and starting points):\n\n   - Check how many of the three tiles in the sequence are present in the current hand.\n\n   - For each tile in the sequence, count how many are present. Sum these counts, but for each tile, you can have multiple copies.\n\nWait, no. Because when considering a sequence, say 1m,2m,3m, the presence of each tile in the current hand determines whether they contribute to the sequence.\n\nWait, for a sequence, you need at least one of each of the three tiles in the sequence. So for the current hand, for each tile in the sequence, if it's present, it contributes 1 towards the sequence. So the sum of these is the number of tiles present in the sequence.\n\nIf the sum is >=3, then the sequence is already present. Otherwise, the number of tiles needed is 3 - sum.\n\nWait, no. Because for a sequence, you need exactly one of each tile. So suppose the current hand has two 1m's and one 2m, but no 3m. Then, for the sequence 1m,2m,3m, the sum is 2+1+0 = 3. But that's because you have two 1m's, which are more than needed. Wait, no, because for a sequence, having two of a tile doesn't help—it just means you can choose one of them.\n\nWait, no. The way the problem statement describes it, a shuntsu is made of three sequential numbers in the same suit. Each tile in the sequence can be any number of copies, but you need at least one of each consecutive number.\n\nWait, no. Because in the note, [5p,5s,9m,4p,1s,7p,7m,6p] has a shuntsu because it contains [5p,4p,6p] or [5p,7p,6p]. So in this case, the initial hand has 5p,4p,6p. So for the sequence 4p,5p,6p, each is present once. So yes, that's a shuntsu.\n\nSo for a sequence, you need at least one of each of the three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for the current hand, for each possible sequence, count how many of the three tiles are present. The sum is the number of tiles in the sequence that are present. If the sum is >=3, then the sequence is already present. Otherwise, the number of tiles to add is 3 minus the sum.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum can be more than 3 if a tile is present multiple times. For example, the initial hand has two 1m's, two 2m's, and one 3m. Then, for the sequence 1m,2m,3m, the sum is 2+2+1=5. So the sum is 5, which is greater than 3, so the sequence is considered present. So in that case, no tiles needed to be added.\n\nSo for each possible triplet or sequence, we can calculate the number of tiles needed to form it by subtracting the sum of the current tiles in that triplet or sequence from 3.\n\nWait, no. Because for a triplet, it's three of the same tile. So if the current hand has two of them, you need one more. So the number of tiles needed is max(3 - count, 0). For a sequence, you need at least one of each of the three tiles, so the number of tiles needed is max(3 - (number of distinct tiles in the sequence present in the hand), 0).\n\nWait, but the sequence is three specific tiles. So for the sequence 1m,2m,3m, if the current hand has 1m, 1m, 2m, 3m, then all three tiles are present, so no need to add. If it's missing, say, 3m, then one tile is needed.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each initial hand:\n\n1. For each possible triplet (all suits and numbers):\n\n   a. Count how many times the triplet's tile is present in the current hand.\n\n   b. The required tiles for this triplet is max(3 - current_count, 0).\n\n2. For each possible sequence (all suits and starting points):\n\n   a. For each of the three consecutive numbers in the sequence, count how many times they appear in the current hand. However, for the sequence, each of the three numbers must be present at least once. So for the sequence, the sum is the count of how many unique tiles in the sequence are present in the hand.\n\n   b. The required tiles for this sequence is max(3 - sum, 0).\n\n3. The minimal number of tiles to add is the minimum value among all required tiles for all possible triplets and sequences.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each of the three input hands, generate a frequency dictionary.\n\n- For each possible triplet and sequence, compute the required tiles.\n\n- Keep track of the minimal required tiles across all possible triplets and sequences.\n\nNow, the question is how to generate all possible triplets and sequences.\n\nLet's structure this.\n\nFirst, for triplets:\n\nThere are 3 suits: m, p, s.\n\nFor each suit, there are 9 possible numbers (1-9). So for triplets, there are 3 * 9 = 27 possible triplets.\n\nEach triplet is represented by a single tile (e.g., '1m').\n\nFor sequences:\n\nAgain, 3 suits. For each suit, the starting number can be from 1 to 7 (since 7+2=9). So for sequences, there are 3*7=21 possibilities.\n\nEach sequence is a set of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nNow, for each triplet and sequence, compute how many tiles are needed.\n\nBut wait, for the sequences, we need to count how many of the three required tiles are present in the current hand.\n\nSo for example, for the sequence 1m,2m,3m:\n\ncurrent_hand has 1m, 2m, 3m: all three are present → needed 0.\n\ncurrent_hand has 1m, 1m, 2m: 1m is present, 2m is present, but 3m is missing → needed 1 (for 3m).\n\ncurrent_hand has 1m, 2m, 2m: 1m and 2m are present → needed 1 (for 3m).\n\nSo the required is 3 - (number of present tiles in the sequence).\n\nWait, but for the sequence, each tile is required to have at least one copy. So the number of tiles in the sequence that are present is the count of how many of the three distinct tiles are present in the hand.\n\nWait, no. Because in the hand, you can have multiple copies of a tile in the sequence. But for the sequence, you only need one. So the presence of even one copy is sufficient.\n\nSo for the sequence, the count is how many of the three tiles are present in the hand (regardless of their quantity). So for each sequence, the number of tiles needed is 3 minus the count of unique tiles in the sequence that are present in the hand.\n\nWait, no. Because if the hand has two of the first tile and one of the second, but none of the third, then for the sequence, you still have two tiles (first and second) present, but you need the third. So required tiles is 1.\n\nSo for the sequence, the number of tiles present is the count of the three tiles in the sequence that are present in the hand, regardless of their counts. So for the sequence, the count is the number of unique tiles in the sequence that are present in the hand.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Suppose the sequence is 1m,2m,3m. The hand has 1m,1m,2m,3m. So all three tiles are present. So required is 0.\n\nBut if the hand has 1m, 2m, 2m, then the three tiles in the sequence are 1m, 2m, 3m. The hand has 1m and 2m, but not 3m. So required is 1.\n\nSo for a sequence, the number of tiles present is the number of unique tiles in the sequence that are present in the hand. So the required tiles is 3 minus that number.\n\nSo, for each sequence, the required tiles is max(3 - (number of unique tiles in the sequence present in the hand), 0).\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, for each initial hand, the steps are:\n\n1. Parse the hand into a list of tiles.\n\n2. Create a frequency dictionary (like a Counter) that counts how many of each tile are present.\n\n3. For all possible triplets:\n\n   a. For each triplet tile (e.g., '1m'), get the count from the frequency dict.\n\n   b. Compute required = max(3 - count, 0).\n\n4. For all possible sequences:\n\n   a. For each sequence (e.g., 1m,2m,3m):\n\n      i. For each of the three tiles in the sequence, check if it exists in the frequency dict.\n\n      ii. Count how many of the three are present (each contributes 1 if present, 0 otherwise).\n\n      iii. Compute required = max(3 - count, 0).\n\n5. Collect all required values from triplets and sequences.\n\n6. The minimal required value across all is the answer for this hand.\n\nSo now, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nNow, how to represent the triplets and sequences.\n\nLet's structure the code:\n\nFirst, for each hand, process it.\n\nIn Python, for each hand, we can split the string into individual tiles.\n\nFor example, the input is three strings, each of which is a tile. So for the first hand, '1s 2s 3s' is split into ['1s', '2s', '3s'].\n\nThen, create a frequency dictionary, e.g., from collections import Counter; cnt = Counter(hand).\n\nThen, for each possible triplet:\n\nLoop through all suits ('m', 'p', 's'), and for each, loop through numbers 1-9.\n\nFor each triplet tile, like '1m', get the count from cnt.get('1m', 0). Then, required is max(3 - count, 0). Add this to a list.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences:\n\nFor each suit in 'mps', loop through start numbers 1-7.\n\nFor each start, the sequence is [str(start) + suit, str(start+1) + suit, str(start+2) + suit].\n\nFor each of the three tiles in the sequence, check if they are present in the frequency dict. For each, add 1 if present, else 0. Sum these to get the count. Required is max(3 - count, 0). Add to the list.\n\nAfter processing all triplets and sequences, find the minimal required value.\n\nBut wait, for the sequences, the tiles may not exist in the frequency dict. For example, if the current hand has no '1m', then when considering the sequence 1m,2m,3m, the count is 0, so required is 3.\n\nSo, for each sequence, the code would be something like:\n\nsuit = 'm'\nfor start in 1..7:\n    seq = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n    present = 0\n    for tile in seq:\n        present += cnt.get(tile, 0)\n    required = max(3 - present, 0)\n    # add to list\n\nBut wait, no. Because the presence is determined by whether the tile exists, regardless of count. So for a sequence, the count of how many of the three tiles are present is the number of tiles in the sequence that exist in the hand. So for each tile in the sequence, if it exists in the hand (i.e., its count is >=1), then it contributes 1 to the present count.\n\nWait, no. For a sequence, each of the three tiles must be present at least once. So the present count is the number of tiles in the sequence that are present in the hand, regardless of how many copies.\n\nSo in code:\n\npresent = 0\nfor tile in seq:\n    if tile in cnt:\n        present += 1\n\nrequired = max(3 - present, 0)\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code for sequences would be:\n\nmin_required = infinity\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for start in range(1, 8):  # 1 to 7 inclusive\n        # construct the three tiles\n        tiles = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n        # count how many unique tiles are present in the hand\n        present = 0\n        for t in tiles:\n            if t in cnt:\n                present += 1\n        req = max(3 - present, 0)\n        if req < min_required:\n            min_required = req\n\nSimilarly, for triplets:\n\nmin_required = infinity\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1,10):\n        tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n        count = cnt.get(tile, 0)\n        req = max(3 - count, 0)\n        if req < min_required:\n            min_required = req\n\nSo combining both triplets and sequences, the minimal required is the minimum between all the req values.\n\nOnce we have min_required for a hand, that's the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead the three input lines.\n\nFor each line:\n\n- Split into individual tiles.\n\n- Create a Counter.\n\n- Compute the minimal required as described above.\n\n- Print the minimal required, as an integer.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third line is ['3p', '9m', '2p'].\n\nIn this case, for the triplet, 3p appears once, 2p appears once, 9m appears once. So for triplet, the best is 2p triplet: requires 2 more 2p's. But for sequences, looking at p suit:\n\nPossible sequences:\n\nLooking for sequences where the current hand has some tiles.\n\nFor example, the sequence 1p,2p,3p: current has 2p and 3p (but not 1p). So present is 2, required is 1.\n\nSequence 2p,3p,4p: present 2p and 3p → present is 2 → required 1.\n\nSequence 3p,4p,5p: present 3p → present is 1 → required 2.\n\nSo the minimal required is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if the hand is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, she has three tiles. So no, the input is always three tiles.\n\nAnother edge case: all three tiles are the same. So triplet is already present. So required is 0.\n\nAnother case: two tiles form a sequence. For example, 1m,2m,3m. So the triplet would require 1 more. The sequence is already present, so required is 0.\n\nWait, no. If the hand is ['1m','2m','3m'], then the sequence is present, so required is 0. So for triplet, the required is 3 - 3 = 0. So minimal is 0.\n\nWait, no. Because the triplet is 1m x3. The current count is 1 for 1m, so required is 2 for triplet. But the sequence is already present, so the minimal is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: all three tiles are the same. So triplet is present, required is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: the hand is 1m,1m,2m. Then, for triplet 1m: required is 1. For sequence 1m,2m,3m: present is 2 (1m and 2m) → required 1. So minimal is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe another sequence could be better. Like 2m,3m,4m: requires 3 (no 3m or 4m in hand). So no, the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the code correctly captures that.\n\nAnother case: hand is 1m,4m,5m. What's the minimal? Let's see.\n\nTriplets: none are 3, so for each triplet, required is 3 - current count (all 0 except maybe for 1m,4m,5m, which are 1 each. So triplet required is 2 for each.\n\nSequences: looking for sequences where some are present.\n\nLooking for sequences in m suit:\n\nCheck 4m,5m,6m: present 4m and 5m → required 1.\n\nAlso, 1m,2m,3m: present 1m → required 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the code would return 1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nWe'll read three lines, each as a string.\n\nFor each line:\n\n- Split into a list of three tiles.\n\n- Create a Counter.\n\n- Initialize min_req to a large number.\n\n- Iterate over all possible triplets:\n\n   For each suit, for each number, compute the required.\n\n   Update min_req.\n\n- Iterate over all possible sequences:\n\n   For each suit, for each start, compute the required.\n\n   Update min_req.\n\n- After all, print min_req.\n\nWait, but for each of the three input lines, we have to process them separately.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ntiles_input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n# Each line is a tile, but the input is three lines, each with three tiles?\nWait, no, the input is three lines, each line is a string representing three tiles, separated by space.\n\nWait, for example, the sample input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSo each line is a string of three tiles, separated by spaces.\n\nSo reading via read().split() will give a list of six strings: ['1s', '2s', '3s', '9m', '9m', '9m', '3p', '9m', '2p'].\n\nWait, no, because read().split() splits on any whitespace, so each line is split into three tokens, and then the three lines are read as a single list. So the first line is split into three elements, the second into three, etc.\n\nSo for example, the sample input is read as a list of 9 elements.\n\nSo for each of the three lines, we need to take three consecutive elements.\n\nSo code:\n\nlines = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    line = input().strip()\n    tiles = line.split()\n    lines.append(tiles)\n\nThen, for each tiles in lines:\n\nprocess each line.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef compute_min_draws(hand):\n    cnt = Counter(hand)\n    min_required = float('inf')\n    \n    # Check all possible triplets\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n            count = cnt.get(tile, 0)\n            req = max(3 - count, 0)\n            if req < min_required:\n                min_required = req\n    \n    # Check all possible sequences\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            tiles = [\n                f\"{start}{suit}\",\n                f\"{start+1}{suit}\",\n                f\"{start+2}{suit}\"\n            ]\n            present = 0\n            for t in tiles:\n                if t in cnt:\n                    present += 1\n            req = max(3 - present, 0)\n            if req < min_required:\n                min_required = req\n    \n    return min_required\n\n# Read input\ntiles_list = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    line = input().strip()\n    tiles_list.extend(line.split())\n\n# Process each of the three lines\nresults = []\nfor i in range(3):\n    hand = tiles_list[i*3 : (i+1)*3]\n    res = compute_min_draws(hand)\n    results.append(str(res))\n\n# Output\nprint(' '.join(results))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is '1s 2s 3s' which is three tiles, the second is '9m 9m 9m' (three tiles), the third is '3p 9m 2p' (three tiles). So when we read, the code reads all three lines, each split into three tiles, so tiles_list becomes [1s, 2s, 3s, 9m, 9m, 9m, 3p, 9m, 2p].\n\nThen, for i=0: hand is tiles_list[0:3] → 1s, 2s, 3s.\n\ni=1: 4:6 → 9m,9m,9m.\n\ni=2: 7:9 → 3p,9m,2p.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting against the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nFor the first hand, the triplet 1s, 2s, 3s is not a triplet, but the sequence is present. So required is 0.\n\nSecond hand: all 9m's. So triplet is present, required 0.\n\nThird hand: 3p, 9m, 2p. So triplet for 2p requires 1 more. Sequence 2p,3p,4p: present 2p and 3p → required 1. So minimal is 1.\n\nThus, the output is 0,0,1 → printed as '0 0 1'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nTriplet 1m: count is 2 → required 1.\n\nTriplet 2m: count is 1 → required 2.\n\nSequence 1m,2m,3m: present 1m and 2m → required 1.\n\nSequence 2m,3m,4m: present 2m → required 2.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nThus, code returns 1.\n\nAnother test case: ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nTriplet: for 1m: 1 → req 2. 2m: 1 → req 2. 4m: 1 → req 2. So triplet-wise, minimal is 2.\n\nSequence: looking for sequences where two tiles are present.\n\nE.g., 1m,2m,3m: present 1m,2m → req 1.\n\nOr 2m,3m,4m: present 2m,4m → req 1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nThus, code would return 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the code:\n\nWait, in the code, the function compute_min_draws takes a hand (list of 3 strings), creates a Counter, and computes the minimal.\n\nYes.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The function may miss some sequences or triplets, but according to the code, it covers all possible.\n\nAnother point: when the hand has multiple copies of a tile in a sequence or triplet.\n\nLike, hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nTriplet 1m: count is 2 → required 1.\n\nSequence 1m,2m,3m: present 1m and 2m → required 1.\n\nSo code correctly calculates.\n\nAnother case: hand has ['1m', '1m', '1m'] → triplet is already present. So required is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). The goal is to find the minimum number of additional tiles needed to form at least one mentsu.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible triplet and sequence, calculate how many tiles are missing from the current hand and determine the number of tiles needed to complete that triplet or sequence.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each of the three initial hands, create a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each tile.\n   - Check all possible triplets (27 possibilities) and sequences (21 possibilities) for each hand.\n   - For each triplet, compute the number of additional tiles needed to form it.\n   - For each sequence, compute the number of additional tiles needed to form it.\n   - Track the minimum number of additional tiles required across all possible triplets and sequences for each hand.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm efficiently checks all possible triplets and sequences, ensuring that we find the minimal draws required without unnecessary computations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef compute_min_draws(hand):\n    cnt = Counter(hand)\n    min_required = float('inf')\n    \n    # Check all possible triplets\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n            count = cnt.get(tile, 0)\n            req = max(3 - count, 0)\n            if req < min_required:\n                min_required = req\n    \n    # Check all possible sequences\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            tiles = [\n                f\"{start}{suit}\",\n                f\"{start+1}{suit}\",\n                f\"{start+2}{suit}\"\n            ]\n            present = 0\n            for t in tiles:\n                if t in cnt:\n                    present += 1\n            req = max(3 - present, 0)\n            if req < min_required:\n                min_required = req\n    \n    return min_required\n\n# Read input\ntiles_list = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    line = input().strip()\n    tiles_list.extend(line.split())\n\n# Process each of the three lines\nresults = []\nfor i in range(3):\n    hand = tiles_list[i*3 : (i+1)*3]\n    res = compute_min_draws(hand)\n    results.append(str(res))\n\n# Output\nprint(' '.join(results))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three lines, each containing three tiles. These are read and split into a list of individual tiles.\n- **Frequency Dictionary**: For each hand, a frequency dictionary is created to count the occurrences of each tile.\n- **Triplet Check**: For each possible triplet (27 possibilities), the number of additional tiles needed is calculated based on the current count.\n- **Sequence Check**: For each possible sequence (21 possibilities), the number of additional tiles needed is calculated based on how many of the required tiles are already present.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum number of additional tiles required across all possible triplets and sequences is determined and printed for each of the three initial hands.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimal number of draws needed to form a mentsu, covering all possible cases and ensuring optimal performance.",
