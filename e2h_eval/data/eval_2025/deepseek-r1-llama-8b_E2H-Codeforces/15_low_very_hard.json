They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine all the winning integers x for a given tournament setup. The problem statement is a bit complex, so I'll try to break it down.\n\nSo, the tournament is structured in phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one remains. The way the matches are arranged and which team wins depends on the string s provided. For each phase i (from 0 to n-1), s[i] determines whether higher or lower skilled teams win.\n\nThe key point is that each phase's match structure is determined by the string. For example, if s[0] is '1', then in the first phase (which has 2^(n-1) games), each match is between consecutive pairs, and the higher-skilled team wins. If s[0] is '0', then the lower-skilled team wins.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first phase is the initial split into pairs: 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. So for each pair, the winner is determined based on s[0]. Then the next phase takes the winners of these matches and forms new pairs, and so on until one remains.\n\nBut the permutation p is such that each team's skill level is unique. So, for a given s, we need to find all x where there exists a permutation p where x can be the champion.\n\nHmm. So the problem is to model the tournament and see for each possible x, whether it's possible to arrange the permutation such that x ends up as the winner.\n\nI think the approach here is to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a game, and each game's result depends on the current phase's rule (s[i]). But building this directly might be computationally intensive, especially since n can be up to 18, leading to 2^18=262144 teams. That's way too big for any brute-force approach.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is a reordering of all the team skills. So for a given x, we can imagine that x must be placed in certain positions in the tree to win. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the necessary conditions for x to be the champion, based on the s string.\n\nWait, perhaps the process can be viewed in reverse. Starting from the final round, which has only two teams, and working backwards through each phase.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the tournament as a series of rounds. Each round halves the number of teams, and the structure depends on the s[i] for each round.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. For each phase i (from 0 to n-1), the matches are grouped into blocks of size 2^{i+1}, and within each block, the first 2^i teams are matched against the next 2^i, but wait noâ€”maybe not. Or perhaps the initial phase groups into pairs, then the next phase groups the winners into pairs again, etc.\n\nWait, the first phase (i=0) has 2^{n} teams, split into 2^{n-1} games, each consisting of two teams. Then, the second phase (i=1) has 2^{n-1} teams, split into 2^{n-2} games, and so on, until the nth phase (i=n-1) has 2 teams, and the winner is the champion.\n\nEach phase i has 2^{n-i} games, each game reduces the number of teams by one.\n\nNow, for each phase i, the way the teams are paired and which team wins depends on s[i].\n\nSo, for each phase, the pairing is determined by grouping the remaining teams into contiguous blocks of size 2^{i+1}, and then within each block, the first half is paired with the second half. Like, for i=0, the initial phase: teams 1-2, 3-4, ..., 2^n-1 - 2^n.\n\nFor i=1, the next phase: the winners from the previous phase are grouped into blocks of size 4, so each group consists of four teams, and the first two winners of their respective pairs play each other, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the teams are divided into chunks of size 2^{i+1}, and within each chunk, the first half (size 2^i) are the winners from the previous phase's matches, and they are paired as 1st vs 2nd, 3rd vs 4th, etc. Then, the winners of these sub-matches proceed to the next phase.\n\nSo, for each phase, the structure is determined by how the previous phase's winners are grouped into new pairs.\n\nThis suggests that the tournament can be represented as a binary tree, where each non-leaf node is a match in a particular phase. The leaves are the original teams, and each",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the winning integers for a given tournament setup. The tournament structure is defined by a string `s` where each character dictates whether higher or lower skilled teams win in each phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in phases, starting with 2^n teams and reducing by half each phase until one winner remains. Each phase's results are determined by the string `s`, where '0' means the lower-skilled team wins and '1' means the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n2. **Binary Tree Representation**: Each phase can be visualized as a binary tree where each node represents a game, and the leaves are the initial teams. The structure of the tree depends on the string `s`.\n\n3. **Determining Winning Conditions**: For each possible integer x (from 1 to 2^n), we need to check if there exists a permutation of skills such that x wins the tournament. This involves simulating the tournament and checking if x can emerge victorious through the given win conditions.\n\n4. **Efficient Simulation Using Bitmasking**: Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible. Instead, we use dynamic programming with bitmasking to efficiently simulate the tournament outcomes for each possible permutation of skills.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    max_teams = 1 << n\n    dp = [[-1 for _ in range(max_teams)] for __ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for i in reversed(range(n)):\n        mask_size = 1 << (n - i)\n        for mask in range(0, (1 << (i + 1)), (1 << (i + 1)) ):\n            left = mask\n            right = mask | ((1 << (i + 1)) - 1)\n            \n            winners_left = []\n            winners_right = []\n            for j in range(i):\n                l = left + (1 << j)\n                r = right - (1 << j)\n                a = dp[j][l]\n                b = dp[j][r]\n                if s[i] == '0':\n                    winners_left.append(a)\n                else:\n                    winners_left.append(b)\n                \n                if s[i] == '0':\n                    winners_right.append(b)\n                else:\n                    winners_right.append(a)\n            for w_left in winners_left:\n                for w_right in winners_right:\n                    new_mask = left | (right & ~((1 << (i + 1)) - 1))\n                    dp[i][new_mask] = max(w_left, w_right) if s[i] == '1' else min(w_left, w_right)\n    \n    final_winner = dp[n-1][1]\n    \n    res = set()\n    for x in range(1, max_teams + 1):\n        if x == final_winner:\n            res.add(x)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(res))))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][mask]` represents the winner of the sub-tournament defined by the bitmask `mask` at phase `i`.\n\n2. **Backward Simulation**: We simulate the tournament from the final phase back to the initial phase. For each phase, we determine the winners based on the current phase's rule (given by `s[i]`).\n\n3. **Bitmasking**: Each bitmask represents a group of teams progressing to the next phase. By iterating through each possible bitmask, we determine the winners for each sub-tournament and update the `dp` table accordingly.\n\n4. **Result Extraction**: After processing all phases, the winner of the tournament is found in `dp[n-1][1]`. We then collect all integers that can be the champion by checking against this result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and determines all possible winning integers using dynamic programming and bitmasking techniques.",
