Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. But since we're trying to minimize the number, we want each new card to contribute as much as possible towards reaching the required sum.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current sum of the found cards.\n2. The target is to make the sum zero. So the required sum from the new cards is -current_sum.\n3. Each new card can add at most x (if positive) or subtract at most x (if negative). Wait, no: each new card can contribute any value between -x and x. But to maximize the contribution towards the target, for each new card, we should choose the value that brings us closer to the target.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to model the minimal number of cards needed. Let's see.\n\nLet me denote S as the sum of the found cards. We need to find the minimal k such that the sum of k cards' values equals (-S), and each card's value is in [-x, x].\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the smallest k where |sum_new| ≤ k*x and sum_new = -S.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because each card can contribute up to x or as low as -x. So the maximum possible sum from k cards is k*x, and the minimum possible is -k*x. So for the sum to reach exactly -S, we need that -k*x ≤ -S ≤ k*x.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as: -S >= -k*x → S <= k*x, and -S <= k*x → S >= -k*x.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nIf the sum of the new cards is T, then T must equal -S. Also, T must satisfy -k*x ≤ T ≤ k*x. So for T to be possible, -k*x ≤ -S ≤ k*x.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- k*x ≤ -S → S ≤ k*x.\n\nAnd \n\n- S ≤ k*x → which is always true if the first condition holds because S could be positive or negative.\n\nWait, maybe another way: for T to be possible with k cards, it must satisfy |T| ≤ k * x. Because each card can contribute at most x, or at least -x.\n\nSo for our case, T is equal to -S. So |-S| ≤ k * x → |S| ≤ k *x.\n\nSo the minimal k is the ceiling of |S| / x.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the examples.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nInput is 3 2, and the cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So S=2.\n\nWe need T = -2. So |T|=2.\n\nSo |S| is 2, x is 2. So k is 2/2=1. So minimal k is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: 2 3, cards are -2 and -2. Sum is -4. So T is 4. |T|=4.\n\nx is 3. So 4 /3 is approximately 1.333, so ceiling is 2. So minimal k is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: suppose S is 5, x is 2. Then |S|=5. 5/2 is 2.5, so ceiling is 3. So k=3.\n\nYes, because 3 cards can give a sum of 5 (like 2, 2, 1).\n\nWhat if S is 0? Then we don't need any more cards.\n\nWait, but what if S is zero and some cards are missing. For example, n=1, x=5, and the card is 0. Then sum is zero, so no need for more cards.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card is 3. Sum is 3. So we need T=-3. So |3|=3. x=5. So 3<=5, so k=1.\n\nYes, because we can add a card with -3.\n\nWait, but in the second sample, when S is -4, the minimal k is 2. Because 4/3 is ~1.333, so ceiling is 2.\n\nSo the formula is k = ceil(|S| /x).\n\nWait, but wait: what if |S| is exactly divisible by x? Like S=6, x=3. Then |S|=6, x=3 → 6/3=2. So k=2.\n\nYes, because two 3s would do.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute the sum S of the found cards. If S is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute |S|. Then divide by x, take the ceiling, that's the minimal k.\n\nBut wait, what about when x is zero? Oh, but the problem states x is at least 1, so no problem.\n\nWait, but in the input, the second line gives the numbers on the found cards. Are these numbers allowed to be zero? Yes, because each card can have zero.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of n integers.\n\nCompute S = sum of the list.\n\nIf S is zero, print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute required = abs(S)\n\nk = (required + x -1) // x  # this is equivalent to ceiling division.\n\nPrint k.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, x=2.\n\nCards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is 2. |S|=2. 2/2=1 → k=1.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=2, x=3.\n\nSum is -4. |S|=4. 4/3 is 1.333, ceiling is 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card is 5 → sum is 5. |5|=5. x=5 → 5/5=1. So k=1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=5, cards are 5 and -5. Sum is 0 → k=0.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, x=10, cards are 10, 10, -5, -5. Sum is 20. |S|=20. 20/10=2 → k=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is simple.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the first line as n and x.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCalculate S = sum of the list.\n\nIf S == 0: print 0.\n\nElse: compute required = abs(S), then k = (required + x -1) // x.\n\nPrint(k).\n\nWait, but what about cases where x is zero? Oh, the problem says x is at least 1.\n\nSo, that's covered.\n\nAnother edge case: when S is 1 and x is 1. So required is 1, x=1. k=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: when S is 0 → no need for any cards.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum is 2. Required is 2. (2+2-1)//2 → (3)//2=1.\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n2 3\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. required is 4. (4+3-1)//3 =6//3=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code.\n\nThe code will read from stdin. So, in Python, we can read using input().split().\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    required = abs(s)\n    k = (required + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nThat's it.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the user provided ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2'] as examples. But in reality, the input is given as two lines, not as a list. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and x, second is the list.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",

Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We are given `n` found cards and an integer `x` representing the maximum absolute value of any card.\n   - The goal is to make the total sum of all cards (found plus new) equal to zero.\n   - Each new card can contribute any integer value between -x and x.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Calculate the sum of the values on the found cards.\n   - If this sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - If not, determine the minimum number of additional cards required such that their combined sum cancels out the initial sum.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the sum `S` of the found cards.\n   - If `S` is zero, print 0.\n   - Otherwise, compute the absolute value of `S` to determine the target sum needed from the new cards.\n   - Use ceiling division to find the minimum number of cards required. This is done by `(required + x - 1) // x`, which efficiently computes the ceiling of the division without using floating-point arithmetic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    required = abs(s)\n    k = (required + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. It then reads the values of these `n` cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n- **Zero Check**: If the sum is zero, no additional cards are needed, so the result is printed as 0.\n- **Ceiling Division**: For non-zero sums, the code calculates the minimum number of additional cards required using ceiling division to ensure the sum of the new cards can exactly cancel out the initial sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards needed in constant time, making it suitable for large inputs within the problem constraints.",
