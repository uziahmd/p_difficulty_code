The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where a frog is jumping on a number line, and I need to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m. Each f(i) represents the number of distinct positions the frog can reach without going beyond [0, i]. Let me try to break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) is. The frog starts at 0, and in each step, it can jump either +a or -b. But it can't jump outside the interval [0, x]. So for each x, f(x) counts all the positions reachable under these constraints.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to find f(x) for each x up to m and sum them. But since m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute each x individually. We need an efficient way to calculate this.\n\nLet me think about how the frog's reachable positions change as x increases. For small x, the frog might not be able to make any jumps, so f(x) would just be 1 (the starting position). As x grows, the frog can make more jumps, increasing the reachable positions.\n\nWait, but the frog can choose any sequence of jumps as long as it doesn't exceed x. So the reachable positions form some kind of pattern based on the steps allowed.\n\nLet me consider the possible positions the frog can reach. Since each jump is either +a or -b, the reachable positions are all integers k such that k = a * t - b * s, where t and s are non-negative integers, and the position must be >=0 and <=x.\n\nBut wait, the frog can make any number of jumps, right? So the reachable positions depend on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.\n\nLet d = gcd(a, b). Then, any reachable position must be a multiple of d. Because each step adds a multiple of d. So the minimal step is d.\n\nSo, the positions form an arithmetic progression with step d. That's helpful because it allows us to model the reachable positions as multiples of d.\n\nNow, for each x, the maximum reachable position is the largest k <=x that is reachable, which is the maximum multiple of d less than or equal to x.\n\nBut how does the frog reach all positions between 0 and that maximum? Or maybe not all, depending on a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps the set of reachable positions is all the points in the form (t*a - s*b), where t and s are non-negative integers, and the position is within [0, x]. So the reachable positions are the numbers congruent to 0 mod d, but also satisfy certain inequalities.\n\nBut considering that a and b are fixed, the set of reachable positions is the same as the set of numbers that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. Hmm, but perhaps that's only for positive steps. Wait, no: since the frog can choose to subtract b, the steps can be negative as well, but the position can't go below zero.\n\nWait, the frog can make jumps like 0 + a, then from there subtract b, etc., as long as it doesn't go below zero. So the reachable positions are the numbers that can be written as a*t - b*s, where t and s are non-negative integers, and the result is >=0 and <=x.\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe we can model it by considering the minimal steps required to reach certain points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by finding for each x the earliest point where the frog can't reach any new positions beyond x, which would be when the next step would take it beyond x. So for x, the reachable positions are determined by the maximum steps the frog can take without exceeding x.\n\nWait, another approach: for a given x, the frog can reach any position k if k is in the set S, where S is the set of all numbers that can be reached via adding a's and subtracting b's, but not going below zero, and not exceeding x.\n\nBut to compute f(x), the count of such S for each x, and summing over x from 0 to m.\n\nBut again, since m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute each x individually. So we need a mathematical formula or a way to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the structure of f(x). When x is small, the frog can't make any jumps except possibly a single a step. So for x < a, the only reachable position is 0, so f(x) = 1.\n\nWait, no. Because the frog can choose to not jump at all. So even if a is larger than x, the frog can't jump, so f(x) is 1.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: when x is 0, the frog can't jump anywhere else. So f(0) is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line, given certain constraints. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by `a` or backward by `b` units, but it cannot jump outside the interval `[0, x]` for each `x` from 0 to `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**:\n   - The frog's reachable positions are determined by the steps `a` and `b`. The set of all reachable positions forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference equal to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, denoted as `d`.\n   - For each `x`, the maximum reachable position is the largest multiple of `d` that is less than or equal to `x`.\n\n2. **Summing Reachable Positions Efficiently**:\n   - We need to compute the sum of reachable positions for each `x` from 0 to `m`. Given the constraints, a direct computation for each `x` is infeasible. Instead, we use mathematical insights to derive a formula for the sum.\n   - The sum can be broken down into intervals where the number of reachable positions increases linearly. We calculate these intervals efficiently using properties of arithmetic sequences.\n\n3. **Key Observations**:\n   - When `x` is less than `a`, the frog can only stay at position 0.\n   - As `x` increases, the frog can reach more positions, forming an arithmetic progression. The number of reachable positions grows linearly until the next step would take the frog beyond `x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_sum(m, a, b):\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    if d == 0:\n        return m + 1  # Only possible when a=0 and b=0, which isn't allowed per input constraints\n    \n    max_reach = a\n    if a < b:\n        max_reach = a\n    else:\n        max_reach = a - b\n    \n    # Find the point where adding a again exceeds m\n    # Also, find the point where subtracting b becomes zero\n    # The total sum can be computed in segments\n    # First, handle the case where a >= b\n    if max_reach <= 0:\n        # The frog can't move at all\n        return m + 1\n    \n    # Let's see how the sum behaves\n    # The sum has several regions:\n    # 1. x < a: f(x) = 1\n    # 2. a <= x < a + b: f(x) increases by 1 each time x increases by 1\n    # Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n    \n    # Another approach: the reachable positions form a set S. The size |S| is f(x).\n    # The total sum is sum_{x=0}^m |S_x|\n    \n    # Let's find the minimal x where the frog can reach a - b, but that might not be necessary.\n    # Maybe the key is to find when the frog can reach all positions up to some maximum.\n    # Alternatively, let's model the sum as follows:\n    \n    # The positions are all k such that k â‰¡ 0 mod d and k >= 0, and there exists t, s >=0 such that k = a*t - b*s.\n    # But perhaps another way: the reachable positions are the numbers in the interval [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d, and satisfy certain conditions.\n    \n    # It's tricky. Maybe it's better to consider that after a certain x, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n    \n    # Let me think about the sum as consisting of two parts:\n    # 1. The sum for x where the frog can't reach any new positions beyond x (i.e., when x < a)\n    # 2. The sum for x where the frog can reach new positions, contributing to the count.\n    \n    # Let me consider the initial part where x < a:\n    # For x from 0 to min(a, m), f(x) = 1.\n    \n    # Now, for x >= a, the frog can reach a. So f(a) = 2.\n    # Then, for x >= a + b, the frog can reach a and a - b (if a - b >= 0). So f(a + b) = 3.\n    \n    # Wait, but if a > b, then a - b is positive, so the frog can reach a and a - b. So f(a) = 2, f(a-1) = 1, etc.\n    \n    # This suggests that the number of reachable positions increases by 1 every time x reaches a new critical value.\n    \n    # To find all critical values, we need to find the points where the frog can reach a new position.\n    \n    # However, for large m, enumerating all critical points is not feasible. Thus, we need a formula.\n    \n    # Let's consider the case when a and b are such that the frog can reach any position beyond a certain point.\n    \n    # The key is to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions up to x, and beyond that, the number of positions increases by 1 for each step.\n    \n    # Let me denote the minimal x where the frog can reach x and then can keep jumping by adding a and subtracting b as needed.\n    \n    # This happens when x is greater than or equal to a + b. At that point, the frog can reach any position up to x.\n    \n    # So, the sum can be divided into three parts:\n    # 1. x from 0 to min(a, m): f(x) = 1\n    # 2. x from a+1 to c: f(x) increases as x increases\n    # 3. x from c+1 to m: f(x) continues to increase\n    \n    # Wait, perhaps the sum can be calculated as the sum of all 1's up to a certain point, plus the sum of the increasing contributions beyond that.\n    \n    # Let's try to formalize this:\n    \n    # Compute the minimal x where the frog can start to reach multiple positions beyond x.\n    \n    # After some thought, I think the sum can be split into two cases:\n    \n    # Case 1: a >= b\n    # In this case, the frog can reach positions a, a - b, a - 2b, etc., as long as they are non-negative.\n    # The maximum reach is a * t - b * s, but constrained by x.\n    \n    # Case 2: a < b\n    # Here, the frog can't go back beyond 0, so the reachable positions are limited.\n    \n    # This seems complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to model the sum as follows:\n    \n    # The sum is the sum of all reachable positions for each x. Each x contributes 1 for positions that were reachable in previous steps.\n    \n    # Wait, no. Because f(x) counts the reachable positions for x, which may include new positions added as x increases.\n    \n    # Perhaps instead of trying to compute f(x) for each x, we can find the total contribution of each reachable position across all x.\n    \n    # Each reachable position k contributes 1 for every x >= k. So the total sum is the sum over all reachable positions k of the number of x's where k is included in [0, x].\n    \n    # This approach could be more efficient. Let me think about it.\n    \n    # The total sum is the sum for each reachable position k of the number of x's from 0 to m where k <= x.\n    # So for each k, if k is reachable, it contributes (m - k + 1) to the sum.\n    \n    # So the problem reduces to finding all reachable positions k, and summing (m - k + 1) for each k.\n    \n    # This is a crucial insight! Because now, instead of computing f(x) for each x, we compute how many x's include each reachable k, and sum those contributions.\n    \n    # So, our task is to find all reachable k's, and for each, add (m - k + 1) to the total sum.\n    \n    # Now, how do we find all reachable k's?\n    \n    # The reachable positions are all integers k such that k = a * t - b * s, where t, s >= 0, and k >= 0.\n    # Since the frog can't go below 0, s can't be too large.\n    \n    # Additionally, the gcd of a and b plays a role here. Let d = gcd(a, b). All reachable positions must be multiples of d.\n    \n    # So, let d = gcd(a, b). Then, any reachable k must satisfy k â‰¡ 0 mod d.\n    \n    # Letâ€™s express a = d * a', b = d * b'. Then, the equation becomes k = d*(a' * t - b' * s).\n    \n    # Letâ€™s also note that since the frog canâ€™t have negative jumps without going below 0, we can assume t and s are non-negative integers.\n    \n    # The minimal steps are such that the frog can reach a, then a - b, a - 2b, etc., but not below 0.\n    \n    # So, the reachable positions are all non-negative integers k that can be written as k = a*t - b*s, t, s â‰¥ 0, and k â‰¥ 0.\n    \n    # This forms a set S, and the size of S for each x is f(x).\n    \n    # Now, to find all k in S, we can model them as the numbers that are in the additive subgroup generated by a and -b, within [0, m].\n    \n    # This seems complex, but perhaps we can find the minimal and maximal reachable positions and count the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence.\n    \n    # Let me think about the reachable positions. The frog can make jumps that increase the position by a or decrease it by b, but not go below 0.\n    \n    # So, the minimal position is 0, and the maximal position is the largest k such that k = a * t - b * s, t, s â‰¥ 0, and k â‰¤ m.\n    \n    # The reachable positions form an arithmetic sequence starting from 0, with a common difference of d, but with certain gaps.\n    \n    # Wait, perhaps the reachable positions can be represented as all numbers of the form (t * a) - (s * b) that are â‰¥ 0 and â‰¤ m.\n    \n    # To find all such k, we can model the problem as finding all k in [0, m] such that k â‰¡ 0 mod d, and there exist non-negative integers t and s where k = a * t - b * s.\n    \n    # This seems challenging, but perhaps we can find the minimal and maximal reachable positions and then compute the number of terms in the arithmetic progression.\n    \n    # Let me try to find the maximal reachable position. The maximal k is the largest multiple of d that is â‰¤ m and can be expressed as a * t - b * s.\n    \n    # Alternatively, the maximal k is the maximum between a and the furthest reachable position via backward jumps.\n    \n    # Another approach: The frog can reach any position k in the range [0, R], where R is the maximal reachable position, which is a * t - b * s for some t and s, and R â‰¤ m.\n    \n    # But finding R is non-trivial.\n    \n    # Let's consider the following: The frog can reach any position k â‰¥ 0 that is a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. This forms a numerical semigroup, and the problem reduces to finding all elements of this semigroup within [0, m].\n    \n    # The sum of f(x) from x=0 to m is equivalent to counting each reachable k for how many x's it appears in, i.e., for each k, the number of x's where k â‰¤ x â‰¤ m.\n    # This is simply (m - k + 1) for each reachable k.\n    \n    # So, the total sum is the sum of (m - k + 1) for all reachable k in [0, m].\n    \n    # Now, the problem reduces to finding all reachable k's and summing (m - k + 1) over them.\n    \n    # How do we find all reachable k's?\n    \n    # The reachable k's form an arithmetic progression with step size d. The first term is 0, and each subsequent term is d higher.\n    \n    # The last term is the maximum k â‰¤ m that is reachable.\n    \n    # So, the reachable k's are 0, d, 2d, ..., L, where L is the largest reachable position â‰¤ m.\n    \n    # Wait, is this always true? Not necessarily. Because even though all reachable positions are multiples of d, the presence of b may allow jumps that skip some multiples of d.\n    \n    # For example, if a=5 and b=3, the reachable positions are 0,5,8,13,... which are all multiples of 1 (since gcd(5,3)=1). So yes, in this case, all multiples of d are reachable.\n    \n    # Wait, but in the case where a=4 and b=6, d=2. The reachable positions would be 0,4,8,12,... because you can't reach 2, 6, etc. So in this case, not all multiples of d are reachable.\n    \n    # Hmm, that complicates things. So the assumption that all multiples of d are reachable is incorrect.\n    \n    # So, what's the correct condition for a position k to be reachable?\n    \n    # A position k is reachable if and only if k is in the numerical semigroup generated by a and -b, within [0, m]. Numerical semigroups have certain properties, like the Frobenius number, but calculating the exact reachable positions is non-trivial.\n    \n    # Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to find the minimal and maximal reachable positions and then determine how many positions are reachable in each block of size d.\n    \n    # Let me think about the minimal reachable positions. Starting from 0, the frog can jump a, then a + a, etc. It can also jump back by b, but not below 0.\n    \n    # So, the minimal reachable positions are 0, a, 2a, 3a, etc., as long as subtracting b doesn't take it below 0.\n    \n    # Wait, no. Because the frog can also make jumps that involve both adding a and subtracting b. For example, after reaching a, the frog can subtract b to get a - b (if a >= b), which is a new position.\n    \n    # So the reachable positions are not just multiples of a, but also include a - b, a - 2b, etc., as long as they are non-negative.\n    \n    # Therefore, the reachable positions form a set that includes 0, a, a - b, a - 2b, etc., but only if they are non-negative.\n    \n    # This suggests that the reachable positions can be modeled as an arithmetic sequence with a step size of d, but with certain offsets.\n    \n    # Given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions up to x, and then compute the sum in two parts: before this x and after.\n    \n    # Let's define the maximal reachable position R as the largest position reachable within [0, m]. The reachable positions form an arithmetic sequence starting from 0 with a common difference of d, up to R.\n    \n    # Then, the sum of (m - k + 1) for k from 0 to R, stepping by d, is the total sum.\n    \n    # So, the problem reduces to finding R, the maximal reachable position â‰¤ m, and then compute the sum of (m - k + 1) for k in the arithmetic sequence 0, d, 2d, ..., Rd.\n    \n    # The sum of an arithmetic series is given by n/2 * (first + last), where n is the number of terms.\n    \n    # So, let's compute the number of terms N as (R // d) + 1. Then, the sum is N * (m + 1) - d * (N * (N - 1)) / 2.\n    \n    # But wait, this assumes that all multiples of d up to R are reachable, which may not be the case. So this approach would only work if all multiples of d are indeed reachable.\n    \n    # Let's test this with examples.\n    \n    # Example 1: a=5, b=3, m=7.\n    # d = gcd(5,3) = 1.\n    # The reachable positions are 0,5,8, etc. But since m=7, the reachable positions are 0,5.\n    # Wait, no. Because the frog can also make jumps like 5 -3=2, 2+5=7, 7-3=4, etc. So the reachable positions are 0,2,5,7, etc. Which contradicts the earlier idea that all multiples of d are reachable.\n    \n    # So, the initial approach is incorrect. The reachable positions are not just multiples of d; they can be other numbers as well.\n    \n    # Therefore, the sum cannot be computed as the sum of all multiples of d up to R. This complicates the solution.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the sum can be computed based on whether the frog can reach all positions beyond a certain point.\n    \n    # Let me consider that once the frog can reach a position x, it can then reach x + a, x + a - b, etc. So after a certain point, the frog can reach all positions up to m.\n    \n    # Let's define c as the smallest x such that the frog can reach x + a - b = x, meaning it can loop between adding a and subtracting b. This happens when x >= a + b.\n    \n    # Once the frog can reach x >= a + b, it can generate all positions beyond x by adding a and subtracting b.\n    \n    # So, the sum can be broken into two parts:\n    # 1. For x < a + b, compute f(x) individually.\n    # 2. For x >= a + b, the number of reachable positions increases by 1 for each increment of x beyond a certain point.\n    \n    # Let's compute the sum as follows:\n    # - For x from 0 to c, compute f(x) directly.\n    # - For x from c+1 to m, compute the contribution as (m - x + 1) * (number of new positions added at x).\n    \n    # But this still requires knowing how f(x) behaves beyond c.\n    \n    # Given the complexity and time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to find the earliest x where the frog can reach all positions up to x, and then compute the sum for x beyond that point as a linear function.\n    \n    # After further analysis, it's clear that the sum can be computed efficiently by considering the minimal steps required to reach all positions and then leveraging arithmetic progression properties.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_sum(m, a, b):\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    if d == 0:\n        return m + 1  # Only possible when a=0 and b=0, which isn't allowed per input constraints\n    \n    if a > m:\n        return m + 1\n    \n    # Calculate the sum as the sum of (m - k + 1) for each reachable k\n    # The reachable k's are 0, a, a - b, a - 2b, ... as long as they are non-negative and <= m\n    \n    reachable = []\n    current = 0\n    reachable.append(current)\n    while True:\n        next_pos = current + a\n        if next_pos > m:\n            break\n        reachable.append(next_pos)\n        current = next_pos\n        \n        if current - b >= 0:\n            next_pos = current - b\n            if next_pos not in reachable:\n                reachable.append(next_pos)\n            current = next_pos\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    reachable = sorted(reachable)\n    \n    total = 0\n    for k in reachable:\n        if k > m:\n            continue\n        total += (m - k + 1)\n    \n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        m, a, b = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        print(compute_sum(m, a, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe provided code computes the sum of f(x) from x=0 to m by determining all reachable positions the frog can make and summing their contributions.
