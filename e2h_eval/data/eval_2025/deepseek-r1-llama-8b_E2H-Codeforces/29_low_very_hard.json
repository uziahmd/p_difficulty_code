Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the remainder when the resulting number is divided by 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew starts with string s, which is a digit string. Then, there are n queries. Each query is like \"di -> ti\", meaning replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti. The substitutions are done in the order given, and each substitution affects the subsequent ones.\n\nAfter all substitutions, we need to compute the number represented by the final string modulo 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros should be ignored unless the number is zero (like if the string is empty or all zeros). Oh right, but the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string after replacement. Wait, no— wait, the note says in the third sample, the leading zeros are kept. So the number is computed as the integer value, ignoring leading zeros, except when the string is empty (then it's zero).\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"when you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeros; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\" So, for example, if the string becomes \"0000\", the number is 0, not 4 * 10^something.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Process all the substitution queries in order.\n2. After each substitution, the string changes.\n3. After all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, mod 1e9+7, but considering leading zeros only once (if any).\n\nBut wait, the issue is that the substitutions can be done in such a way that each step depends on previous ones. So we can't process them in reverse because that would change the substitution order.\n\nSo how do I model the substitutions efficiently?\n\nHmm. One approach is to model each character in the original string and see what it becomes after all the substitutions. But the substitutions can be in any order, and each substitution could potentially replace a digit in the current string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the transformations as a function for each digit, where each digit is replaced by some string, which can itself contain other digits that will be replaced in later steps.\n\nWait, that might complicate things because substitutions are processed in order, so the earlier substitutions affect the later ones.\n\nWait, but the order matters. For example, suppose we have a substitution where 'a' is replaced by 'b', and then another substitution where 'b' is replaced by 'c'. So the initial 'a' becomes 'b', and then each 'b' becomes 'c' in the second substitution.\n\nSo, to model this correctly, perhaps for each digit, we can track how it gets transformed through each substitution step.\n\nBut considering that the substitutions are applied in a certain order, it's tricky because each substitution could create new digits that are subject to future substitutions.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can model the transformations for each digit using a dictionary, where each key is a digit, and the value is the string that it gets replaced into after all the substitutions.\n\nWait, but the order of substitutions is important. Because each substitution is processed in sequence, so a digit might be replaced multiple times as each substitution is applied.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the substitution rules as a function that, given a digit, returns the string it becomes after applying all the substitutions up to that point.\n\nWait, but that's not directly possible because substitutions are applied in a particular order.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of trying to apply all substitutions at once, perhaps model the transformations step by step.\n\nEach substitution is processed in order. For each substitution, replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti. So, for each substitution, the current string is modified.\n\nBut if the string is long, and n is up to 105, doing this naively could result in O(n * |s|) operations, but since |s| can be up to 105, and n up to 105, that's manageable.\n\nBut wait, for each substitution, we need to scan the entire current string and replace all instances of di with ti. For each substitution, the time is O(m), where m is the length of the current string. Since each substitution can potentially increase the length, but the total sum of ti lengths is 105, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n- For each query in order:\n   - di is the digit to replace, ti is the string to replace with.\n   - Replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n- After all queries, process the resulting string to compute the number mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement the replacement efficiently.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n\n2. Read n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then compute the remainder when the resulting number is divided by 1,000,000,007. Each substitution query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with another string, which can include other digits that will be processed in subsequent queries.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Start by reading the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace all occurrences of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n3. **Compute Result**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a number, ignoring leading zeros unless the string is empty (in which case the number is zero). Compute the result modulo 1,000,000,007.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\ncurrent_s = s\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1]\n    current_s = current_s.replace(di, ti)\n\n# Now compute the number\nif not current_s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    num_str = current_s.lstrip('0')\n    if num_str == '':\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = 0\n        for c in num_str:\n            num = (num * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n        print(num % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input.\n2. **Processing Queries**: Each query is processed in order, replacing all instances of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring. This ensures that each substitution affects the subsequent ones correctly.\n3. **Computing the Result**: After all substitutions, the resulting string is converted into an integer. Leading zeros are ignored, except when the string is empty, in which case the result is zero. The number is then computed modulo 1,000,000,007 to handle large values efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is applied correctly in sequence, and the final result is computed efficiently using modular arithmetic to handle potential overflow issues.",
