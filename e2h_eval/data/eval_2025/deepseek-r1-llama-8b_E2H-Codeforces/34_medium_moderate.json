And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the average of several weeks, each week being k consecutive days. The input gives me n days and a list of sleep times for each day. My task is to compute the average of all these weeks.\n\nHmm, let's think about the example given. For instance, when n=3 and k=2, there are 3-2+1=2 weeks. Each week is two days: [3,4] and [4,7]. The sum is 3+4 +4+7 = 16, divided by 2 weeks gives 8. So average is 8 hours. But in the sample output, it's 9.000... Wait wait, maybe I misread. Oh wait, no, the sample input shows that the first test case's output is 9.0000000000. Wait, what's happening here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me see: 3,4,7. So weeks are [3,4], sum 7, and [4,7], sum 11. Total 18 over 2 weeks is 9. Yes, that's correct. Oh right, I added wrong before. So each week is summed, then all sums are averaged.\n\nSo the approach is: for each window of size k in the array, compute the sum, then add all these sums together, and divide by the number of windows (n-k+1).\n\nThe challenge is to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2e5, which is quite large. If we compute each window naively by iterating through each element each time, it would be O(nk), which for 2e5 * 2e5 is 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to compute the sum of each sliding window. The standard approach for this is to use a sliding window technique with prefix sums or a running sum.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read the array of n integers.\n3. Compute the sum for each window of size k.\n4. Sum all these window sums.\n5. Divide by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n6. Output the average with sufficient precision.\n\nNow, how to compute the window sums efficiently.\n\nOption 1: Prefix Sum Array.\n\nCompute the prefix sum array S where S[i] is the sum of the first i elements. Then, for each window starting at index i (0-based?), the sum is S[i + k] - S[i]. Summing all these differences will give the total of all window sums.\n\nYes, that's a good approach. The prefix sum allows us to compute each window's sum in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code:\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array:\n   s[0] = 0\n   s[1] = a[0]\n   s[2] = a[0] + a[1]\n   ...\n   s[n] = sum of all a[0..n-1]\n\nThen, for each window starting at index i (0-based in the array), the sum is s[i + k] - s[i].\n\nWait, but in terms of the array indices, let's see:\n\nSuppose the array is zero-based, from 0 to n-1.\n\nThen, the window starting at i (inclusive) and covering i, i+1, ..., i + k-1 days. So the sum is a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[i+k-1].\n\nIn the prefix sum array, s is built such that s[0] = 0, s[1] = a[0], s[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc., so s[j] is sum of first j elements, i.e., a[0] to a[j-1].\n\nThus, the sum from a[i] to a[i + k - 1] is s[i + k] - s[i].\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array.\n- Iterate through each possible starting index i (from 0 to n - k).\n   For each i, compute the sum as s[i + k] - s[i].\n- Sum all these values into a total sum.\n- The average is total_sum / (n - k + 1).\n\nWait, but in the first sample, n=3, k=2. So the number of windows is 2.\n\nprefix sum s would be:\n\ns[0]=0\n\ns[1] = 3\n\ns[2] = 3+4=7\n\ns[3] = 3+4+7=14\n\nThen, for i=0: sum is s[2] - s[0] =7.\n\nFor i=1: sum is s[3] - s[1] =14-3=11.\n\nTotal sum is 7+11=18. Average is 18/2=9. Which matches the sample.\n\nGreat, so the method works.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nInitialize total_sum to 0.\n\nLoop i from 0 to (n - k):\n\n   total_sum += (s[i + k] - s[i])\n\nCompute average: total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n\nBut wait, since n can be up to 2e5, using a list for the prefix sum is manageable.\n\nBut computing the prefix sum is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nIn Python, reading the input can be done via input().split(), but for larger inputs, sometimes it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the constraints given, even with n=2e5, it's manageable.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead the first line as n, k.\n\nRead the second line as the array.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the total sum as described.\n\nCalculate the average.\n\nPrint with enough decimal digits.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the third example has an average of 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich is 7 weeks, sum 7*28964.2857142857 = let's see: 7 * 28964.2857142857 = 202851. So the total sum was 202851.\n\nSo the code must compute the average accurately.\n\nBut in Python, floating point calculations might have precision issues, but since the required relative error is up to 1e-6, using floating points should be okay.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n, k.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the total sum.\n\naverage = total_sum / num_weeks.\n\nnum_weeks is n - k + 1.\n\nNow, output the average with 10 decimal digits? Or more?\n\nWait, the problem says: output the answer with at least 6 digits after decimal point. But the sample outputs show 10 digits. So perhaps we can print 10 or 12 digits and ensure that the trailing zeros are present.\n\nIn Python, formatting the output as, say, \"%.10f\" may not always give exactly 10 digits because of floating point precision. Alternatively, we can compute the exact value as a fraction and represent it precisely, but that's probably overkill.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using decimal module for higher precision, but that might complicate things.\n\nBut for the given constraints, using floating points should suffice, as the numbers are within 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10, which is within the precision of a double.\n\nWait, but when you have a sum of 1e10, the average could be up to 1e10/(2e5) = 5e4, which is manageable.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(n - k + 1):\n    total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the third sample input:\n\nInput is 8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo n=8, k=2. So number of weeks is 7.\n\nEach window is two elements.\n\nCompute the sum for each window:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nSum all: 3 +6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201960, +790=202750.\n\nWait, 3+6=9, plus 100004 is 100013, plus 100123 is 200136, plus 579 is 200715, plus 1245 is 201960, plus 790 is 202750.\n\nSo total is 202750, divided by 7 is 202750/7=28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich is the sample output.\n\nSo the code correctly computes this.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\na=[3,4,7].\n\nprefix is [0,3,7,14].\n\ni ranges from 0 to 1.\n\ni=0: 3+4=7.\n\ni=1:4+7=11.\n\nTotal=18, average 9.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is '1 1\\n10' → n=1, k=1.\n\nNumber of weeks is 1.\n\nsum is 10. Average is 10.\n\nSample 3: as discussed.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nCase where k =n: only one window, sum all elements.\n\nCase where k=1: sum each element and average.\n\nAnother edge case: n=k=2e5, so the code must handle large arrays efficiently.\n\nWhat about when all a[i] are 0? The average is 0.\n\nWhat about when the sum is very large, leading to integer overflows? But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in the code, the prefix array is built correctly.\n\nTesting another example: n=5, k=3.\n\na = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nprefix: 0,1,3,6,10,15.\n\nwindows are:\n\n1+2+3=6\n\n2+3+4=9\n\n3+4+5=12\n\nsum is 6+9+12=27.\n\naverage 27/3=9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nRegarding the output format: the problem says that the output must have at least 6 digits after the decimal point, but the sample shows 10 digits. So to match the samples, perhaps printing 10 digits is better.\n\nIn the code, the format is set to 10 decimal places. That should be fine.\n\nSo the code looks correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week consists of k consecutive days. The goal is to efficiently compute this average using a sliding window technique.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a sequence of sleep times for n days and need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks of k consecutive days. The number of such weeks is (n - k + 1).\n\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum of each window from scratch, we use a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This reduces the overall complexity from O(nk) to O(n).\n\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the sleep times array. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any k-length window.\n\n4. **Summing Window Sums**: Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum for each window of size k. Each window's sum is derived by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the window from the prefix sum at the end of the window.\n\n5. **Compute Average**: Sum all the window sums and divide by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n\n6. **Precision Handling**: Ensure the result is printed with sufficient precision to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sum array\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    # Calculate total sum of all windows\n    total = 0\n    num_windows = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(num_windows):\n        total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n    \n    # Compute average and print with 10 decimal places\n    average = total / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin` for efficiency, especially with large inputs.\n- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is built to allow quick computation of any subarray sum.\n- **Efficient Window Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, each window sum is computed in constant time, leading to an overall linear time complexity.\n- **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average, which is then printed with high precision to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle up to the maximum constraints efficiently and accurately, providing the required result within the problem's precision limits.",
