    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible substring, I need to check if it occurs more than once, and find the maximum length among those.\n\nBut wait, how do I approach this efficiently? The string can be up to 100 characters long, which isn't too bad, but we need a solution that doesn't take way too long.\n\nFirst, let's think about what a substring is. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string. So for each possible starting index and ending index, we can extract a substring.\n\nThe brute-force approach would be to generate all possible substrings, store them in a hash (like a set or a dictionary), and then for each substring, see if it appears again later in the string. But since the string can be 100 characters, the number of substrings could be O(n^2), which is 10,000 for n=100. That's manageable, I think.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible substring lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1.\n2. For each length l, check all possible substrings of length l in the string.\n3. For each such substring, check if it appears again somewhere else in the string (possibly overlapping).\n4. If any such substring exists, return l as the answer.\n5. If no such substring is found for length l, decrease l by 1 and repeat.\n\nThis way, we can find the maximum possible l without checking smaller l's unnecessarily once we find a match.\n\nWait, but how do we efficiently check for the existence of a substring? For each substring s, we can look through the rest of the string to see if s appears again.\n\nAlternatively, for each substring, we can collect all starting indices and see if there are at least two indices where the substring starts, possibly with the second being after the first, allowing overlaps.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me outline the steps more clearly.\n\n- Start with the maximum possible l, which is len(s) - 1, because a substring longer than that can't appear twice. Wait, no: for a string of length n, the maximum possible l is n-1, because you can have the same substring starting at position 0 and position 1, which is allowed. So for 'aaa', the maximum is 2, appearing twice as 'aa'.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 'ababa' the output is 3. The substring 'aba' appears starting at 0 and 2. So yes, for n=5, the maximum l is 3.\n\nSo the initial l to check is len(s) - 1, then decrementing down.\n\nFor each l:\n\n- For i in 0 to len(s)-l:\n   - Extract substring s[i:i+l]\n   - Check if this substring appears again in the string, starting anywhere except i, or maybe including i but later.\n\nWait, but in 'zzz', the substrings of length 2 are 'zz' appearing at 0,1. So the maximum l is 2.\n\nSo the algorithm should proceed as follows:\n\nLoop l from (n-1) down to 1:\n\n   For each possible starting index i of the substring of length l:\n\n      Extract substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n      Check if substr appears again in s, starting at any j > i, or j can be equal to i? Wait, no. Because if j ==i, then it's the same position, but we're looking for at least two occurrences. So substr can start at i and j, where j can be any other index, regardless of whether it's before or after. Wait no, substr starting at i and j, j can be any other index, but i and j must be different.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"met in the string at least twice.\" So, for example, in 'aaaaa', the substring 'aaaa' appears at positions 0, 1, 2, etc., so it's considered to meet the condition.\n\nSo for each substr, I just need to see if it exists in the string more than once, regardless of their positions.\n\nSo for each l from high to low:\n\n   For each i in 0 to len(s)-l:\n\n      substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n      for j in i+1 to len(s)-l:\n\n          if s[j:j+l] == substr:\n\n              return l as the maximum.\n\nIf after checking all l's, none satisfy, then the answer is 0? Or wait, the problem says to output the length, but in the sample input, for the first case 'abcd', the output is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking substrings of decreasing lengths starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we examine all possible substrings and check if they appear more than once in the string. This ensures that we find the longest valid substring efficiently.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Substring Lengths**: Start from the longest possible substring length and decrease down to 1.\n2. **Check Each Substring**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and check if they appear again later in the string.\n3. **Return the Longest Valid Substring**: As soon as we find a valid substring for a given length, return that length as the result.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring without unnecessary checks for smaller lengths once a valid one is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        # Check if substr appears again starting from j = i+1 onwards\n        for j in range(i+1, n - l + 1):\n            if s[j:j+l] == substr:\n                print(l)\n                exit()\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop through possible substring lengths from the longest (n-1) down to 1.\n3. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings starting from each index.\n4. **Check for Duplicates**: For each generated substring, check if it appears again in the string starting from any subsequent index.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid substring is found, print its length and exit. If no valid substring is found after all checks, print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring by leveraging early termination once the longest valid substring is identified.",
