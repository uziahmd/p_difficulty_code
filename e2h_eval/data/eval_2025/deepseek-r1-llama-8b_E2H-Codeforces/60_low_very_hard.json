            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code and counting certain sequences after each modification to a string S. Hmm. So each character added to S is either a '0' or '1', representing dots and dashes respectively. After each addition, I need to find the number of non-empty substrings that correspond to valid English letters, according to the Morse code rules.\n\nWait, wait. But Morse code for letters can be 1 to 4 bits long, right? And some combinations are invalid. Oh right, four specific strings are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring of S that matches these exactly doesn't count towards our total.\n\nSo the task is, after each step, compute how many valid Morse letter substrings exist in the current S.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe we can model the problem by tracking the possible states as we build S step by step. Each state represents the last few characters, up to 4, because any new character can form a substring of length 1-4 with the previous ones.\n\nFor example, suppose the current string ends with a certain sequence of 3 bits. When adding a new bit, the new ending could be of length 4. We need to check if this new 4-bit string is one of the invalid ones. If not, then it contributes to the count.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently track all possible valid substrings as the string grows?\n\nAnother idea: for each position in S, keep track of all possible substrings ending at that position which are valid Morse codes. Then, the total number of such substrings is the sum over all positions of the count of valid substrings ending there.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each new character can create new substrings ending at that position. For example, when adding a new '1' at position i, the substrings ending at i are:\n\n- The single '1' (length 1)\n- The substring ending at i-1 plus this '1' (if that was part of a valid substring)\n- Similarly, check substrings of length 2, 3, 4 ending at i.\n\nWait, but how do I know which previous substrings to consider? It might get complicated if I try to track all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each position, I can track all possible possible endings of the substrings. Like, for each position i, I can keep a dictionary where the keys are the last k bits (for k=1 to 4), and the value is whether that substring is valid. Wait, but that's not enough because the substring could be of varying lengths.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: For each position, we can track the number of valid substrings ending at that position. Let's denote dp[i] as the number of valid substrings ending at position i.\n\nBut how to compute dp[i] based on previous values?\n\nLet's see. When we add a new character c at position i, which is either '0' or '1', the new substrings that end at i are:\n\n- The substring consisting only of c.\n- Substrings formed by appending c to substrings ending at i-1, i-2, etc., as long as those substrings are valid and the combined string is also valid.\n\nWait, no. Because a new substring ending at i can start anywhere from position i-3 back to i. For example, if i is the current position, then the new substrings are s[i], s[i-1..i], s[i-2..i], s[i-3..i], provided their lengths are <=4.\n\nBut checking all possibilities each time might be computationally expensive, especially since m can be up to 3000. So for each of the 3000 steps, I need an efficient way to calculate how many new valid substrings are added.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what defines a valid substring. A substring is valid if it's a Morse code of a letter, i.e., it's not one of the four invalid strings.\n\nSo, for each possible substring (of length 1-4) ending at position i, I need to check if it's valid. If it is, then it contributes to the total count.\n\nSo, for each new character, I can look back up to 3 positions (since the maximum substring length is 4) and check each possible substring ending at i.\n\nWait, yes. For each i, I can check substrings of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4 ending at i. Each of these substrings is a candidate for being valid.\n\nIf a substring is valid, then it adds 1 to the total count.\n\nWait, but each valid substring is a distinct occurrence. So for example, if a substring of length 2 is valid, it's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to a string `S`. Each modification appends either a '0' or '1' to `S`, and we need to count how many valid English letters can be formed from any substring of `S` after each modification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each character added to `S` can form new substrings ending at that position. These substrings can be of lengths 1 to 4. We need to check if each substring is valid based on the given invalid Morse codes.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: For each position in `S`, we track the number of valid substrings ending at that position. This helps us efficiently compute the total number of valid substrings after each modification.\n3. **Efficient Checking**: For each new character added, we check all possible substrings ending at that position (of lengths 1 to 4) to see if they are valid. If a substring is valid, it contributes to the total count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n    return s not in {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\ntotal = 0\nprev_counts = [0] * 4  # dp[i] where i is the length of the prefix up to 4\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    s.append(c)\n    current = 0\n    for i in range(1, 5):\n        if len(s) >= i:\n            substr = ''.join(s[-i:])\n            if is_valid(substr):\n                current += prev_counts[i-1]\n    current %= MOD\n    total = (total + current) % MOD\n    prev_counts.insert(0, current)\n    print(total)\n\nprint('\\n'.join([str(x) for x in prev_counts]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `s` to build the string `S` and a variable `total` to keep track of the cumulative count of valid substrings.\n2. **Iterate Over Modifications**: For each modification, we read the character and append it to `s`.\n3. **Check Substrings**: For each new character, we check all possible substrings ending at this character (lengths 1 to 4). We use a helper function `is_valid` to determine if a substring is valid.\n4. **Update Counts**: We maintain an array `prev_counts` to store the number of valid substrings ending at each position. For each new character, we update this array and the total count of valid substrings.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be large, we use modulo `10^9 + 7` to keep the numbers manageable.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid Morse code substrings after each modification, providing the required results in an optimal manner.",
