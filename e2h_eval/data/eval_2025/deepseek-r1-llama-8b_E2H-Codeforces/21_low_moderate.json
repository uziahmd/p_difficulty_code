The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a way that a_i + b_j is odd. So, for a key j and chest i, if one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd.\n\nHmm, wait, because adding two evens gives even, two odds give even too. Only even and odd sums are odd. So, the condition a_i + b_j ≡ 1 mod 2 means that one must be even and the other odd.\n\nSo, for each key, it can only unlock chests of the opposite parity. That is, a key with an even number can only unlock chests with odd numbers, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the first thing I think is that we need to separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly, the keys should be split into even and odd.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between the number of keys of even parity and the number of chests with odd a_i, plus the minimum between the number of keys with odd parity and the number of chests with even a_i.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- E_a: number of chests where a_i is even.\n- O_a: number of chests where a_i is odd.\n- E_b: number of keys where b_j is even.\n- O_b: number of keys where b_j is odd.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of two possibilities:\n\n1. We use as many even keys as possible on the odd chests. So, the number of such uses is min(O_a, E_b).\n2. We use as many odd keys as possible on the even chests. So, the number of such uses is min(E_a, O_b).\n\nBut wait, no. Because each key can be used only once. So, for example, if I have a lot of even keys, I can only pair each even key with an odd chest. So, the total would be the sum of these two minima.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests is min(O_a, E_b) + min(E_a, O_b). Wait, no. Because maybe E_b is larger than O_a, but after using all O_a, there's some E_b left that can't be used. Similarly for the other terms.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to take the minimum of E_b and O_a for the first pairing (even keys for odd chests), then add the minimum of O_b and E_a for the second pairing (odd keys for even chests).\n\nSo, the total is min(O_a, E_b) + min(E_a, O_b). But wait, that's not correct because each key can be used only once, and each chest also.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose you have E_b even keys and O_a odd chests. Each even key can be used on any odd chest, but each chest can be used only once. So, the maximum possible here is min(E_b, O_a). Similarly, the odd keys can be used on even chests, up to min(O_b, E_a). So the total maximum is the sum of these two minima.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i (E_a and O_a).\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j (E_b and O_b).\n3. Compute the sum of min(E_b, O_a) + min(E_a, O_b).\n4. That's the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nWait, but wait. What if E_b is less than O_a? Then, all E_b keys are used on O_a chests, which leaves some O_a chests unopened. Then, for the other part, O_b can be used on E_a. So, yes, adding them is correct.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\na_i are [9,14,6,2,11]. So, let's see:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\n\nSo, O_a = 2 (9, 11), E_a = 3 (14,6,2).\n\nb_j are [8,4,7,20]. \n\n8 is even, 4 even,7 odd,20 even.\n\nSo, E_b is 3 (8,4,20), O_b is 1 (7",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can only unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Values**: First, we count the number of even and odd values among the chests and keys. This helps us determine how many keys of each parity (even or odd) can be used effectively.\n2. **Calculate Maximum Usable Keys**: For each parity of keys (even and odd), determine how many chests they can unlock. Specifically:\n   - Even keys can unlock odd-numbered chests.\n   - Odd keys can unlock even-numbered chests.\n3. **Sum the Minimums**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum values between the counts of usable keys and chests for each parity combination.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    m = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:n+2]))\n    b = list(map(int, input[n+2:n+2+m]))\n    \n    E_a = 0  # even a_i\n    O_a = 0  # odd a_i\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            E_a += 1\n        else:\n            O_a += 1\n    \n    E_b = 0  # even b_j\n    O_b = 0  # odd b_j\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            E_b += 1\n        else:\n            O_b += 1\n    \n    use_even_key_on_odd_chest = min(E_b, O_a)\n    use_odd_key_on_even_chest = min(O_b, E_a)\n    total = use_even_key_on_odd_chest + use_odd_key_on_even_chest\n    \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of chest values `a`, and the list of key values `b`.\n2. **Counting Parities**: We iterate through the lists `a` and `b` to count how many even and odd numbers there are.\n3. **Calculating Usable Keys**: For each parity combination (even keys on odd chests and odd keys on even chests), we calculate how many such combinations are possible by taking the minimum of the respective counts.\n4. **Summing Results**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of these two minimum values, ensuring we maximize the number of chests opened efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently utilize each key and chest pair to achieve the maximum number of chests opened, considering all edge cases and constraints.",
