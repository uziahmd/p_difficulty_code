She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has n tabs open in her browser. The tabs are numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right within the currently open tabs, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to close all unnecessary tabs.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what each operation does. So moving the cursor takes 1 second per step. Closing all tabs to the left or right of the current position also takes 1 second each.\n\nWait, for example, if she's at position i, she can choose to close left (which would close all tabs less than i), or close right (all greater than i). But when she closes, the a and b change because those tabs are now closed.\n\nSo the first thing I need to model is the current state: which tabs are open. But since n is up to 100, maybe we can represent the state by the current a and b, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be calculated without tracking all possible states, but rather by considering the necessary movements and operations based on the initial and target states.\n\nLet me think about the required steps. The process will involve:\n\n1. Moving the cursor to a position where she can perform a close operation.\n2. Performing the close operation.\n3. Possibly moving again to another position to perform another close.\n4. Then, possibly moving back to some position, though I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but after closing some tabs, the available tabs are updated. So after each close, the a and b change, which affects where the cursor can move.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to structure the problem into phases. For example:\n\n- First, decide whether to close the left side or the right side first, or both.\n\nBut wait, sometimes you have to close both sides. Like in the first sample input: the initial position is 3, and she needs to keep 2-4. So she needs to close tabs 1 (left) and 5 (right).\n\nSo how do we model that?\n\nLet's consider the steps:\n\nCase 1: Only the left needs to be closed.\n\nShe moves to position l-1, then close left.\n\nWait no, wait. Because she can only close left when she is at some position i. After she closes left, all tabs to the left of i are closed, so a becomes i.\n\nSimilarly, when she closes right, b becomes i.\n\nSo the key is to determine which tabs need to be closed on the left and right.\n\nWait, but the problem says she must end up with exactly the tabs l to r. So any tabs outside of [l, r] must be closed.\n\nSo, the initial state is that a=1, b=n. The desired state is a=l, b=r.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you close left, it sets a to your current position minus one? Or wait, according to the problem statement:\n\nIf the cursor is at i, closing left will close all tabs from a to i-1. So after that, the new a is i, because those tabs are closed.\n\nSimilarly, closing right closes all from i+1 to b, and the new b is i.\n\nSo the process involves:\n\n- Starting with a=1, b=n.\n\n- At each step, choose to move left or right, or close left or right.\n\n- After a close, the a or b changes.\n\nSo the problem is similar to a state transition problem, where each state is determined by the current a, b, and the cursor position.\n\nBut given that n is up to 100, and a and b can range from 1 to n, the number of possible states is manageable. However, for each state, we need to track the minimal steps taken to reach it.\n\nSo perhaps a BFS approach is suitable here.\n\nYes, I think BFS is a good idea. Because each state transition takes one second, and we want the minimal steps.\n\nEach state can be represented by (a, b, pos), where 'a' is the left boundary, 'b' is the right boundary, and 'pos' is the current cursor position.\n\nThe initial state is (1, n, pos).\n\nWe need to find the minimal steps to reach a state where a >= l and b <= r. Wait, no: the final state must have a = l and b = r, because all tabs outside [l, r] must be closed.\n\nSo the target is (l, r, ...), but the cursor can be anywhere between l and r, as long as a and b are l and r respectively.\n\nSo the target states are any (l, r",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while keeping the tabs within this segment open. The solution involves using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Luba can move the cursor left or right and close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Each movement or closure operation takes one second. The goal is to find the minimum time to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n2. **State Representation**: Each state is represented by three values: the current left boundary (`a`), the current right boundary (`b`), and the current position of the cursor (`pos`). The initial state is `(1, n, pos)`.\n\n3. **BFS Strategy**: We use BFS to explore all possible states starting from the initial state. Each state transition corresponds to either moving the cursor or closing tabs. We keep track of visited states to avoid revisiting them and ensure the shortest path is found.\n\n4. **Target State**: The target state is when `a = l` and `b = r`, indicating all necessary tabs are open and all unnecessary tabs are closed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input_line.split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # If no tabs to close, return 0\n    if l > 1 or r < n:\n        pass\n    else:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # BFS setup\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque()\n    initial_a = 1\n    initial_b = n\n    queue.append((initial_a, initial_b, pos))\n    visited.add((initial_a, initial_b, pos))\n    \n    directions = [(-1, 'move'), (1, 'move')]  # left and right moves\n    close_left = (0, 'close_left')\n    close_right = (0, 'close_right')\n    \n    min_steps = -1\n    \n    while queue:\n        a, b, current_pos = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we've reached the target state\n        if a >= l and b <= r:\n            min_steps = 0\n            break\n        \n        # Generate next states\n        # Move left\n        new_pos = max(1, current_pos - 1)\n        new_state = (a, b, new_pos)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append(new_state)\n            min_steps += 1\n        \n        # Move right\n        new_pos = min(n, current_pos + 1)\n        new_state = (a, b, new_pos)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append(new_state)\n            min_steps += 1\n        \n        # Close left\n        if current_pos > a:\n            new_a = current_pos\n            new_state = (new_a, b, current_pos)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append(new_state)\n                min_steps += 1\n                if new_a >= l and b <= r:\n                    min_steps -= 1  # because the last step was closing left, which may have taken us to the target\n                    break\n        \n        # Close right\n        if current_pos < b:\n            new_b = current_pos\n            new_state = (a, new_b, current_pos)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append(new_state)\n                min_steps += 1\n                if a >= l and new_b <= r:\n                    min_steps -= 1  # because the last step was closing right, which may have taken us to the target\n                    break\n    \n    print(min_steps)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Setup**: Read the input values and handle edge cases where no tabs need to be closed.\n- **BFS Initialization**: Start BFS from the initial state `(1, n, pos)`.\n- **State Transitions**: For each state, consider moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right.
