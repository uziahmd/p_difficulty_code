    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing certain swap operations. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', or '1' and '2'. So, for example, you can swap '01' to get '10', but you can't swap '02' or '20'.\n\nHmm, right. So the key here is understanding which characters can be moved relative to each other. Because of the allowed swaps, certain positions can be rearranged.\n\nLet me think about what the allowed swaps mean in terms of movement. Since we can swap '0' and '1' adjacently, any '0's and '1's can be reordered among themselves. Similarly, '1's and '2's can be reordered. But '0's cannot pass through '1's or '2's unless there's a way to move them via the allowed swaps.\n\nWait, no. Because '0's can't directly swap with '2's. So for example, if you have a '0' followed by a '2', you can't swap them. So how can a '0' move past a '2'? Well, maybe via the '1's acting as intermediaries. For instance, suppose you have '0', '2', '1'. Then you can swap '2' and '1' to make '0', '1', '2'. Then swap '0' and '1' to get '1', '0', '2'. Wait, but that doesn't help the '0' get past the '2'. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the movement possibilities. Let's see:\n\n- '0's can only be swapped with '1's. So a '0' can move to the left past any number of '1's, but can't move past '2's because they can't be directly swapped.\n\nWait no. Because a '0' can only swap with '1's. So for a '0' to move to the left, it needs to have a '1' on its immediate left. Otherwise, it can't move past that 'non-1' character.\n\nSimilarly, a '2' can only move to the left if it has a '1' immediately to the left. Because '2' can only swap with '1's.\n\nSo, for example, consider the string '210'. Can the '0' move to the left? Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 2 1 0\n\nWe can swap '1' and '0' (they are adjacent), but wait, no. Wait, the allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' and between '1' and '2'. So in '210', the '1' and '0' are adjacent. So swapping them would give '201', but wait, is that allowed? Oh yes! Because '1' and '0' are allowed to swap. So after one swap, we get '201'. Now, the '0' is at position 2. Can it move further left? It's now before a '2', which is not allowed to be swapped. So no. So in this case, the '0' can move one position to the left.\n\nBut what about a more complex situation, like '021'? How does the '0' move?\n\nIn '021', the '0' is at position 1. It's followed by '2', which can't be swapped. So '0' can't move further right. So the '0' remains where it is.\n\nWait, but what if there's a '1' somewhere else. Like '0121'. Let's see:\n\nThe '0' is at position 1. It can swap with the '1' at position 2, giving '0112'. Now, the '0' is at position 1, followed by another '1'. So it can swap again, moving to position 2, resulting in '1012'. Then, the '0' can't move further because it's now after a '1', but perhaps it's useful.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the '0' can move past '1's but not '2's. So perhaps the '0's can be arranged in any order among themselves, but their relative positions to '2's are fixed unless there are '1's that can be used as intermediaries.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think about a longer string, say '2010'. How can the '0's and '1's move?\n\nIn '2010':\n\nPosition 0: '2'\n1: '0'\n2: '1'\n3: '0'\n\nWe want to bring the first '0' (position 1) to the front, but it's stuck behind the '2' because they can't swap. However, the '1' at position 2 can be swapped with '0' at position 1, making '2100'. Then, the '0's can move past the '1's, but since the '2' is still in front, the '0's can't get past it.\n\nSo in this case, the '0's can't move beyond the '2's.\n\nHmm, so the conclusion is that '0's cannot move past '2's, because you can't swap '0's and '2's. So the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. But within the '0's and '1's, and within the '1's and '2's, they can be reordered.\n\nWait, but wait. Suppose you have a '0', '1', '2' sequence. Then, can the '0' move to the right? Let's see:\n\nInitial: 0 1 2\n\nSwap '1' and '2' to get 0 2 1. Then, swap '0' and '2'—can't do that. So the '0' can't move past '2's. But perhaps there's a way to move the '2' away using '1's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's impossible.\n\nSo, the key idea is that '0's can only be reordered among themselves, but their positions relative to '2's are fixed. Because you can't swap '0's with '2's directly, and any movement of '0's would require moving past '2's, which isn't possible.\n\nSimilarly, '2's can be reordered among themselves but can't move past '0's.\n\nWait, but '1's can act as intermediaries. For example, if you have a '0' followed by a '2', but there's a '1' somewhere else, perhaps you can arrange the '1's to allow the '0' to move.\n\nWait, let's take an example: '021'.\n\nCan the '0' move past the '2'? No, because '0' can't directly swap with '2'. So the '0' can't move past the '2'.\n\nAnother example: '201'. So '2' is first, then '0', then '1'. The '0' can be swapped with '1' to get '210'. Now, the '0' is after '2' and before '1'. But it can't move past '2' anymore.\n\nWait, but maybe if there's a '1' before the '0', it can be moved. Hmm.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nWhat's the allowed swap graph? Each swap allows certain transitions.\n\nFor example, '0' can be adjacent to '1' and can swap. '1' can be adjacent to '0' and '2' and can swap. '2' can be adjacent to '1' and can swap.\n\nSo the connected components are determined by which characters can be adjacent via these swaps.\n\nWait, no. Because the swaps are only between specific pairs. So '0' can be swapped with '1's, but not with '2's. So '0's can only move through '1's, but cannot jump over '2's.\n\nSo, for '0's, their movement is limited by the '2's. They can't move past '2's. So the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain the same as in the original string.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because '0's can't pass '2's, their order is fixed. So, for example, if the original string has a '0' before a '2', then in the final string, that '0' must still come before that '2'.\n\nSimilarly, '2's can't pass '0's, so their order is also fixed relative to '0's.\n\nBut '1's can move freely among themselves, and also can be placed between '0's and '2's.\n\nSo, the approach is to separate the string into three groups:\n\n1. All '0's that appear before any '2's.\n2. All '1's and '2's that can be reordered among themselves.\n3. All '2's that appear before any '0's.\n\nWait, no. Because '2's can't move past '0's either. So the '2's that appear before '0's in the original string can't be moved after the '0's. So the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed based on their occurrence in the original string.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- The relative order of all '0's and '2's is fixed. So, in the resulting string, any '0' that appears before a '2' in the original string must still appear before it.\n\n- Among the '0's, their order can be rearranged. But since they're all '0's, their order doesn't matter for lex order.\n\n- Similarly, among the '2's, their order can be rearranged, but since they are '2's, their order doesn't matter for lex order.\n\nWait, but the '1's can be reordered among themselves, but also can be interleaved between '0's and '2's.\n\nSo, the minimal lex string will be formed by:\n\n- All the '0's that are before any '2's in the original string, but arranged in any order (since they're all '0's).\n\n- Then, arrange the '1's as much as possible in the earliest positions.\n\n- Then, arrange the '2's that are before any '0's in the original string, but again, in any order.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the string into two parts: the part before the first '2' and the part after.\n\nWait, no. Because the string can have multiple '2's and '0's scattered.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the string and group the '0's, '1's, and '2's in such a way that:\n\n- All '0's that appear before any '2's can be collected together, and arranged as early as possible.\n\n- All '2's that appear after any '0's must be kept after those '0's.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal lex string is achieved by first taking all the '0's that are before any '2's, then all the '1's, then all the '2's that are after any '0's.\n\nWait, but how do the '1's fit in?\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nTake the input '100210'.\n\nThe output is '001120'.\n\nBreaking down the input: '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nSo, the '0's are at positions 1, 2, 5.\n\nThe '2' is at position 3.\n\nThe '1's are at 0, 4.\n\nIn the output, the '0's from the original string that are before any '2's are the ones at positions 1 and 2. These are moved to the front. Then the '1's are placed next, followed by the remaining '0's and '2's.\n\nWait, but in the output, it's '0','0','1','1','2','0'.\n\nSo, the '0's that were before the '2' are collected, then the '1's are arranged, then the '2' and the remaining '0's.\n\nWait, but the '2' comes after the '1's. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the '1's can be arranged in any order, but to minimize the lex order, we want as many '0's as possible early, followed by as many '1's as possible, then the '2's.\n\nSo, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n1. Split the string into two parts: the part up to the first '2', and the part starting from the first '2'.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple '2's and '0's mixed in?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to collect all '0's that are before any '2's, then collect all the '1's, and then collect all the '2's that are after any '0's.\n\nWait, no. Because in the original string, the '0's may be interleaved with '2's.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to find the positions of all '0's and '2's, and ensure that any '0's that come before a '2' in the original string stay before it in the final string. The '1's can be arranged among themselves and possibly between '0's and '2's.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nWe can rearrange the '0's and '1's among themselves in any order, as long as their relative positions to '2's are preserved.\n\nWait, no. Because '0's can't cross '2's, and '2's can't cross '0's. So the relative order between '0's and '2's must remain as in the original string.\n\nSo, for example, if in the original string, a '0' comes before a '2', then in the final string, that '0' must still come before that '2'. But the '0's can be reordered among themselves, and the '2's can be reordered among themselves.\n\nAdditionally, '1's can be reordered among themselves and can be placed anywhere except between '0's and '2's, but wait, no. Because '1's can be swapped with '0's and '2's, so '1's can be positioned between '0's and '2's.\n\nWait, no. Because '1's can be moved around freely as they can swap with '0's and '2's. So a '1' can be placed between a '0' and a '2' as needed.\n\nSo, for example, if the string is '02', you can't swap them. But if the string is '012', you can swap '1' and '2' to get '021', then swap '0' and '2'—no, can't do that. So the '0' remains before the '21' part.\n\nWait, no. Because '0' and '2' can't be swapped. So '012' can become '021' (swapping '1' and '2'), but '0' is still before '2'.\n\nSo the '0's and '2's' relative order is fixed, but '1's can be interleaved.\n\nSo, the overall strategy is:\n\n- The '0's that are before any '2's in the original string can be collected and arranged as early as possible, in any order (but since they are all '0's, their order doesn't matter).\n\n- The '2's that are after any '0's in the original string can be collected and arranged as late as possible, in any order (since they are all '2's, their order doesn't matter).\n\n- The '1's can be arranged in any order, but preferably as early as possible to minimize the lex order.\n\nBut how to interleave the '1's between the '0's and '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nThe minimal lex string is obtained by first taking all the '0's that are before any '2's, then as many '1's as possible, then the '2's that are after any '0's.\n\nWait, but in the example given:\n\nInput: '100210' → Output: '001120'\n\nOriginal string: '1','0','0','2','1','0'\n\nThe '0's before any '2' are the first two '0's at positions 1 and 2. The '2' is at position 3.\n\nThen, the '1's are at positions 0 and 4. In the output, the '1's are placed after the '0's, then the '2' comes next, followed by the remaining '0's.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Collect all '0's that are before any '2's.\n\n   So, in the input, the '0's at positions 1,2,5 (wait, no, position 5 is after the '2' at 3). Wait, maybe my initial analysis was incorrect.\n\nWait, the string is '100210' → '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nSo, the first '2' is at index 3.\n\nAll '0's before index 3 are the first two '0's (positions 1 and 2).\n\nThe '0's after index 3 are the last '0' (position 5).\n\nSo, the '0's before the first '2' are collected first, then the '1's are arranged, then the '2's and the '0's after.\n\nBut in the output, the '2' is placed after the '1's. So the '2' is moved to after the '1's, which are moved to the front.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- The '0's that are before any '2's can be moved to the front.\n\n- The '1's can be moved to come after the '0's but before the '2's.\n\n- The '2's that are after any '0's can be moved to come after the '1's.\n\nSo, the minimal string is constructed as:\n\n- All '0's that are before any '2's, arranged in any order (since they are all '0's).\n\n- All '1's, arranged in any order (preferably as early as possible).\n\n- All '2's that are after any '0's, arranged in any order (preferably as late as possible).\n\nAdditionally, any '0's that are after the first '2' in the original string can't be moved before that '2', so they must come after all the '2's that are before them.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Split the string into two parts: the part before the first '2' (including all '0's and '1's), and the part after the first '2' (including all '0's, '1's, and '2's).\n\n2. From the part before the first '2', collect all the '0's and '1's.\n\n3. Rearrange these '0's and '1's into the lex smallest possible order, which would be all '0's first, followed by all '1's.\n\n4. From the part after the first '2', collect all '0's, '1's, and '2's. Rearrange them into the lex smallest possible order, which would be all '0's, followed by '1's, followed by '2's.\n\nWait, but the '2's in the part after the first '2' can be reordered among themselves, but since they are all '2's, their order doesn't affect lex order.\n\nWait, perhaps the following steps are better:\n\n- The minimal lex string will consist of:\n\n   a. All '0's that appear before any '2's.\n\n   b. All '1's.\n\n   c. All '2's that appear after any '0's.\n\nBut the '0's in part a and the '0's in part c can't be mixed because part a's '0's are before any '2's, and part c's '0's are after some '2's, which would mess up the order.\n\nWait, no. Because part c's '0's are after some '2's, which in the original string implies that those '0's are after the first '2'. So in the final string, they have to come after the '2's.\n\nSo, the final string is built as:\n\n[all '0's before first '2'] + [all '1's] + [all '2's after first '2'].\n\nBut wait, the '2's in part c can be followed by '0's, which are after the first '2's.\n\nNo, because those '0's are after the first '2's, so they must be after the '2's in the final string.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\n- '0's before first '2' → sorted as '0's.\n\n- '1's → sorted as '1's.\n\n- '2's after first '2' → sorted as '2's.\n\nBut wait, what about the '1's in the part after the first '2'? Those '1's can be moved earlier, thus allowing the '0's in part c to be after the '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nThe minimal lex string is the concatenation of:\n\n- The '0's that appear before any '2's.\n\n- The '1's from the entire string.\n\n- The '2's that appear after any '0's.\n\nAnd any '0's that are after the first '2' in the original string are considered in part c and thus must be placed after all the '2's.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because in the original string, the '0's after the first '2' are in part c, and the '2's in part c are after the first '2's. So the '0's in part c are after the first '2's, so they must come after all the '2's in the final string.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the first occurrence of '2' in the string.\n\n2. All '0's before this position are collected into group A.\n\n3. All '2's after this position are collected into group C.\n\n4. All '1's from the entire string are collected into group B.\n\n5. The minimal string is A + B + C.\n\nWait, but what about the '0's in group C? Are they allowed to be placed after group B?\n\nYes, because group C consists of '2's that are after the first '2', and the '0's in group C are after that '2' in the original string. So in the final string, group C must come after group B.\n\nWait, but group C includes '2's and '0's that are after the first '2'. So group C is a mix of '2's and '0's. How should they be ordered?\n\nBecause in the final string, the '0's in group C must come after the '2's that are in group C. Or can they be arranged in any order?\n\nWait, no. Because '0's can't cross '2's. So in group C, the '0's can't come before the '2's if they were originally after the first '2'. So the relative order of '0's and '2's in group C must be preserved as per the original string.\n\nWait, but group C is all the '2's and '0's after the first '2'. So in the original string, any '0's in group C are after the first '2', but their order relative to '2's in group C is preserved.\n\nBut since in the final string, group C is placed after group B, which is '1's, the '0's in group C can't be moved before the '2's in group C.\n\nSo, within group C, the '0's must appear after the '2's that are in group C, but wait, no. Because in group C, the '0's are in the same order as they appeared after the first '2' in the original string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Maybe the correct approach is:\n\n- All '0's that appear before any '2's are moved to the front, in any order.\n\n- All '1's are moved to the earliest possible positions.\n\n- All '2's that appear after any '0's (including those '0's that are after the first '2') are moved to the latest possible positions, but their relative order is preserved.\n\nWait, but how to manage the '0's that are after the first '2' in the original string. They can't be moved before the '2's.\n\nSo perhaps the correct steps are:\n\n1. Separate the string into three parts:\n\n   a. The prefix before the first '2': contains only '0's and '1's.\n\n   b. The suffix after the first '2': contains '0's, '1's, and '2's.\n\n2. For the prefix, collect all '0's, then all '1's.\n\n3. For the suffix, collect all '1's, then '0's, then '2's.\n\nWait, but in the suffix, the '0's and '2's can't be reordered. So their relative order must be preserved.\n\nWait, no. Because in the suffix, '0's can't be moved past '2's, so their order is fixed.\n\nSo, for the suffix, the '0's must appear in the same order as in the original string, but the '1's can be reordered among themselves.\n\nSo, for the suffix, the '0's are processed in the order they appear, followed by '1's, followed by '2's.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe minimal string is formed as:\n\n(prefix_0s) + (prefix_1s) + (suffix_1s) + (suffix_0s) + (suffix_2s)\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix includes '0's that are after the first '2' and '2's that are after the first '2'. So in the suffix, the '0's must appear in the same relative order as they appeared after the first '2' in the original string, and the '2's as well.\n\nThus, the minimal string is:\n\n(prefix_0s) + (all_1s) + (suffix_0s) + (suffix_1s) + (suffix_2s)\n\nWait, no. Because in the suffix, the '0's are after the first '2', so they must come after all '2's in the suffix.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternative approach: construct the minimal string by processing each character and determining whether it can be moved earlier based on the allowed swaps.\n\nBut considering that the constraints are tight (up to 1e5 characters), the solution must be O(n) time.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- The minimal string is composed of:\n\n   a. All '0's that are before any '2's in the original string, arranged in any order.\n\n   b. All '1's, arranged in any order.\n\n   c. All '2's that are after any '0's in the original string, arranged in any order.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, '100210' → '001120':\n\n- The '0's before the first '2' are the first two '0's.\n\n- The '1's are the first '1' and the '1' after the '2'.\n\n- The '2' is the '2' in the original string.\n\n- The '0's after the '2' is just one '0'.\n\nSo in the output, the '0's from a are first, followed by all '1's, then the '2', then the '0' from c.\n\nSo, the output is a concatenation of a, b, c.\n\nBut in the output, the '2' comes before the '0' from c, which is correct because in the original string, the '2' comes before that '0'.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCollect all '0's that appear before any '2's in the original string. Then collect all '1's, then collect all '2's that appear after any '0's in the original string, followed by all '0's that appear after the first '2' in the original string.\n\nWait, but the '0's after the first '2' in the original string must come after all '2's in the original string. So in the final string, they are placed after all '2's that are in the suffix.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal string is formed by:\n\n1. Take all '0's that appear before the first '2' in the original string.\n\n2. Take all '1's from the entire string.\n\n3. Take all '2's that appear after the last '0' in the original string.\n\nWait, that might not work.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct steps are:\n\nThe minimal string is built as follows:\n\n- All '0's that are before any '2's, in any order.\n\n- All '1's, in any order.\n\n- All '2's that are after any '0's, in any order.\n\nBut in the original string, any '0's after the first '2' can't be moved before any '2's, so they must be in the suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to collect the '0's before the first '2', then all '1's, then the '2's after the first '2' (in any order), followed by the '0's after the first '2' (in their original order).\n\nBut that would place the '0's after the first '2' in the end.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the first occurrence of '2' in the string. Let's call this index 'first_two'.\n\n2. All characters before 'first_two' are processed as follows:\n\n   a. Collect all '0's in this part. Let's call this group A.\n\n3. The rest of the string (from 'first_two' onwards) is processed as follows:\n\n   a. Collect all '2's in this part. Let's call this group C.\n\n   b. Collect all '0's in this part. Let's call this group D.\n\n   c. Collect all '1's in this part. Let's call this group B.\n\n4. The minimal string is formed as:\n\n   Group A (all '0's before first '2') + group B (all '1's) + group C (all '2's after first '2') + group D (all '0's after first '2').\n\nWait, but in the suffix, the '0's (group D) must come after all '2's in group C, because in the original string, group D's '0's are after group C's '2's. So their order is preserved.\n\nBut in the minimal string, group D comes after group C.\n\nSo, the minimal string is A + B + C + D.\n\nIs this correct?\n\nLet's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input: '100210' → Output '001120'\n\nProcessing:\n\n- first_two is at index 3.\n\nGroup A: the '0's before index 3 are indices 1 and 2: '0', '0'.\n\nGroup B: all '1's in the entire string: '1' (index 0), '1' (index4).\n\nGroup C: '2's after index3: only '2' at index3.\n\nGroup D: '0's after index3: '0' at index5.\n\nSo the minimal string is '00' + '11' + '2' + '0' → '001120' → matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input: '20' → output '20'.\n\nGroup A: no '0's before first '2' (the first character is '2').\n\nGroup B: no '1's.\n\nGroup C: '2' (only character).\n\nGroup D: no '0's after first '2'.\n\nSo minimal string is empty + empty + '2' + empty → '2', but wait, the input is '20'.\n\nWait, wait, the first '2' is at index0. So group A is nothing. The rest is from index0 onwards. So group C is the '2' at index0. Group D is the '0' at index1.\n\nSo the minimal string is group A (empty) + group B (empty) + group C ('2') + group D ('0') → '20', which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: '11222121' → output '11112222'.\n\nGroup A: before first '2'—the string starts with '1's, so no '0's. So group A is empty.\n\nGroup B: all '1's in the entire string: four '1's.\n\nGroup C: '2's after first '2'—the string has '222' at the middle, but wait, the first '2' is at position 3.\n\nSo group C is all '2's from position3 onwards.\n\nGroup D: '0's after first '2'—none, since the string is '11222121' which is '1','1','2','2','2','1','2','1' → no '0's after the first '2'.\n\nSo the minimal string is group A (empty) + group B ('1111') + group C ('222') + group D (empty) → '11112222', which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: '0121'.\n\nFirst '2' is at index2.\n\nGroup A: '0's before index2 → '0' at index0.\n\nGroup B: all '1's in the entire string: '1' at index3 and '1' at index1.\n\nGroup C: '2's after index2: '2' at index2.\n\nGroup D: '0's after index2: none.\n\nSo minimal string is '0' + '11' + '2' → '0112'.\n\nBut wait, can the '1's be arranged to be in any order? So group B is '1's, so in the minimal string, '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: '021'.\n\nFirst '2' is at index1.\n\nGroup A: '0's before index1 → '0' at index0.\n\nGroup B: '1's in the entire string: '1' at index2.\n\nGroup C: '2's after index1 → '2' at index1.\n\nGroup D: '0's after index1 → none.\n\nSo minimal string is '0' + '1' + '2' → '012'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: '210'.\n\nGroup A: '0's before first '2' (which is index0) → none.\n\nGroup B: '1' at index1.\n\nGroup C: '2's after index0 → '2' at index0.\n\nGroup D: '0' at index2.\n\nSo the minimal string is '' + '1' + '2' + '0' → '120'.\n\nBut wait, can we arrange the '0' to come before the '2'? No, because '0' is after the '2' in the original string, and can't be moved before.\n\nSo the output is '120' which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: '2010' → '2010' becomes '00120'?\n\nWait, let's process:\n\nFirst '2' is at index0.\n\nGroup A: no '0's before index0.\n\nGroup B: '1' at index2.\n\nGroup C: '2's after index0 → '2' at index0.\n\nGroup D: '0's after index0: '0' at index1 and '0' at index3.\n\nSo the minimal string is '' + '1' + '2' + '0' + '0' → '12100'? Wait, no.\n\nWait, no: group C is the '2's after the first '2', which is only the '2' at index0. Group D is the '0's after the first '2'—indices 1 and 3.\n\nSo the minimal string is group A (empty) + group B (all '1's, which is '1') + group C (all '2's after first '2', which is the '2' at index0) → so group C is '2' → but wait, group C is all '2's after the first '2', which is the first '2' itself.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding group C and D.\n\nWait, group C is all '2's in the suffix (after first '2'). So in '2010', the suffix starts at index0. So group C is '2's in the entire string, which are all '2's except the '0's and '1's.\n\nWait, no. The group C is all '2's in the suffix (after the first '2'). So the first '2' is included in group C.\n\nSo in '2010', the first '2' is at index0, which is in group C.\n\nThe group C will be all '2's from index0 onwards.\n\nSo group C is '2' at index0, and any '2's after that.\n\nIn '2010', after index0, there are no more '2's. So group C is ['2'].\n\nGroup D is all '0's in the suffix (after the first '2'), which are indices 1 and 3.\n\nSo the minimal string is group A (empty) + group B (all '1's → '1') + group C (all '2's after first '2' → '2') + group D (all '0's after first '2' → '00').\n\nSo the minimal string is '1' + '2' + '00' → '1200'.\n\nBut the original string is '2010', and the output should be '1200'.\n\nWait, but can the '0's in group D be arranged in any order? No, because their relative order is preserved.\n\nSo the output would be '1200'.\n\nBut wait, in the original string, '2010' is the input, which is '2','0','1','0'.\n\nAfter processing, the '0's before the first '2' are none.\n\nThe '1's are at index",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing allowed adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', or '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that:\n1. '0's cannot move past '2's because they cannot be directly swapped.\n2. '1's can be freely reordered among themselves and can act as intermediaries to allow '0's to move past them.\n\nGiven this, the strategy is:\n1. Collect all '0's that appear before any '2' in the original string.\n2. Collect all '1's from the entire string.\n3. Collect all '2's that appear after any '0' in the original string.\n4. Construct the minimal string by concatenating these groups in the order: collected '0's, followed by all '1's, followed by the collected '2's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nfirst_two = s.find('2')\nprefix = s[:first_two]\nsuffix = s[first_two:]\n\n# Group A: '0's in prefix\ngroup_a = [c for c in prefix if c == '0']\n\n# Group B: all '1's in the entire string\ngroup_b = [c for c in s if c == '1']\n\n# Group C: '2's in suffix\ngroup_c = [c for c in suffix if c == '2']\n\n# Group D: '0's in suffix (after the first '2')\ngroup_d = [c for c in suffix if c == '0']\n\n# Construct the result\nresult = group_a + group_b + group_c + group_d\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify Groups**: The string is divided into four groups based on the positions of '2's.\n   - `group_a`: Collects all '0's before the first occurrence of '2'.\n   - `group_b`: Collects all '1's from the entire string.\n   - `group_c`: Collects all '2's after the first occurrence of '2'.\n   - `group_d`: Collects all '0's after the first occurrence of '2'.\n\n2. **Construct Result**: The result string is formed by concatenating `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`, and `group_d` in that order. This ensures the smallest lexicographical order by placing '0's as early as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's with their respective '0's.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs the minimal string in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 characters.",
