Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options, any will do. The output should be the three vertices v1, v2, v3.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to understand how to compute the possible angles that can be formed by selecting three vertices in a regular polygon.\n\nWait, in a regular polygon, all sides and angles are equal. So each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So for any three points, the angles depend on their positions.\n\nLet me think: For a regular n-gon, the central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So the possible angles that can be formed when selecting three points probably relate to these steps.\n\nFor example, in a triangle (n=3), each angle is 60 degrees, so any triplet gives exactly that.\n\nIn a square (n=4), the possible angles could be 45 or 90 degrees. Because if you pick adjacent points, the angle might be 45, but if you skip a point, it's 90.\n\nWait, how is the angle determined? Oh right, the problem says v2 is the vertex of the angle, with v1 and v3 lying on its sides. So v1 and v3 are on the two sides emanating from v2. So, the angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v1-v2 and v3-v2.\n\nSo the angle between these two chords is what we're trying to measure.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3 around v2.\n\nWait, perhaps for a regular polygon, the possible angles are determined by the steps taken from v2 to reach v1 and v3.\n\nLike, for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 will be a function of the number of steps (k) between v1 and v3 along the perimeter, considering both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think differently.\n\nIn a regular polygon, each internal angle is known. But the angle formed by three points isn't necessarily the internal angle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the polygon is regular, all vertices lie on a circle. So the angle at v2 can be computed using some properties of circles and inscribed angles.\n\nWait, I remember that in a circle, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference. So, perhaps the angle at v2 is related to the arcs between the points.\n\nYes! So, the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but perhaps depending on the direction.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. If we have three points A, B, C on a circle, then the angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't contain B. Or is it the other way around?\n\nI think it's the angle at B is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that's opposite to B. So, the angle ABC = (arc AC)/2, where arc AC is the minor arc between A and C.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle at B is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that's intercepted by the angle. So, yes, if arc AC is x degrees, then angle ABC is x/2.\n\nSo in our case, the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3. So to find the angle, we need to find the arc length between v1 and v3, then divide by two.\n\nBut wait, in our problem, v1 and v3 are on the sides of v2. So they must be adjacent to v2. Or perhaps not. Wait, no. Because the problem says that v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the angle at v2. So, the sides are the two edges starting at v2 and going to its adjacent vertices. So, v1 and v3 must be those adjacent vertices. Or wait, no— the sides are the two edges connected to v2, so the sides are the edges between v2 and its previous and next vertices in the polygon.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement. The problem says, \"v1 and v3 lie on its sides.\" So, the sides of the angle are the two lines from v2 to the next and previous vertices, respectively. So, the sides are the two edges connected to v2.\n\nSo, for example, in a square, v2 is vertex 2. Its adjacent vertices are 1 and 3. So v1 and v3 must be either 1 or 3. So the possible",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the possible angles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon and Angles**: In a regular polygon, all vertices are equally spaced on a circle. The angle at any vertex formed by two other vertices can be computed using the inscribed angle theorem, which relates the angle to the arc length between the two points on the circle.\n\n2. **Possible Angles in Regular Polygons**: For a regular n-gon, the possible angles at a vertex v2 can be determined by considering the number of steps (k) from v2 to reach v1 and v3. The angle at v2 will be half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3.\n\n3. **Finding Closest Angle**: We need to compute the closest angle to 'a' by checking all possible pairs of vertices (v1, v3) relative to v2. This involves checking both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions around the polygon.\n\n4. **Optimal Solution Selection**: Among all possible configurations, we select the one that minimizes the absolute difference between the computed angle and 'a'. If multiple solutions exist, any valid configuration is acceptable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef compute_angle(n, k):\n    # The central angle for step k is 360/n * k, but when k exceeds n//2, it wraps around.\n    # The angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3.\n    # Since the polygon is regular, the minimal arc is min(k, n - k)\n    minimal_arc = min(k, n - k)\n    return minimal_arc * 180 / n\n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v2 = 0\nbest_k = 0\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    for k in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n        angle = compute_angle(n, k)\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < best_diff or (diff == best_diff and angle > best_angle):\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_v2 = v2\n            best_k = k\n            best_angle = angle\n\n# Now, construct the triplet\nmidpoint = (best_k // 2) % n\nprev_v = best_v2 - best_k\nnext_v = best_v2 + best_k\nif prev_v <= 0:\n    prev_v += n\nif next_v >= n+1:\n    next_v -= n\n\n# Ensure v1 and v3 are distinct and ordered correctly\nv1, v3 = sorted([prev_v, next_v])\n# Now, arrange the triplet such that v2 is in the middle\ntriplet = [v1, best_v2, v3]\nprint(' '.join(map(str, triplet)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of vertices `n` and the target angle `a`.\n\n2. **Compute Angle Function**: This helper function calculates the angle at a vertex v2 when two other vertices are `k` steps away in either direction. The angle is computed as half the measure of the minimal arc between these points.\n\n3. **Finding the Best Configuration**: The main loop iterates over each vertex as v2 and checks all possible distances `k` to find the configuration that minimizes the absolute difference between the computed angle and `a`.\n\n4. **Constructing the Triplet**: After determining the optimal v2, the adjacent vertices v1 and v3 are calculated. The triplet is then formatted and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the closest possible angle to `a` by leveraging the geometric properties of regular polygons and iterating through feasible configurations.",
