Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So it's a perfect matching between R ships and B bases.\n\nBut there's a catch: the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. The paths are straight lines in 2D space, and we need to make sure none of them cross each other.\n\nHmm, how to model this? I think this is similar to checking if a bipartite graph is matchable and whether the edges (representing non-intersecting paths) form a matching.\n\nWait, but how do we determine if two paths intersect? Because for any two pairs of points (ship A to base X and ship B to base Y), their line segments should not cross.\n\nSo, for a given matching, we need to ensure that all the corresponding line segments don't intersect with each other.\n\nThis sounds computationally heavy because for each possible matching, we'd have to check all pairs of line segments. But since R and B can be up to 10 each, the maximum number of possible matchings could be manageable.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. R and B can be up to 10, but the problem states that R and B can be different. For example, R=3 and B=3 would require a perfect matching where each ship is assigned to a base, so 3! = 6 possibilities. For R=5 and B=3, it's impossible because you can't have a perfect matching—so the code needs to first check if R equals B. Oh, right, because you can only have a perfect matching if R equals B. So the first thing I should do is check if R != B. If they are not equal, output No immediately.\n\nWait, but looking back at the input example:\n\nIn the first sample input, R=3 and B=3. Output is Yes. In the second sample, R=2 and B=1. Wait, no, the second sample's input is a bit confusing. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait the second part of the input is two lines, each representing a base. So the first line after R and B is the first base, then the next is the second. So in the second sample, R=2 and B=1? Or wait, no—wait the first line is '3 3\\n...' which is R=3, B=3. Then the bases are given as 3 lines. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait the problem statement says: \"the i+1-th line contains xi and yi for the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the positions of the bases.\"\n\nSo the first line after R and B is for the first spaceship, then the next for the second, etc., up to R lines. Then comes B lines for the bases.\n\nSo in the second sample input, the input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, no, the way the input is presented is a bit unclear. Maybe it's better to parse the input correctly.\n\nBut regardless, the first step is to read R and B. Then read R lines for the ships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nSo the first thing I should do is check if R != B. If they are not equal, output No because it's impossible to have a perfect matching.\n\nSo in the second sample, R=2 and B=3? Or maybe R=3 and B=2? Wait, perhaps I should look at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nThen the bases are three lines:\n2 1\n1 0\n2 2\n\nWait, so R=3, B=3. So the first sample has R=B=3, which is acceptable.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 1\n1 0\n2 2\n3 1\n\nWait, that can't be right because R=2, B=1. So R and B must be equal for a perfect matching to exist. So in this case, R=2 and B=1, so it's impossible. Hence, the output is No.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the first condition is: if R != B, output No.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check if R != B. If so, output No.\n2. Else, find all possible permutations of assigning R ships to B bases (since R and B are the same, it's a permutation of B elements).\n3. For each permutation, check if all the corresponding line segments (ship to base) are non-intersecting.\n4. If any permutation satisfies this, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read R and B.\n- Read R ship coordinates.\n- Read B base coordinates.\n- If R != B, output No.\n- Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (assign each base to a ship).\n- For each permutation, create a list of line segments (each segment connects a ship to its assigned base).\n- For this list of segments, check that no two segments intersect.\n- If any permutation passes this test, return Yes.\n- After checking all permutations, if none work, return No.\n\nNow, the key part is efficiently checking whether a set of line segments are non-intersecting.\n\nHow to implement the line segment intersection check?\n\nI remember that two line segments AB and CD intersect if certain conditions are met based on their endpoints' coordinates.\n\nThe algorithm to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect involves checking whether the points are in certain relative positions.\n\nI think the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the orientation of various points to determine if the segments cross.\n\nOrientation can be determined using the cross product. For points p, q, r, the orientation is 0 if colinear, positive if counterclockwise, negative if clockwise.\n\nThe steps for segment intersection are as follows (from computational geometry):\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if:\n\na) The points are not all colinear, and\n\nb) The orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, or\n\nc) The orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different, or\n\nd) One segment has endpoints on opposite sides of the other segment.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's see.\n\nAnother method is to use the separating axis theorem for line segments. For each pair of line segments, project all four endpoints onto each axis and see if there's any axis where the projections overlap. If for some axis, the projections do not overlap, the segments do not intersect.\n\nBut for line segments, it's a bit more involved. We need to consider all possible directions and compute the bounding boxes.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard method for determining line segment intersection.\n\nI found an implementation of this somewhere, but let me try to write it myself.\n\nFunction to check if two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect:\n\nCompute the cross products to determine if the segments straddle each other.\n\nThe detailed steps:\n\nCompute the orientation of (p1, q1, p2): o1.\n\nCompute the orientation of (p1, q1, q2): o2.\n\nCompute the orientation of (p2, q2, p1): o3.\n\nCompute the orientation of (p2, q2, q1): o4.\n\nIf o1 != o2 and o3 != o4, then the segments intersect.\n\nElse, the segments don't intersect.\n\nWait, but also, if any point lies on the other segment, it's considered as an intersection.\n\nSo the function returns true if the segments intersect, including when they share an endpoint.\n\nBut in our problem, the assignment is a perfect matching, so each ship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base to exactly one ship. So the line segments are between distinct ships and distinct bases. Therefore, the line segments cannot share an endpoint, so we don't have to worry about that case.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that no three points are colinear, so no three points lie on the same line. But that doesn't prevent two line segments from sharing an endpoint, but in our case, since each ship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one ship, the line segments will not share any endpoints. So the segments are between distinct points.\n\nTherefore, when checking for intersection, the segments won't share any endpoints, so the function can safely assume that.\n\nThus, the function can return true if the two segments cross each other in the middle.\n\nSo, the function to check if two segments intersect is needed.\n\nImplementing this function.\n\nLet's think about writing a helper function called segments_intersect(a, b, c, d), which returns True if the line segments ab and cd intersect.\n\nTo compute orientation:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\nThen, the function segments_intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # a and b are endpoints of first segment, c and d of second.\n    # Check if the two segments intersect.\n\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: collinear but one endpoint lies on the other segment.\n    # Since in our problem, no three points are colinear, this can't happen. So no need to handle.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that no three points are colinear. So the special case where two segments are colinear and share an endpoint can't happen here. So we can ignore that part.\n\nTherefore, the function above should suffice.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\nFor each possible permutation of B bases assigned to the R ships (but wait, R and B are equal, so it's a permutation of size B), we create a list of line segments.\n\nFor each permutation, we check all pairs of line segments in the list to see if any pair intersects. If all pairs are non-intersecting, then the permutation is valid, and we can return Yes.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to the next permutation.\n\nOnce all permutations are checked and none satisfy the condition, output No.\n\nNow, considering the computational aspect.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible R and B? 10 each.\n\nSo the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, we have 10 line segments. For each segment, we need to check against all others to see if any pair intersects.\n\nChecking all pairs in 10 segments: C(10,2) = 45 pairs per permutation.\n\nEach pair requires four orientation calculations and some comparisons.\n\nFor each permutation, the time is 45 * O(1) operations.\n\nSo total operations: 3,628,800 * 45 = around 163 million operations. Hmm, that's manageable in Python, right? Especially since each operation is simple.\n\nBut wait, 163 million operations might be a bit tight for Python, which is slower than compiled languages. But considering that the constraints are small (R and B up to 10), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, let's see: 10! is about 3.6 million. For each permutation, 45 pairs, each requiring 4 orientation checks. Each orientation is a few multiplications and subtractions.\n\nSo for each permutation, 180 operations. 3.6M * 180 = 648 million operations. That's a lot for Python.\n\nWait, 648 million is a lot. Python can handle about 10^8 operations in about a second, roughly. So 6e8 would take about 60 seconds, which is over the time limit.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps R and B are up to 10, but maybe the code can be optimized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute all possible matches and represent them in a way that allows us to quickly check if any permutation leads to a non-intersecting arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph and find a maximum matching, but that doesn't directly help with the non-crossing condition.\n\nWait, another idea: the order in which the ships are arranged must form a non-crossing path when connected to their bases.\n\nWait, perhaps we can arrange the ships and bases in a particular order (like sorted by x-coordinate or y-coordinate) and then assign the closest ship to the base, ensuring that the paths don't cross.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph, where edges represent compatible assignments (i.e., the line segments between a ship and a base do not intersect with any other such segments). Then, the problem reduces to finding a perfect matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nBut how to build this graph efficiently.\n\nWait, but building this graph for each possible permutation would be time-consuming.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach is still the way to go, but with some optimizations.\n\nLet me think about how to optimize the permutation checking.\n\nFirst, for each permutation, the number of pairs is 10 choose 2 = 45. But for each pair, we can compute their orientation and check if they cross.\n\nBut perhaps some pruning can be done early.\n\nWait, for each permutation, the first line segment is between ship 0 and base p[0]. Then, for all other line segments, we can check whether they cross with the first, then the second, etc., and if any pair crosses, we can break early and proceed to the next permutation.\n\nSo for each permutation, we can process the line segments in order, and for each new segment, check it against all previous ones. If any pair crosses, the permutation is invalid, and we can skip further checks.\n\nThis way, for many permutations, we can quickly reject them without checking all 45 pairs.\n\nThat's a good optimization.\n\nAnother optimization is to pre-sort the ships and bases in some way to reduce the number of permutations we need to check.\n\nWait, perhaps if the ships and bases are sorted in a certain way, the permutation that works will be among the first few possibilities.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph, where an edge exists between a ship and a base if the line segment connecting them does not cross any other such segment. But this seems difficult to model.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of segments. So even with the early termination, it's 45 checks per permutation.\n\nBut considering that 10! is about 3.6 million, and each permutation takes on average 45/2 = 22.5 steps before a crossing is found, it's 3.6m * 22.5 ≈ 81 million operations. Which might be manageable, but perhaps not in Python.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a smarter way to represent the segments and their intersections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps memoization can help, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother thought: the problem is similar to the problem of polygon triangulation, where the non-crossing condition is required. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the line segments as a graph and model the problem as finding a matching in this graph, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the problem as a bipartite graph where each node on the left is a ship, each node on the right is a base, and an edge exists between a ship and a base if the line segment between them does not cross any other line segment in the current matching.\n\nWait, but that's dynamic, as adding a segment affects future possibilities.\n\nHmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each permutation, the segments can be added one by one, and for each new segment, we check it against all previously added segments.\n\nThis is the same as the early termination approach.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we process the segments in order and stop as soon as any pair crosses.\n\nSo, in code, for a given permutation, we can loop through each segment, compare it with all previous segments, and if any conflict is found, break and try the next permutation.\n\nThis can save a lot of time for many permutations.\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation:\n\nsegments = [ (ship_0, base_p[0]), (ship_1, base_p[1]), ..., (ship_{n-1}, base_p[n-1}) ]\n\nfor i in 0..len(segments)-1:\n    for j in i+1..len(segments)-1:\n        if segments[i] and segments[j] intersect:\n            permutation is invalid, break and try next permutation.\n\nBut with the early termination, perhaps the average number of checks per permutation is much lower.\n\nSo, how much time would this take in Python?\n\nWell, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps precompute all possible pairs of ships and bases, and for each possible pair, determine if the segment is non-crossing with any existing segment.\n\nBut that might not help as much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the segments as a list and for each new segment, quickly check against all others.\n\nAnother optimization: since the problem requires that all segments are non-crossing, perhaps the order in which the segments are processed can affect the likelihood of early termination.\n\nFor example, processing the segments in an order that allows for early detection of crossings.\n\nBut I'm not sure how.\n\nAlternatively, for each permutation, the order of the segments is fixed as per the permutation, so perhaps the order doesn't matter much.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial plan, implementing the permutation generator and checking each pair with the early termination.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nRead R and B from the first line.\n\nThen read R lines for the ships.\n\nThen read B lines for the bases.\n\nCheck if R != B. If so, output No.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the B bases, assigning each to a ship.\n\nWait, but since the ships are fixed (they're R in number, R = B), each permutation represents a unique assignment of each base to a ship.\n\nSo, for example, for R=3, the permutation (2,1,0) would assign base 2 to ship 0, base 1 to ship 1, and base 0 to ship 2.\n\nSo, in code, using itertools.permutations(range(B)), but each permutation is a tuple of B elements, indicating the order in which the bases are assigned to the ships.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the permutation is a list where the i-th element is the index of the base assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nSo for a permutation like (2, 0, 1), ship 0 is assigned to base 2, ship 1 to base 0, ship 2 to base 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(range(B)), we create a list of segments, where each segment is (ship, base). Then, for each segment, we check against all previous segments.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nimport itertools\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\nships = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(R)]\nbases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(B)]\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nfound = False\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n    segments = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        s = ships[i]\n        b = bases[perm[i]]\n        segments.append( (s, b) )\n    # Now check all pairs\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n            a, b = segments[i]\n            c, d = segments[j]\n            if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        found = True\n        break\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nWait, but this code may have a problem. For example, in the second sample input, R=2, B=1. So R != B, so output No. But in the sample input provided, the second sample is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the lines.\n\nWait, the first line is '3 3', so R=3, B=3.\n\nThen 3 ship lines, followed by 3 base lines.\n\nThen the second sample is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the second sample has R=2, B=1? Or R=2 and B=3?\n\nWait, the second sample's input is:\n\nLine 1: 2 1 → R=2, B=1.\n\nThen 2 ship lines: '1 0' and '2 2'.\n\nThen 1 base line: '3 1'.\n\nSo R=2, B=1. So R != B, so output is No.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample output.\n\nSo the code correctly handles that.\n\nAnother test case: the first sample.\n\nR=3, B=3.\n\nShips are at (0,0), (2,0), (3,1).\n\nBases are at (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2).\n\nOne possible permutation is (0,1,2) → base 0 assigned to ship 0, base 1 to ship 1, base 2 to ship 2.\n\nWait, but in the code, the permutation is a tuple of base indices, so in this case, perm is (0, 1, 2), so ship 0 is assigned to base 0, ship 1 to base 1, ship 2 to base 2.\n\nWait, the segments would be:\n\nShip 0 (0,0) → Base 0 (-2,1).\n\nShip 1 (2,0) → Base 1 (0,3).\n\nShip 2 (3,1) → Base 2 (2,2).\n\nNow, check for any pair of segments.\n\nBetween (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3):\n\nCompute their orientation.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nPoint A: (0,0), B: (-2,1), C: (2,0), D: (0,3).\n\nCompute orientation(A, B, C):\n\nval = (1-0)*(2 - (-2)) - (-2 - 0)*(0-1) \n\nWait, let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, orientation(p, q, r) = (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x) - (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y).\n\nSo p=(0,0), q=(-2,1), r=(2,0).\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 1-0=1.\n\n(r.x - q.x) is 2 - (-2)=4.\n\n(q.x - p.x) is -2-0=-2.\n\n(r.y - q.y) is 0-1=-1.\n\nval = 1*4 - (-2)*(-1) = 4 - 2 = 2.\n\nSo o1 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, o2 is orientation(A,B,D): D is (0,3).\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1.\n\n(r.x - q.x) = 0 - (-2) = 2.\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2.\n\n(r.y - q.y) = 3-1=2.\n\nval = 1*2 - (-2)*2 = 2 +4=6>0 → o2=1.\n\nSo o1 == o2 → no intersection.\n\nNext, orientation(C, D, A):\n\nC is (2,0), D is (0,3), A is (0,0).\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 3-0=3.\n\n(r.x - q.x) = 0-2=-2.\n\n(q.x - p.x) = 0-2=-2.\n\n(r.y - q.y) = 0-3=-3.\n\nval = 3*(-2) - (-2)*(-3) = -6 -6 =-12 <0 → o3 = -1.\n\norientation(C, D, B) → B is (-2,1).\n\n(q.y - p.y) =3.\n\n(r.x - q.x) =0 -2 =-2.\n\n(q.x - p.x) =0-2 =-2.\n\n(r.y - q.y) =1-3 =-2.\n\nval =3*(-2) - (-2)*(-2) → -6 -4 =-10<0 → o4=-1.\n\nSo o3 == o4 → no intersection.\n\nSo segments 0 and 1 do not intersect.\n\nNow, check segment 0 and 2: (0,0)-(-2,1) and (3,1)-(2,2).\n\nCompute orientation for (0,0), (-2,1), (3,1):\n\np=(0,0), q=(-2,1), r=(3,1).\n\nval = (1-0)*(3 - (-2)) - (-2-0)*(1-1) → 1*5 - (-2)*0 =5 → o1=1.\n\norientation for (0,0), (-2,1), (2,2):\n\np=(0,0), q=(-2,1), r=(2,2).\n\nval =1*(2 - (-2)) - (-2)*(2-1) →1*4 - (-2)*1 →4+2=6>0 → o2=1.\n\nSo o1 == o2.\n\nCheck orientation for (3,1), (2,2), (0,0):\n\np=(3,1), q=(2,2), r=(0,0).\n\nval = (2-1)*(0 -2) - (2-3)*(0-2) →1*(-2) - (-1)*(-2) →-2 -2= -4 <0 → o3=-1.\n\norientation for (3,1), (2,2), (0,0):\n\nWait, no.

So the permutation is valid, and the answer is Yes.\n\nHence, the code would find this permutation and output Yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the performance?\n\nIn Python, 10! is 3.6 million permutations. For each permutation, up to 45 pairs are checked, but with early termination.\n\nBut perhaps for the worst case, it's 3.6e6 * 45 = 1.6e8 operations.\n\nWhich may be manageable.\n\nBut in Python, loops are relatively slow. So perhaps this code may not pass within the time limits for larger test cases.\n\nBut given the constraints, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, R and B can be up to 10, which means 10! is about 3.6 million, which is manageable.\n\nBut with each permutation requiring 45 checks, and each check involving 4 orientation calculations, perhaps it's tight.\n\nAlternative idea: precompute all possible pairs and for each pair, store whether their line segments cross.\n\nWait, but for each permutation, the segments are a specific subset of all possible pairs.\n\nSo perhaps precomputing for all possible pairs is not useful.\n\nAnother optimization: for a permutation, once any pair of segments is found to cross, we can break early and proceed to the next permutation.\n\nThis would reduce the number of checks per permutation.\n\nFor example, in the best case, for each permutation, the first pair is checked, and if it crosses, the permutation is rejected after one check.\n\nIn the worst case, for each permutation, all 45 pairs are checked.\n\nBut the average number of checks per permutation is much less than 45.\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation, we process the segments in order, and for each new segment, compare it with all previous ones. As soon as a crossing is found, break and proceed.\n\nSo, in code, for a permutation, the segments are added in order, and for each new segment, we check it against all segments already in the list.\n\nIf any crossing is found, mark the permutation as invalid.\n\nThus, for a permutation where the first two segments cross, the code will break after checking the first two segments.\n\nThis can significantly reduce the number of checks.\n\nFor example, for a permutation where the first three segments are non-crossing, but the fourth and fifth cross, the code will check segments 4 against 0,1,2,3, and if any cross, break after the first cross.\n\nSo, the code is structured as:\n\nfor each permutation:\n    create the segments list\n    for i in 0 to len(segments)-1:\n        for j in i+1 to len(segments)-1:\n            check segments[i] and segments[j]\n            if they cross, mark as invalid and break\n        if invalid, break\n    if valid, return Yes.\n\nSo, in code, the inner loop is:\n\nvalid = True\nfor i in range(len(segments)):\n    for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n        if segments_intersect(...):\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        break\n\nSo, for a permutation where the first segment is invalid with the second, the inner loop for j=i+1=1 runs once, finds a cross, breaks, and proceeds to the next permutation.\n\nThus, the average number of checks per permutation is much less than 45.\n\nThis can make the code run in acceptable time.\n\nTesting this idea, perhaps.\n\nAnother optimization: for each permutation, the order of adding segments can be optimized to allow for earlier detection of crossings.\n\nFor example, process segments in the order of increasing x-coordinate or something like that, which may lead to earlier detection of crossings.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: in the permutation, the order of the segments may influence the number of checks. For instance, perhaps processing the segments in the order of their x-coordinates can minimize the chances of early termination. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not worth the effort, and the code can proceed as is.\n\nSo, the code seems correct, but let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All ships and bases are aligned along a single line, but since the problem states that no three points are colinear, this is impossible.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So any two points can lie on a line, but not three.\n\nSo, for example, two ships and two bases can be on the same line, but the third ship and base must not be.\n\nBut in such a case, the segments could potentially cross.\n\nAnother edge case: R=1, B=1. Then, obviously, the single segment is valid.\n\nAnother case: R=2, B=2, but the two ships and two bases are arranged such that the two possible segments cross each other.\n\nSo, for example, ship A at (0,0), ship B at (2,2).\n\nBase X at (1,0), Base Y at (0,1).\n\nPermutation 0: assign X to A, Y to B.\n\nSegments: A-X (0,0)-(1,0), B-Y (2,2)-(0,1).\n\nDo these segments cross?\n\nCompute orientation for (0,0), (1,0), (2,2).\n\nWait, orientation is (y2 - y1)(x3 - x2) - (x2 -x1)(y3 - y1).\n\nWait, A is (0,0), X is (1,0), B is (2,2).\n\nCompute orientation(A, X, B):\n\n(y_x - y_a) * (x_b - x_x) - (x_x - x_a) * (y_b - y_x).\n\n(y_x is 0, y_a is 0, so 0 * (2-1) = 0.\n\nx_x is 1, x_a is 0 → 1-0=1.\n\ny_b is 2, y_x is 0 → 2-0=2.\n\nSo 0*1 - 1*2 = -2 → o1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, orientation(A, X, Y):\n\nY is (0,1).\n\nCompute orientation(A,X,Y):\n\n(y_x - y_a) = 0.\n\nx_y is 0, x_x is 1.\n\ny_y is 1.\n\nval = 0*(0-1) - (1-0)*(1-0) = 0 - 1*1 = -1 → o2 = -1.\n\nSo o1 == o2.\n\nNow, orientation(X, Y, A):\n\nX is (1,0), Y is (0,1), A is (0,0).\n\nCompute orientation(X, Y, A):\n\n(y_Y - y_X) = 1-0=1.\n\n(x_A - x_Y) = 0-0=0.\n\n(x_Y - x_X) = 0-1 =-1.\n\n(y_A - y_Y) =0-1 =-1.\n\nval = 1*(0) - (-1)*(-1) → 0 -1 =-1 → o3 =-1.\n\norientation(X,Y,B):\n\nB is (2,2).\n\nval = (1-0)*(2-0) - (0-1)*(2-1) →1*2 - (-1)*1= 2+1=3>0 → o4=1.\n\nSo o3 != o4 → segments cross.\n\nThus, this permutation is invalid.\n\nThe other permutation is Y assigned to A, X assigned to B.\n\nSegments: A-Y (0,0)-(0,1), B-X (2,2)-(1,0).\n\nDo these cross?\n\nCheck orientation(A, Y, B):\n\nA is (0,0), Y is (0,1), B is (2,2).\n\nval = (1-0)(2-0) - (0-0)(2-1) →1*2 - 0*1=2>0 → o1=1.\n\norientation(A,Y,X):\n\nX is (1,0).\n\nval =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Perfect Matching**: The first step is to check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, it's impossible to have a perfect matching, so we immediately return \"No\".\n\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of assigning B bases to R spaceships, we generate all possible ways to assign each base to a spaceship.\n\n3. **Check Segment Intersection**: For each permutation, we create a list of line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base. We then check if any two line segments intersect using the orientation method from computational geometry. The orientation helps determine if three points are collinear or the direction of the turn formed by three points.\n\n4. **Early Termination**: For each permutation, we check each pair of line segments. If any pair intersects, we terminate early and proceed to the next permutation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    R = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    B = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n\n    def orientation(p, q, r):\n        val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n        if val == 0:\n            return 0\n        return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n        o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n        o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n        o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n        if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        segments = []\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            s = ships[i]\n            b = bases[perm[i]]\n            segments.append((s, b))\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(segments)):\n                if segments_intersect(*segments[i]), segments_intersect(*segments[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n\n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for spaceships and bases.\n- **Orientation Function**: This helper function determines the orientation of three points (colinear, clockwise, or counterclockwise).\n- **Segment Intersection Check**: Using the orientation function, this function checks if two line segments intersect by comparing the orientations of their endpoints.\n- **Permutations and Early Termination**: By generating all permutations of base assignments and checking each pair of segments, we efficiently determine if any valid assignment exists where no segments intersect.
