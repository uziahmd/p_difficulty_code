    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Gluttony. The task is to construct an array b by permuting the elements of array a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S (with size k between 1 and n-1), the sum of elements in positions S of a and b are different. So, for any non-empty proper subset, the sum of elements in a's subset should not equal the sum in b's subset.\n\nHmm, that sounds tricky. I need to find a permutation of a such that all these subset sums are unique. If such a permutation doesn't exist, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand what this condition implies. For any two distinct subsets S and T (both non-empty and proper), the sum of a's elements in S must differ from the sum in T. Wait, no—wait, the condition is that for every non-empty subset S of the indices, the sum of a's elements in S must be different from the sum of b's elements in S.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: for every non-empty subset S (of the indices, size 1<=k<n), the sum of a's elements at those positions should differ from the sum of b's elements at the same positions.\n\nSo, for each subset S, sum_a(S) != sum_b(S). So, for every subset S, the sum in a and the sum in b after permutation must be different.\n\nWait, but how can that be possible? Because for some subsets, their sum might be the same in a and b.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that for every non-empty subset of indices S, the sums on that positions in a and b must be different. So for each subset S, sum_a(S) != sum_b(S).\n\nBut wait, the way S is defined is as a set of indices. So for a given permutation b, when you look at any subset S of the indices (excluding empty and full), the sum of the elements in a at those positions must not equal the sum of the elements in b at those positions.\n\nSo, for example, if S is {1}, then a[0] != b[0]. Similarly, for S={2}, a[1] != b[1]. For S={1,2}, a[0]+a[1] must not equal b[0]+b[1], and so on for all other subsets.\n\nThis seems very restrictive. Especially because for all subsets, including single-element subsets, we need that the element in a is different from the corresponding element in b.\n\nWait, but wait—since b is a permutation of a, each element of a appears exactly once in b. So, for any single-element subset S={i}, a[i] must not equal b[i]. Otherwise, for S={i}, sum_a(S) = sum_b(S) would be true, which violates the condition.\n\nOh! So the first thing is that in the permutation b, no element can stay in its original position. Because if b[i] = a[i], then the subset {i} would have the same sum in a and b, which is forbidden.\n\nSo, that gives us a necessary condition: the permutation b must be a derangement of a. A derangement is a permutation where no element appears in its original position.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if there exists a derangement of a. But wait, that's not sufficient because even if all individual elements are different, the subset sums for larger subsets may still collide.\n\nFor example, suppose n=3. Suppose a is [1,2,3], and b is [2,3,1]. Then, for subset {1,2}, a has 1+2=3, and b has 2+3=5. That's fine. But what about another arrangement?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nGiven that for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_a(S) != sum_b(S). \n\nSince b is a permutation of a, sum_a(S) is the sum of the elements in a for subset S. sum_b(S) is the sum of the elements in b for the same subset S.\n\nBut since b is a permutation, the sum_b(S) is just a rearrangement of the same elements. So for each subset S, the sum in a and the sum in b for S must be different.\n\nWait, but the sum of a subset S is determined by which elements are in S. Since b is a permutation, the sum for subset S in b could be the same as in a. So, how can we arrange the permutation such that for all non-empty proper subsets S, the sum in a and the sum in b differ.\n\nThis seems very difficult. Maybe it's only possible if all",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an array `b` by permuting the elements of array `a` such that for every non-empty subset of indices, the sum of elements in `a` and `b` are different. If such a permutation doesn't exist, we should return `-1`.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that for any single-element subset, the element in `a` must not be the same as the corresponding element in `b`. This means that `b` must be a derangement of `a`, where no element appears in its original position. \n\nGiven that `n` can be up to 22, we need an efficient way to check all possible permutations. We can use a backtracking approach to generate permutations and check the condition for each permutation. However, generating all permutations directly is computationally expensive (factorial complexity), so we need to optimize.\n\nWe can use a recursive backtracking approach with pruning to efficiently explore possible permutations:\n1. Start with an empty permutation.\n2. For each position, try placing an element that hasn't been used yet.\n3. Check if the current permutation satisfies the subset sum condition for all non-empty proper subsets. If it does, return the permutation.\n4. If no valid permutation is found after all possibilities are exhausted, return `-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    n, *rest = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    a = rest[:n]\n    \n    # First, check if a has duplicates. But the problem says a has distinct integers.\n    # So, proceed.\n    \n    # We need to find a permutation b where for every non-empty subset S (proper), sum_a(S) != sum_b(S)\n    \n    # Since for single-element subsets, a[i] != b[i], b must be a derangement.\n    # So, first, check if there exists a derangement.\n    \n    # Let's try to find a derangement and then check the other conditions.\n    \n    # Try all possible derangements (permutations where no element is in original position).\n    # Since n is small (<=22), but even for n=22, the number of derangements is manageable? Probably not, because 22! is way too big.\n    # So, we need a smarter approach.\n    \n    # Wait, but even if we have a derangement, the other subset sums may collide.\n    \n    # So perhaps we can model this as a graph problem, but I'm not sure.\n    \n    # Alternative idea: The problem requires that all subset sums (non-empty, proper) in a and b are different.\n    # So, for any S, sum(b[S]) != sum(a[S]).\n    \n    # Since b is a permutation, sum(b[S]) is a sum of some elements from a.\n    # So, for the condition to hold, the sum of any non-empty proper subset in a must not equal the sum of any permutation of that subset in b.\n    \n    # Hmm, perhaps the only way this can happen is if the multiset of subset sums in a is disjoint from that in b.\n    \n    # But considering all subsets, this seems very difficult.\n    \n    # Let's think about the necessary conditions:\n    \n    # 1. For single-element subsets: b[i] != a[i] for all i.\n    # 2. For two-element subsets: sum of any two elements in a must not equal the sum of their permutation in b.\n    # 3. Similarly for larger subsets.\n    \n    # It's getting complicated, but perhaps we can model this using a recursive approach where we build the permutation step by step and check the conditions.\n    \n    # However, for n=22, this approach is not feasible due to time constraints.\n    \n    # Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let's consider that the sum of all elements in a is S. Then, for any subset S of size k, sum_a(S) must differ from sum_b(S). But since b is a permutation, sum_b(S) is just the sum of some k elements from a.\n    \n    # Alternatively, since b is a permutation, the sum of any subset in b is the same as the sum of some other subset in a. So, the problem reduces to ensuring that no subset in a (excluding empty and full set) has the same sum as any of its permutations in b.\n    \n    # This seems like a problem related to subset sums being unique across all subsets, which is similar to the concept of a \"subset-sum-distinct\" set. However, here, it's more complex because we're dealing with permutations and ensuring that the sums don't match between a and its permutation.\n    \n    # Given the problem constraints, perhaps the only solution is to find a permutation where all single-element subsets have different elements, and then ensure that for all pairs, triplets, etc., their sums are also different.\n    \n    # One approach is to use a backtracking algorithm that tries to build the permutation step by step, checking at each step whether the partial permutation so far satisfies the subset sum condition for all subsets considered so far.\n    \n    # However, for n=22, this approach is not feasible due to the exponential time complexity.\n    \n    # Another idea: Since the problem is similar to constructing a Latin square, perhaps we can find a way to order the elements such that all required sums are unique. But I'm not sure.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the only way for the condition to hold is if the array is such that no two elements are equal and no two pairs of elements sum to the same value, etc. But again, for n=22, this seems impractical.\n    \n    # Maybe the problem is only solvable for certain cases, like when n is small, and for larger n, it's impossible. But looking at the sample input, for n=4, it's possible.\n    \n    # Wait, perhaps the problem is always solvable except for cases where there are duplicate elements or some other condition. But the problem states that the array has distinct integers, so that's not the case.\n    \n    # Another thought: For the condition to hold, the array must be such that all elements are unique and no two subsets have the same sum. But ensuring this is not trivial.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement a backtracking solution with pruning for small n. Since n is up to 22, but for practical purposes, the code might not run in reasonable time for larger n. However, given the problem's constraints, it's the only feasible approach.\n    \n    # Let's try implementing this.\n    \n    # So, the plan is:\n    # 1. Generate all possible derangements of a (permutations where no element is in its original position).\n    # 2. For each derangement, check if it satisfies the condition for all non-empty proper subsets.\n    # 3. Return the first valid permutation found.\n    # 4. If no permutation is found after checking all possibilities, return -1.\n    \n    # However, generating all derangements is computationally expensive, as the number of derangements for n=22 is around 21 million, but for n=15, it's about 1.5 million. So, it's manageable for small n but not for n=22.\n    \n    # Therefore, we need a smarter approach. Perhaps we can model this as a graph problem where each node represents a state, and edges represent valid swaps. But I'm not sure.\n    \n    # Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to construct the permutation incrementally, ensuring that adding a new element doesn't violate the subset sum condition.\n    \n    # Let's think about how adding a new element affects the subset sums. Suppose we have already placed the first k elements correctly. When we place the (k+1)-th element, we need to ensure that all subsets that include this new element do not have a sum that matches any existing subset sum.\n    \n    # This seems difficult, but perhaps we can represent the current state as a set of used elements and a dictionary mapping subset sums to their occurrences. For each candidate element, we can check if adding it introduces any conflicting subset sums.\n    \n    # However, this approach still involves checking all subsets, which is computationally expensive.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps the only feasible way is to implement the backtracking approach for small n, but for larger n, it's not possible. But the problem allows n up to 22, which makes this approach infeasible.\n    \n    # Wait, but perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that a solution exists only when the array is a sequence of consecutive numbers starting from 1, but I'm not sure.\n    \n    # Given the time, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a specific pattern or structure in the array that allows the permutation to satisfy the condition. For example, arranging the array in a specific order where each element is significantly larger than the sum of all previous elements, ensuring that no subset sums can collide.\n    \n    # Let's see: If we arrange the array in increasing order, but in a way that each element is greater than the sum of all previous elements, then any subset sum will be unique. But this might not always be possible.\n    \n    # For example, if the array is [1, 2, 4, 8], each element is greater than the sum of all previous ones. In this case, any subset sum is unique. So, any permutation would satisfy the condition because the subset sums would be unique in both a and b.\n    \n    # But if the array is not in such a configuration, it might not be possible. So, perhaps the solution is to sort the array and then create a permutation where each element is placed in a position such that it's larger than the sum of all previous elements. But this depends on the specific arrangement.\n    \n    # Let's test this idea. Suppose we sort the array in increasing order. Then, place each element in a new position such that it's larger than the sum of all previously placed elements. This way, any subset sum will be unique, and thus the condition is satisfied.\n    \n    # For example, the sample input is [1000, 100, 10, 1]. Sorting gives [1, 10, 100, 1000]. Placing them in a way that each element is larger than the sum of all previous ones:\n    # - Place 1 in position 0.\n    # - Next, place 10, which is larger than 1.\n    # - Next, place 100, which is larger than 1 + 10 = 11.\n    # - Next, place 1000, which is larger than 1 + 10 + 100 = 111.\n    # So, the permutation could be [1000, 1, 100, 10], but wait, that doesn't satisfy the condition for single-element subsets. Because 1000 is in position 0, which was originally 1. So, b[0] = 1000, a[0] = 1, which is fine.\n    # Then, for two-element subsets, 1+10 = 11, but in the permutation, 1000 and 1 are adjacent. Their sum is 1001, which is different from 11.\n    # Similarly, all other subsets will have unique sums.\n    \n    # So, perhaps the solution is to sort the array and then arrange the elements in such a way that each new element is larger than the sum of all previous elements. This ensures that all subset sums are unique.\n    \n    # So, the steps are:\n    1. Sort the array in increasing order.\n    2. Create a permutation where each element is placed in a new position, ensuring that it's larger than the sum of all previously placed elements.\n    3. This way, any subset sum in a will be unique, and in b, since it's a permutation, the subset sums will be the same as in a, but arranged differently. Wait, no—this might not necessarily ensure that the subset sums are different in a and b.\n    \n    # Wait, in this approach, the sum of any subset in a will be different from the sum of the same subset in b because the elements are arranged in a way that their sums are unique. So, for any subset S, sum_a(S) is the sum of some elements, and sum_b(S) is the sum of a different combination, which due to the arrangement, must be different.\n    \n    # Therefore, this approach could work. Let's try to implement it.\n    \n    # So, the algorithm is:\n    - Sort the array in increasing order.\n    - Create a list `b` to store the permutation.\n    - Keep track of the sum of elements placed so far.\n    - For each element in the sorted array, try to place it in a position where it is larger than the sum of all elements placed before it.\n    - If we can place all elements in this way, the permutation will satisfy the condition.\n    \n    # Let's test this with the sample input:\n    # Sample Input: 4 elements [1000, 100, 10, 1]\n    # Sorted: [1, 10, 100, 1000]\n    # Let's try placing each element:\n    # Place 1: sum_so_far = 1\n    # Next, place 10: 10 > 1 → yes. sum_so_far += 10 → 11\n    # Next, place 100: 100 > 11 → yes. sum_so_far += 100 → 111\n    # Next, place 1000: 1000 > 111 → yes. sum_so_far += 1000 → 1111\n    # So, the permutation is [1, 10, 100, 1000]. But in the sample output, the permutation is [100, 1, 1000, 10]. So, perhaps the order of placement needs to be adjusted.\n    \n    # Wait, in the sample output, the permutation starts with 100, which is larger than 1. Then 1 is placed next, which is less than 100. So, the approach I described earlier wouldn't work because placing 100 first would require that the next element is larger than 100, which 1 isn't. So, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n    \n    # Hmm, this suggests that the approach needs to be adjusted. Maybe the permutation needs to be built in such a way that each new element is larger than the sum of all previously placed elements. But in the sample, the second element is 1, which is smaller than 100.\n    \n    # So, perhaps the initial approach is flawed. Maybe I need to think differently.\n    \n    # Let's consider that the problem is equivalent to ensuring that all subset sums in a are unique. Because if all subset sums are unique, then any permutation would have unique subset sums as well, but since it's a permutation, the sums would just be the same as in a but in a different order. Wait, no—that's not correct because the sum of a subset S in a is the same as the sum of the same subset in b, just in a different order. So, the condition would not be satisfied.\n    \n    # So, this line of thinking is incorrect.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints and the difficulty of the problem, perhaps the correct approach is to use the backtracking method with pruning for small n, but for larger n, it's not feasible. However, given that n can be up to 22, even with pruning, it's not computationally feasible.\n    \n    # Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with a greedy approach where we arrange the elements in a specific order, such as in increasing order, and then check if the permutation satisfies the condition. If not, try another order.\n    \n    # Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only solvable for certain arrays, and we can determine that quickly. For example, if the array is such that no two elements are equal and no three elements form an arithmetic progression, then it might be possible. But I'm not sure.\n    \n    # Given the time, I think the best approach is to implement a function that generates permutations and checks the condition. For n up to 22, this is not feasible, but perhaps for the problem's constraints, it's manageable.\n    \n    # So, let's outline the steps for the code:\n    1. Read the input.\n    2. Generate all possible derangements of `a`.\n    3. For each derangement, check if it satisfies the subset sum condition.\n    4. If a valid permutation is found, print it.\n    5. If no permutation is found after checking all possibilities, print `-1`.\n    \n    # Now, implementing this requires generating derangements and checking the subset sum condition for each derangement. Given that n is up to 22, this approach is not computationally feasible for larger n, but for the problem's constraints, perhaps it's acceptable.\n    \n    # So, the code will use itertools.permutations to generate all possible derangements, then for each permutation, check the subset sum condition.\n    \n    # However, generating all derangements is O(n!) which is too slow for n=22. So, this approach is not feasible. Thus, we need a smarter way.\n    \n    # Given the time, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by noting that the permutation must be such that each element is placed in a position where it is larger than the sum of all previously placed elements. This way, any subset sum will be unique.\n    \n    # So, the approach is:\n    - Sort the array in increasing order.\n    - Initialize an empty permutation list `b`.\n    - Keep track of the sum of elements placed so far.\n    - For each element in the sorted array, attempt to place it in the next available position if it is larger than the current sum. Update the sum accordingly.\n    - If all elements can be placed in this way, the permutation is valid.\n    \n    # Let's test this approach with the sample input:\n    # Sample Input: [1000, 100, 10, 1]\n    # Sorted: [1, 10, 100, 1000]\n    # sum = 0\n    # Place 1: sum becomes 1\n    # Next, place 10: 10 > 1 → yes. sum += 10 → 11\n    # Next, place 100: 100 > 11 → yes. sum += 100 → 111\n    # Next, place 1000: 1000 > 111 → yes. sum += 1000 → 1111\n    # So, the permutation is [1, 10, 100, 1000]. But the sample output is different.\n    \n    # Wait, in the sample output, the permutation is [100, 1, 1000, 10]. So, our approach didn't produce that permutation. But according to our approach, it should be valid because each element is larger than the sum of all previous elements.\n    \n    # Wait, let's check the subset sums:\n    # For the sample output, b = [100, 1, 1000, 10]\n    # Subset {1}: 100 != 1\n    # Subset {2}: 1 != 100\n    # Subset {3}: 1000 != 10\n    # Subset {4}: 10 != 1\n    # For two-element subsets:\n    # {1,2}: 100 + 1 = 101 ≠ 1 + 10 = 11\n    # {1,3}: 100 + 1000 = 1100 ≠ 1 + 10 = 11, etc.\n    # All larger subsets will have sums that are unique because each element is larger than the sum of all previous ones.\n    \n    # So, our approach seems valid. The permutation [1, 10, 100, 1000] would also be valid because each element is larger than the sum of all previous ones. But the sample output is a different permutation. So, perhaps there are multiple valid permutations.\n    \n    # Therefore, the approach is to sort the array and then place each element in the next position if it's larger than the sum of all previously placed elements. This ensures that all subset sums are unique, satisfying the condition.\n    \n    # Now, let's implement this approach in code.\n    \n    # Steps:\n    1. Sort the array in increasing order.\n    2. Initialize `b` as an empty list.\n    3. Initialize `sum_so_far` to 0.\n    4. Iterate through each element in the sorted array:\n        a. Find the next position in `b` where the element can be placed (i.e., it's larger than `sum_so_far`).\n        b. If such a position is found, add the element to `b`, update `sum_so_far` to include this element.\n        c. If no position is found, backtrack or return `-1`.\n    5. If all elements are placed successfully, return `b`.\n    6. If no valid permutation is found, return `-1`.\n    \n    # However, this approach may not always work because there might be cases where no such permutation exists. For example, if the array is [1, 2], the sorted array is [1, 2]. Trying to place 1 first: sum_so_far becomes 1. Then, place 2 in the next position. But in this case, the permutation [2, 1] is a derangement and satisfies the condition. So, the approach works here.\n    \n    # Another example: [1, 3, 5].
