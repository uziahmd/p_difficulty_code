The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a way that a_i + b_j is odd. So, for a key j and chest i, if one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd.\n\nHmm, wait, because adding two evens gives even, two odds give even too. Only even and odd sums are odd. So, the condition a_i + b_j ≡ 1 mod 2 means that one must be even and the other odd.\n\nSo, for each key, it can only unlock chests of the opposite parity. That is, a key with an even number can only unlock chests with odd numbers, and vice versa.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked using the given keys, with each key used at most once per chest.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, I need to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Similarly for the keys.\n\nBecause each key can unlock either even or odd chests, depending on its parity.\n\nWait, no. Wait: For a key j, if b_j is even, then it can only unlock chests with a_i being odd. Because even + odd = odd. Similarly, if b_j is odd, it can unlock even a_i chests.\n\nSo, the total number of usable chests is determined by how many keys of each parity we have and how many chests of the required parity they can unlock.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n1. Separate the a array into even and odd counts. Let's call them even_a and odd_a.\n2. Similarly, separate the b array into even_b and odd_b.\n3. Now, each key in even_b can unlock any odd_a chest.\n4. Each key in odd_b can unlock any even_a chest.\n5. The maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between (even_b * odd_a) and the total possible, but also considering the availability of keys and chests.\n\nWait, no. Because we can't use more keys than available. For example, suppose we have even_b keys. Each can unlock an odd_a chest. But the maximum number of chests we can unlock from odd_a is the minimum of even_b and the number of odd_a chests.\n\nSimilarly, for the odd_b keys, the maximum is the minimum of odd_b and even_a.\n\nSo, the total maximum is the sum of the two minima: min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a).\n\nWait, no, because maybe some keys are better used elsewhere. But wait, no. Because each key can only be used once. So, for example, if I have 10 even_b keys and 3 odd_a chests, I can unlock all 3. Similarly, for odd_b and even_a, the same applies.\n\nSo the total maximum is indeed the sum of these two minima.\n\nWait, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\nn=5, m=4\na:9,14,6,2,11 → Let's count even and odd.\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\nSo even_a = 3 (14,6,2), odd_a=2 (9,11).\n\nb:8,4,7,20 → even_b=3 (8,4,20), odd_b=1 (7).\nSo min(even_b, odd_a)=min(3,2)=2; min(odd_b, even_a)=min(1,3)=1. Total 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: second input.\n\nn=5, m=1\na:2,4,6,8,10 → all even. So even_a=5, odd_a=0.\nb:5 is odd. So min(even_b, odd_a)=0, min(odd_b, even_a)=min(1,5)=1. So total 1. Correct.\n\nThird sample:\nn=1, m=4.\na:10 is even.\nb:20,30,40,50 are even. So even_b=4, odd_b=0.\nSo even_a=1, odd_a=0.\nSo min(even_b, odd_a)=0. min(odd_b, even_a)=0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the approach seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Count the number of even and odd in a and b.\n- Calculate the sum as min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a).\n- Output this sum.\n\nThat's efficient because it's O(n + m), which is acceptable for n and m up to 1e5.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the a list, split into even and odd counts.\n\nSame for b.\n\nCompute the two minima and sum.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list: a = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncount_even_a = 0\ncount_odd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        count_even_a +=1\n    else:\n        count_odd_a +=1\n\nSame for b:\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncount_even_b = 0\ncount_odd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 ==0:\n        count_even_b +=1\n    else:\n        count_odd_b +=1\n\nCompute res = min(count_even_b, count_odd_a) + min(count_odd_b, count_even_a)\nprint(res)\n\nWait, but in the second sample, the output is 1. Let's see:\n\nIn the second sample, a is all even (5), b has 1 key (odd). So even_b is 0, odd_b is 1.\n\nmin(even_b, odd_a) is min(0, 0) =0, min(odd_b, even_a) is min(1,5)=1. So sum is 1. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: what if there are more keys than chests? Like a has 2 even chests, 3 even_b keys, and 2 odd_b keys.\n\nThen min(3,2) for even_b and odd_a, and min(2, even_a). So depends on whether odd_a is zero or not.\n\nWait, no: even_b is the number of even keys. They can unlock odd_a chests.\n\nSo for example, a has 3 even chests, 2 odd chests.\n\nb has 4 even keys and 3 odd keys.\n\nSo even_b=4, odd_b=3.\n\nmin(even_b, odd_a)= min(4,2)=2. min(odd_b, even_a) = min(3,3)=3. So total 5.\n\nBut wait, how? Even_b (4) can unlock 2 odd chests. Odd_b (3) can unlock 3 even chests. So total 5 chests opened. That makes sense.\n\nYes, the code would compute 2+3=5.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should be straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can only unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: First, we count the number of even and odd integers in both the chests and the keys.\n2. **Determine Usable Combinations**: Each even key can unlock an odd chest, and each odd key can unlock an even chest. We calculate the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by considering these combinations.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum values between the counts of even keys and odd chests, and the counts of odd keys and even chests.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_even_a = 0\ncount_odd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        count_even_a += 1\n    else:\n        count_odd_a += 1\n\ncount_even_b = 0\ncount_odd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        count_even_b += 1\n    else:\n        count_odd_b += 1\n\nmax_chests = min(count_even_b, count_odd_a) + min(count_odd_b, count_even_a)\nprint(max_chests)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Counting Evens and Odds**: We iterate through both the chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- **Using Keys Efficiently**: By determining how many keys of each parity can unlock chests of the opposite parity, we ensure we use each key optimally.\n- **Summing Up**: The result is the sum of the two minimum values, ensuring we maximize the number of chests opened without reusing any keys or chests.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that we find the optimal solution in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs up to the given limits.",
