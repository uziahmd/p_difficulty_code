Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible substring, I need to check if it occurs more than once, and find the maximum length among those.\n\nBut wait, how do I approach this efficiently? The string can be up to 100 characters long. So maybe a brute-force approach is manageable here.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible substring lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1. Because as soon as we find a substring of a certain length that appears more than once, we can return that length as the answer.\n\n2. For each length L, starting from (length of string - 1) down to 1:\n   a. Generate all possible substrings of length L.\n   b. Check if any of these substrings appear more than once in the string.\n\n3. If for a certain L, there exists a substring that appears at least twice, then return L as the answer.\n\nSo the plan is to loop L from the maximum possible down to 1. For each L, check all substrings of that length to see if any repeat.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nFirst, the maximum possible L is len(s)-1, because a substring of length len(s) is the whole string, which only appears once. So start with L = len(s)-1, then decrement until L=1.\n\nFor each L, collect all possible substrings of length L. Then, for each substring, count how many times it appears in s. If any count is >=2, then return L.\n\nNow, how to generate all substrings of length L? For a string s, for i in range(len(s)-L+1), take s[i:i+L].\n\nOnce I have all these substrings, I can create a set and see if adding a substring causes a duplicate. Or perhaps, for each substring, check if it appears again somewhere else in the string.\n\nWait, but checking for duplicates might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, for each substring, keep track of where it appears, and see if any other occurrence exists.\n\nBut for L up to 99, and for each L, generating up to 100-L substrings, this should be manageable.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nFor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    substrings = [s[i:i+L] for i in range(len(s) - L +1)]\n    seen = set()\n    for sub in substrings:\n        if sub in seen:\n            return L\n        seen.add(sub)\n    # If no duplicates found for this L, continue to smaller L\nIf after checking all L down to 1, the maximum found is 0, return 0.\n\nWait, but what if the string is like 'aaaaa'? Then the maximum substring is 'aaaa' (length 4). Because 'aaaa' appears multiple times. Wait, no: in 'aaaaa', the substrings of length 4 are 'aaaa' starting at index 0 and 1. So yes, 'aaaa' appears twice, so the maximum is 4.\n\nYes, so the code above should correctly handle that.\n\nWait, let's test the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → Output is 0. Because all substrings are unique.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → Output 3. Substrings of length 3 are 'aba' (positions 0-2, 2-4). So yes.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → Output 2. Substrings of length 2 are 'zz' at positions 0-1 and 1-2. So two occurrences.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where the entire string repeats but is longer than len(s)-1. Like 'abab'. The max L is 2, since 'aba' is length 3, but it appears once. But 'ab' appears twice.\n\nWait, 'abab' has 'ab' as a substring that appears twice, but also 'aba' is unique. So the maximum is 2.\n\nAnother case: 'abcdeabcde' → the substring 'abcde' appears twice. So the maximum L is 5.\n\nAnother case: 'aaa' → substrings of length 2: 'aa' appears at 0-1 and 1-2. So L=2 is the answer.\n\nWhat about when the string is just 'a'? Then output is 0, since no substring of length >=1 appears at least twice.\n\nSo the code needs to handle L from len(s)-1 down to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking all possible substrings of the given string starting from the longest possible length down to 1. For each length, we generate all substrings of that length and check if any of them appear more than once. The first length for which we find such a substring is our answer.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible length (length of the string - 1) and decrement down to 1.\n2. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all substrings of that length.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: Use a set to track substrings and check for duplicates as we generate them.\n4. **Return Result**: If a duplicate substring is found, return the current length as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        sub = s[i:i+L]\n        if sub in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(sub)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stored in variable `s`.\n2. **Loop Over Lengths**: We loop from the length of the string minus one down to 1.\n3. **Generate Substrings**: For each length `L`, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n4. **Track Substrings**: Use a set to keep track of substrings encountered so far.\n5. **Check for Duplicates**: For each substring, check if it has been seen before. If a duplicate is found, print the current length and exit.\n6. **Handle Edge Cases**: If no duplicates are found after checking all lengths, print 0.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the longest repeating substring by checking each possible length in descending order, ensuring we return the correct result as soon as possible.",
