For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for every binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me try to understand what a beautiful multiset is. So, for each binary string s of length 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And we need to find all possible assignments of c_s such that when you compute the maximum possible size of such a multiset, it equals f.\n\nHmm. The goal is to count the number of c assignments that result in the maximum beautiful multiset size being exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, note that each binary string s can be considered as a node in a trie-like structure. Each node represents a certain prefix, and its children are the next bits. For example, \"0\", \"00\", \"01\", etc., form a tree.\n\nIn the context of the problem, for each node s (each binary string), the c_s is the maximum allowed number of times s appears in the multiset as a prefix. Wait, no. Wait, for any string t in the multiset, all prefixes of t (including itself) must satisfy their c constraints.\n\nWait, no. For each string s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the count for s. So for s, the count must be <= c_s.\n\nSo for the multiset to be beautiful, for every possible s, the number of elements in the multiset that start with s must be <= c_s.\n\nBut when considering the maximum possible size of such a multiset given the c_s assignments, the size is determined by the minimal constraints across all possible s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is the sum over all possible s of the number of elements that can be added without violating any c_s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the constraints on each individual s. For example, for each s, the maximum number of times it can appear as a prefix is c_s. So the total number of elements in the multiset is the sum over all s of the number of elements that have s as a prefix but not any longer prefix.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the problem in terms of the trie.\n\nEach node in the trie represents a certain prefix s. The multiset can include any string, which contributes +1 to all its prefixes s. So for each string t in the multiset, it adds 1 to every s that is a prefix of t.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the multiset to be beautiful is that for every node s, the number of times it is a prefix of any string in the multiset is at most c_s.\n\nWait, but each string t in the multiset contributes to all of its prefixes s. So the total count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. This includes all strings that have s as a prefix, regardless of their longer parts.\n\nSo for each s, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. So for the multiset to be beautiful, for each s, this count must be <= c_s.\n\nBut the problem asks for the maximum possible size of such a multiset, given the c_s assignments. We need to find the number of c assignments where this maximum size is exactly f.\n\nHmm, so for a given c assignment, the maximum size is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the number of possible extensions beyond s. Or maybe not exactly. Maybe it's more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the constraints on the c_s's. Because each time you add a string t to the multiset, it contributes to all of its prefixes. So the constraints are interdependent.\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we model the problem as a tree, where each node is a binary string s. For each node s, the maximum number of times it can be used as a prefix is c_s. So the maximum possible contribution of s to the multiset is the number of possible extensions beyond s, multiplied by the c_s, but subject to the constraints of its ancestors.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the sum of c_s's multiplied by the number of possible suffixes for each s. Because each s can be extended into several strings, and each such extension adds 1 to the counts of all of its prefixes.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because adding a string t increases the counts of all its prefixes s. So the constraints are that for every s, the sum over t where s is a prefix of t in the multiset must be <= c_s.\n\nHmm.

Using dynamic programming on this trie, we compute the number of valid configurations of \\( c_s \\) values such that the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). The trie is processed in BFS order to ensure dependencies between nodes are handled correctly. The DP state tracks the number of ways to assign \\( c_s \\) values such that the subtree rooted at each node contributes exactly to the total count of the beautiful multiset. The result is computed by summing the DP states for all nodes contributing exactly \\( f \\) to the total count, modulo \\( 998244353 \\).",
