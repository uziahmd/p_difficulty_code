Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Petya selling souvenirs. He has n souvenirs, each with a weight and a cost. He wants to choose a subset of them such that the total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is as large as possible. My task is to find this maximum possible cost.\n\nHmm. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So we need an efficient solution because brute force won't work here.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since each souvenir has a weight of either 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can group them by their weights and handle each group separately.\n\nYes! Because for each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the souvenirs in descending order of cost. Then, for each possible number of souvenirs taken from each category, we compute the maximum cost without exceeding the total weight limit.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights: group_1, group_2, group_3.\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost. This way, when we take the top k items, they give the maximum possible cost for that group.\n3. Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum cost for different total weights. But since m can be up to 3e5, we need an efficient way.\n\nWait, but for each group, after sorting, we can precompute the prefix sums. For example, for group_1, prefix_sum[i] will be the total cost if we take the first i souvenirs. Similarly for group_2 and group_3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem reduces to finding combinations of i, j, k such that 1*i + 2*j + 3*k <= m, and the sum of their prefix sums is maximized.\n\nBut trying all possible i, j, k is not feasible because n can be up to 1e5, and each group could have up to 1e5 elements.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can model this with a dynamic programming approach where we iterate over each group and update the possible maximum costs.\n\nLet me think about the DP state. Let's say dp[w] represents the maximum cost achievable with a total weight of w.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0, and all others are -infinity or something.\n\nThen, for each group, we process it and update the dp array.\n\nFor group 1:\nEach item has weight 1. So for each possible number of items taken (from 0 to the size of group1), we can add their cost to the dp.\n\nBut processing group1 directly would involve considering adding 0,1,...,k items. But considering the size could be up to 1e5, this might be too slow.\n\nWait, but group1 is sorted, so the prefix sums are non-decreasing. So for group1, the optimal is to take as many as possible without exceeding the remaining weight.\n\nSimilarly for group2 and group3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a knapsack-like approach where for each group, we iterate through the possible counts and update the dp accordingly.\n\nBut even that might be too slow because each group could have up to 1e5 items, and for each item, we'd have to loop through the dp array.\n\nWait, but group1, group2, group3 are independent. So perhaps the approach is to combine the three groups in a way that for each possible count in group1, group2, and group3, the total weight is within m, and the total cost is maximum.\n\nWait, but the total possible combinations could be up to (1e5)^3, which is way too big.\n\nSo that's not feasible. Need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother idea: Since the weights are small (only 1,2,3), perhaps we can model the problem with multiple passes over the groups, using the fact that each group's items are sorted.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Preprocess each group to get the prefix sums.\n- For each possible number of items taken from group1 (i), group2 (j), and group3 (k), we want to maximize the sum of their prefix sums, subject to i*1 + j*2 + k*3 <= m.\n\nBut considering all possible i, j, k is O(n^3), which is impossible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can model this with a dynamic programming approach that iterates over each group and updates the possible states.\n\nLet me think of processing one group at a time, and for each possible weight, track the maximum cost achievable.\n\nLet's try this:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0.\n\nProcess group1 first.\n\nFor each i in 0 to len(group1):\n   For each",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit. The souvenirs are categorized by their weights (1, 2, or 3) and each has a specific cost.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Souvenirs**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, or 3).\n2. **Sort and Compute Prefix Sums**: For each group, sort the souvenirs in descending order of cost and compute prefix sums. This allows us to quickly determine the maximum cost for taking a certain number of items from each group.\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP array where `dp[w]` represents the maximum cost achievable with a total weight of `w`. Initialize `dp[0]` to 0 and all other entries to negative infinity.\n4. **Iterate Over Groups**: Process each group and update the DP array to reflect the maximum cost achievable by including items from the current group without exceeding the weight limit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    m = int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr += 2\n\n    group1 = []\n    group2 = []\n    group3 = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        w = int(input[ptr])\n        c = int(input[ptr+1])\n        ptr += 2\n        if w == 1:\n            group1.append(c)\n        elif w == 2:\n            group2.append(c)\n        else:\n            group3.append(c)\n\n    # Sort each group in descending order and compute prefix sums\n    group1.sort(reverse=True)\n    group2.sort(reverse=True)\n    group3.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    prefix1 = [0]\n    for c in group1:\n        prefix1.append(prefix1[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix2 = [0]\n    for c in group2:\n        prefix2.append(prefix2[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix3 = [0]\n    for c in group3:\n        prefix3.append(prefix3[-1] + c)\n    \n    # Now, we need to find i, j, k such that 1*i + 2*j + 3*k <= m, and maximize prefix1[i] + prefix2[j] + prefix3[k]\n    \n    # We'll use a DP approach where dp[w] is the max cost with weight w\n    dp = [-float('inf')] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n\n    # First, process group1\n    for i in range(1, len(prefix1)):\n        weight = i - 1\n        cost = prefix1[i]\n        for w in range(m, weight-1, -1):\n            if dp[w - weight] != -float('inf'):\n                if dp[w] < dp[w - weight] + cost:\n                    dp[w] = dp[w - weight] + cost\n\n    # Then, process group2\n    for j in range(1, len(prefix2)):\n        weight = j - 1\n        cost = prefix2[j]\n        for w in range(m, weight-1, -1):\n            if dp[w - weight] != -float('inf'):\n                if dp[w] < dp[w - weight] + cost:\n                    dp[w] = dp[w - weight] + cost\n\n    # Finally, process group3\n    for k in range(1, len(prefix3)):\n        weight = k - 1\n        cost = prefix3[k]\n        for w in range(m, weight-1, -1):\n            if dp[w - weight] != -float('inf'):\n                if dp[w] < dp[w - weight] + cost:\n                    dp[w] = dp[w - weight] + cost\n\n    print(dp[m])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Categorization**: Souvenirs are grouped by their weights to handle each category separately.\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Each group is sorted by cost in descending order, and prefix sums are computed to quickly get the maximum cost for taking the top `i` items.\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: The DP array is used to keep track of the maximum cost achievable for each possible weight up to `m`.
