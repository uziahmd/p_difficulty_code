    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem called Golden Plate. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a plate. The plate is a rectangle split into w x h cells. We need to add k rings of gilding. Each ring is along the edge of a certain size, and each subsequent ring is two cells inward from the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is the outermost border. Then, the second ring is two cells in from that, so it's the next inner border, and so on.\n\nHmm, how do I calculate the number of cells in each ring?\n\nWait, the problem says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells of an inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). So, for each ring, we subtract 4 from both width and height for the next ring.\n\nBut wait, each ring is 1 cell wide. So, for example, the first ring is when i=1, the rectangle is w x h. The perimeter of that rectangle is 2*(w + h - 2), because the top and bottom rows are w cells each, but subtract 2 because the corners are counted once each, same for left and right columns.\n\nWait no, let's think again. For a rectangle with w columns and h rows:\n\nThe perimeter is 2*(w) + 2*(h) - 4. Because the four corners are counted twice when we just add w and h each multiplied by 2. So subtracting 4 corrects that.\n\nSo for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2).\n\nBut wait, for each ring, the current_w and current_h are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h -4*(i-1)), respectively.\n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, we compute 2*( (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 ), and sum all these values.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each ring is a border of a rectangle, which is as described.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   - Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   - If current_w <=0 or current_h <=0, then this ring doesn't exist? But according to the input constraints, k is at most floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ), so we don't have to worry about invalid rings.\n\nWait, the problem says k is up to floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ), where n and m are presumably w and h. So for each i from 1 to k, current_w and current_h will be positive integers greater than zero.\n\nSo, for each i, we can safely compute the perimeter.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total_gilded = 0\n\nFor i in 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total_gilded += perimeter\n\nReturn total_gilded as the output.\n\nWait, let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1\n\nCompute for i=1:\n\ncurrent_w=3, current_h=3.\n\nPerimeter: 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example:7 9 1\n\ncurrent_w=7, current_h=9.\n\nPerimeter: 2*(7+9-2)=2*(14)=28. Correct.\n\nThird example:7 9 2.\n\ni=1: perimeter is 28.\n\ni=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5.\n\nPerimeter: 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. Wait, adding 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother test case: what if w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\ni=1: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 2*8=16.\n\ni=2: 5-4=1 → 1x5? Wait, no. Wait, for i=2, current_w=5-4*(2-1)=1, current_h=5-4=1. Wait, but 1x1 is a single cell. So the perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0. So total",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by bordering cells that are progressively inward from the edge.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around a rectangle. The first ring is the outermost border, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each subsequent ring is smaller by 4 cells in both width and height (2 cells on each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle it forms. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is calculated as `2 * (w + h - 2)`, accounting for the four corners being counted once each.\n3. **Iterative Summation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`, representing the width, height, and number of rings, respectively.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, adjust the width and height by subtracting 4 for each previous ring to get the dimensions of the current ring's rectangle.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, compute its perimeter and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging the geometric properties of rectangles and iterating through each ring to accumulate the total count of gilded cells.",
