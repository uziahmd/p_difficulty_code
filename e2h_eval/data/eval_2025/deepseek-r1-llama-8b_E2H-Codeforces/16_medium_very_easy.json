Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) in Crazy Town. The town has n infinite line roads, and these roads divide the plane into blocks. My home and university are each in a block, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from my home's block to the university's block. Each step allows moving between two adjacent blocks that share a border with a non-zero length.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? Well, the key is probably to determine which side of each road each point lies on. Because each road divides the plane into two parts, so each road can act as a kind of boundary between blocks.\n\nWait, right. For each road, if I compute the sign of the expression a*x + b*y + c for a point (x,y), that tells me on which side of the road the point is. If two points are on the same side for all roads, then they are in the same block, right? Or wait, not exactly—because the arrangement of multiple roads can create more complex regions. But perhaps the minimal path is determined by the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nBecause each time a road separates the home and the university, you might have to cross it. And each such crossing would contribute one step. So maybe the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads where the two points lie on different sides.\n\nWait, but that's assuming that each road contributes at most one step. Because sometimes, a single road might separate them, requiring a step across it. But what if multiple roads are crossed in some way that reduces the total steps?\n\nNo, because each step is moving from one block to an adjacent one. So if two blocks are separated by k roads, you need to cross each of those roads once. Because each road can only be crossed once, right? Because after crossing, you're in another block.\n\nSo the minimal number of steps is exactly the number of roads that separate the home and university. That is, for each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the answer.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each such road requires a step. Because to get from one side to the other, you must cross the road. But how? Because in the arrangement of roads, each road might intersect others, creating regions. But the minimal path would cross each separating road once.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each of the n roads, compute the sign of a*x1 + b*y1 + c and a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n2. If the signs are different, increment the count.\n3. The count is the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let's test this with the example.\n\nIn the example, the input is:\n\nHome: 1 1\nUniversity: -1 -1\nn=2\nRoad 1: 0 1 0 → y=0\nRoad 2: 1 0 0 → x=0\n\nFor Road 1: home is (1,1). Plugging into 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 >0. University is (-1,-1): 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1 <0. So they are on opposite sides. So count +=1.\n\nFor Road 2: home is (1,1). 1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0. University is (-1,-1): 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1<0. So opposite again. Count is 2. So output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample given in the problem statement, but I think the logic holds.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read home and university coordinates.\n- Read each road's a, b, c.\n- For each road, calculate s1 = a*x1 +b*y1 +c and s2 = a*x2 +b*y2 +c.\n- If s1 and s2 have different signs (i.e., their product is negative), then increment the count.\n- Finally, output the count.\n\nBut wait, what if the product is zero? Oh, but the problem states that neither home nor university lie on any road. So s1 and s2 can't be zero. So we don't have to worry about that case.\n\nSo the code should:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\nRead n.\nThen for each of n lines:\n   read a, b, c.\n   compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n   if s1*s2 < 0, increment count.\n\nFinally, print count.\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nHandling large numbers? Well, since the constraints allow x and y up to 1e6, and a, b, c up to 1e6, the products could be up to 1e12 * 1e6 which is 1e18, which fits into Python's integers without issue.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line, split into x1 and y1 as integers.\nSecond line: x2, y2.\nThird line: n.\nInitialize count=0.\nLoop n times:\n   Read a, b, c as integers.\n   Compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   s2 = a*x2 + b*x2 + c\n   if s1*s2 < 0: count +=1\nPrint count.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\ns1 for first road: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1\ns2: 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0=-1 → product is -1 → count=1.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 +0*1 +0=1\ns2: 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1 → product -1 → count=2.\n\nOutput 2.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose two roads that cross each other. Home is (0,0), uni is (2,0). Roads are x=0 and y=0. Then for road x=0: home is on x=0 (but wait, problem says home isn't on any road. So adjust: home is (1,0), uni is (2,0). Road1: x=0 → home is left, uni is right. So s1=1, s2=2 → same sign. Road2: y=0. Both on the line. Oops, but problem says home and uni aren't on any road. So let's choose another scenario.\n\nSuppose home is (1,1), uni is (2,1). Roads are x=0 and y=0.\n\nFor x=0: home is on positive side, uni on positive (since x=2>0). So same side.\n\nFor y=0: home is y=1>0, uni y=1>0. Same side. So count is 0 steps. So output 0.\n\nWait, but in reality, how many steps? Since home and uni are in the same block, no steps needed.\n\nAnother test: home is (1,2), uni is (3,4). Roads are x=2, y=2.\n\nCompute for road x=2: home is 1<2 → s1 = 2*1 + (-1)*2 + 0 → 2-2=0? Wait, no. Wait, the road is x=2, equation is 1*x + 0*y + (-2) =0 → x-2=0.\n\nSo s1 = 1*1 +0*2 -2 = 1-2 =-1.\ns2=1*3 -2=1. So product is -1*1= -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad y=2: equation is 0x +1y -2=0 → y=2.\n\ns1=0*1 +1*2 -2=0 → s1=0? No, home is (1,2), which is on the road. But problem says home isn't on any road. So adjust: home is (1,3), uni is (3,5).\n\ns1 for x=2: 1*1 -2 = -1.\ns2:3-2=1 → product negative → count +=1.\n\nFor y=2: s1=3-2=1. s2=5-2=3 → product positive → no count.\n\nSo total count is 1. So minimal steps is 1.\n\nWhich makes sense because you cross x=2 once.\n\nSo the logic works.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving between two adjacent blocks that share a border with a non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each road in Crazy Town divides the plane into two halves. By determining on which side of each road your home and university lie, we can count how many roads separate them. Each such road will require one step to cross, as moving from one block to another across a road is a single step.\n\n1. **Read Input:** Read the coordinates of your home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Evaluate Each Road:** For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at the coordinates of your home and university. If these values have opposite signs, it means the home and university are on different sides of the road, necessitating a step.\n3. **Count Separating Roads:** Sum the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads.\n- **Evaluating Each Road:** For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), compute the value of the equation at the home and university coordinates.\n- **Check Opposite Sides:** If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n- **Count Steps:** Each such road contributes one step to the total count, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of the roads and the points, ensuring an optimal solution.",
