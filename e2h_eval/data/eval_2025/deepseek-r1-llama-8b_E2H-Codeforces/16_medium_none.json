Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) formed by roads in Crazy Town. Each road is an infinite line, and the roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to the university. A step is moving from one block to another if they share a common border segment with non-zero length.\n\nHmm. So each step requires crossing exactly one road. Because if two blocks share a border, that border is a segment of a single road. So, moving between adjacent blocks across a single road counts as one step.\n\nWait, but wait. No, because the roads are lines, which extend infinitely. So two blocks can be adjacent across a single road, meaning that their shared boundary is a segment along that road. So, stepping from one block to another requires crossing that road.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: how many roads separate the home and the university? Because each such road must be crossed once.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct. Because some roads might intersect each other, creating more complex regions. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the minimal steps required correspond to the number of roads that separate the home and university. Or maybe it's the number of roads that the straight line between home and university intersects.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Imagine two roads that cross each other. If the home is on one side of both roads, and the university is on the opposite side of both, then the minimal path would require crossing both roads, right? Because you can't just cross one and then the other in a way that allows moving directly between them without passing through the intersection point.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps the number of roads that the line between home and university crosses corresponds to the number of steps needed.\n\nWait, but each step is moving across one road. So the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that lie between the home and university, i.e., the number of roads that the line segment connecting them crosses, plus any roads that form a 'barrier' that needs to be crossed, but perhaps in a way that the path has to go around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps required are equal to the number of roads that the home and university are on opposite sides of. Because each such road must be crossed exactly once.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each such road, the home and university are on opposite sides, so the path from home to university must cross that road. So the number of such roads is the minimal number of steps.\n\nWait, but what if a road doesn't separate them? Like, if the home and university are on the same side of a road, then you don't need to cross it. So the minimal steps are the count of roads where home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each road (line), determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of such roads.\n3. That count is the minimal number of steps.\n\nYes! Because each such road must be crossed exactly once. So the answer is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nThat's a neat solution. So how do I compute whether two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nGiven a line ax + by + c = 0, for a point (x0, y0), evaluate the value f(x0, y0) = a*x0 + b*y0 + c. If f is positive, negative, or zero. Since neither home nor university is on any road, f will never be zero for either point.\n\nIf f1 * f2 < 0, then the two points are on opposite sides of the line. So for each road, we calculate the product of f(h) and f(u), and count how many times this product is negative.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the home (x1,y1) and university (x2,y2) coordinates.\n- For each of the n roads:\n   - Read a, b, c.\n   - Compute f_h = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n   - Compute f_u = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n   - If f_h and f_u have opposite signs, increment the count.\n- Output the count as the minimal number of steps.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome is (1,1)\nUniversity is (-1,-1)\nn=2\nRoad 1: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. So the line is the x-axis.\n\nFor home, f_h = 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1 >0.\nUniversity f_u = 0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 = -1 <0.\nSo they are on opposite sides. So count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 1x +0y +0 =0 → x=0.\n\nf_h =1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0.\nf_u=1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 =-1<0.\nOpposite sides again. So count is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 2 and 2.\n\nAnother test case: Suppose a single road that doesn't separate them. Then the answer is 0.\n\nWhat about when a road has both points on the same side? Then it doesn't contribute to the count.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, we can read the inputs, process each line, compute the two values, and count.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The coefficients a, b, c can be very large. But since Python handles big integers well, this shouldn't be a problem.\n- Overflow? Not likely, since in Python integers can be arbitrarily large.\n- Division by zero? No, since for each road, a and b are not both zero.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read home and university points.\n2. Read n.\n3. For each of the next n lines:\n   a. Read a, b, c.\n   b. Compute f_h = a * x1 + b * y1 + c.\n   c. Compute f_u = a * x2 + b * y2 + c.\n   d. If f_h * f_u < 0, increment the count.\n4. Output the count as the result for each.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the output is two lines, one for home to university and vice versa? Or wait, looking back at the sample input, the output is two lines: first the steps from home to university, then the steps from university to home. But in reality, it's the same number, since the number of roads separating them is symmetric.\n\nSo the code can compute the count once, then print it twice.\n\nBut according to the sample input, the output is two lines, both being 2.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nCompute the count as described.\n\nPrint the count.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says the output should consist of two lines, each being the minimal steps for home to university and university to home. But since the number of separating roads is the same in both directions, the output is the same for both.\n\nSo in code, after computing the count, print count, then print count again.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows two outputs, both 2. So yes.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of n roads:\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, line.split())\n\n    f_h = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    f_u = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if f_h * f_u < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nLines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nFirst road: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0.\n\nf_h = 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0.\n\nf_u = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1<0.\n\nproduct is negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x+0y+0=0 →x=0.\n\nf_h=1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0.\n\nf_u=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 =-1<0.\n\nproduct is negative → count is 2.\n\nSo output is 2 and 2.\n\nAnother test case: say n=0, but the constraints say n>=1. So no.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then the count is 0.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think this approach is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step involves crossing a single road, and the roads are defined by their equations.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road can be represented as a line on the plane. To move from one block to another adjacent block, you must cross exactly one road. Thus, the minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Each road is an infinite line that divides the plane into two regions.\n   - If a road separates the home and the university, it means they lie on opposite sides of the road.\n   - We need to count how many such roads exist.\n\n2. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road (line), determine if the home and university are on opposite sides.\n   - This can be checked using the line equation. For a point (x, y) on the line ax + by + c = 0, substitute the coordinates of the home and university into the equation. If the results have opposite signs, the points are on opposite sides of the line.\n\n3. **Complexity Consideration**:\n   - The algorithm efficiently processes each road once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read home coordinates\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n# Read university coordinates\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n# Read number of roads\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    # Compute for home\n    f_h = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    # Compute for university\n    f_u = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if f_h * f_u < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads.\n- **Processing Each Road**: For each road, compute the values of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, increment the count.\n- **Output**: Print the count twice, once for the path from home to university and once for the return path, though both counts are the same.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of steps required by counting the separating roads between the two points.",
