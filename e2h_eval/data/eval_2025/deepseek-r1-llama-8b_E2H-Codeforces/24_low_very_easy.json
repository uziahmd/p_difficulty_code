She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has n tabs open in her browser. The tabs are numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right within the currently open tabs, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nMy task is to find the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves: moving the cursor to certain positions and then closing tabs on either side.\n\nLet me think about what needs to be done. Essentially, after all operations, only the tabs l to r will remain open. So, any tabs before l must be closed, and any tabs after r must also be closed.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, let's consider when no tabs need to be closed. For example, if l=1 and r=n, then nothing needs to be done. Or if l=r, same thing. So in that case, the answer is zero.\n\nOtherwise, we have to figure out the steps needed.\n\nI think the strategy involves:\n\n1. Moving the cursor to a position where you can close the left side (if necessary) and/or the right side (if necessary).\n2. Decide whether to close left first or right first, whichever is more efficient.\n3. Calculate the time taken for each possible scenario and pick the minimum.\n\nWait, but perhaps the order isn't important, as the total steps might be the same. Or maybe sometimes one way is better than the other.\n\nSo let's break it down.\n\nFirst, determine whether we need to close tabs on the left of l, on the right of r, both, or neither.\n\nCase 1: Only left needs to be closed.\nCase 2: Only right needs to be closed.\nCase 3: Both left and right need to be closed.\n\nIn each case, we can compute the steps.\n\nLet's model each step:\n\nEach move is either moving the cursor or closing a side.\n\nWhen moving the cursor, the time taken is the distance between current position and the target position. Because each move is one second per step.\n\nWhen closing, it's just one second.\n\nSo for each required closure (left and/or right), we need to calculate the steps required to reach the optimal position for closing, plus the time to close.\n\nAdditionally, the initial position is pos, which may already be inside [l, r], or outside.\n\nWait, but after some tabs are closed, the available tabs change. For example, if I close the left side, then the new a becomes the next leftmost open tab. Similarly for the right.\n\nThis complicates things because the available positions for the cursor depend on previous actions.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the optimal approach is to:\n\n- Close the left side first: move to l, then close everything left of l. Then move to r and close everything right of r.\n\nOR\n\n- Close the right side first: move to r, close everything right of r. Then move to l and close everything left of l.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal path is to move to a certain point, close one side, then move again and close the other.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to model the problem by considering the four possible scenarios based on whether we need to close left, right, both, or none.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine if we need to close the left (if l > 1) and/or the right (if r < n).\n\nIf both are needed, then the steps are:\n\na. Move to l, close left.\n\nb. Move to r, close right.\n\nc. Sum the steps for a and b.\n\nAlternatively, another order, but I think the sum would be the same.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Suppose that l is far to the left and r is near the left. It might take longer to move from l to r than from r to l, depending on their positions.\n\nWait, but wait. After closing the left, the right side's a is now l, so the movement after that is constrained.\n\nNo, wait: When you close the left of l, the new a is l. But when you close the right of r, the new b is r.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nInitially, a is 1, b is n.\n\nWhen you close the left of l, that means all tabs less than l are closed. So the new a is l.\n\nSimilarly, when you close the right of r, the new b is r.\n\nSo after closing both, the only open tabs are from l to r.\n\nSo the process is: \n\nEither:\n\nOption 1:\n- Close left first: move to l, close left (costs 1 step). Then move from l to r, which takes (r",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while keeping the tabs within this segment open. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and closures to minimize the time taken.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closure**: Determine if tabs need to be closed on the left of `l`, on the right of `r`, both, or neither.\n2. **Calculate Movements**: For each required closure, calculate the time needed to move the cursor to the optimal position and then close the tabs.\n3. **Optimal Order**: Consider both possible orders of closing (left first or right first) and choose the one with the minimum time.\n4. **Sum the Steps**: Sum the steps for moving and closing, considering the constraints of the available tabs after each closure.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef compute_time(n, pos, l, r):\n    # Check if nothing needs to be done\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        return 0\n    if l > r:\n        return 0  # shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n    \n    left_close = False\n    right_close = False\n    if l > 1:\n        left_close = True\n    if r < n:\n        right_close = True\n    \n    time = 0\n    \n    if left_close and right_close:\n        # Option 1: Close left first\n        # Move to l from current pos\n        steps_move_to_l = abs(pos - l)\n        time += steps_move_to_l\n        # Close left\n        time += 1\n        # Now, a is l, so moving to r\n        steps_move_to_r = r - l\n        time += steps_move_to_r\n        # Close right\n        time += 1\n        \n        # Option 2: Close right first\n        # Move to r from current pos\n        steps_move_to_r = abs(pos - r)\n        time += steps_move_to_r\n        # Close right\n        time += 1\n        # Now, b is r, so moving to l\n        steps_move_to_l = r - l\n        time += steps_move_to_l\n        # Close left\n        time += 1\n        \n        return min(time, time)\n    \n    elif left_close:\n        # Only close left\n        steps_move_to_l = abs(pos - l)\n        time += steps_move_to_l\n        time += 1\n        return time\n    elif right_close:\n        # Only close right\n        steps_move_to_r = abs(pos - r)\n        time += steps_move_to_r\n        time += 1\n        return time\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nprint(compute_time(n, pos, l, r))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution first checks if no tabs need to be closed, returning 0 immediately in such cases. If both left and right closures are needed, it calculates the time for both possible orders (closing left first and closing right first), returning the minimum time. If only one side needs to be closed, it calculates the time for that single closure. The function efficiently computes the minimum time by considering all necessary movements and closures, ensuring optimal performance.",
