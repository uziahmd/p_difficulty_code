Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a string of digits through several substitution queries and then computing the result modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo, Andrew has a string s. Eugene sends multiple queries, each being a replacement: replace all occurrences of a certain digit di with a substring ti. For example, if the query is \"2->00\", every '2' in s gets replaced by '00'. After all queries, we need to compute the number represented by s modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but the order of the queries matters. Oh right, because each query is processed in the given order. So, for each query, we have to modify the current string s accordingly.\n\nBut wait, how do the substitutions interact? Like, if there are multiple substitutions that could affect each other. For example, if a substitution replaces '3' with something that includes '3's again, those would be processed in later steps.\n\nHmm, but each query is a separate substitution step. So, each time, we process the current string by replacing all occurrences of di with ti.\n\nThe challenge here is to model the transformations efficiently, especially considering that each substitution can change the string, which affects future substitutions.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the state of the string after each substitution. But since the substitutions can be done in any order, and each substitution can potentially add new digits, perhaps we need a way to model all possible substitutions at once.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Instead of modifying the string step by step, perhaps we can represent for each digit what it gets replaced with, considering the latest substitution rules. Because each substitution is applied to all occurrences of a particular digit in the current string.\n\nWait, but the substitution steps are applied sequentially. So, the first substitution may create new digits which are subject to the next substitution if they match any of the substitution digits.\n\nSo, for example, if the first substitution is '2→00', then the string now has more '0's. If a later substitution is '0→5', then all the '0's from the first substitution will be replaced with '5's.\n\nSo, the order of substitution is crucial.\n\nThis suggests that we can't precompute all substitutions in any arbitrary order; we must process them in the given sequence.\n\nBut doing this naively for each substitution might be computationally feasible since the maximum length of s is 105, and n is up to 105 as well. So, the total operations would be manageable.\n\nWait, but for each substitution, we need to replace all instances of di in the current string with ti. So, for each substitution, we can process the string by scanning each character and replacing di when found.\n\nBut this approach could get slow for large strings, but given the constraints (s up to 105 and n up to 105), it's acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n- For each query in order:\n   - For each character in the current string:\n      - If the character is equal to di, replace it with ti.\n   - Update the current string with this modified version.\n\nWait, but this isn't correct. Because in the substitution, the di can appear in the ti, so during the substitution, any occurrence of di in the current string is replaced, including those introduced by previous substitutions.\n\nYes, because each substitution is applied to the current state of the string.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the substitution is applied to the string as it is at the time of the query. So, for each query, we scan the entire string and replace all di's with ti's.\n\nSo, for each substitution, we have to process the entire string, replacing every di with ti.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, the resulting string is computed.\n\nThen, we have to compute the number represented by this string mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the string can be empty after substitutions. In that case, the result is zero.\n\nAlso, leading zeros should be ignored when converting to a number. So, for example, if the string is '000123', it represents 123, not 000123.\n\nWait, no. The note says that when you represent s as a decimal number, ignore the leading zeros. So, the string could be something like '00123', which becomes 123.\n\nBut the substitution steps may leave leading zeros. So, after all substitutions, we need to process the string to remove leading zeros before converting to a number.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says: when you represent s as a decimal number, ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\n\nSo, the final s is processed to remove leading zeros. For example, if s is '000', it's treated as 0.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n\n2. Read n queries.\n\n3. For each query in order:\n   a. Split into di and ti. For example, for \"2->00\", di is '2', ti is '00'.\n   b. Replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\n4. After all queries, process the resulting string to remove leading zeros, except if it's all zeros, then it's 0.\n\n5. Convert this processed string to a number and compute mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the substitution steps can be many, but each substitution is a complete replacement of di with ti. So, for each substitution, the entire string is scanned and all di's are replaced.\n\nSo, the key is to perform each substitution correctly on the current string.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nImplementing each substitution:\n\nGiven the current string, for each query, find every occurrence of di and replace it with ti.\n\nBut this can be done by creating a new string where each character is either the original or the substituted one.\n\nFor example, for each character c in the current string:\n\nif c == di, then add ti to the new string.\n\nelse, add c.\n\nSo, the substitution is straightforward.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\n- Read the initial s.\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Read each query, parse into di and ti.\n\n- For each query, perform the substitution on the current s.\n\n- After all substitutions, process the final s.\n\nProcessing the final s:\n\n- Remove leading zeros.\n\n- If the resulting string is empty, output 0.\n\n- Else, output the integer value mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how to handle leading zeros? For example, if the string is '00123', it becomes '123' when converted. But the problem statement says to ignore leading zeros, so the string is treated as 123.\n\nSo, the processing step is:\n\n1. If the string is empty, output 0.\n\n2. Else, strip leading zeros.\n\n3. If the stripped string is empty, output 0.\n\n4. Else, convert the stripped string to integer, compute mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo, now, the main part is implementing the substitutions correctly.\n\nNow, testing on the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, the input seems to be a list of lines, but perhaps in the actual input, it's four lines: the initial s, then n=1, then the first query, etc. Or perhaps the initial line is the s, followed by the n, then n lines of queries.\n\nWait, the first line is s, the second is n, then n lines of queries.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the input is written as:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nBut that seems to represent a list of four elements, each being a string. So perhaps the actual input is four lines:\n\nLine 1: 123123\n\nLine 2: 1\n\nLine 3: 2->00\n\nLine 4: 3->\n\nWait, but the third query is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', which suggests that a single line may contain two substitutions. Wait, no, the third line is a query, which is of the form di->ti.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is read as follows:\n\n- The first line is s.\n\n- The second line is n.\n\n- Then, n lines follow, each representing a query.\n\nEach query is a string of the form \"di->ti\", possibly containing newlines? Or is it that the input is given as a list of lines, each line representing a query.\n\nWait, the sample input is presented as a list of four strings, which perhaps corresponds to the four lines:\n\nLine 1: '123123'\n\nLine 2: '1'\n\nLine 3: '2->00'\n\nLine 4: '3->'\n\nWait, but the third query is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'—no, that doesn't fit. Maybe the third and fourth lines are part of a single query? Or perhaps the sample input was mistyped.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third line is a query, and the fourth line is another query.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is as follows:\n\nInput:\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n2->00\n\n3->\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\n1000000008\n\n0\n\nWhich is four lines after the initial s.\n\nWait, but the third and fourth lines are two separate queries.\n\nNo, because the third line is '222', which would mean n=222, but that can't be because n is given as 1 in the second line.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as four lines:\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n2->00\n\n3->\n\nBut that's only two queries, but the third line is '222' which is a query? Or perhaps the third line is a query that includes a newline.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe initial string is '123123'.\n\nn is 1.\n\nThen, the query is '2->00'.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, after applying the first query, the string becomes '10031003', then the second query is '3->', which replaces all '3's with nothing, giving '1212'.\n\nThen, the third query is '222', which is probably a typo, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is as follows:\n\nThe first line is '123123'.\n\nThe second line is '1' (n=1).\n\nThe third line is '2->00'.\n\nThen, the fourth line is '3->'.\n\nSo, two queries: first, replace 2 with 00; second, replace 3 with empty.\n\nSo, initial s is '123123'.\n\nAfter first substitution (replace 2 with 00):\n\nLooking for '2's in '123123'—there's one '2' in the middle. So replace with '00', resulting in '130013'.\n\nWait, no, wait: '123123' is 1 2 3 1 2 3.\n\nReplacing '2's with '00' gives '1 00 3 1 00 3' → '10031003'.\n\nSecond substitution is '3->', so replace '3's with empty. So '10031003' becomes '10001003'? No, wait, the substitution is for '3's.\n\nLooking at '10031003', the '3's are the third and sixth characters. Replacing them with nothing:\n\nPositions: 0:1, 1:0, 2:0, 3:3 → replaced by nothing → position 3 is removed.\n\nSimilarly, position 5: 0, position 6:3 → replaced by nothing.\n\nSo, the string becomes '100 0 1 00' → Wait, no:\n\nWait, the string is '1','0','0','3','1','0','0','3'.\n\nWhen replacing '3's, each '3' is removed. So, the string becomes '1 0 0 1 0 0' → '100100'?\n\nWait, no, because the '3's are at positions 3 and 7 (assuming 0-based). So removing them:\n\nOriginal string: indices 0-7.\n\nAfter removing 3's:\n\nIndices 0:1, 1:0, 2:0, 4:1, 5:0, 6:0.\n\nSo the new string is '100100'?\n\nBut the sample output after the second substitution is '1212'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution steps.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\nAfter the first substitution (2→00): '123123' becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second substitution is 3→, which replaces all 3's with nothing.\n\nSo '10031003' is '1 0 0 3 1 0 0 3'.\n\nReplace each '3' with empty:\n\nSo the string becomes '1 0 0 1 0 0' → '100100'?\n\nBut the sample output after this substitution is '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample. Let me check the sample note.\n\nIn the sample note, the outputs after each query are:\n\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\nSo, after the first substitution, the string is '10031003'.\n\nAfter the second substitution, it's '1212'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter substitution of '3->' on '10031003':\n\nLooking for '3's in '10031003':\n\nThe third character is '0' (position 2?), wait maybe I'm getting the indices wrong.\n\nWait, '10031003' is 1 0 0 3 1 0 0 3.\n\nSo, the '3's are at positions 3 and 7.\n\nRemoving those:\n\nSo the string becomes '1 0 0 1 0 0' → '100100', but the sample output is '1212'.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is different. Maybe the third query is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'.\n\nWait, perhaps the third query is two substitutions: 2→0 and 0→7.\n\nWait, but each query is a single substitution. So perhaps the input is such that each line after the initial is a query, which can have multiple substitutions? Or perhaps each query is a single substitution, and the third line is a single substitution '2->0', and the fourth line is '0->7'.\n\nAh, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's re-express the sample input:\n\nInitial s: '123123'\n\nn=1.\n\nThen, the first query is '2->00' → s becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second query is '3->' → s becomes '100100'.\n\nWait, but the sample output after the second substitution is '1212', which is shorter.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nLine 1: '123123'\n\nLine 2: '3'\n\nLine 3: '2->00'\n\nLine 4: '3->'\n\nLine 5: '222'\n\nLine 6: '2'\n\nLine 7: '2->0'\n\nLine 8: '0->7'\n\nLine 9: '1000000008'\n\nLine 10: '0'\n\nWait, but that's not matching the sample output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is as follows:\n\nThe initial string is '123123'.\n\nn=3.\n\nQueries:\n\n1. '2->00'\n\n2. '3->'\n\n3. '222' → but that can't be a substitution, as it's not in the format di->ti.\n\nHmm, perhaps the sample input is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misreading it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe initial string is '123123'.\n\nn=3.\n\nQueries:\n\n1. '2->00'\n\n2. '3->'\n\n3. '222' → which is a query that may be invalid, but perhaps in the context of the problem, it's allowed.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, as di must be a single digit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about how to proceed with the code.\n\nThe plan is:\n\nRead the initial string s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next n lines, each being a query.\n\nFor each query, split into di and ti. How? Each query is of the form di->ti, where di is a single digit, ti is a string (could be empty).\n\nSo, for each query line, we can split on '->' to get di and ti.\n\nFor example, the query '2->00' gives di='2', ti='00'.\n\nOnce we have di and ti, we process the current string by replacing every occurrence of di with ti.\n\nSo, for each character in s:\n\nif it's equal to di, we append ti to the new string.\n\nelse, we append the character.\n\nSo, the substitution is straightforward.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, process the string:\n\n- Remove leading zeros.\n\n- If the result is empty, output 0.\n\n- Else, compute the integer value mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, how to handle the substitution step:\n\nEach substitution is applied to the current string. So, for each substitution, the current string is processed to replace all di's with ti's.\n\nSo, for example, if after a substitution, the string has new di's that match another substitution, the next substitution will process them.\n\nSo, the order of substitutions is crucial.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe can read s as the first line. Then read n. Then read n lines, each being a query.\n\nThen, process each substitution.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ncurrent = s\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\n\nfor query in queries:\n    # split into di and ti\n    parts = query.split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) >1 else ''\n    # substitute di with ti in current\n    new_s = []\n    for c in current:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    current = ''.join(new_s)\n\n# Now process current\nif not current:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # remove leading zeros\n    stripped = current.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(stripped)\n        print(num % mod)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, after the third substitution, the string is '777', which comes from '222' being replaced by '0' and then '0' being replaced by '7'.\n\nWait, perhaps the third substitution is '2->0' and the fourth is '0->7'.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nAfter the first substitution, s is '10031003'.\n\nSecond substitution is '3->', so s becomes '100100'.\n\nThird substitution is '2->0': looking for '2's in '100100' — none, so s remains '100100'.\n\nFourth substitution is '0->7': replace all '0's with '7's → '77777'.\n\nWait, but that's not matching the sample output.\n\nWait, the sample output after the third substitution is '777'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, that's four lines.\n\nSo, initial s is '123123'.\n\nn=1.\n\nFirst query: '2->00' → s becomes '10031003'.\n\nSecond query: '3->' → s becomes '100100'.\n\nThird query: '222' → which is a query, but di must be a single digit. So, '222' is not a valid di, but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's '2->0\\n0->7' as a single query.\n\nWait, perhaps the third line is a query, and the fourth is another query. So, the third query is '2->0', and the fourth is '0->7'.\n\nSo, processing:\n\nAfter second substitution, s is '100100'.\n\nThird substitution: '2->0' → look for '2's in '100100' → none, so s remains '100100'.\n\nFourth substitution: '0->7' → replace all '0's with '7's → '77777'.\n\nSo, the final s is '77777'.\n\nModulo 1e9+7 is 77777.\n\nBut the sample output after the third substitution is '777'.\n\nHmm, perhaps the third query is '22->0' → but that's not a single digit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third query is '2->0' and the fourth is '0->7'.\n\nIn that case, after third substitution, s is '100100' (no '2's), then fourth substitution: replace '0's with '7's, resulting in '77777'.\n\nBut the sample output after the third substitution is '777', which suggests that after the third substitution, the string is '777'.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the third query is '222' → which is not a valid substitution (di is more than one digit), but perhaps it's an error in the sample.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third query is '2->0', and the fourth is '0->7'.\n\nSo, let's process:\n\nAfter substitution 3: s is '100100' (from '10031003' after substitution 2).\n\nSubstitution 3: '2->0' → no change.\n\nSubstitution 4: '0->7' → replace all '0's → '77777'.\n\nWhich is 77777 mod 1e9+7 is 77777.\n\nBut sample output shows after the third substitution, the string is '777'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '222' → which is invalid, but perhaps the code ignores it.\n\nBut in the code, each query is processed as di and ti.\n\nSo, in the third query, '222' would be di='222', which is longer than one digit, but according to the problem statement, di is exactly one digit.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample input is presented incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third query is '2->0' and the fourth is '0->7'.\n\nSo, substitution 3: replace '2's with '0's. But in the current string '100100', there are no '2's, so no change.\n\nSubstitution 4: replace '0's with '7's, so '100100' becomes '77777'.\n\nSo, the final string is '77777', which mod 1e9+7 is 77777.\n\nBut the sample output is 777.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, the sample output is ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1'].\n\nSo, after the third substitution, the string is '777'.\n\nSo, perhaps the third substitution is '222' → which is a query that replaces '2's with '0's, but '222' is not a valid di.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '22->0', but again, di must be a single digit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '2->0' and the fourth substitution is '0->7', but that would produce '77777'.\n\nBut sample output shows after the third substitution, the string is '777'.\n\nWait, perhaps after substitution 2, the string is '1212'.\n\nHow?\n\nLet me re-examine substitution steps.\n\nInitial s: '123123'.\n\nAfter substitution 1: '2->00' → '1' + '00' + '3' + '1' + '00' + '3' → '10031003'.\n\nSubstitution 2: '3->' → replace all '3's with nothing.\n\nSo, '10031003' → let's see:\n\nThe string is '1','0','0','3','1','0','0','3'.\n\nReplacing '3's: each '3' is removed.\n\nSo, the string becomes '1 0 0 1 0 0' → '100100'.\n\nBut the sample output after substitution 2 is '1212'.\n\nHmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps substitution 2 is '3->00' instead of '3->', but the sample shows the second substitution as '3->'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution steps.\n\nAlternative approach: simulate the sample step by step.\n\nSample Input:\n\nAfter first substitution: '2->00' → '123123' → '1' '2' '3' '1' '2' '3' → replace '2's with '00's.\n\nSo, the string becomes '1' followed by '00' (replacing '2'), then '3' (remains), then '1', then '00' (replacing '2'), then '3'.\n\nSo, the string is '1 00 3 1 00 3' → '10031003'.\n\nAfter second substitution: '3->' → replace '3's with nothing.\n\nSo, '10031003' → '1 0 0 3 1 0 0 3' → replacing '3's:\n\nThe third '3' is at position 3, and the last '3' is at position 7.\n\nSo, the string becomes '1 0 0 1 0 0' → '100100'.\n\nBut the sample output after substitution 2 is '1212'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the substitution applies to all occurrences, including those added by previous substitutions.\n\nWait, in substitution 2, '3->' is applied to the string '10031003'.\n\nSo, '3's in that string are at positions 3 and 7.\n\nSo, replacing them with nothing:\n\nThe string becomes '1 0 0 1 0 0' → '100100'.\n\nBut the sample output after substitution 2 is '1212'.\n\nSo, why is that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second substitution is '3->', but in the string after substitution 1, '3's are in positions 2, 5, and 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the indices.\n\nWait, '10031003' is:\n\nIndex 0: '1'\n\nIndex 1: '0'\n\nIndex 2: '0'\n\nIndex 3: '3'\n\nIndex 4: '1'\n\nIndex 5: '0'\n\nIndex 6: '0'\n\nIndex 7: '3'\n\nSo, when replacing '3's, the indices 3 and 7 are removed.\n\nSo, the string becomes:\n\nIndices 0:1, 1:0, 2:0, 4:1, 5:0, 6:0.\n\nThus, the string is '1 0 0 1 0 0' → '100100'.\n\nBut the sample output is '1212'.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy.\n\nUnless, the substitution is done in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps in substitution 2, the '3's are replaced, but perhaps the substitution is not done correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps substitution 2 is '3->00', which would cause the '3's to be replaced with '00's.\n\nBut in the sample, substitution 2 is '3->'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe initial string is '222'.\n\nn=2.\n\nQueries:\n\n1.

So, if ti contains '3's, then the substitution may introduce more '3's that are subject to subsequent substitutions.\n\nBut in this case, substitution 2 is '3->', so ti is empty.\n\nSo, in substitution 2, any '3's are replaced with empty, and thus, any '3's in ti would not be processed in this substitution.\n\nBut in substitution 2, ti is empty, so no '3's are added.\n\nSo, I'm not sure why the sample output is '1212' after substitution 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is done in a way that the entire string is processed, and all '3's are replaced, including those in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is done for all '3's, including those that were added in substitution 1.\n\nSo, substitution 1 adds '00's, which don't have '3's.\n\nSo, substitution 2 replaces the '3's in the original string, but perhaps the '3's in the middle are also replaced.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is done for all '3's in the entire string, including those added by substitution 1.\n\nBut substitution 1 adds '00's, which don't have '3's.\n\nSo, substitution 2 replaces the original '3's.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is misrepresented.\n\nBut regardless, the code I wrote should handle the substitution steps correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is correct, and the sample is just a specific case.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nSo, initial s is '222'.\n\nn=2.\n\nQueries:\n\n1. '2->0' → replace '2's with '0's → '000'.\n\n2. '0->7' → replace '0's with '7's → '777'.\n\nSo, the final string is '777', which mod 1e9+7 is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code handles this correctly.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n1000000008\n\n0\n\nSo, no substitutions.\n\nSo, the string is '1000000008'.\n\nStripping leading zeros gives '1000000008'.\n\nAs a number, it's 1000000008.\n\nMod 1e9+7 is 1, since 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a string through a series of substitution queries and then compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). The substitutions are applied in sequence, and each substitution replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with a given substring. After processing all queries, we convert the resulting string to a number, ignoring leading zeros, and compute its remainder when divided by \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Start by reading the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Process Queries:** For each query, replace all occurrences of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n3. **Handle Substitutions:** For each query, split it into the digit to be replaced (di) and the substring to replace it with (ti). Construct a new string by iterating through each character of the current string and substituting di with ti where necessary.\n4. **Final String Processing:** After processing all queries, remove any leading zeros from the resulting string. If the resulting string is empty, treat it as zero. Otherwise, convert the string to an integer and compute its modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ncurrent = s\n\nmod = 10**9 + 7\n\nfor query in queries:\n    if '->' not in query:\n        continue  # invalid query format, skip\n    parts = query.split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n    new_s = []\n    for c in current:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    current = ''.join(new_s)\n\nif not current:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    stripped = current.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(stripped)\n        print(num % mod)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The initial string and the number of queries are read first.\n- **Processing Each Query:** Each query is processed by splitting it into the digit to replace (di) and the replacement string (ti). The current string is then updated by replacing all occurrences of di with ti.\n- **String Substitution:** For each character in the current string, if it matches di, the replacement string ti is appended to the new string; otherwise, the character itself is appended.\n- **Final Processing:** After all queries are processed, the resulting string is stripped of leading zeros. If the result is an empty string, it is treated as zero. Otherwise, the integer value of the string is computed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is handled correctly and efficiently, even for the maximum constraints provided.",
