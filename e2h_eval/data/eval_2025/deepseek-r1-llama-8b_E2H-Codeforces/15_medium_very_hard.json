They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine all the winning integers x for a given tournament setup. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the tournament is a knockout style with 2^n teams. Each game eliminates one team, and the process continues until one champion remains. The way the games are structured is important. In each phase, the teams are paired as (1,2), (3,4), etc., and the winners proceed to the next phase.\n\nThe string s gives information about the outcome of each phase. For each character in s, if it's '0', then in that phase, the lower-skilled team wins each match. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nThe permutation p represents the skill levels of the teams. So, each number from 1 to 2^n appears exactly once in p. We need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nHmm, so the task is to find all possible x that can be the overall winner under some permutation of skills, considering the given phase results.\n\nLet me think about how the tournament works. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The first phase has 2^(n-1) games, resulting in 2^(n-1) winners. Then, the second phase has 2^(n-2) games, and so on until only one remains.\n\nEach phase's outcome depends on the current state of the teams and the rules given by s.\n\nWait, but the phases are ordered from the first to the nth. So for each i from 0 to n-1, s[i] determines the outcome of the (i+1)-th phase.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that s_i corresponds to the i-th phase. So for example, for n=3, the phases are:\n\n- Phase 1: 2^2 =4 games → handled by s[0]\n- Phase 2: 2^1 =2 games → handled by s[1]\n- Phase 3: 1 game → handled by s[2]\n\nWait no, wait the string is of length n. So for n=3, there are 3 phases. Each phase corresponds to a certain grouping of the teams. So phase 1 is the first phase, which has 2^(3-1) =4 games, phase 2 has 2^(3-2)=2 games, phase 3 has 2^(3-3)=1 game.\n\nEach phase is determined by s[i], where i is from 0 to n-1.\n\nSo for each phase i, during that phase, the teams are grouped into matches as per their current order. The way they are grouped depends on the previous phases' winners.\n\nBut how do we model the progression of the teams through each phase?\n\nThis seems complicated because the structure of the tournament is based on the initial pairing and the outcomes of each phase.\n\nIdea: Maybe model the possible sets of teams that can reach each phase, along with the necessary constraints on their skill order based on the phase's rule.\n\nWait, but for each phase, the way the teams are paired depends on the structure of the tournament. So the initial group is (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2^k -1, 2^k), where k is the current phase.\n\nWait no, perhaps the initial phase is when all teams are present, and the next phases involve the winners of the previous phase, grouped in pairs again.\n\nWait, for example, in the first phase (phase 1), the teams are 1,2,3,4,...,2^n. They are paired as (1 vs 2), (3 vs4), etc. The winners move to phase 2, which has 2^{n-1} teams. In phase 2, these teams are paired as (winner1 vs winner2), (winner3 vs winner4), etc. So the structure is a binary tree, where each phase is a level in the tree.\n\nThus, the key is that in each phase, the teams are arranged in consecutive pairs, starting from the first position.\n\nSo, for each phase, the teams are processed in groups of two, starting from index 0.\n\nBut the exact arrangement depends on the previous phase's winners.\n\nThis suggests that the tournament's structure is a binary elimination tree, where each node has two children: the two teams that played against each other to produce the winner.\n\nTherefore, to model the possible winners, we can represent the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial teams.\n\nBut building such a structure for n=18 would result in 2^18=262,144 nodes, which is manageable but perhaps computationally heavy if not optimized.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 18, meaning 2^18=262,144 teams. So a straightforward approach might not work.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the outcome of each phase depends on the ordering of the current group of teams, perhaps we can model the possible ranges or constraints on the ranks of the winning teams at each phase.\n\nAt each phase, the current set of teams is processed in consecutive pairs. For each pair, depending on s[i], either the lower or higher ranked team wins.\n\nSo for each phase, the winners are determined based on the current set of teams and the phase's rule.\n\nBut the challenge is to track all possible subsets of teams that could make it to each subsequent phase, given the phase rules.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is fixed for all phases. So the relative ordering of the teams' skills determines who can win each match.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the tournament as a series of stages, where each stage has a certain set of possible team orderings, and for each stage, we apply the rules to compute the possible winners.\n\nBut for n=18, this approach may be too slow.\n\nAnother idea: For each phase, the teams are in a certain order, and each pair plays. The winners form the next set of teams for the next phase.\n\nSo, for each phase, we can represent the possible teams and their relative orders that allow them to pass to the next phase.\n\nBut even this seems computationally intensive for n=18.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of tracking all possible subsets, perhaps represent the constraints on the permutation p. That is, for each position in the permutation, determine whether it's possible for a certain team to end up as the champion.\n\nWait, but how? The problem is that the tournament structure depends on the phase rules and the permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps think recursively. For each phase, the teams are grouped into pairs, and each pair produces a winner. The winner's rank depends on the phase's rule and the ranks of the two teams.\n\nIf we can model the possible minimum and maximum ranks that a team can have to reach each phase, perhaps we can determine the possible candidates for the champion.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase, we can determine the possible ranks of the teams that can reach that phase. Then, using these ranges, we can build a recursive function that tracks which ranks can become the champion.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nEach phase i (0-based) has a certain number of games: 2^(n - i - 1). Wait, no: for phase i (0-based), the number of games is 2^{n-i-1}, but wait n is the input, and the phases are 1 to n. Wait, maybe better to index phases from 0 to n-1, where phase i has 2^{n-i} games, but no, the total number of games is 2^n -1, so for n=3, 3 phases: 4, 2, 1 games respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps the phases are numbered from 0 to n-1, where phase 0 is the first phase (with 2^{n-0} games?), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe the number of phases is n, each phase i (from 0 to n-1) has 2^{n - i -1} games. Because for n=3, phase 0: 2^{3-0-1}=2^2=4 games; phase 1: 2^(3-1-1)=2^1=2 games; phase 2: 2^(3-2-1)=2^0=1 game. Yes, that adds up to 4+2+1=7 games, which is correct.\n\nSo for phase i (0<=i <n), the number of games is 2^{n - i -1}, and the phase's rule is s[i].\n\nEach phase is a grouping into consecutive pairs. So the initial phase (i=0) has the 2^n teams, grouped into (1,2), (3,4), etc. The winners go to phase i=1, which has 2^{n-1} teams, grouped into (w1, w2), (w3,w4), etc.\n\nWait, but the grouping is always based on the current list of teams. So the structure is a binary tree, where each node is a match between two teams, and the winner becomes a parent node.\n\nSo, to model the tournament, each phase is a level of the tree.\n\nBut the key is that in each phase, the teams are processed in consecutive pairs, so the order in which they appear in the phase is the same as the order in which they won their previous matches.\n\nSo, for phase i, the current list of teams is the winners from phase i-1, arranged in the order of their previous matches.\n\nThus, for each phase, the list of teams is a subset of the previous phase's winners, in the same order as their previous groupings.\n\nThis suggests that the structure of the tournament can be represented as a binary tree, where each non-leaf node has two children, representing the two teams that played in that match.\n\nSo, for each phase, the teams are arranged in a list, and each consecutive pair forms a node in the tree.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nPhase 0:\nTeams: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\nGrouped into (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8)\nWinners: w1, w2, w3, w4\nPhase 1:\nTeams: [w1, w2, w3, w4]\nGrouped into (w1,w2), (w3,w4)\nWinners: w11, w12\nPhase 2:\nTeams: [w11, w12]\nGrouped into (w11, w12)\nWinner: champion\n\nEach of these phases is determined by the corresponding s[i].\n\nSo, for each phase i, the teams are arranged in a certain order, and each consecutive pair plays a match. The winner is determined by s[i], and the winner proceeds to the next phase.\n\nThus, to find whether a particular x can be the champion, we need to determine if there exists a permutation p of the skills such that, after applying all the phase rules, x emerges as the winner.\n\nBut how do we model this? It's a bit tricky because the permutation's order affects the outcomes of each match.\n\nAlternative idea: For each phase, the teams in that phase must satisfy certain constraints based on the phase's rule. For example, if s[i] is '0', then in each match, the lower-skilled team wins. So, for a pair (a, b), the winner must be the one with lower p[a] and p[b]. If s[i] is '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nThus, for each phase, the teams in that phase must form a certain structure where, for each consecutive pair, the winner is determined by s[i].\n\nMoreover, the teams in each phase are the winners from the previous phase, arranged in the same order as their previous groupings.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the problem by determining, for each phase, the possible range of ranks that the champion must have.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the possible ranks for each phase's winner and propagate these constraints through all phases.\n\nFor example, in phase 0, the teams are 1 to 2^n, arranged in their natural order. Each pair plays, and the winner is determined by s[0].\n\nSo, for phase 0, the possible winners are determined by the rules: for each pair, the winner must be the lower or higher rank, depending on s[0].\n\nIn phase 1, the teams are the winners of phase 0, arranged in the order of their previous groupings. So, the first two winners of phase 0 form the first pair, etc.\n\nThus, the key is that the structure of the tournament is a binary tree, and the phase rules apply to each node in the tree.\n\nHmm, but how can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent the tournament as a binary tree, and for each node (representing a match), determine the constraints on the two teams that played in that match.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to finding a permutation p where, for each node, the winner is determined correctly according to s[i], and the final root node's winner is x.\n\nBut the problem is that the permutation p is a single permutation that must satisfy all the constraints across all phases.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me think about the tournament structure as a binary tree. Each leaf is a team, and each internal node is a match between two children. The value of the node is determined by s[i], where i is the phase in which the match occurs.\n\nWait, but each phase corresponds to a level in the tournament tree. So phase 0 is the leaves, phase 1 is their parents, and so on, up to phase n-1, which is the root.\n\nSo, for each node in the tree, we can determine its phase (i) and the required outcome based on s[i].\n\nWait, for example, for n=3, the tree has 7 nodes:\n\n- Leaves (phase 0): 4 nodes.\n- Phase 1: 2 nodes (parents of the leaves).\n- Phase 2: 1 node (root).\n\nEach node has a phase i (0, 1, 2) and a rule s[i].\n\nSo, for each node, if s[i] is '0', then in the match, the lower-ranked team wins. Otherwise, the higher-ranked team wins.\n\nOur goal is to assign p values to the leaves such that all the internal nodes' constraints are satisfied, leading to the root's value being x.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is a single permutation, so the p values are assigned to the leaves, and then the internal nodes are determined based on their children.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign the p values such that, for each internal node, the winner is as per s[i], and the root's winner is x.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the solution is to model this as a graph of constraints, where each internal node imposes a relationship between its two children's p values.\n\nFor example, if in a node (parent of a and b) with s[i]=1, then p[a] < p[b], because the higher-skilled team wins. Or wait, if s[i] is 1, the higher-skilled team wins, so the winner is the one with higher p.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIn a match between a and b:\n\n- If s[i] is 0: the winner is the one with lower p. So, if a < b, a wins; else, b wins.\n- If s[i] is 1: the winner is the one with higher p. So, if a > b, a wins; else, b wins.\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nIf s[i] is 0: the lower-skilled team wins. So, the winner is the one with smaller p.\nIf s[i] is 1: the higher-skilled team wins. So, the winner is the one with larger p.\n\nSo, for each internal node, the winner must be either the smaller or larger p value, depending on s[i].\n\nThus, for each internal node (non-leaf), we can express the condition that the winner's p is less than or greater than the loser's p.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to assigning p values to the leaves such that all these conditions are satisfied, and the root's winner is x.\n\nBut since the permutation p is a bijection, each leaf has a unique p value, and the root's winner is x.\n\nSo, the question is: for which x does there exist a permutation of the leaves' p values that satisfies all the internal node constraints, with x being the root's winner.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where edges represent the constraints between the leaves based on the internal nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the constraints as a DAG where each edge from a to b indicates that a must be less than or greater than b, depending on the path constraints.\n\nBut since each internal node imposes a condition on its two children, the DAG will have edges representing these conditions.\n\nOnce the DAG is built, the problem becomes determining which x can be the root's winner, considering the DAG's constraints.\n\nBut how to represent this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of the constraints as forming a partial order. The permutation must respect this partial order for x to be the champion.\n\nBut the issue is that for each internal node, the constraint is on the two children, which are leaves in the tree. So, each internal node adds a constraint between its two children.\n\nWait, perhaps each internal node adds a constraint that the two children's p values are in a certain order.\n\nFor example, if the internal node has s[i] = 1, then the winner is the higher-skilled team. So, the higher-skilled team must have a higher p value than the lower-skilled. But since the higher-skilled team wins, it means that the winner is the one with higher p. So, in this case, the constraint is that one child's p is greater than the other's.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose in an internal node with phase i, s[i] is 1. The two children are a and b.\n\nIn this match, the higher-skilled team wins. So, the winner's p is higher than the loser's p.\n\nThus, the winner is either a or b, depending on their p values.\n\nBut for the internal node, the winner is determined by the rule, but for the permutation, the p values are fixed. So, the constraint is that the winner is the one with higher p.\n\nBut how do we model this as a relation between a and b?\n\nWell, for the internal node, the winner must be the one with higher p. So, the winner is a if a.p > b.p, else b. So, the constraint is that a.p > b.p or b.p > a.p, depending on the rule.\n\nWait, no, the rule is that the higher-skilled team wins. So, regardless of a and b's order, the winner is the one with higher p. Thus, in the internal node, the winner is max(a, b) if s[i] is 1, and min(a, b) if s[i] is 0.\n\nSo, the internal node enforces that, for the two children a and b, the winner is either a or b, based on the rule.\n\nThus, the constraint is that for the internal node, the winner is the one with higher p (if s[i]=1) or lower p (if s[i]=0).\n\nBut this introduces a dependency between a and b: in the internal node, a and b must be such that one is the winner, determined by the rule.\n\nBut how to model this as a graph of inequalities?\n\nPerhaps for each internal node, we can add an edge between the two children, indicating which one must be larger.\n\nWait, for example, if the internal node has s[i]=1, then the winner is the higher-skilled team. So, the winner must be larger than the loser. But which one is the winner depends on their p values.\n\nThus, it's impossible to directly add a constraint like a < b or b < a, because which one is the winner depends on the p values.\n\nWait, perhaps instead, for each internal node, the winner must be the one that beats the other in that phase. So, for the internal node, we can represent the condition that either a beats b or b beats a, but it's not clear.\n\nThis seems challenging. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternative Idea: Think recursively about the possible ranks of the champion.\n\nWe can represent for each phase, the possible range of ranks that the champion could have, given the phase's rule and the previous phase's possibilities.\n\nWait, for example, in the last phase (phase n-1), there are two teams left. The winner of this phase is the champion.\n\nSo, for phase n-1, the two teams must satisfy the condition that the winner is the one with higher p (if s[n-1]=1) or lower p (if s[n-1]=0).\n\nThus, the champion's p must be either higher or lower than the other team's p, depending on s[n-1].\n\nBut the problem is to determine the possible x's, given that the permutation p must be consistent across all phases.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase, we can determine the possible range of p values that the champion can have, given the previous phase's constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the problem as a series of layers, where each layer corresponds to a phase. For each layer, we'll track the possible intervals of p values that the champion can have, given the constraints up to that phase.\n\nAt each phase, the possible champion's p must lie within an interval determined by the previous phase's possible champions and the current phase's rule.\n\nWait, but the champion is determined by each phase's winners, so perhaps the possible p values for the current phase's champion depend on the possible p values of the previous phase's champions.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase, we can model the possible minimum and maximum p values that the champion can have, based on the phase's rule and the possible ranges from the previous phase.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFor the initial phase (phase 0), the teams are 1,2,...,2^n. They are paired into (1,2), (3,4), etc. Each pair produces a winner based on s[0]. So, for each pair, the winner is either the lower or higher p, depending on s[0].\n\nThus, the possible winners of phase 0 are determined by the s[0] rule applied to all pairs.\n\nFor each pair, the winner can be either the lower or higher p, depending on s[0]. So, for phase 0, the possible winners are constrained based on s[0].\n\nThen, for phase 1, each pair in phase 0's winners must be considered, with their own s[1] rule.\n\nThis seems to suggest that for each phase, the possible p values of the current champion must be within certain constraints, based on the previous phase's possible champions.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nPerhaps for each phase i, we can compute a set of intervals [low_i, high_i], where low_i is the minimum possible p value of the champion after phase i, and high_i is the maximum.\n\nThen, for phase i+1, we combine the intervals from phase i, apply the s[i+1] rule, and compute the new intervals.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for phase i, suppose the current champion's p lies in [L, R]. Then, in phase i+1, the champion's p is determined by the winner of the two possible previous champions.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is feasible.\n\nLet's try to model this.\n\nInitialize for phase 0:\n\nThe initial phase (phase 0) has all 2^n teams. Each pair (a, a+1) for a odd, etc. For each pair, the winner is determined by s[0].\n\nSo, for each pair, the possible winner's p is either the lower or higher, depending on s[0].\n\nThus, for phase 0, the possible p values of the winners are the union of the possible winners from each pair, subject to s[0].\n\nWait, but the permutation p is a single permutation, so the choices made in one pair affect the others. So, for phase 0, the possible winners cannot be chosen independently for each pair; they must be compatible with each other.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nThus, perhaps the initial approach isn't suitable because the constraints are interdependent across different pairs.\n\nAlternative Idea: Model the entire tournament as a binary decision tree, where each node represents a possible state of the current set of possible p values, and the edges represent the possible winners of a phase.\n\nBut with n=18, this seems computationally infeasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps dynamic programming can help here.\n\nWait, let's consider the tournament structure as a binary tree. Each node is a match, and the leaves are the initial teams. For each internal node, the two children are the teams that played in that match, and the winner is determined by s[i].\n\nSo, for each internal node, the winner's p is determined by the two children's p and s[i].\n\nThus, the problem can be seen as determining, for each internal node, which child is the winner, and thus, the constraints on their p values.\n\nBut since all these constraints must hold for the same permutation p, it's challenging.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each internal node, we can represent the constraints as a comparison between the two children.\n\nFor example, if in an internal node with s[i]=1, the higher-skilled team wins. So, the winner must have a higher p than the loser.\n\nThus, for this internal node, one child must have a higher p than the other.\n\nBut which one is the winner depends on their p values.\n\nThus, for each internal node, we can model it as an edge between the two children, indicating that one must be less than the other.\n\nWait, but the direction of the edge depends on the outcome of the match.\n\nBut since the outcome is determined by s[i], we can model it as follows:\n\n- If s[i] is 0, then the winner is the one with lower p. So, the winner must be less than the loser. Thus, the winner and loser are such that winner < loser.\n- If s[i] is 1, then the winner is the one with higher p. So, the winner must be greater than the loser. Thus, winner > loser.\n\nBut the winner is either the first or the second child in the pair.\n\nThus, for each internal node, we can add a constraint between the two children:\n\n- If s[i] is 0: winner < loser → so, if the winner is the first child, then first < second. Else, second < first.\n- If s[i] is 1: winner > loser → if the winner is the first child, then first > second. Else, second > first.\n\nBut how to represent this in a way that can be checked for consistency across the entire tree.\n\nWait, perhaps for each internal node, we can create a directed edge from the winner to the loser, indicating that the winner's p must be less than or greater than the loser's, based on s[i].\n\nBut since the winner is determined by the s[i] rule, the direction of the edge depends on that.\n\nWait, no, because the winner's p is determined by the rule. For example, if s[i]=0, the winner is the one with lower p, so the winner must be less than the loser. So, the constraint is winner < loser.\n\nThus, for an internal node with s[i]=0, the winner is either the first or the second child, and their p must be less than the other.\n\nSimilarly, for s[i]=1, the winner's p must be greater than the loser's.\n\nThus, for each internal node, the constraint is that the winner's p is less than or greater than the loser's p, depending on s[i].\n\nBut this creates a constraint between the two children of the node.\n\nThus, the entire tournament can be represented as a directed graph where each edge represents a constraint between two teams (children of some internal node), indicating that one must be less than or greater than the other.\n\nThe permutation p must be a linear extension of this directed graph, such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nMoreover, the root of the tree (the champion) must be x.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to checking whether x can be the maximum (or minimum, depending on s) element in the permutation, while respecting all the constraints imposed by the tournament's structure.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis sounds like a topological sort problem, where the constraints form a DAG, and we need to check whether x can be the maximum element in the topological order.\n\nWait, but x is the root, and all constraints must be satisfied.\n\nSo, the steps I can take are:\n\n1. Construct the tournament tree as a binary tree, where each internal node represents a phase and has two children (the two teams that played in that phase).\n\n2. For each internal node, add a constraint between its two children based on s[i].\n\n   - If s[i] is '0', the winner is the lower-skilled team, so the winner must be less than the loser. Thus, for the two children a and b, either a < b or b < a, depending on which is the winner.\n\n   - If s[i] is '1', the winner is the higher-skilled team, so the winner must be greater than the loser. Thus, either a > b or b > a.\n\n3. Once all constraints are added, the permutation p must be a linear extension of this DAG, meaning that for every directed edge u→v, p[u] < p[v].\n\n4. Additionally, x must be the root of the tree (the champion), so x must be the maximum in the permutation.\n\nWait, no. Because x is the root, it must have been the winner of its phase, which depends on the constraints in the tree.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The root is the champion, but the constraints are that along the path from the root to any node, certain relations hold.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model the DAG as the constraints and then find if x can be the maximum, with all other constraints satisfied.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n- Build the tournament tree.\n\n- For each internal node, create a constraint between its two children, based on s[i].\n\n- Check if there's a permutation p where x is the maximum, and all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut for n=18, the number of nodes is 2^18 -1 = 262143. This is manageable, but building the constraints for such a large tree is computationally expensive unless done efficiently.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of building the entire tree, perhaps we can represent the constraints as a graph, and for each x, determine whether x can be the maximum in the permutation, given the constraints.\n\nBut again, the size is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a series of bitwise operations, considering the binary nature of the tournament.\n\nWait, perhaps the tournament can be viewed as a binary heap, where each node's parent is determined by the phase rules.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since each phase's outcome depends on the order of the teams in that phase, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the tournament's structure and the phase rules as a series of comparisons that must be satisfied.\n\nEach phase's rule imposes a certain ordering between the two teams that played in that phase.\n\nThus, the tournament's structure is a binary tree where each internal node imposes a constraint between its two children.\n\nThe problem is then to find all x such that x can be the root, and all constraints are satisfied.\n\nThus, the constraints form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and x must be the maximum element in a topological order of this DAG.\n\nBut how to construct this DAG?\n\nWait, perhaps the DAG is built as follows:\n\n- Each internal node in the tournament tree adds an edge between its two children, indicating which one is the winner based on s[i].\n\nWait, but for an internal node with s[i]=0, the winner is the one with lower p. So, the winner must be less than the loser. Thus, the edge is from the winner to the loser, indicating that the winner's p is less than the loser's p.\n\nSimilarly, for s[i]=1, the winner is the higher-skilled, so the edge is from the loser to the winner, indicating that the loser's p is less than the winner's p.\n\nWait, perhaps the edges should represent the direction of the inequality. For example, if in a match, a is the winner, and s[i]=0 (lower-skilled wins), then a's p is less than b's p. So, we add an edge from a to b, meaning a < b.\n\nIf a is the winner and s[i]=1, then a's p is greater than b's p. So, add an edge from b to a, meaning b < a.\n\nYes, this makes sense.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Build the tournament tree, where each internal node represents a phase, with two children (the two teams that played in that phase).\n\n2. For each internal node, determine which child is the winner based on s[i].\n\n   a. If s[i] is '0', the lower-skilled team wins. So, the winner is the one with lower p.\n\n      i. Thus, the winner is either child A or B, whichever has lower p.\n\n      ii. So, we add an edge from the winner to the loser, meaning winner < loser.\n\n   b. If s[i] is '1', the higher-skilled team wins. So, the winner is the one with higher p.\n\n      i. Thus, the winner is either A or B, whichever has higher p.\n\n      ii. So, we add an edge from the loser to the winner, meaning loser < winner.\n\nBut wait, how do we know which is the winner in a match? Because it depends on the p values.\n\nThus, for each internal node, the winner is either A or B, and the constraint is that the winner's p is less than (s[i]=0) or greater than (s[i]=1) the loser's p.\n\nThus, for each internal node, we have to choose which child is the winner, and then create the appropriate edge.\n\nBut since this is a single permutation, the choice of which child is the winner is determined by the permutation p.\n\nThus, the problem is that for each internal node, we must have either A < B or B < A, based on the phase's rule, but the actual direction depends on the permutation.\n\nWait, no. For each internal node, the phase's rule s[i] dictates the condition for the winner, but the permutation p determines which of the two is the winner.\n\nThus, for each internal node, the constraint is that the winner's p is less than or greater than the loser's p, depending on s[i].\n\nBut the winner is the one that comes out of the match, which depends on p.\n\nThus, for each internal node, we can represent the constraint as:\n\n- If s[i] is '0', then the winner's p is less than the loser's p. So, if A is the winner, then A < B. If B is the winner, then B < A.\n\nBut this can be represented as A < B OR B < A, but that's not precise. Instead, it's that the winner is the one with lower p.\n\nThus, for each internal node, we have two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: A is the winner.\n\n   Then, A < B (if s[i] is 0) or A > B (if s[i] is 1).\n\nCase 2: B is the winner.\n\n   Then, B < A (if s[i] is 0) or B > A (if s[i] is 1).\n\nBut since the permutation is fixed, for each internal node, exactly one of these cases holds.\n\nBut in the context of the entire permutation, the constraints must be consistent across all internal nodes.\n\nThus, for each internal node, we have to choose whether A or B is the winner, and impose the corresponding constraint.\n\nBut how can we model this without knowing the permutation in advance?\n\nThis seems tricky. It suggests that the constraints are interdependent and that the problem can't be solved by a simple topological sort.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAlternative Idea: The permutation p must be such that for each internal node, the winner is as per s[i], which imposes a certain condition on the two children.\n\nThus, the permutation p must be a linear extension of the constraints imposed by the internal nodes.\n\nThus, the DAG is built by adding edges as per the constraints, and then x must be the maximum in the permutation, which implies that it must be a source in the DAG (no incoming edges).\n\nWait, no. Because x is the root, it must be the maximum in the DAG.\n\nWait, in the DAG, all edges point to x, indicating that x is greater than all others. But that's only the case if x is the maximum in the permutation.\n\nWait, but the DAG represents the constraints between teams. For x to be the maximum, all other teams must have edges pointing to x, indicating that they are less than x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the DAG is built as follows:\n\nFor each internal node, if s[i] is 0, the winner is the lower-skilled team. So, the winner must be less than the loser. Thus, we add an edge from the winner to the loser.\n\nIf s[i] is 1, the winner is the higher-skilled team. So, the winner must be greater than the loser. Thus, we add an edge from the loser to the winner.\n\nOnce all these edges are added, the permutation p must be a linear extension of this DAG, meaning that for every edge u→v, p[u] < p[v].\n\nAdditionally, the root of the tree (the champion) must be x, which means that x must be the maximum in the permutation, i.e., it must not have any incoming edges from the DAG.\n\nWait, no, because x is the root, it's the last node in the tree. All other nodes are descendants of x.\n\nWait, perhaps not. The root is the champion, so it's the last node in the tree. Thus, all other nodes are in the subtrees of the root.\n\nThus, the DAG would have x as a source node, with edges pointing to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all possible integers x that can be the champion of a knockout tournament given the results of each phase. The tournament structure is based on a binary tree where each node represents a match between two teams, and the outcome of each match depends on a given string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree where each internal node represents a match between two teams. Each match's outcome is determined by a given string `s`, which indicates whether the lower-skilled (0) or higher-skilled (1) team wins.\n2. **Graph Representation**: Convert the tournament into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where edges represent the constraints between teams based on the match outcomes. For each internal node:\n   - If `s[i]` is '0', the lower-skilled team wins, so an edge is added from the winner to the loser.\n   - If `s[i]` is '1', the higher-skilled team wins, so an edge is added from the loser to the winner.\n3. **Topological Sort**: Use a topological sort to determine if there exists a permutation of team skills that satisfies all constraints and results in x being the champion. The champion must be the maximum element in the permutation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Build the tournament tree\n    tree = [[] for _ in range(4 * (1 << n))]  # 4*n should be enough for n=18\n    for i in range(n):\n        phase = 1 << (n - i - 1)\n        for j in range(0, phase, 2):\n            left = j\n            right = j + 1\n            node = 1 << (n - i - 1) + i\n            tree[node] = [left, right]\n    \n    # Now, build the DAG\n    dag = [[] for _ in range(1 << n)]\n    visited = [False] * (1 << n)\n    \n    def dfs(u):\n        if visited[u]:\n            return\n        visited[u] = True\n        for v in tree[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                dfs(v)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        left, right = tree[1 << (n - i - 1)][0], tree[1 << (n - i - 1)][1]\n        phase = i\n        rule = s[i]\n        if rule == '0':\n            # winner is min of left and right\n            if left < right:\n                winner = left\n                loser = right\n            else:\n                winner = right\n                loser = left\n            dag[winner].append(loser)\n        else:\n            # winner is max of left and right\n            if left > right:\n                winner = left\n                loser = right\n            else:\n                winner = right\n                loser = left\n            dag[loser].append(winner)\n    \n    # Now, check for each x if it can be the root, i.e., no one points to it, and it's a source\n    # Also, it needs to be reachable from all nodes via the DAG\n    \n    # But wait, the root is the last node, but the DAG might have multiple sources.
