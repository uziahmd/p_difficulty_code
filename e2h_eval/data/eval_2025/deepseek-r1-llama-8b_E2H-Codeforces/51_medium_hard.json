Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if the pile of letters found in the morning can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly, without any extra letters left. So, essentially, the combined letters of the guest and host should exactly match the pile.\n\nHmm, right. So the approach here is to check if the total count of each letter in the guest and host names equals the count in the pile. If they do for all letters, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this. The steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines: guest, host, pile.\n2. Combine the guest and host into one string.\n3. Compare the frequency of each character in this combined string with the frequency in the pile.\n4. If all counts match, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, first, I need a way to count the frequency of each character. In Python, I can use the Counter class from the collections module. That's efficient and easy to use.\n\nBut wait, what if there are uppercase letters? Oh, the problem states that all letters are uppercase, so no case issues to worry about.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure.\n\n- Read guest, host, pile from input. Note that the input lines might have '\\n' at the end, but since we're using .strip(), maybe not. Or perhaps just split them as per the lines.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input, it's given as three lines. So, in the code, I can read the three lines by splitting the input into lines.\n\nLike:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nWait, but sometimes, when reading multiple lines, the standard input may have some leading or trailing newlines. So, using strip() would help to remove any such whitespace.\n\nOnce I have all three strings, I need to combine guest and host.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nThen, create a Counter for combined and for pile.\n\nfrom collections import Counter\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nThen, compare the two Counters. If they are equal, print YES, else NO.\n\nWait, yes. Because Counter will count each occurrence of each character. So, if the counts for all characters match between the combined guest+host and the pile, then it's possible to rearrange.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nif counter_combined == counter_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: One of the names is empty. But the problem says each line is not empty. So no, all lines have at least one character.\n\nCase 2: All letters are same. For example, guest is 'AA', host is 'AA', pile is 'AAAA' → should output YES.\n\nCase 3: The pile has more letters than needed. Like guest + host is 'AB', pile is 'AABBC'. Then counts don't match, so output NO.\n\nAnother test case: suppose guest is 'AB', host is 'CD', pile is 'ACBD' → should return YES.\n\nWait, let's see. Combined is 'ABCD', pile is 'ACBD' which is same as combined, so yes.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about if the guest or host has letters that aren't in the pile? Then the counters won't match.\n\nSo the approach should handle all cases.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nImport Counter from collections.\n\nRead the three lines.\n\nCombine guest and host.\n\nCheck if their Counter equals the pile's Counter.\n\nPrint accordingly.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWait, in Python, when reading from standard input, using input() will read each line including the newline. So for example, if the second line is 'DEDMOROZ\\n', then input().strip() will give 'DEDMOROZ'.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says the input consists of three lines, so each input() will include the newline? Or not? Wait, no. Because when you type input(), it reads until the newline and excludes the newline.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nIf the input is:\n\nabc\ndef\nghi\n\nThen, input().strip() for each would give 'abc', 'def', 'ghi'.\n\nSo, combining guest and host is correct.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines\nguest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhost = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\npile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Create counters\ncounter_g = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nif counter_g == counter_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the input lines have leading or trailing spaces? The problem statement says each line contains only uppercase letters and is not empty. So, no, the lines have no leading/trailing spaces, so strip() is not necessary, but using it won't hurt.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial and final newlines are part of the lines. But in practice, when using readline(), the trailing newline is stripped.\n\nWait, no. Because when you read a line using readline(), it includes the trailing newline. So, if the actual input lines are followed by a newline, the resulting string will have that.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: When you have a file with lines separated by newlines, each readline() returns the line including the '\\n' at the end. So, for example, if the first line is 'SANTACLAUS\\n', then guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip() would be 'SANTACLAUS' (without the newline). Similarly, for the second line, if it's 'DEDMOROZ\\n', then host is 'DEDMOROZ'.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: What if the pile is exactly the concatenation of guest and host, but in a different order. Since Counter is order-agnostic, that's fine.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, wait, the sample input isn't written as separate lines, but as a list. So in reality, the input lines are:\n\nFirst line: SANTACLAUS\nSecond line: DEDMOROZ\nThird line: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined guest and host: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\nWait, no. Guest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ. So combined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nWait, let's count the letters.\n\nGuest: S A N T A C L A U S → Wait, let me count the letters:\n\nS A N T A C L A U S → Let's see:\n\nLetters: S appears 3 times (positions 0, 8, 9?), Wait wait:\n\nWait, \"SANTACLAUS\" is S A N T A C L A U S → so S appears twice: positions 0 and last.\n\nWait, S A N T A C L A U S → S at start and end. So count of S: 2.\n\nSimilarly, A appears in positions 2, 5, 7: 3 times.\n\nN: once.\n\nT: once.\n\nC: once.\n\nL: once.\n\nU: once.\n\nSo guest has: S(2), A(3), N(1), T(1), C(1), L(1), U(1).\n\nHost is DEDMOROZ: D E D M O R O Z → letters:\n\nD: 2, E: 2, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nCombined guest+host:\n\nLetters:\n\nS: 2\nA: 3\nN: 1\nT:1\nC:1\nL:1\nU:1\nD:2\nE:2\nM:1\nO:2\nR:1\nZ:1.\n\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nWait, let me parse that. The pile is S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S.\n\nWait, perhaps better to count all letters in the pile.\n\nBut regardless, the code will correctly count each letter.\n\nIn the sample, the code would see that the combined guest+host has the same letters as the pile, so output YES.\n\nAnother sample: the second sample. The output is NO because the pile lacks a 'P' and has an extra 'L'.\n\nSo, the code should correctly identify that.\n\nThus, the approach seems solid.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that the combined letters of the guest and host should match the letters in the pile without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Frequencies:** Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Frequencies:** Check if the frequency counts of the combined names match exactly with the frequency counts of the pile. If they match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of character frequencies, which is necessary because the problem requires that no extra or missing letters are present.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines from input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Count the frequency of each character in the combined string and the pile\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\n# Check if the counters are equal\nif counter_combined == counter_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read as three separate lines, each representing the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated into one string to form the combined names.\n- **Frequency Counting:** Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** By comparing the two `Counter` objects, we determine if they contain exactly the same characters with the same frequencies. If they do, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names, and we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the problem constraints are met correctly.",
