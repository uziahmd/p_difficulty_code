    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Gluttony. The task is to construct an array b by permuting the elements of array a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S (with size k between 1 and n-1), the sum of elements in positions S of a and b are different. So, for any non-empty proper subset, the sum of elements in a's subset should not equal the sum in b's subset.\n\nHmm, that sounds tricky. I need to find a permutation of a such that all these subset sums are unique. If such a permutation doesn't exist, output -1.\n\nFirst, I think about what conditions make this possible. Since the subsets can be of any size from 1 to n-1, each subset's sum must be unique across both a and b. Wait, no, actually, the condition is that for each subset S, the sum in a's S and the sum in b's S are different. But wait, no—wait, the problem says: \"the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different.\" Wait, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, no. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the problem statement says: \"for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 < k < n) the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's that for each subset S, the sum of a's elements at those positions is different from the sum of b's elements at the same positions. So for example, if in a, the subset S has elements [a1, a3], then in b, the subset S must have a different sum.\n\nSo, for each S, sum_a(S) != sum_b(S).\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because for any permutation, the sum of a particular subset might change. For example, if in a, the subset S is {a1, a2}, and in b, these two elements are swapped, then the sum would remain the same. So that's a problem because the sum would be equal.\n\nTherefore, to satisfy the condition, the permutation must be such that for every non-empty subset S (size 1 to n-1), the sum of S in a and the sum of S in b are different.\n\nWait, but that's impossible if any subset S has a sum that is the same in a and its permuted version. So the permutation has to change the sum for every possible non-empty proper subset.\n\nBut how can that happen?\n\nLet me think about small cases.\n\nExample given: Input is 4 numbers [1000, 100, 10, 1]. The output is [100, 1, 1000, 10].\n\nWait, let's see. For each non-empty subset S of size 1 to 3:\n\nIn a (original array):\n\n- Subsets of size 1: 1000, 100, 10, 1.\n\nIn b, the array is [100,1,1000,10]. So the single elements are 100,1,1000,10. All different from a's single elements except for 100 and 1. Wait, no: a's single elements are 1000,100,10,1. B's are 100,1,1000,10. So for single-element subsets, the sums are 1000 vs 100, 100 vs 1, etc.—all different.\n\nWait, for single-element subsets, all sums in a are distinct, and in b they are also distinct, but does a and b have overlapping sums? For instance, a has 100, and b has 100 as well. So for the subset containing just the second element, a's sum is 100, and b's sum is 100. Oh, wait, that would violate the condition because they are equal.\n\nBut in the sample output, the second element is 1 in b, right? Wait, no, let me recheck.\n\nWait, the sample input is 1000, 100, 10, 1. The output is 100, 1, 1000, 10.\n\nWait, a is [1000, 100, 10, 1], and b is [100, 1, 1000, 10]. So for the subset S={2}, a's element is 100, b's is 1. So their sums are different.\n\nFor S={1}, a's sum is 1000, b's sum is 100. Different.\n\nFor S={3}, a is 10, b is 1000. Different.\n\nS={4}, a is 1, b is 10. Different.\n\nNow, for subsets of size 2:\n\nIn",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an array `b` by permuting the elements of array `a` such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the empty subset and the full subset), the sum of elements in `a` and `b` are different. If such an array `b` cannot be constructed, we should return `-1`.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to ensure that every possible non-empty proper subset of indices has a unique sum in both arrays `a` and `b`. This can be achieved by finding a permutation of `a` such that the sums of all subsets in `b` do not match those in `a`.\n\n1. **Check for Feasibility**: First, check if it's possible to construct such an array `b`. This can be determined by ensuring that no two elements in `a` have the same value because if they did, swapping them would not change the subset sums.\n\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Generate permutations of `a` and check each permutation to see if it satisfies the condition. However, generating all permutations is computationally expensive for larger `n`, so we need an optimized approach.\n\n3. **Optimized Check**: For each permutation, compute the subset sums and compare them with the corresponding sums in `a`. If any subset sum matches, discard that permutation and try the next one.\n\n4. **Output Result**: If a valid permutation is found, print it. Otherwise, print `-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    n_and_rest = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    n = n_and_rest[0]\n    a = n_and_rest[1:n+1]\n\n    # Check if all elements are distinct\n    if len(a) != len(set(a)):\n        print(-1)\n        return\n\n    # Try all possible permutations\n    for perm in permutations(a):\n        b = list(perm)\n        # Check for all non-empty proper subsets\n        valid = True\n        for mask in range(1, (1 << n) - 1):\n            s_a = 0\n            s_b = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if (mask >> i) & 1:\n                    s_a += a[i]\n                    s_b += b[i]\n            if s_a == s_b:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, b)))\n            return\n    print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the size `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Distinct Check**: We check if all elements in `a` are distinct. If not, it's impossible to construct `b`, so we print `-1`.\n3. **Permutation Check**: We generate all permutations of `a` and check each one to see if it meets the subset sum condition.\n4. **Subset Sum Comparison**: For each permutation, we compare the subset sums of `a` and `b` using bit masking to iterate over all possible non-empty proper subsets.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid permutation is found, it is printed. If none are valid after checking all permutations, `-1` is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check each permutation and validate it against the required conditions, providing the correct result or determining its impossibility.",
