His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasya's Olympiad results. The teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points in total from both tours. But the results are given for each participant in two separate lists—first tour points and second tour points. The order of these lists isn't aligned with the participants' names, which complicates things because we don't know which a_i corresponds to which b_j.\n\nThe task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved. \n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements:\n\n- Each participant has a sum s = a + b. The participants are ranked in descending order of their s. If two have the same s, the jury can arrange them in any order, so their ranks can vary.\n\nSo, the goal is to find, considering all possible valid pairings between a and b, what are the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can achieve, given that his a_i + b_j >= x.\n\nWait, but since the a and b arrays are given in arbitrary order, each a_i can be paired with any b_j, as long as each a and b is used exactly once. So it's a matter of permuting the b array such that each a is paired correctly.\n\nBut how do I model this? Because the pairing affects the sums, and thus the rankings.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to consider all possible permutations of the b array, pair each a_i with a b_j, compute the sum, then sort all these sums to determine the ranks.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, so 105! possible permutations is way too big. That's impossible to compute directly.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think differently. For each participant, their sum is a_p + b_q, where p and q are permutations such that each a is used exactly once and each b is used exactly once.\n\nBut how can I find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya without checking all permutations?\n\nAnother thought: For the best rank, Vasya wants as high a sum as possible, and as few others as possible have higher sums. To maximize his own sum, he should have the maximum possible a_i + b_j, but also, arrange others' sums such that as few as possible are higher than his.\n\nWait, but the pairing affects not only his sum but also the sums of others. So perhaps the optimal way is:\n\nFor the best possible rank, we want Vasya's sum to be as large as possible, and others' sums to be as small as possible. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for the best rank, Vasya's sum should be the maximum possible, given that it's >=x. And then, arrange other participants' sums such that as many as possible are less than or equal to his sum.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, his sum is as small as possible (but still >=x), and others' sums are arranged to be as large as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way. So the approach would be:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n   But wait, no. Because in reality, each a is paired with exactly one b, and each b is paired with exactly one a. So it's a bijection.\n\nWait, the problem states that Vasya is present in the Olympiad, so there exists some i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So we can always find a valid pairing.\n\nSo to model the problem, the steps might be:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\n- We want Vasya to have the highest possible sum. So we select the maximum possible sum for him, which would be the maximum a_i + b_j >=x. Then, for others, arrange their sums to be as low as possible, to minimize the number of people above him.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the best rank is determined by how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum.\n\nBecause if more participants have a sum > Vasya's, then his rank is worse. So to minimize that, we need to arrange that as few as possible participants have sums higher than his.\n\nSo for the best case:\n\n- Choose Vasya's sum as the maximum possible, which is the maximum a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nThen, for all other participants, assign their a and b in a way that their sums are as small as possible, but ensuring that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nWait, but how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best rank is the position when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and all other participants have sums <= his. So the rank is 1.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if his sum is the maximum.\n\nWait, the note in the example says that when all participants have the same sum, Vasya can be first or last. So in that case, the best is 1, worst is 5.\n\nSo, for the best possible scenario, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others' sums are arranged such that they are as low as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\n- Assign to Vasya the maximum possible a_i + b_j, such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n- Then, for the remaining a's and b's, pair them in such a way that the sum of each pair is as small as possible, but ensuring that each a and b is used once.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for the best rank, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is achieved when he takes the largest a and the largest b, but only if their sum is >=x. Otherwise, perhaps a smaller a and a larger b, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to find the best possible rank is:\n\nCompute all possible a_i + b_j that are >=x, and choose the maximum among them. Then, for the best rank, Vasya's sum is that maximum, and all others have sums <= that maximum.\n\nWait, but the others' sums can be anything, but their arrangement depends on how a and b are paired.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Because, for instance, if Vasya takes a certain a_i and b_j, then other a's and b's are left, and their pairing can influence others' sums.\n\nWait, perhaps for the best case, the best possible rank is 1, achieved when Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. How to compute that maximum?\n\nWait, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j, for all i,j, but subject to the condition that after selecting a_i and b_j, the remaining a's and b's can be paired in a way that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\nTo find the best possible rank, we need to maximize Vasya's sum, given that it's >=x, and then arrange the other participants' sums to be as low as possible, so that as few as possible are higher than Vasya's.\n\nSo for best rank:\n\nFind the maximum possible sum s_v that can be achieved by any a_i + b_j, such that s_v >=x. Then, the best possible rank is 1, provided that after pairing the remaining a's and b's, none of their sums exceed s_v.\n\nWait, but can that always be done?\n\nNot necessarily. Because, suppose there's another a_k and b_l such that a_k + b_l > s_v. Then, even if Vasya has s_v, someone else may have a higher sum, making Vasya's best rank higher.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to ensure that Vasya's sum is the maximum is to have all other a's and b's paired in such a way that their sums are <= s_v.\n\nHow?\n\nWell, perhaps by pairing the largest remaining a with the smallest remaining b, so that their sum is as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, to arrange that the other pairs' sums are as small as possible.\n\nWait, but how to compute that.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nMaybe an alternative approach is to find the minimal number of participants who have a sum greater than Vasya's maximum possible sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank is 1 if and only if the maximum possible sum for Vasya is such that all other a_i + b_j <= s_v. Otherwise, there will be someone with a higher sum.\n\nWait, but how to compute the maximum possible sum for Vasya.\n\nLet me think about the process:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe can choose any a_i and b_j, provided that a_i + b_j >=x, and then pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that the sum of each pair is as small as possible.\n\nThe best possible rank is 1 if, after pairing, all other participants have sum <= s_v.\n\nOtherwise, the rank is higher.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Try all possible a_i and b_j pairs, compute s_v = a_i + b_j, which must be >=x.\n\n2. For each such s_v, check whether it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's such that all other participants have sum <= s_v.\n\n3. Among all such possible s_v's, the maximum possible s_v gives the best rank (which could be 1).\n\nIf no such s_v exists, then perhaps the best rank is 2, etc.\n\nWait, but trying all possible a_i and b_j is feasible for n=105, since n is small.\n\nWait, n is up to 105, so 105*105=11,025 possibilities for a_i and b_j. For each possibility, we need to see if the remaining can be paired.\n\nBut for each possibility, we need to check if the remaining a's and b's can be paired in a way that all sums are <= s_v.\n\nHow to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible s_v is the maximum of all possible a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nOnce we have that, we can then check whether the remaining a's and b's can be paired such that all their sums are <= s_v.\n\nIf yes, then the best rank is 1.\n\nElse, it's possible that someone else has a higher sum, so the best rank is higher.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum s_v is fixed, and regardless of how the remaining are paired, some of them could have higher sums.\n\nSo, to compute whether it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that all their sums are <= s_v.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nPerhaps, for each possible a_i and b_j (as Vasya's pair), we need to:\n\n- Check if the sum a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n- Then, take the remaining a's and b's, and see if it's possible to pair them into n-1 pairs, each with sum <= s_v.\n\nIf yes, then the best rank is 1.\n\nOtherwise, try next possible a_i and b_j.\n\nSo, the algorithm would proceed as follows:\n\nFor each possible a_i and b_j (i.e., for each possible pair of indices (i, j)):\n\n- Compute s_v = a[i] + b[j].\n\n- Check if s_v >=x.\n\n- Then, create a list of the remaining a's and b's (excluding a[i] and b[j]).\n\n- Now, we need to pair the remaining a's with the remaining b's, each a with one b, such that all a + b <= s_v.\n\nIs it possible to do so?\n\nIf yes, then the best possible rank is 1.\n\nElse, try the next pair.\n\nIf for any pair (i,j), the above condition holds, then the best possible rank is 1.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to see whether it's possible to have a best rank of 2, etc.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of finding the best possible rank, the first thing is to find if it's possible for Vasya to have the maximum sum, which would give him rank 1.\n\nIf not, then perhaps he can have the next possible maximum sum, but that's getting complicated.\n\nBut maybe the initial approach is to find the maximum possible s_v that can be achieved by any (i,j) pair, such that s_v >=x, and then see if the remaining can be paired to have sums <= s_v.\n\nIf that's possible, then the best rank is 1.\n\nElse, perhaps the best possible rank is 2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is 1 only if s_v is the maximum possible, and the remaining can be arranged.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (i,j), compute s_v = a[i] + b[j], where s_v >=x.\n\n2. Among these, find the maximum possible s_v_max.\n\n3. Now, check whether it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's such that all their sums are <= s_v_max.\n\nIf yes, then the best rank is 1.\n\nIf no, then the best rank is higher.\n\nWait, but how to check step 3.\n\nSo, for step 3:\n\nWe have the remaining a's (all a's except a[i]), and remaining b's (all b's except b[j]).\n\nWe need to pair each a in A_remaining with a b in B_remaining such that a + b <= s_v_max.\n\nMoreover, each a and b must be used exactly once.\n\nSo, this is a bipartite matching problem, but it's more of a decision problem: can we match the a's and b's in such a way that all a + b <= s_v_max.\n\nHow to check this.\n\nAn efficient way is needed.\n\nIdea: Sort the a_remaining in ascending order and b_remaining in descending order, then pair them.\n\nBecause the smallest a should be paired with the largest possible b that doesn't make a + b > s_v_max.\n\nWait, but perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, to maximize the number of pairs that satisfy a + b <= s_v_max, we can sort the a's in ascending order and the b's in descending order, then pair them in order. If this works, then all pairs will satisfy a + b <= s_v_max.\n\nBecause for each a in A_remaining sorted ascendingly, the corresponding b is as large as possible, which allows us to cover as many a's as possible.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nSort A_remaining in non-decreasing order.\n\nSort B_remaining in non-increasing order.\n\nPair them in order, i.e., A[0] with B[0], A[1] with B[1], etc.\n\nCheck if for all pairs, A[k] + B[k] <= s_v_max.\n\nIf yes, then it's possible.\n\nElse, no.\n\nSo, in code, for a given A_remaining and B_remaining, and s_v_max, the function would be:\n\ndef can_pair(a_list, b_list, max_sum):\n    a_sorted = sorted(a_list)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b_list, reverse=True)\n    for a, b in zip(a_sorted, b_sorted):\n        if a + b > max_sum:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the plan for the best possible rank is:\n\nLoop through all possible a_i and b_j:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j: continue  # Not sure if necessary, but perhaps.\n        s_v = a[i] + b[j]\n        if s_v < x:\n            continue\n        # Now, check if the remaining can be paired with sums <= s_v.\n        # Create a list of a's excluding a[i], and b's excluding b[j].\n        a_remaining = a[:i] + a[i+1:]\n        b_remaining = b[:j] + b[j+1:]\n        # Also, since the a and b are in arbitrary order, we need to consider all possible pairings except for the current i,j.\n        # Wait, no. Because the a and b lists are given, but in arbitrary order. So when we pick a particular a_i and b_j, the remaining a's and b's are the ones not in those positions.\n        # Or wait, perhaps the a and b are given in the input as two separate lists, but the actual pairing between them is unknown. So, when choosing a_i and b_j as Vasya's pair, the remaining a's are all a's except a_i, and the remaining b's are all b's except b_j.\n\nWait, no. Because the a and b lists are given, but the pairing is arbitrary. So, when choosing a_i as Vasya's a, and b_j as his b, the remaining a's are the rest of the a's, and the remaining b's are the rest of the b's.\n\nSo, yes, the code for creating a_remaining and b_remaining would be as follows.\n\nThen, check if the can_pair function returns True.\n\nIf yes, then the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, the first time we find such a pair (i,j), we can immediately return 1 as the best rank.\n\nWait, but perhaps there are multiple pairs that allow Vasya to have sum s_v_max.\n\nWait, no. Because s_v_max is the maximum possible sum, so for any other pair, the sum would be less than or equal to s_v_max.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the maximum possible s_v.\n\nThen, for that s_v, check if the remaining can be paired.\n\nIf yes, then the best possible rank is 1.\n\nElse, perhaps it's not possible, and Vasya's rank is higher.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another pair (k,l) with sum s_v = s_v_max, and the remaining can be paired.\n\nIn that case, it's possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is:\n\nFind all pairs (i,j) such that a[i]+b[j] is as large as possible (>=x), and among those, check if any can be used as Vasya's pair, and the remaining can be paired with sums <= s_v.\n\nIf any such pair exists, the best rank is 1.\n\nElse, we need to look for the next possible s_v.\n\nBut this could get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to find the maximum possible s_v that can be achieved, and then see if it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's such that all their sums are <= s_v.\n\nIf yes, then the best rank is 1.\n\nElse, the best rank is 2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but how to find the maximum possible s_v.\n\nThe maximum possible s_v is the maximum of a_i + b_j for all i, j.\n\nBut wait, the a and b are in arbitrary order, but when you pair them, it's a bijection.\n\nSo, the maximum sum for Vasya is the maximum of all possible a_i + b_j.\n\nBecause in that case, he can have that sum, and others can be arranged to have lower sums.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily possible because pairing a_i and b_j may leave others with a's and b's that can form higher sums.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut perhaps, for the best possible scenario, the best rank is 1 if the maximum possible s_v is achievable, and the remaining can be arranged to have sums <= s_v.\n\nElse, the best possible rank is higher.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the maximum possible s_v across all a_i + b_j.\n\n   For all i, j, compute a[i] + b[j], and find the maximum s_v_max that is >=x.\n\n2. For that s_v_max, check if it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's such that all sums are <= s_v_max.\n\n   If yes, then the best rank is 1.\n\n   Else, proceed.\n\n3. Else, perhaps the best rank is 2, etc.\n\nWait, but what if s_v_max is not achievable because after choosing a_i and b_j, the remaining can't be paired.\n\nThen, perhaps the next step is to find the next maximum s_v that can be achieved, and repeat the process.\n\nBut this could be time-consuming.\n\nWait, but for the purposes of programming competition, perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nFind all possible a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nFor each possible s_v in descending order:\n\n   For each possible (i,j) pair where a[i] + b[j] = s_v:\n\n      Check if the remaining a's and b's can be paired such that all sums <= s_v.\n\n      If yes, then the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, in code, the steps would be:\n\nmax_s_possible = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if a[i] + b[j] >= x:\n            current_sum = a[i] + b[j]\n            if current_sum > max_s_possible:\n                max_s_possible = current_sum\n\nif max_s_possible ==0:\n    # No possible solution, but the problem says Vasya exists.\n\nThen, for all possible (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] = max_s_possible:\n\n   Check if the remaining can be paired.\n\n   If any such (i,j) leads to a successful pairing, then the best rank is 1.\n\nElse, proceed to find the next possible s_v.\n\nBut how to find the next possible s_v.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to find the maximum s_v, and if it's possible to pair, then best rank is 1.\n\nElse, perhaps the best rank is higher.\n\nBut in practice, for the problem, perhaps the best rank is 1 if the maximum s_v can be achieved, else it's 2, but that's not necessarily correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the best rank is 1 only if the maximum s_v is possible and the remaining can be paired.\n\nOtherwise, the best possible rank is the number of participants whose sum is greater than the maximum s_v.\n\nWait, but no. Because the maximum s_v could be higher than some other possible pairings, but if the remaining can't be paired, then perhaps other participants can have higher sums.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative idea: for the best possible rank, it's 1 if it's possible for Vasya to have the maximum sum, and for all others, their sums are <= his.\n\nSo, to compute this, we can proceed as follows:\n\nCompute all possible a_i + b_j as possible s_v.\n\nFind the maximum s_v among those >=x.\n\nThen, for each possible (i,j) that gives this s_v, check if the remaining can be paired with sums <=s_v.\n\nIf any such (i,j) exists, then the best rank is 1.\n\nElse, the best rank is higher.\n\nWait, but perhaps even if s_v_max is not possible, there's another s_v that is less than s_v_max, but allows for a better pairing.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the maximum s_v that can be achieved, and then see if it's possible to pair the remaining.\n\nIf yes, then the best rank is 1.\n\nElse, perhaps the best possible rank is 2, but how to compute that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the best possible rank is 1 only if the maximum s_v can be achieved and the remaining can be paired.\n\nOtherwise, the best possible rank is the minimal k such that there are k participants (including Vasya) with sum >=x, and all others have sum <x.\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by how many participants can have a sum greater than or equal to Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, but again, without knowing the pairing, it's hard to tell.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think of this problem as two separate parts: best rank and worst rank.\n\nLet me tackle the worst rank first.\n\nWorst possible rank:\n\nWe want Vasya's sum to be as small as possible (but >=x), and as many other participants as possible have sums higher than his.\n\nSo, for the worst rank, we need to find the minimal possible s_v >=x, and then arrange the other participants' sums to be as large as possible.\n\nThus, the worst rank is the number of participants whose sum is > s_v plus one (since Vasya is included).\n\nSo, to find the worst rank:\n\nFind the minimal s_v >=x that can be formed by any a_i + b_j.\n\nThen, for that s_v, check if it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's such that as many as possible have sums > s_v.\n\nWait, but how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, for the worst rank, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and all other participants have sum > s_v.\n\nIn that case, his rank would be (number of participants with sum > s_v) + 1.\n\nBut how to find such s_v.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to think about the worst case as:\n\nVasya's sum is the minimal possible s >=x, and all other participants' sums are > s.\n\nSo, for the worst rank:\n\nFind the minimal s_v >=x, such that it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's to have all their sums > s_v.\n\nIf such an s_v exists, then the worst rank is the number of participants (n) minus the number of participants with sum <= s_v, which includes Vasya.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum possible number of participants who have a sum > s_v.\n\nSo, to compute that, for the worst case, we want s_v to be as small as possible, and others to have as large as possible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFind the minimal possible s_v >=x, that can be achieved by any a_i + b_j.\n\nThen, check if it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's in such a way that all their sums are > s_v.\n\nIf yes, then the worst rank is (n - number of a's and b's that sum to <= s_v) + 1.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case.\n\nSo, for the worst case, the approach is:\n\n1. Find the minimal s_v that can be achieved by any a_i + b_j, such that s_v >=x.\n\n2. For this s_v, check if it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's such that all their sums are > s_v.\n\n   If yes, then the worst rank is (number of participants with sum > s_v) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst rank is determined by the maximum possible number of participants who can have a sum greater than s_v.\n\nSo, for the worst case:\n\nFind the minimal s_v >=x that can be achieved.\n\nThen, for the remaining a's and b's, can we pair them such that their sums are all > s_v.\n\nIf yes, then the worst rank is (number of participants with sum > s_v) + 1.\n\nElse, perhaps the worst rank is higher.\n\nWait, but perhaps the worst possible rank is n, when all others have higher sums.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, it's not possible for all others to have higher sums.\n\nSo, perhaps the worst rank is the maximum possible number of participants (including Vasya) who have a sum > s_v.\n\nWait, but how to find s_v and the pairing.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nPerhaps for the worst case, the minimal s_v is the minimal possible, and the remaining can be paired to have as many sums > s_v as possible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible s_v >=x.\n\n   This is the minimal a_i + b_j across all i,j, but a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n2. For this s_v, check if it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's such that all their sums are > s_v.\n\n   If yes, then the worst rank is (number of participants with sum > s_v) + 1.\n\n   Else, perhaps the worst rank is higher.\n\nWait, but how to compute whether it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's to have all sums > s_v.\n\nThis is similar to the earlier problem.\n\nAgain, for the remaining a's and b's, can we pair them such that all a + b > s_v.\n\nTo check this, perhaps we can sort the a's in ascending order and the b's in ascending order, then pair the smallest a with the largest b, next a with next largest b, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because if a is small and b is large, their sum may be > s_v.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to maximize the number of pairs with a + b > s_v is to pair the largest a's with the smallest b's, and vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to do it is:\n\nSort a_remaining in ascending order.\n\nSort b_remaining in ascending order.\n\nPair a[0] with b[-1], a[1] with b[-2], etc.\n\nIf all a + b > s_v, then it's possible.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\nSort a_remaining in ascending order.\n\nSort b_remaining in ascending order.\n\nThen, pair a[i] with b[n-1 -i], for i from 0 to len(a_remaining)-1.\n\nCheck if all a[i] + b[j] > s_v.\n\nIf yes, then it's possible.\n\nElse, no.\n\nSo, the function would be:\n\ndef can_pair_high(a_list, b_list, min_sum):\n    a_sorted = sorted(a_list)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b_list)\n    # Pair a[0] with b[-1], a[1] with b[-2], etc.\n    for i in range(len(a_sorted)):\n        a = a_sorted[i]\n        b = b_sorted[len(b_sorted) - 1 - i]\n        if a + b <= min_sum:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nThis way, we're trying to pair the smallest a with the largest b, which gives the maximum possible sum for that a. If even then the sum is <= min_sum, then it's impossible.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSo, the plan for the worst possible rank is:\n\nFind the minimal possible s_v >=x.\n\nFor each possible (i,j) pair where a[i] + b[j] = s_v:\n\n   Check if the remaining can be paired such that all a + b > s_v.\n\n   If yes, then the worst rank is the number of participants (including Vasya) whose sum is > s_v.\n\nBut wait, including Vasya, because his sum is s_v.\n\nSo, the worst rank is the count of participants whose sum > s_v plus 1 (since Vasya is part of that count).\n\nWait, no. Because Vasya's sum is s_v, and others have sums > s_v. So the total number of participants with sum > s_v is the count of others, and Vasya's rank is count_others + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each (i,j) pair where a[i] + b[j] = s_v:\n\n   Check if the remaining can be paired such that all their sums > s_v.\n\n   If yes, then the worst rank is the number of such participants.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nFind the minimal s_v >=x.\n\nFor each (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] = s_v:\n\n   create a_remaining = a without a[i]\n\n   create b_remaining = b without b[j]\n\n   sort a_remaining in ascending order.\n\n   sort b_remaining in ascending order.\n\n   pair a[0] with b[-1], a[1] with b[-2], etc.\n\n   if all a + b > s_v:\n\n       then the worst rank is (count_others + 1), where count_others is the number of participants with sum > s_v.\n\nBut how to compute count_others.\n\nWait, count_others is the number of participants whose sum is > s_v.\n\nWhich includes all participants except Vasya, and all others in their pairs.\n\nBut in this case, for the worst case, all other participants have sum > s_v.\n\nSo, the worst rank is the number of such participants + 1.\n\nWait, but how to find the count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the worst case, the number of participants with sum > s_v is (n-1), so the worst rank is n.\n\nBut that's only if all others have higher sums.\n\nSo, in code, for each possible (i,j) pair that achieves s_v:\n\n   Check if the remaining can be paired to have sums > s_v.\n\n   If yes, then the worst rank is (n - 1) + 1 = n.\n\nWait, no. Because the count_others is (n-1), since Vasya is one participant, and the others are (n-1). If all others have sum > s_v, then count_others is (n-1), and the worst rank is (n-1) + 1 = n.\n\nBut that's only if all others have sum > s_v.\n\nSo, in code, for each (i,j) pair:\n\n   a_remaining = a without a[i]\n\n   b_remaining = b without b[j]\n\n   sort a_remaining in ascending order.\n\n   sort b_remaining in ascending order.\n\n   pair a[k] with b[n_remaining-1 -k] for each k.\n\n   for each pair, check if a[k] + b[j] > s_v.\n\n   if all pairs are > s_v, then worst_rank_candidate = (number of participants with sum > s_v) + 1.\n\nBut in this case, the number is (number of other participants) + 1 (Vasya), but no—because Vasya's sum is s_v, and others are > s_v.\n\nSo, the total participants with sum > s_v is (n-1), and Vasya is in position n.\n\nWait, no. Because the participants are ordered by their sum in descending order. So, if all others have sum > s_v, then Vasya is the last participant, so his rank is n.\n\nSo, the worst rank is n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each (i,j):\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] == s_v_min:\n\n      create a_remaining and b_remaining.\n\n      sort a_remaining in ascending, b_remaining in ascending.\n\n      pair a[k] with b_remaining[-(k+1)].\n\n      for each pair:\n\n          if a[k] + b_remaining[p] <= s_v_min:\n\n              break.\n\n      else:\n\n          # All pairs are > s_v_min.\n\n          worst_rank = n.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is n.\n\nElse, continue.\n\nIf none of the (i,j) pairs can achieve this, then perhaps the worst rank is higher.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's not possible for all others to have sums > s_v.\n\nIn that case, the worst rank is the maximum number of participants (excluding Vasya) that can have sum > s_v.\n\nSo, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum possible number of participants (excluding Vasya) that can have sum > s_v.\n\nPlus 1, because Vasya is included.\n\nSo, the approach for the worst rank is:\n\nFind the minimal s_v >=x.\n\nFor each (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] = s_v:\n\n   create a_remaining and b_remaining.\n\n   sort a_remaining in ascending.\n\n   sort b_remaining in ascending.\n\n   pair a[k] with b_remaining[-(k+1)].\n\n   count how many pairs have a + b > s_v.\n\n   keep track of the maximum count across all (i,j) pairs.\n\nThen, the worst rank is (max_count) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal s_v is found.\n\nThen, for each (i,j) that forms s_v, check if the remaining can be paired to have as many pairs as possible with a + b > s_v.\n\nThe maximum such count across all (i,j) pairs is the maximum possible number of participants (excluding Vasya) with sum > s_v.\n\nSo, the worst rank is (max_count + 1).\n\nWait, but perhaps it's possible that in some (i,j) pairs, the remaining can be paired to have more than others.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal s_v >=x.\n\n2. For each (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] = s_v:\n\n   a. create a_remaining and b_remaining.\n\n   b. sort a_remaining in ascending order.\n\n   c. sort b_remaining in ascending order.\n\n   d. pair a[k] with b_remaining[-(k+1)] for each k.\n\n   e. for each pair, if a + b > s_v, increment count.\n\n   f. record the maximum count.\n\n3. The worst rank is (max_count + 1).\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nAll a and b are 1, so all sums are 2.\n\nSo, s_v_min is 2.\n\nThen, for any (i,j), the remaining can be paired, and in the worst case, all other participants have sum 2, which is equal to s_v.\n\nSo, in this case, the worst rank is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, in this case, the function would return 5.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose n=2.\n\na = [3, 1]\n\nb = [2, 4]\n\nx=4.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n3+2=5 >=4.\n\n3+4=7 >=4.\n\n1+2=3 <4.\n\n1+4=5 >=4.\n\ns_v_min is 5.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, the minimal s_v >=x is 5.\n\nNow, for each (i,j) pair where a[i]+b[j] =5.\n\nThese are (0,0):3+2=5, (1,1",
