A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends wanting to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some amount of drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make, given the constraints on the available resources.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. All positive integers, not exceeding 1000.\n\nWait, what do these variables represent?\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles of drink. Each bottle has l milliliters.\nSo total drink is k * l ml.\n\nc: number of limes. Each lime is cut into d slices. So total slices are c * d.\n\np: grams of salt available.\n\nEach toast requires:\n- nl milliliters per friend. So for one toast, all n friends need n * nl ml in total.\nWait, no. Wait, each friend needs nl ml for a toast. So per toast round, total drink used is n * nl ml.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, you need n slices.\n\nAnd each toast also requires np grams of salt per friend. So per toast, total salt used is n * np grams.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of toasts T such that:\n\n1. The total drink is enough: T * (n * nl) ≤ (k * l)\n2. The total lime slices are enough: T * n ≤ (c * d)\n3. The total salt is enough: T * (n * np) ≤ p\n\nThen, T is the minimum of those three values divided by 1 (since T is the same for each constraint). Because for each resource, the maximum possible T based on that resource is (available / required per toast), and we take the smallest among those.\n\nWait, let me think again. For each resource:\n\n- Drink: total_drink = k * l\nEach toast uses n * nl. So max_T_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\nBut wait, if it's not divisible, then we have to floor it because you can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\nSame for other resources.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the maximum possible T based on each resource, then take the minimum of those Ts.\n\nSo:\n\nmax_toasts_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nmax_toasts_lime = (c * d) // n\nmax_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen, T = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nLet's test this with the example provided.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCompute each resource:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20ml. Each toast uses 3 friends * 3ml =9ml. 20/9 is 2.222..., so 2 toasts.\n\nLime: 10 limes, each 8 slices → 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices → 80/3=26.666, so 26? Wait, but 26 toasts would need 78 slices, which is less than 80. So 26? But sample output says 6 toasts. Wait, wait no, in the note, the sample says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts, but the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Oh right, because each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast.\n\nWait, so in the sample, n=3, so each toast needs 3 slices. So 80 slices allow for 80/3=26.666 → 26 toasts. But wait, the note says the drink allows 6 toasts. Then why does the answer say 2?\n\nAh, because the salt is the limiting factor. In the note, the salt allows 100/(1 *3)=33 toasts. So the minimum of 6, 26, 33 is 6, but then each friend can make 6 /3 = 2 toasts.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial calculation for the sample is:\n\nThey have 20ml of drink. Each toast for all 3 friends uses 3 *3 =9ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222... → 2 full toasts.\n\nThey have 80 slices. Each toast uses 3 slices → 80 /3 =26.666 → 26 toasts.\n\nSalt is 100g. Each toast uses 3 *1=3g → 100 /3 =33.333 →33 toasts.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts is the minimum of 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Requirements**: Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - One lime slice per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - Total drink available is `k * l` milliliters.\n   - Total lime slices available is `c * d`.\n   - Total salt available is `p` grams.\n\n3. **Determine Constraints**:\n   - The maximum number of toasts based on drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - The maximum number of toasts based on lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - The maximum number of toasts based on salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Compute the Result**: The actual number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the three values calculated above divided by the number of friends `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    n = data[0]\n    k = data[1]\n    l = data[2]\n    c = data[3]\n    d = data[4]\n    p = data[5]\n    nl = data[6]\n    np = data[7]\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    # Calculate maximum possible toasts based on each resource\n    max_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    max_toasts_lime = total_lime // n\n    max_toasts_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n    \n    # Find the minimum of these to determine the maximum toasts\n    max_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n    \n    print(str(max_toasts))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution reads the input values and calculates the total resources available. It then determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on each resource constraint. The minimum value among these constraints is taken to ensure that all friends can toast the same number of times without running out of any resource prematurely. This approach efficiently computes the result using integer division to handle cases where resources might not perfectly divide into the required amounts for each toast.",
