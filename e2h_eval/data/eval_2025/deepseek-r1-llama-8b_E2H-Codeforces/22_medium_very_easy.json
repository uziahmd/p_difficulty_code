After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best in that particular subject. Being the best means no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, the input is n students and m subjects. Each student's marks are given as a string of m characters. For each subject, we need to find which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in any subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to process each subject across all students. For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if in any subject j, their mark equals the maximum of that subject.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Read the input: n and m, followed by n strings each of length m.\n2. For each of the m subjects, determine the maximum mark among all students.\n3. For each student, check if they have a mark equal to any of the max marks of their respective subjects.\n4. Count the number of such students.\n\nWait, but for each subject, we need to know the maximum. So let's create an array or list where each index represents a subject, and the value is the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFor example, for subject 0, look at all students' first character, find the max, then store it. Similarly for subject 1, etc.\n\nOnce we have the max for each subject, for each student, we can compare their marks against these maxes. If in any subject their mark matches the max, they are successful.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read each student's string into a list of strings.\n- For each subject j from 0 to m-1:\n   - Find the maximum mark in that subject across all students.\n- Create a list of these max marks.\n- Then, for each student, iterate through each subject j:\n   - If their mark in j is equal to max_marks[j], increment the count.\n- Finally, output the count.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nNow, considering the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nEach student's marks are:\nStudent 1: '223' → [2,2,3]\nStudent 2: '232' → [2,3,2]\nStudent 3: '112' → [1,1,2]\n\nFor each subject:\nSubject 0: the marks are 2,2,1. Max is 2.\nSubject 1: 2,3,1. Max is 3.\nSubject 2: 3,2,2. Max is 3.\n\nSo the max_marks are [2,3,3].\n\nNow, check each student:\nStudent 1: Check each subject:\n- Subject 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So he is successful.\n- Even if others, he already qualifies. So count him.\nStudent 2: Subject 1: 3 ==3 → yes. Successful.\nStudent 3: All his marks are less than the max in each subject. So not successful.\nTotal count is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\nSecond test case:\n3 5\n91728\n11828\n11111\n\nWait, the input is given as two lines, but in the example, it's shown as a list with two elements. Oh wait, the first line is n and m, then next n lines describe each student. So for the second sample, the students are:\n\nStudent 1: 9 1 7 2 8\nStudent 2: 1 1 8 2 8\nStudent 3: 1 1 1 1 1\n\nMax for each subject:\n\nSubject 0: 9,1,1 → max 9\nSubject 1:1,1,1 → max 1\nSubject 2:7,8,1 → max 8\nSubject 3:2,2,1 → max 2\nSubject4:8,8,1 → max8\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent1: Check each subject:\nsubject0:9 ==9 → yes. So he is successful.\nOthers don't matter.\n\nStudent2: subject1:1 ==1 → yes.\nAlso, subject2:8 ==8 → yes. So he qualifies.\n\nStudent3: none of his subjects are the max. So only 2 students? Wait, the sample output says 3.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, sample output says ['2', '3'] but the actual output is two numbers: first sample's output is 2 and second sample's output is 3.\n\nWait the sample input shows two test cases? Or perhaps the way the input is presented is different.\n\nWait, looking back: The input is given as a list with two strings. Wait, the first line is '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', which is one line with n=3 and m=3, followed by three lines of students. Then another line with '3 5\\n...', which would mean the second test case. So the output is two numbers: 2 and 3.\n\nWait, so for the second test case, all three students are successful.\n\nHow?\n\nLet me re-calculate the max for each subject:\n\nStudent1: 9 1 7 2 8\nStudent2: 1 1 8 2 8\nStudent3: 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSubjects:\n\nSubject0: max is 9 (student1)\nSubject1: max is 1 (all have 1)\nSubject2: max is 8 (students 1 and 2 have 7 and 8)\nSubject3: max is 2\nSubject4: max is 8 (both students 1 and 2 have 8)\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent1: in subject0, his mark is 9 which is max. So yes.\nStudent2: in subject1, his mark is 1 which is max. Also, in subject2 and 4, he has 8 which is max. So he qualifies.\nStudent3: in subject1, mark is 1, which is the max. So he qualifies.\n\nAh, because for subject1, the max is 1. So all students have 1 in subject1 except the first student who has 1 as well. So student3's mark is 1, same as max. So he is successful.\n\nSo all three students are successful, hence output is 3.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nSteps:\n\nRead n and m from input. Wait, the input is given as a single string, but split into lines. So for the sample input, the first line is \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\", but that's actually the first line containing n, m, followed by n lines of marks.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the sample input, it's written as a list of strings:\n\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nBut in reality, the input will be a single string, with newlines separating the data. So when processing, we can split the input into lines.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin, perhaps using sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nSo step 1: Read all lines.\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, the first line is the first element, which contains n and m.\n\nn, m = map(int, lines[0].split())\n\nThen, the next n lines are the students' marks.\n\nstudents = []\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    s = lines[i]\n    students.append(s)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, it's given as two lines, but perhaps in actual, it's one line with multiple parts. Wait, no. The input is given as two separate lines, but perhaps in the problem statement, the input is a single line with n and m, followed by n lines, each being m digits.\n\nWait, the first line is n and m, then n lines each with m characters.\n\nSo for the sample input, the first line is '3 3', then three lines.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\nn_m_line = lines[0]\nn, m = map(int, n_m_line.split())\nstudents = []\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    students.append(lines[i])\n\nWait, but sometimes, the lines after might have leading or trailing spaces, but in the problem statement, each line is exactly m characters, no spaces.\n\nSo for each student's line, it's a string of length m.\n\nThen, for each subject j from 0 to m-1:\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        mark = int(students[i][j])\n        if mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = mark\n    max_marks[j] = max_mark\n\nOnce we have the max_marks list, for each student, check if any of their j-th marks equals max_marks[j].\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    student_marks = [int(c) for c in students[i]]\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student_marks[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nWait, let's test it against the sample.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nstudents = ['223', '232', '112']\n\nmax_marks for each j:\n\nj=0: 2,2,1 → max 2\nj=1: 2,3,1 → max3\nj=2:3,2,2 → max3\n\nso max_marks = [2,3,3]\n\neach student:\n\nStudent 0: '223' → [2,2,3]\nCheck j=0: 2 ==2 → yes. count is 1.\n\nStudent1: '232' → [2,3,2]\nj=0: 2 !=2? No, it's equal → yes. Or wait, 2 ==2 → yes. So count becomes 2.\n\nWait, no, student1's j=0 is 2, which is equal to max 2. So yes, he is counted. But according to the note, student1 is best at subjects 1 and 3, but in the code, he is counted because he has j=0 as max.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no. In the problem statement, for each subject j, the max is determined. So for j=0, the max is 2. So any student who has 2 in j=0 is a best in that subject.\n\nSo for student1, their j=0 is 2, which is the max. So he is best in subject 0.\n\nSo in the code, the count correctly includes him.\n\nWait, but according to the sample explanation, student1 is the best in subjects 1 and 3, but according to our code, he is also the best in subject 0. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nSo students:\n\nStudent1: 2,2,3\n\nStudent2: 2,3,2\n\nStudent3:1,1,2\n\nMax marks:\n\nj=0: 2 (students 0 and 1 have 2)\nj=1:3 (student1)\nj=2:3 (students0 and 1 have 3)\n\nSo student1 is the best in j=0, j=1, j=2.\n\nSo why in the sample note, it says student1 is best in subjects 1 and 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the subjects are 1-based instead of 0-based. Because in the problem statement, the subjects are numbered 1 to m.\n\nSo in the code, j is 0-based, but the problem counts subjects starting from 1.\n\nWait, that would cause confusion.\n\nWait, in the first sample:\n\nThe first student's marks are 2,2,3.\n\nThe max for subject 1 is 2 (j=0 in code). Subject 2 is 3 (j=1), and subject 3 is 3 (j=2).\n\nSo for student1, he is best in subject1 (mark 2), subject2 (3), and subject3 (3). So he is the best in all three. But the sample note says he is best in subjects 1 and 3. That suggests that subject numbering starts at 1.\n\nSo perhaps in the code, the subjects are 1-based. So in the code, when j=0, it's subject1, j=1 is subject2, etc.\n\nBut that's just the way the problem is presented. It doesn't affect the code; the code correctly finds the max for each subject regardless of how it's numbered.\n\nSo in any case, the code correctly counts the number of students who are best in at least one subject.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nTesting the second sample:\n\nstudents are:\n\n'91728' → [9,1,7,2,8]\n'11828' → [1,1,8,2,8]\n'11111' → [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks:\n\nj=0:9,1,1 → 9\nj=1:1,1,1 →1\nj=2:7,8,1 →8\nj=3:2,2,1 →2\nj=4:8,8,1 →8\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent1: j=0 is 9, which equals max. So counted.\nStudent2: j=1 is 1, which equals max. Counted.\nStudent3: j=1 is 1, which equals max. Counted.\n\nSo total 3.\n\nSo code works.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=1, m=1: student is the best in that subject. So count is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n91\n\n82\n\nmax_marks: j0:9, j1:8.\n\nStudent1: j0 is 9 → yes. Student2: j1 is8 → yes. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n91\n\n82\n\nSame as above.\n\nAnother case: all students have same marks.\n\nLike n=3, m=2.\n\nAll have 55.\n\nmax_marks: 5 and5.\n\nEach student has 5 in both subjects. So each is best in both. So count is3.\n\nWait, no. Because for each subject, the max is 5. So each student's mark in each subject is 5, so each is best in both. So each is successful.\n\nSo the code correctly counts 3.\n\nAnother edge case: n=100, m=100. But the code handles it since loops are manageable.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, to write the code.\n\nI'll need to import sys.\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess n and m.\n\nThen, for each subject, compute the max.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any subject matches their max.\n\nCount and print.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\nn_m = lines[0].split()\nn = int(n_m[0])\nm = int(n_m[1])\n\nstudents = []\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    students.append(lines[i])\n\nmax_marks = [0]*m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_mark = int(students[i][j])\n        if current_mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = current_mark\n    max_marks[j] = max_mark\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    student_marks = [int(c) for c in students[i]]\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student_marks[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but what about when m=0? Well, constraints say m >=1, because 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTest the code with the samples.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput lines after reading:\n\nLine 0: '3 3'\n\nLines 1,2,3: '223', '232', '112'\n\nProcessing:\n\nmax_marks for j=0:2, j=1:3, j=2:3.\n\nStudent0: '223' → 2,2,3. At j=0, 2==2 → count 1.\n\nStudent1: '232' → 2,3,2. At j=0, 2==2 → count 2.\n\nStudent2: '112' → 1,1,2. No j where mark equals max. So count remains 2.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nLines after reading:\n\nLine0: '3 5'\n\nLines1,2,3: '91728', '11828', '11111'\n\nmax_marks:\n\nj0:9, j1:1, j2:8, j3:2, j4:8.\n\nStudent0: '91728' → 9,1,7,2,8.\n\nAt j0:9 ==9 → count 1.\n\nStudent1: '11828' →1,1,8,2,8.\n\nAt j1:1 ==1 → count 2.\n\nStudent2: '11111' →1,1,1,1,1.\n\nAt j1:1 ==1 → count 3.\n\nThus, output is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nLooks good.\n",
