She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has n tabs open in her browser. The tabs are numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right within the currently open tabs, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tabs need to be closed. Those are the ones outside [l, r]. So any tab less than l must be closed, and any tab greater than r must be closed.\n\nBut the order in which she does things matters. For example, maybe she should move the cursor to a certain position and then close either left or right tabs.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. Determine which tabs are outside the desired range. For example, if n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4: she needs to close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial state is that all tabs are open. She needs to leave only l to r. So any tab not in [l, r] must be closed.\n\nSo first, I need to see whether any tabs are to the left of l and whether any are to the right of r. Because those are the tabs that need to be closed.\n\nCase 1: All tabs are already within [l, r]. Then, she doesn't need to do anything. So the answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: There are tabs to the left of l that need closing, and/or to the right of r that need closing.\n\nSo let's consider each possibility.\n\nFirst, determine if there are any tabs to the left of l: left_close = (l > 1). Similarly, right_close = (r < n).\n\nIf both are false, output 0.\n\nElse, we need to calculate the steps needed.\n\nSo the plan is to figure out the minimal steps required to close all necessary tabs on the left and right.\n\nEach action (move or close) takes one second.\n\nSo for the left part:\n\nShe can choose to close all tabs to the left of current cursor. But she might need to move the cursor to some position where the left part is all to the left of that position.\n\nSimilarly for the right.\n\nLet's think about the process:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then right.\n\n- Move to position where she can close left.\n- Close left.\n- Then, move to the right side, close right.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then left.\n\n- Move to position where she can close right.\n- Close right.\n- Then, move to the left side, close left.\n\nAlternatively, she might not need to move much after closing one side, but depends on the initial position.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to decide which side to close first and compute the steps for each option, then take the minimum.\n\nSo let's model the steps for both options and pick the better one.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each scenario.\n\nFirst, check if left_close and/or right_close are true.\n\nIf neither is needed, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the steps for two scenarios:\n\nScenario A: Close left first, then close right.\n\nScenario B: Close right first, then close left.\n\nTake the minimum of these two.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there's another scenario where she can do something else, but I think handling these two should cover all cases.\n\nSo for each scenario, calculate the required steps.\n\nHow?\n\nFor Scenario A:\n\n1. Move the cursor to the leftmost position (or as far left as possible) so that when she closes left, all left tabs are closed.\n\nWait, no. When she is at position i, closing left will close all tabs from a to i-1. So to close all left tabs, she needs to be at position l. Because any tabs before l would be closed.\n\nWait, no. If she is at position l, closing left will close all tabs to the left of l (i.e., from a to l-1), which are exactly the left tabs that need to be closed.\n\nSimilarly, to close the right, she needs to be at position r+1, because closing right will close r+1 to b, but since r is the right end, perhaps she can just be at r, but wait: when she's at r, closing right would close r+1 to b, which may include more tabs beyond r.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, initially, a is 1 and b is n. But once some tabs are closed, a and b change.\n\nSo for the initial state, a is 1, b is n.\n\nWhen she closes left, the new a becomes the current position minus 1, but only if that's higher than the previous a.\n\nWait, maybe the a and b are updated automatically after each close operation.\n\nHmm, but for the purposes of calculating steps, maybe I can model the positions she needs to reach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose she wants to close the left part (tabs < l). To do that, she must be at a position where the left closure will affect all those tabs.\n\nSo she needs to be at l, because any tabs to the left of l are to be closed. When she's at l, she can close all tabs to the left of l (which are 1 to l-1), thus removing them.\n\nSimilarly, to close the right part (tabs > r), she needs to be at r, because closing right from there will remove tabs from r+1 to n.\n\nWait, no. Because after closing left, the a may change. So perhaps she needs to be at a certain position in the remaining tabs.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial steps are:\n\n1. Determine whether she needs to close left and/or right.\n\nIf both are needed, she has to perform two operations: close left and close right.\n\nBut the order may vary.\n\nSo, let's model the steps for each possible scenario.\n\nLet's say she needs to close left and right.\n\nSo for scenario A: close left first, then close right.\n\nSteps:\n\na) Move from pos to l. How many steps? It's |pos - l|.\n\nb) Close left. This takes 1 step.\n\nc) Now, after closing left, the available tabs are from l to b (since she's at l, the new a is l, and b remains as it was until she closes right.\n\nd) Then, she needs to move from l to r. The distance is (r - l), but since she can only move within the current a and b, which after closing left are l and n.\n\nWait, no: after closing left, the available tabs are from l to n. So when she is at l, she can move right to any position up to n.\n\nSo to reach r, she needs (r - l) steps.\n\ne) Close right. 1 step.\n\nTotal steps for scenario A: (steps to l) + 1 + (steps from l to r) + 1 = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, but wait: moving from l to r is (r - l) steps. Yes.\n\nBut what if she closes left first, but after that, she can't reach r because the new a is l. Wait, no: after closing left, the available tabs are l, l+1, ..., n. So she can move freely between l and r.\n\nSo scenario A's total steps are |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, but what if the initial position is already l?\n\nLike, for example, the second test case: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\nIn this case, she needs to close all tabs to the right of r=3, which is 4,5,6.\n\nSo she can move to 3, then close right, which closes 4,5,6. That's one step.\n\nSo in that case, the steps are:\n\nmove to l (which is 1 in this case?), wait no.\n\nWait, in that example, l is 1, so she needs to close the right side.\n\nWait, no: l=1, so the left part is already covered (no tabs to the left of 1). So she only needs to close the right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the steps as follows:\n\nCalculate for each possible case (left_close and right_close) and for each possible order.\n\nLet me structure it:\n\nCompute four variables:\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nIf neither is needed, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nWe have four possibilities:\n\n1. Only left needed: close left, no right needed.\n\n2. Only right needed: close right, no left needed.\n\n3. Both needed: close left then right, or right then left.\n\nSo for each scenario, compute the steps.\n\nSo let's go through each case.\n\nCase 1: Only left needed.\n\nShe needs to close all left of l.\n\nShe can be at position l, then close left (1 step).\n\nBut how many steps does it take to get to l?\n\nIt's |pos - l|.\n\nSo total steps: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase 2: Only right needed.\n\nShe needs to be at position r, then close right (1 step).\n\nSteps to get from pos to r: |pos - r|.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase 3: Both left and right needed.\n\nHere, two options:\n\nOption A: Close left first, then right.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move from pos to l: steps = |pos - l|\n- Close left: +1\n- Then, move from l to r: steps += (r - l)\n- Close right: +1\nTotal: |pos-l| + (r-l) + 2.\n\nOption B: Close right first, then left.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move from pos to r: steps = |pos - r|\n- Close right: +1\n- Then, move from r to l: steps += (r - l) (because from r to l is r-l steps if l < r)\nWait, no: if l < r, then moving from r to l requires (r - l) steps.\n\nWait, no: if you're at r, and you want to get to l, which is to the left, the steps are (r - l). Because each step moves you one to the left.\n\nYes.\n\nSo total steps: |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nNow, compare the two options and take the minimum.\n\nSo for case 3, the minimal steps would be the minimum between option A and option B.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCompute left_needed and right_needed.\n\nIf neither, return 0.\n\nElse if only left needed: steps = |pos - l| + 1.\n\nElse if only right needed: steps = |pos - r| + 1.\n\nElse:\n\noptionA = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2\n\noptionB = |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2\n\nWait wait, wait: no. Because in option B, after closing right, the a and b change.\n\nWait, after closing right, the a remains the same as before (since the left hasn't been closed yet), but the b becomes r.\n\nBecause when she closes right, all tabs to the right of current position (r) are closed, so the new b is r.\n\nSo after closing right, she is at r, and the available tabs are from a (which is still 1, since left hasn't been closed) to r.\n\nSo when she wants to close left, she can be anywhere between l and r.\n\nWait, but in option B, after closing right, she is at r, and needs to move to l to close the left.\n\nBut now, the available tabs are from a=1 to r.\n\nSo moving from r to l: r - l steps.\n\nThen, close left: 1 step.\n\nSo total steps for option B: |pos - r| + 1 (close right) + (r - l) (move to l) + 1 (close left) = |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWhich is the same as option A's calculation.\n\nWait, but is that correct?\n\nBecause, after closing right, the new b is r. So when moving from r to l, she can't go beyond the current a and b.\n\nBut since l is <= r, and a is 1, it's allowed.\n\nSo yes, the movement is possible.\n\nSo for case 3, the minimal steps is the minimum between optionA and optionB.\n\nWait, but optionA and optionB have the same formula.\n\nWait no:\n\nOption A: steps to l, close, move to r, close.\n\nOption B: steps to r, close, move to l, close.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nOption A: |pos-l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos-l| + (r-l) + 2.\n\nOption B: |pos-r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - r| + (r-l) + 2.\n\nSo the total steps are |pos-l| + (r-l) + 2 vs |pos-r| + (r-l) + 2.\n\nSo the minimal is min( |pos-l| + ... , |pos-r| + ... )\n\nSo for case 3, the minimal steps is min( |pos-l| + (r-l)+2, |pos-r| + (r-l)+2 )\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing some other cases where she can save steps by doing something else.\n\nWait, maybe she can close one side without having to move all the way to the edge.\n\nBut I think the approach above covers all possibilities.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3 2 4.\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nleft_needed: l>1 → 2>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed: r<6 → 4<6 → yes.\n\nSo case 3.\n\nCompute optionA: |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\nOption B: |3-4| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo minimal is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nleft_needed: 1>1? No.\n\nright_needed: 3 <6 → yes.\n\nSo case 2: only right needed.\n\nSteps: |3-3| (already at r) +1 → 1 step.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 2 1 5.\n\nleft_needed: 1>1? No.\n\nright_needed:5<5? No.\n\nSo 0 steps.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: let's imagine n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nleft_needed: 3>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed:5<7 → yes.\n\nSo case3.\n\noptionA: |4-3|=1 → 1 + (5-3)=2 → 3 → 1+2+2=5.\n\noptionB: |4-5|=1 → 1 + 2 + 2=5.\n\nSame steps.\n\nAnother test case: n=10, pos=7, l=4, r=8.\n\nleft_needed: 4>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed:8<10 → yes.\n\noptionA: |7-4|=3 → 3 + (8-4)=4 → 3+4=7 → 7+2=9.\n\noptionB: |7-8|=1 → 1 +4 → 5 → 5+2=7.\n\nSo option B is better, 7 steps.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nMove from 7 to 8: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nThen move from 8 to 4: 4 steps.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nTotal 7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nThe plan is:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute left_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed: print 0.\n\nelse if left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n   steps = abs(pos - l) + 1.\n\nelif right_needed and not left_needed:\n\n   steps = abs(pos - r) + 1.\n\nelse:\n\n   optionA = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n   optionB = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n   steps = min(optionA, optionB)\n\nprint(steps)\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where l == r, like l=3, r=3. Then, the segment is just one tab. So she doesn't need to close any tabs, but in the code, left_needed and right_needed would depend on whether l>1 and r <n.\n\nWait, for l=3, r=3, if n=5: left_needed is true (3>1), right_needed is true (3<5). So she needs to close both.\n\nSo steps would be as per case3.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r=1, n=5: left_needed is false, right_needed is true (since r=1 <5). So she needs to close right. Steps are |pos -1| +1.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nWhat about when l=1, r=n: then she doesn't need to close any tabs. So code returns 0.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=1, r=2, n=3. So left is already done, right_needed is true (r=2 <3).\n\nShe needs to close right (tab 3).\n\nSteps: move from pos to 2 (r), close right. So if pos is 2: 1 step.\n\nIf pos is 3: steps to 2 is 1, close right: total 2 steps.\n\nWait, according to the code:\n\nright_needed is true, left_needed is false.\n\nSo steps = |pos - r| +1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=2, pos=1.\n\nShe needs to close right (3). She is at 1, which is l.\n\nShe can close right directly: steps is |1-2| +1 → 1+1=2? Or wait, no: she is at 1, which is r=2? No, r=2.\n\nWait, no: in this case, l=1, r=2. So she needs to close right (3).\n\nShe is at 1. She can move to 2, then close right.\n\nSo steps: move to 2 (1 step), close right (1 step). Total 2.\n\nWhich matches the code.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, the Python code can be written as follows.\n\nRead the four integers from input.\n\nCompute left_needed and right_needed.\n\nBased on the conditions, compute steps.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nThe input is given as a single line, four integers, separated by spaces.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed and not left_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    optionA = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    optionB = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    steps = min(optionA, optionB)\n\nprint(steps)\n\nWait, but what if l == r?\n\nIn that case, the code correctly handles it.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nleft_needed = True, right_needed=True.\n\noptionA: 3-2=1 + (4-2)=2 → 1+2=3 → +2 → 5.\n\noptionB: 3-4=1 + 2 → 3 → +2 →5.\n\nmin is 5. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nleft_needed: 1>1 → no.\n\nright_needed: 3<6 → yes.\n\nso steps = |3-3| +1 → 1. Correct.\n\nSample 3:\n\n5 2 1 5.\n\nno needed. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nleft_needed: 3>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed:5<7 → yes.\n\noptionA: |4-3|=1 + 2 → 3 → +2=5.\n\noptionB: |4-5|=1 +2 → 3 → +2=5.\n\nSo min is 5.\n\nBut earlier thought that option B could be better in another case.\n\nAnother test case: n=10, pos=7, l=4, r=8.\n\noptionA: 7-4=3 +4=7 → +2=9.\n\noptionB:7-8=1 +4=5 → +2=7.\n\nSo steps 7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the final code is as described.\n",
