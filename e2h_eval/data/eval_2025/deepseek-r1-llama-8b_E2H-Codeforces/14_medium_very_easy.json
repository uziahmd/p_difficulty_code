    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! (n factorial) has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero. But also, multiples of higher powers like 25 contribute more.\n\nSo the formula for trailing zeros is sum(n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ...) until the division result is zero.\n\nWait, right. So for a given m, I need to find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m.\n\nBut how do I find the range of n's that satisfy this?\n\nI think the approach is to find the minimal n where the trailing zeros are >= m, and then see if there are consecutive n's that give the same m.\n\nBecause when you compute the trailing zeros for n, as n increases, the count can stay the same or increase. So for some m, there might be a range of n's where the trailing zeros are exactly m.\n\nFor example, in the sample input m=1. The trailing zeros for 5! is 1, but 6! is 720, which has one zero too. Wait, no, wait: 5! is 120, which has one zero. 6! is 720, also one zero. Oh wait no, 6! has one zero? Wait, 6! is 720, which ends with one zero. Wait, but 10! would be 3628800, which has two zeros. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the sample input says for m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Each of these factorials has exactly one trailing zero. How does that happen?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n5! = 120 → 1 zero.\n6! = 720 → 1 zero.\n7! = 5040 → 1 zero.\n8! = 40320 → 1 zero.\n9! = 362880 → 1 zero.\n10! = 3628800 → 2 zeros.\n\nOh right, so between 5! and 9!, the trailing zeros remain at 1. So for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9 → five numbers.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's such that their trailing zero count equals m, and output them in order.\n\nNow, how to find all such n's efficiently.\n\nFirst, I need to find the lower bound of n where the trailing zeros are equal to m. Then, check if adding 1,2,3... gives the same m until it changes. The count will be the difference plus one (if the next n also gives m).\n\nWait, but for m=5, in the sample, the output is '0'. Because for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nWait, let's compute the trailing zeros for some n:\n\nLet's see, 24! → how many zeros?\n\n24/5 =4, 24/25=0. So total is 4. So 24! has 4 zeros.\n\n25! has 25/5=5, 25/25=1 → 5+1=6 zeros.\n\nSo for m=5, is there any n where trailing zeros are exactly 5?\n\nNo, because 25! jumps to 6, and 24! is 4. So there's a gap. So the output is zero.\n\nSo the first step is to find the minimal n such that the trailing zeros are >=m. Then check if the next numbers also have the same count.\n\nWait, no. Because sometimes, the count can increase by more than one. Like from 24 to 25, the count goes from 4 to 6. So for m=5, no n satisfies, hence output zero.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the smallest n_low such that the trailing zeros of n_low is >= m.\n\n2. Check if the trailing zeros of n_low is exactly m. If not, then no solution exists, output 0.\n\n3. If it is exactly m, then find the maximum n_high such that the trailing zeros of n_high is m.\n\n4. The count is n_high - n_low +1.\n\n5. Then, collect all numbers from n_low to n_high and output them.\n\nBut how to efficiently find n_low and n_high.\n\nAn efficient way is to perform a binary search on n to find the smallest n where the trailing zeros are >=m.\n\nOnce n_low is found, compute its trailing zeros. If it's not equal to m, return 0.\n\nOtherwise, find the maximum n where the trailing zeros are exactly m.\n\nWait, but after n_low, we can keep incrementing until the trailing zeros increase beyond m. The last n that gives m is n_high.\n\nAlternatively, since the trailing zeros function is non-decreasing, once we find n_low, we can find the smallest n where the trailing zeros exceed m, say n_upper. Then n_high is n_upper-1.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Binary search for the smallest n where trailing_zeros(n) >=m.\n\n- Check if trailing_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, find the maximum n where trailing_zeros(n) ==m. Which can be done by incrementally checking n_low+1, etc., until the trailing zeros increase.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming for large m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the upper bound using binary search as well.\n\nWait, let's think: For a given m, the set of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros is a consecutive range. So the idea is to find the starting point (n_low) and ending point (n_high) of that range.\n\nSo how to find n_low:\n\nWe can use binary search to find the minimal n where trailing_zeros(n) >=m. Once we have that, check if trailing_zeros(n_low) ==m.\n\nIf yes, proceed. Then, find the maximum n where trailing_zeros(n) ==m.\n\nTo find n_high:\n\nWe can start at n_low and keep incrementing until trailing_zeros(n) exceeds m. The last n before that is n_high.\n\nBut for very large m, this could take a lot of steps. So perhaps a better way is to perform another binary search for the maximum n where trailing_zeros(n) <=m.\n\nWait, no. Because trailing_zeros is non-decreasing. So for the maximum n where trailing_zeros(n) ==m, it's the largest n such that trailing_zeros(n) ==m.\n\nWait, but how do I find that?\n\nAlternatively, after finding n_low, I can compute the next n where trailing_zeros(n) >m. Then n_high is one less than that.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nImplement a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\nThen, perform a binary search to find the minimal n_low where trailing_zeros(n_low) >=m.\n\nIf trailing_zeros(n_low) !=m, output 0.\n\nElse, perform another binary search to find the maximal n where trailing_zeros(n) <=m.\n\nWait, no. Because for n_high, we need trailing_zeros(n_high) ==m.\n\nWait, but the maximum n where trailing_zeros(n) ==m may be such that n_high+1 is the first n where trailing_zeros is m+1.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to find the smallest n where trailing_zeros(n) >m. Then, n_high is the maximum n where trailing_zeros(n) ==m, which is (smallest n where trailing_zeros >m) -1.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Compute trailing_zeros(n_low) = m. Use binary search to find the minimal n_low.\n\n   - If trailing_zeros(n_low) !=m, output 0.\n\n2. Compute n_upper as the smallest n where trailing_zeros(n) >m.\n\n   - Then n_high = n_upper -1.\n\n3. The count is n_high -n_low +1.\n\n4. Output the numbers from n_low to n_high, inclusive.\n\nSo, how to implement the binary search.\n\nImplementing the helper function is straightforward.\n\nNow, for the binary search part.\n\nFunction to compute trailing zeros:\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the binary search to find the minimal n_low.\n\nThe minimal possible n is 0, but since we're looking for positive integers, the lower bound can be 0 or 5, depending on m.\n\nWait, for m=1, n starts at 5.\n\nSo in the binary search, low=0, high= something like 5*m (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, so 5*m is an upper bound for the minimal n_low).\n\nWait, but perhaps setting high to 5*m is sufficient.\n\nWait, for m=1, 5*1=5. That's correct.\n\nFor m=5, 5*5=25, but the minimal n_low where trailing_zeros(n)>=5 is 25, which gives 6 zeros. So in that case, the binary search would find 25 as the minimal n where trailing_zeros(n) >=5, but then check if trailing_zeros(25) is 5? No, it's 6. So output 0.\n\nSo, the binary search for n_low is correct.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low via binary search as the minimal n where count_trailing_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nIf count_trailing_zeros(n_low) !=m: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Compute n_upper as the minimal n where count_trailing_zeros(n) >m.\n\n   n_high =n_upper-1.\n\n   The count is n_high -n_low +1.\n\n   Output the numbers from n_low to n_high.\n\nSo, now, the challenge is to implement the binary search correctly.\n\nImplementing the binary search for n_low.\n\nWe can set low=0, high=5*m.\n\nBut wait, for larger m, 5*m may not be sufficient. Because for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, but the actual minimal n_low for m=1e5 may be higher.\n\nWait, no, because the count_trailing_zeros(n) increases roughly as n/4 (since each 5 contributes at least one, but higher multiples contribute more). So for m=1e5, n is around 4e5.\n\nWait, perhaps a better upper bound is 5*m.\n\nWait, because for n=5*m, count_trailing_zeros(n) is at least m (since 5*m /5 =m), but possibly more due to higher multiples. So 5*m is a safe upper bound.\n\nSo for binary search, initial high=5*m.\n\nSimilarly, for n_upper, the initial high can be 5*(m+1), since n_upper is the first n where count_trailing_zeros(n) >m.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, 5*(m+1) is 5e5+5, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the binary search functions:\n\nImplement a function to find the minimal n where count >= target.\n\nAnother function to find the minimal n where count > target.\n\nWait, perhaps the same function can be adapted.\n\nWait, for n_low, we need the minimal n where count >=m.\n\nFor n_upper, we need the minimal n where count>m.\n\nSo, for both, the binary search can be implemented similarly.\n\nLet me think about the binary search for n_low.\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m.\n\nWhile low <high:\n\n   mid = (low + high)//2.\n\n   current_count = count_trailing_zeros(mid).\n\n   if current_count <m:\n\n       low=mid+1.\n\n   else:\n\n       high=mid.\n\nAt the end, low should be the minimal n where count >=m.\n\nSimilarly, for n_upper, which is the minimal n where count>m.\n\nWe can perform a similar binary search.\n\nSet low=0, high=5*(m+1).\n\nWhile low<high:\n\n   mid=(low+high)//2.\n\n   current_count=count_trailing_zeros(mid).\n\n   if current_count <=m:\n\n       low=mid+1.\n\n   else:\n\n       high=mid.\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count>m.\n\nSo, for n_upper, the value is low.\n\nThen, n_high =n_upper-1.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, handle the cases.\n\nFor example, in the sample input m=1.\n\nn_low is 5, count_trailing_zeros(5)=1.\n\nn_upper is the first n where count>m=1. Let's compute count_trailing_zeros(5)=1, 6=1, ..., 9=1, 10=2.\n\nSo n_upper is 10.\n\nn_high=10-1=9.\n\nSo the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 → 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nn_low is 25, count_trailing_zeros(25)=6>5. So n_low is 25, but count is 6!=5. So output 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_low is 25, count is6.\n\nn_upper is the first n where count>6.\n\ncount_trailing_zeros(25)=6.\n\ncount for 26: 26//5=5, 26//25=1 → 5+1=6.\n\nSimilarly, 29: 29//5=5, 29//25=1 →6.\n\n30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 →7.\n\nSo n_upper is 30.\n\nn_high=30-1=29.\n\nSo the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29 →5 numbers.\n\nWait, but what about 30: count is7>6.\n\nSo the n_high is29.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low via binary search.\n\nIf count_trailing(n_low)!=m: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Compute n_upper via binary search for the first n where count>m.\n\n   n_high =n_upper-1.\n\n   The numbers are from n_low to n_high, inclusive.\n\n   Output k =n_high -n_low +1.\n\n   Then output the numbers in order.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nWhat if m=0? According to the problem statement, m>=1.\n\nWait, the input constraints are 1<=m<=1e5. So m=0 is not allowed.\n\nAnother edge case: m=1, which is handled.\n\nAnother case: m=2.\n\nn_low is 10, because 10//5=2, 10//25=0. So count is2.\n\nn_upper is the first n where count>2.\n\nCheck 15: 15//5=3, 15//25=0 →3>2.\n\nSo n_upper is15.\n\nn_high=14.\n\nWait, 14//5=2, 14//25=0 →2.\n\nSo numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 →5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implementing in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input.\n\nThe input is a single integer m.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says that the input is a line containing m.\n\nIn the sample input, it's given as ['1', '5'], but perhaps in the actual code, the input is read as a string.\n\nWait, the input is a single integer m.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nm = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nThen, implement the functions.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo, write the helper function.\n\nImplement the binary search functions.\n\nSo, writing the code.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut wait, for m=1e5, the binary search for n_low will be up to 5e5, which is acceptable.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nAnother thing: for n_high, n_high must be >=n_low.\n\nOtherwise, the count is zero.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low via binary search for minimal n where count >=m.\n\nIf count !=m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Compute n_upper via binary search for minimal n where count>m.\n\n   n_high =n_upper-1.\n\n   if n_high <n_low → output 0.\n\n   else → output the numbers from n_low to n_high.\n\nWait, but n_upper is the first n where count>m. So n_upper-1 is the last n where count<=m.\n\nBut since count(n_low) is m, and for n_high, count is m, so n_high >=n_low.\n\nSo, code:\n\nImplement helper function.\n\nImplement binary search for n_low.\n\nImplement binary search for n_upper.\n\nCompute n_high.\n\nIf count(n_low) !=m →0.\n\nElse, collect the numbers.\n\nNow, implement the helper function.\n\nBut in Python, for very large n, the function may be slow. But since the binary search is O(log n), and each step calls the helper function, which is O(log n) per call, the total is O((log n)^2), which is acceptable.\n\nWait, for n up to 5e5, log2(n) is about 19. So 19^2 is 361 steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n =n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    # find minimal n where count >=target.\n\n    low=0\n\n    high=5*target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid=(low+high)//2\n\n        c=count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n\n        if c < target:\n\n            low=mid+1\n\n        else:\n\n            high=mid\n\n    return low\n\ndef find_max_n(target):\n\n    # find minimal n where count>m.\n\n    low=0\n\n    high=5*(target+1)\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid=(low+high)//2\n\n        c=count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n\n        if c <= target:\n\n            low=mid+1\n\n        else:\n\n            high=mid\n\n    return low\n\nWait, for find_max_n, it's looking for the first n where count>m. So the function is correct.\n\nSo, in the main code:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\ncurrent_count = count_trailing_zeros(n_low)\n\nif current_count != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    n_upper = find_max_n(m)\n\n    n_high =n_upper-1\n\n    if n_high <n_low:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        k =n_high -n_low +1\n\n        print(k)\n\n        # print the numbers separated by spaces.\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high+1))))\n\nWait, but in Python, for large ranges, the 'range' function is efficient, but for n_high-n_low+1 up to 1e5, it's manageable.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\nSample Output:\n\n5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, but the code as written would print '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWait, no. Because in code, it's printing k, followed by the numbers.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nBut the sample output shows a single line with the numbers.\n\nWait, no, the sample output shows '5 6 7 8 9' on the same line as the count.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the sample input, the output is:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, no, the sample shows the output as a list of strings. But in reality, the output is two lines: the first line is the count followed by the numbers, and the second line is zero.\n\nWait, wait no. The problem says:\n\nOutput:\n\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\nSo the output should be two lines: the first line is k, then the second line is the space-separated list of the k numbers.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe output is to print the first line as k, and then the next line(s) as the list of numbers. Or, perhaps, the entire output is printed on a single line, with the count followed by the numbers.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is shown as:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the first string is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' and the second is '0'.\n\nWait, but that's probably a representation of the output, meaning that for m=1, the first output is the count followed by the numbers in the same line, and the second case (m=5) is 0.\n\nWait, no, the sample input is ['1','5'], and the output is two lines: the first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' and the second is '0'.\n\nWait, that can't be. Or perhaps it's a formatting issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a single line for each test case. So for the first case, the output is two lines: the first line is the count, the second line is the numbers.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the problem statement says \"print the desired outputs to standard output\".\n\nWait, perhaps the output is to print k on the first line, and then on the second line, the k numbers separated by spaces.\n\nSo for the sample input, the output is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\n0\n\nWait, but the sample shows the output as a list with two elements: the first being '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' and the second '0'.\n\nAh, perhaps that's just the way it's presented. So in the actual output, it's two lines.\n\nSo in code, for the first case, the code should output '5' on the first line, and '5 6 7 8 9' on the second line.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the first element of the output list is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' which is a single line with both the count and the numbers. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake in formatting. Maybe the actual output is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\n0\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample output is represented as a list of two strings, but perhaps that's just a representation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a single line: first the count, then the numbers, separated by spaces.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\n\"First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\nSo, the first line is the count, the next line is the list of numbers.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is shown as two lines, each line being a string.\n\nWait, no, in the sample, the output is a list of two strings. The first string is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' which includes a newline, and the second string is '0'.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects the output to be a single line, with k followed by the numbers, but when k is zero, it's just zero.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The code should output the count on the first line, then the numbers on the next line.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high+1))))\n\nWait, but for the sample input, this would produce:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nAnd for m=5, it would output:\n\n0\n\n0\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output for m=5 is zero, so it's a single line.\n\nSo, perhaps, in code, for the case where k is zero, output zero on one line, and nothing else.\n\nSo, code:\n\nif current_count !=m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    n_upper = find_max_n(m)\n\n    n_high =n_upper-1\n\n    if n_high <n_low:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        k =n_high -n_low +1\n\n        print(k)\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high+1))))\n\nSo, in the sample input, when m=1:\n\nk=5, and the second line is 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhen m=5, n_low=25, count is6!=5, so print 0.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nn_low=10, count=2.\n\nn_upper is 15, so n_high=14.\n\nNumbers are 10,11,12,13,14 →5 numbers.\n\nSo code would output 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_low=25, count=6.\n\nn_upper is30, n_high=29.\n\nNumbers 25,26,27,28,29 →5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nn_low is 15, count=3.\n\nn_upper is20, count for 20: 20//5=4, 20//25=0 →4>3. So n_upper=20.\n\nn_high=19.\n\nNumbers from 15 to19:15,16,17,18,19 →5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the final code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to output all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**:\n   - **Lower Bound (n_low)**: Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound (n_upper)**: Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: If the count of trailing zeros at \\( n\\_low \\) is exactly \\( m \\), then the valid range of \\( n \\) values is from \\( n\\_low \\) to \\( n\\_high \\) (where \\( n\\_high = n\\_upper - 1 \\)). If not, there are no valid \\( n \\) values.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the count of valid \\( n \\) values followed by the values themselves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        c = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if c < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef find_max_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (target + 1)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        c = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if c <= target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\ncurrent_count = count_trailing_zeros(n_low)\n\nif current_count != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_upper = find_max_n(m)\n    n_high = n_upper - 1\n    if n_high < n_low:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = n_high - n_low + 1\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: Computes the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by counting the factors of 5.\n- **find_min_n(target)**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeros is at least the target.\n- **find_max_n(target)**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeros exceeds the target.\n- **Main Logic**: Reads the input, determines the valid range of \\( n \\) values, and prints the results accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, ensuring the solution is optimal even for large values of \\( m \\).",
