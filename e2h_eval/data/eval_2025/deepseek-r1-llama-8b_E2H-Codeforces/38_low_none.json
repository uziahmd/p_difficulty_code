    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then determine the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all such graphs with that minimum. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, understanding what a p-reachable graph is. The definition says it has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, they are reachable from each other. So each such pair contributes to p. Wait, but since it's an ordered pair, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh no, wait: the problem says \"ordered pairs of nodes (u, v)\" where u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. These are called unidirectional pairs. But p is defined as the number of such pairs where u < v and they are reachable in both directions? Or wait, no: the p is the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So for each such pair, u can reach v and v can reach u, but that's not necessarily unidirectional. Wait, no: the p is the count of such pairs where u and v are mutually reachable, but not necessarily unidirectional. Because the unidirectional pairs are those where u can't reach v and vice versa. So p counts the number of mutual pairs (u, v) where u < v and each can reach the other.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says: p is the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So for each such pair, u and v form a mutual reachable pair. So the p counts the number of such edges in the undirected sense—each mutual edge is counted once. Because for each u < v, if they are mutually reachable, it contributes 1 to p.\n\nSo the first part of the problem is to find the minimal number of nodes needed in a directed graph that has exactly p such ordered pairs where u < v and u and v are mutually reachable.\n\nHmm, so the question is about the structure of such a graph. How can we model this?\n\nI think the minimal number of nodes will be related to how many such mutual edges we can fit into a structure with as few nodes as possible. Let's think about the structure that maximizes the number of mutual edges per node.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the minimal number of nodes is when the graph is constructed in a way that allows as many mutual edges as possible, thus requiring fewer nodes to reach p. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to arrange the graph in a way that each new node adds as many new mutual edges as possible.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of nodes is achieved when the graph is structured as a collection of chains or something similar. Or perhaps it's a complete DAG, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's consider that for a graph with n nodes, the maximum number of mutual edges (i.e., pairs (u, v) where u can reach v and v can reach u) is the number of edges in a tournament graph where the edges are arranged in a way that maximizes mutual reachability. Wait, no, a tournament graph is a complete oriented graph where every pair of vertices is connected by a single directed edge. So in a tournament, for any two nodes u and v, either u→v or v→u, but not both. So a tournament can't have any mutual reachable pairs except for the case when u can reach v via some path, but not necessarily directly.\n\nWait, but mutual reachability doesn't require a direct edge between them. So for example, in a directed cycle of three nodes, each node can reach the next, forming a cycle. So in that case, each pair (u, v) is mutually reachable because you can go around the cycle. So in a directed cycle of length k, the number of mutual pairs is k choose 2, because each pair is mutually reachable.\n\nWait, but in a directed cycle of length 3, each node can reach every other node, so the number of mutual pairs is 3 choose 2 = 3, right? So for a directed cycle of size k, the number of mutual pairs is C(k, 2), which is k*(k-1)/2.\n\nSo if p is equal to C(k, 2), then the minimal number of nodes is k. For example, when p=3, the minimal nodes are 3.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal number of nodes is the smallest k such that C(k, 2) >= p. Or wait, maybe not. Because sometimes, you can have multiple cycles or other structures to achieve p with fewer nodes than a single cycle.\n\nWait, no. Because a single cycle gives the maximum number of mutual edges for a given number of nodes. So if you want as",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among such graphs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` and both `u` can reach `v` and `v` can reach `u`. This implies that each such pair forms a mutual reachable edge.\n\n2. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The minimal number of nodes required is determined by finding the smallest integer `k` such that the number of mutual edges in a complete undirected graph of `k` nodes is at least `p`. This is because each node in a complete graph can reach every other node, forming the maximum number of mutual edges for a given `k`.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum number of nodes `k` is found, we construct a graph where each node points to every other node except itself. This structure maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs, which is `k*(k-1)/2 - p`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    p = int(input[0])\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    # Find the minimal k such that k*(k-1)/2 >= p\n    k = 0\n    while (k * (k - 1)) // 2 < p:\n        k += 1\n    \n    # Now, calculate the maximum unidirectional pairs\n    max_uni = (k * (k - 1)) // 2 - p\n    print(f\"{k} {max_uni}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an integer `p`.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Case**: If `p` is 0, the output is directly \"0 0\" since no nodes are needed and there are no unidirectional pairs.\n\n3. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: Using a loop, we find the smallest integer `k` such that the number of mutual edges in a complete graph of `k` nodes is at least `p`.\n\n4. **Calculating Unidirectional Pairs**: The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is calculated by subtracting `p` from the total number of possible mutual edges in a complete graph of `k` nodes.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently determine the minimum number of nodes and the maximum unidirectional pairs for any given `p`, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
