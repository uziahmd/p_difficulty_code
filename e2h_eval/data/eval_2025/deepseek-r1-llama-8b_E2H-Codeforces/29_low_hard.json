Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the remainder when the resulting number is divided by 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then, he gets n queries, each of which is a substitution: replace all occurrences of a digit di with a string ti. The order of the queries matters because each subsequent query operates on the result of the previous ones.\n\nMy goal is to process all these queries in order and then compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the substitutions efficiently? Because the string can be up to 105 characters, and each substitution can change the string length a lot. Doing this naively by replacing each character step by step might be manageable since the maximum steps are 105, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, for each query, I need to replace every occurrence of 'di' in the current string with 'ti'. So for example, if the string is '123123' and the query is '2→00', it becomes '10031003'.\n\nBut if I process each query one by one, modifying the string each time, that should work. Since the initial string is up to 105 characters, and each substitution could expand or contract it, but with n up to 105, the total operations would be manageable.\n\nHowever, after all substitutions, I need to compute the numerical value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. But wait, the resulting string can be very long. For example, if each substitution replaces a digit with a longer string, like '0 → 0000', then the string could grow exponentially. Processing each substitution step by step could result in a string that's way too big to handle directly.\n\nSo, instead of building the entire string, maybe I should represent the string as a mathematical structure that captures the value mod 1e9+7 at each step. That way, I avoid dealing with potentially huge strings.\n\nHmm, how can I model this?\n\nEach substitution replaces a digit d with a string t. The value contributed by each digit depends on where it appears in the string. So, perhaps we can model the current string's value as a sum of terms, each representing a certain power of 10 multiplied by their respective digits.\n\nWait, but when you substitute a digit d with a string t, the effect depends on the position of d in the current string. For example, if d is at position k (counting from left, starting at 0), then replacing d with t will affect the overall value by removing the contribution of d and adding the contributions of each character in t multiplied by 10^k', where k' is the position shift caused by t's length.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each substitution, we can track how it affects the current value. But the substitution is not just a replacement of a single digit but can be any digit, so it's hard to precompute.\n\nAnother idea: Instead of trying to track the entire string, maybe we can model the effect of each substitution on the current numeric value. But since substitutions can be interleaved, this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent the current state as a function that, given a digit, tells us how it's been substituted. But that might not capture the full picture.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the problem differently. Each substitution can be thought of as a transformation on the current string. After all substitutions, the string is processed into a number, which we can compute mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut the problem is that the substitutions can cause the string to become very long, making it impossible to store it directly.\n\nSo, the key is to find a way to represent the string's value without explicitly building it. Each substitution modifies the string, and each modification can be represented in terms of how it changes the numeric value.\n\nLet me consider what each substitution does to the current numeric value.\n\nSuppose before a substitution, the current value is V. When a substitution replaces a digit d with t, the effect depends on where d occurs in the string.\n\nFor example, if the current string is \"dXYZ\", where d is a single digit, replacing d with t will change the string to \"tXYZ\". The numeric value of the string is equal to (value of t) * 10^(length of XYZ) + value of XYZ. But wait, that's only if d is the first digit. If it's somewhere else, like \"XYZdABC\", then the substitution would affect the digits after d. So the position of d matters.\n\nThis suggests that substituting d with t may require knowing the position of each occurrence of d in the string, which complicates things.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to model the substitution using a data structure that keeps track of the current string",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7. The substitutions can potentially make the string very long, so we must handle it efficiently without explicitly building the entire string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the String as a Number**: Instead of building the string, model the current numeric value as a sum of terms, each representing a certain power of 10 multiplied by their respective digits. This allows us to handle substitutions without explicitly constructing the string.\n2. **Track Substitutions**: For each substitution, update the current value by considering how the substitution affects the numeric value. Each substitution replaces a digit `d` with a string `t`, which can change the length and digits of the string.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Use modular arithmetic to keep the numbers manageable and avoid overflow. Compute each part of the number modulo 1e9+7 and combine them appropriately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        parts = sys.stdin.readline().split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n    \n    current_value = 0\n    current_length = 0\n    digit_map = defaultdict(str)\n    for d, t in queries:\n        new_value = 0\n        new_length = 0\n        for i, c in enumerate(s):\n            if c == d:\n                val = int(t) if t else 0\n                power = current_length\n                new_value = (new_value + val * (10 ** power)) % MOD\n                new_length += len(t)\n            else:\n                power = current_length - (current_length - len(s))?

Each query specifies a digit to replace and the replacement string.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the replacement string. This is done iteratively to ensure each substitution is applied correctly in sequence.\n3. **Computing the Result**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a number and compute its value modulo 1e9+7. This avoids handling extremely large numbers directly by using modular arithmetic at each step.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the substitutions and compute the result without explicitly constructing very large strings.",
