The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a way that a_i + b_j is odd. So, for a key j and chest i, if one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd.\n\nHmm, wait, because adding two evens gives even, two odds give even too. Only even and odd sums are odd. So, the condition a_i + b_j ≡ 1 mod 2 means that one must be even and the other odd.\n\nSo, for each key, it can only unlock chests of the opposite parity. That is, a key with an even number can only unlock chests with odd numbers, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the first thing I think is that we need to separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly, the keys should be split into even and odd.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between the number of keys of even parity and the number of chests with odd a_i, plus the minimum between the number of keys with odd parity and the number of chests with even a_i.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- E_a: number of chests where a_i is even.\n- O_a: number of chests where a_i is odd.\n- E_b: number of keys where b_j is even.\n- O_b: number of keys where b_j is odd.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of:\n\nmin(O_b, E_a) + min(E_b, O_a)\n\nBecause for the even a chests, we can use the odd b keys, and for the odd a chests, we can use the even b keys.\n\nBut wait, what if there are more even a chests than available odd b keys? Then, the excess even a chests can't be opened. Similarly for the others.\n\nSo the total is the sum of these two minima.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the a array and count the number of even and odd a's.\n3. Read the b array and count the number of even and odd b's.\n4. Compute min(O_b, E_a) + min(E_b, O_a).\n5. Output this sum as the result.\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, let's test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example:\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\na array: 9,14,6,2,11\nEven a's: 14,6,2 → E_a=3\nOdd a's: 9,11 → O_a=2.\n\nb array: 8,4,7,20\nEven b's: 8,4,20 → E_b=3\nOdd b's:7 → O_b=1.\n\nCompute min(O_b=1, E_a=3) → 1\nCompute min(E_b=3, O_a=2) → 2\nTotal is 3, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n5 1\n2,4,6,8,10\n5\n\na is all even (E_a=5)\nb is 5, which is odd (O_b=1).\n\nSo min(1,5)=1. And min(E_b=0, O_a=0) is 0. So total is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example:\n1 4\n10\n20,30,40,50\n\na is 10, even. E_a=1.\nb's are all even. O_b=0.\n\nSo min(O_b=0, E_a=1) is 0. min(E_b=4, O_a=0) is 0. Total 0, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this logic works.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe'll need to process the input:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read a list, count the number of even and odd elements.\n\nSame for the b list.\n\nThen compute the sum as described.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead the first line as n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, read the a list: a = list(map(int, input().split())). Then E_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 ==0). O_a = n - E_a.\n\nSimilarly for b: b = list(map(int, ... )). E_b = sum(1 for x in b if x%2 ==0), O_b = m - E_b.\n\nCompute res = min(O_b, E_a) + min(E_b, O_a)\n\nPrint(res)\n\nWait, but what about the order of the min functions?\n\nYes, because each even a needs an odd b, which is O_b. So if E_a is larger than O_b, then we can only take O_b. Else, take E_a.\n\nSimilarly, for the odd a's, they need even b's. So if O_a is larger than E_b, take E_b; else, take O_a.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nuse_even_b_for_odd_a = min(odd_a, even_b)\nuse_odd_b_for_even_a = min(even_a, odd_b)\n\ntotal = use_even_b_for_odd_a + use_odd_b_for_even_a\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the code, the variable names might not be accurate. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, 'even_a' is the number of chests with even a_i. So for these, we can use odd_b keys.\n\nSo, the number of even_a chests that can be unlocked is the minimum between even_a and the number of odd_b keys. Because each odd_b can unlock one even_a chest.\n\nSimilarly, for the odd_a chests, which can be unlocked by even_b keys, the number is the minimum between odd_a and even_b.\n\nSo yes, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the third example:\n\na is [10], even_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50], all even, so even_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nSo:\n\nmin(odd_a=0, even_b=4) → 0.\n\nmin(even_a=1, odd_b=0) → 0.\n\nTotal 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=3, m=3.\n\na = [2,4,6] → even_a=3, odd_a=0.\n\nb = [3,5,7] → even_b=0, odd_b=3.\n\nSo, can we unlock all 3 even_a chests?\n\nNo, because even_b is 0. So we can't use any keys on them.\n\nWait, because even_a chests require odd_b keys. So in this case, even_a is 3, odd_b is 3. So min(3,3) is 3. So total is 3.\n\nWait, but the odd_a is 0, so the second term is min(0, even_b=0) → 0. So total is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat if even_a is 5, odd_a=3, even_b=2, odd_b=4.\n\nThen:\n\nmin(4,5) →4.\n\nmin(3, 2) →2.\n\nTotal 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo I think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can only unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: First, we count the number of even and odd integers in both the chests and the keys.\n2. **Determine Usable Pairs**: For each even-numbered chest, we need an odd-numbered key, and for each odd-numbered chest, we need an even-numbered key.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Open Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum values between the counts of even chests and odd keys, and the counts of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nuse_even_b_for_odd_a = min(odd_a, even_b)\nuse_odd_b_for_even_a = min(even_a, odd_b)\n\ntotal = use_even_b_for_odd_a + use_odd_b_for_even_a\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of chests `n` and keys `m`, followed by the lists of numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Evens and Odds**: We count how many of the numbers in the chests are even (`even_a`) and how many are odd (`odd_a`). Similarly, we count the even and odd numbers in the keys.\n3. **Calculate Usable Keys**: We determine how many even-numbered chests can be unlocked using odd-numbered keys (`min(odd_a, even_b)`) and how many odd-numbered chests can be unlocked using even-numbered keys (`min(even_a, odd_b)`).\n4. **Sum the Results**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of these two values, which gives us the maximum number of chests Neko can unlock.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging simple counting and minimum value calculations, ensuring it runs in linear time relative to the size of the input, making it suitable for large inputs up to the constraints given.",
