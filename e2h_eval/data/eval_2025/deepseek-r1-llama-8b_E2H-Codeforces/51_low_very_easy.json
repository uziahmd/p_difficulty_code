Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if the pile of letters found in the morning can be used to exactly form both the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters left. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input: guest, host, and pile.\n2. Check if the combined letters of guest and host are exactly equal to the pile letters.\n3. If they match, output \"YES\"; else, \"NO\".\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, I think I can count the frequency of each character in the guest and host names, combine them, and then compare with the pile's frequency.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n- Concatenate guest and host strings into one.\n- Count each character in this concatenated string.\n- Do the same for the pile string.\n- Compare the two counts. If they're identical, return YES; else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the order? Oh, right, because we just need a permutation, the order doesn't matter. Only the counts of each character matter.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the input. Each line is a string, right? So in Python, I can read them using input().strip() or something similar.\n\nBut wait, looking at the example input, each line is a single string, not multiple lines. So perhaps each line is a single string representing the name or the pile.\n\nSo, for the guest, host, and pile, each is a single string. For example, the first sample has 'SANTACLAUS' as guest, 'DEDMOROZ' as host, and 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' as the pile.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read guest = input().strip()\n2. Read host = input().strip()\n3. Read pile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combine guest + host into a single string. Let's call it required_str.\n\nThen, check if the sorted version of required_str equals the sorted pile. Because sorting will arrange all the letters in order, and if they match, it means that the pile can be rearranged to form the required names.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the Counter class from collections. So, create a counter for required_str and another for the pile. If the counters are equal, then return YES.\n\nYes, that's probably more efficient, especially for longer strings.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n- Import Counter from collections.\n- Combine guest and host into required_str.\n- Create counter_required = Counter(required_str)\n- Create counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n- If counter_required == counter_pile, print YES else NO.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the total number of characters doesn't match? For example, if the sum of guest and host lengths is different from the pile length, then it's immediately NO.\n\nSo, perhaps as a first check, we can compare the total length. Because even if all characters are present, the sum must match.\n\nFor example, if guest length is 5, host is 4, total is 9. Pile must be length 9. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSo adding that as a first step could save some computation. But in practice, the Counter comparison would also catch this, since the total number of letters would differ.\n\nBut adding an early check for len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile) can save some processing time.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (len(guest) + len(host)) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # proceed to compare\n\nThat's a good idea.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All empty strings. But according to the problem statement, all lines are not empty. So no problem.\n\nCase 2: Guest is 'A', host is 'B', pile is 'AB'. Then yes.\n\nCase 3: Guest is 'AA', host is 'BB', pile is 'ABAB' â†’ no, because counts are A:2, B:2 vs A:2, B:2. Wait, that's equal. So it's okay. Wait, no. Because the guest is 'AA' (two A's) and host is 'BB' (two B's). So the required_str is 'AABB', which when sorted is AABB. The pile is ABAB, which when sorted is AABB. So they match. So the answer is YES.\n\nWait, but the pile has two A's and two B's, same as required. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: guest is 'ABC', host is 'CBA', pile is 'ABCBCBA'. Then the required_str is 'ABCCBA', which when sorted is 'ABCBCA'? Or wait, let me see. Guest is 'ABC', host is 'C",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that there should be no extra letters and no missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths:** Ensure that the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, it is immediately impossible to form the names from the pile, so we print \"NO\".\n4. **Count Characters:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Compare Counts:** If the character counts match exactly, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the possibility of rearranging the pile to form the required names by ensuring both the total number of characters and their frequencies match.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine guest and host\nrequired = guest + host\n\n# Check if the total length matches\nif len(required) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Count the characters\n    required_counter = Counter(required)\n    pile_counter = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the counters\n    if required_counter == pile_counter:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read line by line, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated to form a single string representing all the letters needed.\n- **Length Check:** A quick check ensures the total number of letters in the combined names matches the pile. This avoids unnecessary counting when lengths are different.\n- **Character Counting:** Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** By comparing the two counters, we determine if the pile can be rearranged to form the required names. If they match exactly, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the combined guest and host names, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
