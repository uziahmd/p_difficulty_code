Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    ],
    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The definition they give is specific. So, Valera's paper is a square with n x n letters, where n is odd. The letters form an 'X' if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, for each test case, I need to:\n\n- Check that the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is all the same character.\n- Check that the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) is all the same character.\n- Ensure that both diagonals have the same character. Because if one is 'x' and the other is 'y', that's not acceptable.\n- Then, check that every cell not on either diagonal has the same character, and that this character is different from the diagonal ones.\n\nWait, right. So step by step:\n\n1. Read n and then read n lines each with n characters.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first line after n is a string like '5\\nxooox', etc. So each line represents a row. So I'll need to split them into rows.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I need to process it.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFor each test case:\n- Extract the grid as a 2D list.\n- Check the main diagonal: collect all elements [i][i] for i from 0 to n-1. Are they all the same?\n- Similarly, check the anti-diagonal: collect [i][n-1 - i] for each i. Are they all the same?\n- If both diagonals are all same, but their characters differ, then proceed. Else, it's not an X.\n- Then, check all other cells. For each cell (i,j), if it's on either diagonal, skip. Otherwise, check if all such cells have the same character, which must be different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read n. Then read n lines, each line being a string. So for example, for n=3, the lines are 'wsw', 'sws', 'wsw'.\n\nThen, create the grid as a list of lists. So grid[i][j] is the j-th character of the i-th line.\n\nWait, but in Python, strings are immutable, so each row can be accessed as a list.\n\nSo, code structure:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grid.append(list(line))\n\nOnce the grid is built, proceed.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    # Not all same, so return NO\nelse:\n    main_char = main_diag[0]\n\nSimilarly for anti-diagonal:\n\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 - i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(anti_diag)) != 1:\n    # Not all same, return NO\nelse:\n    anti_char = anti_diag[0]\n\nNow, check if main_char == anti_char. Because the diagonals must be the same character. Otherwise, it's not an X.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition says that both diagonals are same. Because the 'X' has both diagonals as same letters. So for example, both are 'x's.\n\nSo if main_char != anti_char, then the grid doesn't form an X. So in this case, output is NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for all other cells (non-diagonal), check if they are the same character, and that this character is different from main_char.\n\nSo, loop through each cell (i,j):\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue  # on diagonal, skip\n        else:\n            current_char = grid[i][j]\n            if current_char != other_char:\n                # Not all same, so NO\n                flag = False\n                break\nSo we need to have a single 'other_char' which is not equal to main_char.\n\nWait, what's the 'other_char'? It's the same across all non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo:\n\nother_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        c = grid[i][j]\n        if other_char is None:\n            other_char = c\n        else:\n            if c != other_char:\n                # Mismatch found\n                other_char = None\n                break\n    if other_char is None:\n        break\n\nAfter this loop, if other_char is None, that means there were conflicting non-diagonal characters, so it's invalid.\n\nAlso, we need to make sure that other_char is not equal to main_char (and anti_char, which is same as main_char). Because the non-diagonal must be different.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read grid.\n2. Check main diagonal is all same character, say 'd'.\n3. Check anti-diagonal is all same, say 'a'.\n4. If d != a, then no.\n5. Else, check that all non-diagonal cells are same, say 'o', and o != d.\n6. If all conditions met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- n is 3: the smallest possible n.\n- All cells are same as diagonals except non-diagonals are same, but same as diagonals: that's invalid because non-diagonal should be different.\n- Diagonals are same, but non-diagonal cells have mixed letters.\n\nAnother thing: when checking the anti-diagonal, it's from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). So for i in 0..n-1, j = n-1 -i.\n\nWait, for i=0, j is n-1. For i=1, j is n-2, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nGrid:\nRow 0: w s w\nRow 1: s w s\nRow 2: w s w\n\nMain diagonal: w, w, w → all same.\n\nAnti-diagonal: w, w, w → same.\n\nSo main_char and anti_char are same.\n\nNow, non-diagonal cells:\n\nLooking at (0,1): s\n(1,0): s\n(1,2): s\n(2,1): s\n\nAll are 's', and 's' is different from 'w'.\n\nSo output is YES.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the first test case outputs NO. Wait, no, looking back.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nThe first input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWait, perhaps I got the order wrong. Oh, wait, the sample shows three test cases, each with their own grid.\n\nSo the first test case is n=5, and the grid is xooox, oxoxx, soxoo, etc. But regardless, let's see:\n\nIn the second test case, n=3, grid is 'wsw', 'sws', 'wsw'. As we saw earlier, it should output YES.\n\nWait, but the sample output is ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'].\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the grid.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the first sample.\n\nWait, the first input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o o x\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nMain diagonal: grid[0][0] = x, grid[1][1] = x, grid[2][2] = x, grid[3][3] = x, grid[4][4] = x. So all x's.\n\nAnti-diagonal: grid[0][4] = x, grid[1][3] = o, grid[2][2] = x, grid[3][1] = x, grid[4][0] = x.\n\nWait, so anti-diagonal is x, o, x, x, x. So the anti-diagonal is not all same. So the second condition fails. Hence, output is NO.\n\nAh, okay, that explains why the first test case is NO.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, thinking about how to implement this in Python.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the reading of the input correctly. Each line is a string, possibly including '\\n' characters. So when reading, we need to strip each line.\n\nYes, in the code, I have line = input().strip(), which removes any leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nAnother issue: when n is 3, the anti-diagonal is grid[0][2], grid[1][1], grid[2][0].\n\nWait, no, for i=0, j = 2 (since n-1 -i = 2). For i=1, j=1. For i=2, j=0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines into grid.\n\nCheck main diagonal.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal.\n\nIf main and anti are same:\n\n   Check all non-diagonal cells are same, and different from main.\n\nElse:\n\n   Output NO.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grid.append(list(line))\n\n# Check main diagonal\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    continue\n\nmain_char = main_diag[0]\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(anti_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    continue\n\nif main_char != anti_char:  # Wait, no: variable name is main_char, anti_char is the variable.\n    # Wait, in code above, I named the variable anti_diag, but stored as a list. So need to get the first element.\n\nWait, I think I messed up variable names.\n\nNo, in code, after creating anti_diag, I should set anti_char = anti_diag[0]. Then, check if main_char != anti_char.\n\nWait, let's correct that.\n\nSo:\n\nanti_char = anti_diag[0]\n\nif main_char != anti_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    continue\n\nSo now, the diagonals are same.\n\nProceed to check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nInitialize other_char as None.\n\nother_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n            continue\n        current = grid[i][j]\n        if other_char is None:\n            other_char = current\n        else:\n            if current != other_char:\n                other_char = None\n                break\n    if other_char is None:\n        break\n\nif other_char is None or other_char == main_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but what if all non-diagonal cells are same as main_char? That's invalid because they should be different.\n\nSo after collecting other_char, we need to check two things:\n\n1. other_char is not None (meaning all non-diagonal are same)\n2. other_char is different from main_char.\n\nOtherwise, it's invalid.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nWait, but what if all non-diagonal cells are same as each other, but same as main_char?\n\nLike, suppose n=3, grid is:\n\naaa\naaa\naaa\n\nThen, main and anti are a's. Non-diagonal are a's. So other_char is a. Then, other_char == main_char: invalid.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=5.\n\nSuppose main and anti are 'x's. Non-diagonal are all 'o's. So valid.\n\nAnother case: some non-diagonal are 'o', some are 'p'. Then, other_char is set to 'o' in the first cell, then in the next cell it finds 'p' which is different. So other_char becomes None. So code returns NO.\n\nSo, now, coding this.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox → x o o o x\n\noxoxo → o x o x o\n\nsoxoo → s o x o o\n\noxoxo → o x o x o\n\nxooox → x o o o x\n\nMain diagonal: positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) → all 'x's.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,4) = x, (1,3) = o, (2,2)=x, (3,1)=x, (4,0)=x → the anti-diagonal has o in position 1,3.\n\nSo anti_diag is [x, o, x, x, x]. So len(set) is 2, so condition fails. So output is NO.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw → w s w\n\nsws → s w s\n\nwsw → w s w\n\nMain diag: w, w, w.\n\nAnti-diag: w, w, w. So same as main.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1) is s, (1,0) is s, (1,2) is s, (2,1) is s. So all 's's, and 's' != 'w'. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nx p x → x p x\n\np x p → p x p\n\nx p e → x p e\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, x.\n\nAnti-diagonal: e, x, x. So anti_diag is [x, x, e]. So len(set) is 2 → invalid. So output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: n=1. But according to the problem statement, n is at least 3. So no need to handle n=1.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are 'x's, but non-diagonal have 'x's as well. So, the other_char is x, same as main_char. So output is NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, all non-diagonal are 'o's, different from 'x's. So output YES.\n\nWhat about n=5, where the anti-diagonal is same as main, but some non-diagonal have different letters.\n\nE.g., main and anti are 'x's, but one non-diagonal is 'y' and another is 'z'. Then, other_char will be set to 'y' at first, then 'z' will cause other_char to be None. So output is NO.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, considering the constraints.\n\nn can be up to 299, which is manageable. For each test case, the code runs in O(n^2) time, which is acceptable.\n\nIn Python, for n=300, n^2 is 90,000 operations, which is fine.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWait, in the code, after the main and anti diagonals pass the checks, we proceed to check the other_char.\n\nBut what if the grid is 3x3, and all non-diagonal are same as main_char?\n\nLike:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen, main and anti are 'a's. The non-diagonal are 'a's. So other_char is 'a', which equals main_char. So code correctly outputs NO.\n\nSo, the code is handling that.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, and the anti-diagonal is same as main, but non-diagonal have different letters.\n\nE.g.:\n\nrow 0: a b a\n\nrow 1: b a b\n\nrow 2: a b a\n\nHere, main and anti are 'a's. Non-diagonal: positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) → all 'b's. So it's a valid X.\n\nSo code should output YES.\n\nAnother case where anti-diagonal is same as main, but non-diagonal have varying letters.\n\nE.g., row 0: a a a\n\nrow 1: a b a\n\nrow 2: a a a\n\nThen, main and anti are a's. Non-diagonal: (0,1) is a, (1,0) is a, (1,2) is b, (2,1) is a.\n\nSo other_char is a, but in position (1,2), it's b. So other_char becomes None. So output is NO.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\".
