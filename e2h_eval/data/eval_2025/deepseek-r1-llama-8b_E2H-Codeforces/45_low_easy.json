There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The main rule is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by no more than one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in.\n\nHmm, let me think about how the tournament structure affects this. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So for n players, there are n-1 games in total. But the order of these games matters because the winner's path depends on the matchups.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of games the winner can play isn't necessarily n-1. Because the structure of the bracket could limit that. For example, in a 3-player tournament, the winner plays two games: first against someone, then against the next. But wait, no—because with 3 players, there are two rounds. So the winner must play two games.\n\nBut in the sample input, when n=4, the output is 2. Hmm, why? Oh, because in a standard knockout bracket with four players, the winner would play three games (like a single elimination tree). Wait no, wait. Let's see:\n\nWait, perhaps the way the matchups are arranged affects how many times the winner can play. Because the initial bracket might group certain players together so that the winner has to face opponents with varying numbers of previous games.\n\nSo, the key here is to model the maximum possible games the winner can have based on the constraints.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Each time the winner plays a game, their number of games increases by one. The next opponent they face must have either the same number of games or one less than them.\n\nWait, no. Because when the winner plays a game, their count increases by one. So before each game, the opponent must have either one less or one more game count than the winner.\n\nWait, no. The rule is that two players can play only if their game counts differ by at most one. So, the winner can face an opponent who has played the same number of games or one more or one less.\n\nWait, but the winner is always the one who has won all their games. So when the winner plays a new game, their own game count increases by one. So the next opponent must have a game count that is either equal to the current count plus one or minus one.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify: the condition is that the two players' current game counts differ by no more than one. So when the winner has played k games, the next opponent must have played either k-1, k, or k+1 games.\n\nBut wait, since the opponent is another player who has also been winning their games, their game count can't be higher than the winner's. Because the winner is the one who's been playing more games.\n\nWait, no. Because the opponent could have played more games than the winner. For example, imagine the winner has played two games, and the opponent has played three. Then, when they play, their counts differ by one, which is allowed. But in this case, the opponent must have had two games before, right?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nSuppose the winner is A. When A plays against B, both have some number of games already played. The condition is |A's games - B's games| ≤ 1.\n\nSo after A plays against B, A's games increase by 1.\n\nSo for the next game, A's count is k+1, and the next opponent must have a count of k, k+1, or k+2.\n\nWait, no. Because before the next game, A has k+1 games, and the opponent must have a count that is within 1 of that.\n\nSo the opponent can have k, k+1, or k+2 games.\n\nBut wait, when the opponent has k+2 games, that would mean they have beaten two more opponents than A. How is that possible?\n\nMaybe the structure of the tournament allows that.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can have is determined by the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, that rings a bell. Because each time, the next opponent can have a game count of either the same or one more. So the maximum possible steps could form a Fibonacci-like series.\n\nSo, let's model this as a problem where we need to find the largest m such that the sum of the Fibonacci-like terms doesn't exceed n-1.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly Fibonacci, but something similar. Let me think.\n\nLet’s denote f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Then, the maximum possible k is the largest value such that f(k) ≤ n.\n\nSo, what's f(k)?\n\nFor k=1: The",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in. The tournament follows a specific rule where two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the number of games the winner can play forms a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each subsequent opponent the winner faces must have either the same number of games or one more game than the winner. This constraint leads us to consider the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games, which can be derived using a dynamic programming approach.\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `i` games.\n2. **Base Cases**: \n   - `dp[0] = 1` (the winner plays 0 games)\n   - `dp[1] = 2` (the winner plays 1 game, needing at least 2 players)\n3. **Recurrence Relation**: For each `i`, `dp[i]` is the sum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`. This is because the winner needs to face opponents who have either played one fewer game or one fewer game than their previous opponent.\n4. **Finding the Maximum Games**: Using the above recurrence, we compute the values until we find the largest `k` such that `dp[k]` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelif n == 2:\n    print(1)\nelse:\n    dp = [0] * (n)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    dp[1] = 2\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n    # Now find the maximum k where dp[k] <= n\n    max_games = 0\n    for k in range(n, 0, -1):\n        if dp[k] <= n:\n            max_games = k\n            break\n    print(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing the `dp` array where `dp[0]` is 1 (no games) and `dp[1]` is 2 (one game).\n2. **Filling the DP Array**: Using the recurrence relation, we fill the `dp` array up to `dp[n]`.\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: We iterate from `n` down to 1 to find the largest `k` such that `dp[k]` is less than or equal to `n`, giving us the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution using dynamic programming, ensuring we handle all edge cases and constraints effectively.",
