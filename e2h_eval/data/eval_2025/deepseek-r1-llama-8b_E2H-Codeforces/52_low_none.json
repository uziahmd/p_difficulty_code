Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. Hmm. So the idea is that Vasily has some initial number of candles, 'a'. Each candle burns for exactly one hour and then goes out. But here's the twist: he can take 'b' of these burned-out candles and make a new one. So each time he collects enough gone candles, he can create more to burn.\n\nMy task is to calculate the total hours he can keep the room lit by using these candles optimally.\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. For input 4 2, the output is 7. How does that work?\n\nSo initially, he has 4 candles. He burns all 4, which gives him 4 hours. Then, those 4 become 4 used candles. He can convert 4 into 2 new ones (since 4 divided by 2 is 2). He burns those two, adding 2 hours. Now, after that, he has 2 used candles again. Since 2 is equal to 'b' (which is 2), he can make another new candle. Burn that, adding another hour. Now, he has 1 used candle left, but since b is 2, he can't make more. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\nAnother example: 6 3. So initial 6 gives 6 hours. Then, 6 /3=2 new candles. Burn them (2 hours), now have 2 used. Can't make more since 2<3. So total 6+2=8.\n\nSo the approach is to calculate how many times we can collect the used candles and turn them into new ones, and sum all the hours.\n\nHow to model this? Let's think about it as a loop.\n\nWe start with 'total' hours as 'a'. Then, while the number of used candles (initially a) is >= b, we can do:\n\n- Calculate how many new candles we can make: used // b\n- Add that number to 'total'\n- The new used candles are (used % b) + new_candles (because each new candle when burned adds to the used pile)\nWait, no. Wait, when you create new candles, you burn them, so each new candle contributes one used candle.\n\nSo for example, when you have 4 used candles and b=2:\n\nnew_candles = 4 // 2 = 2. So you add 2 hours. After burning them, you have 2 used candles from these, plus the remaining 4 % 2 =0. So new used is 0 +2=2.\n\nThen, check again: 2 >=2? Yes. new_candles=1, add 1 to total. Now used becomes 1 (from 2//2=1) plus 1%2=0, so total used is 1.\n\nNow 1 <2, so stop. Total is 4+2+1=7.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize total = a\n\ncurrent_used = a\n\nwhile current_used >= b:\n    new_candles = current_used // b\n    total += new_candles\n    # the new_used is (current_used % b) + new_candles\n    current_used = (current_used % b) + new_candles\n\nThis loop continues until current_used <b.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward.\n\nNow, in code, we need to read 'a' and 'b' from input, compute the total, and output it.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: a is less than b. Then, he can't make any new candles. So output a.\n\nCase 2: a is exactly divisible by b once, but after that, there's nothing left.\n\nLike a=5, b=5: initial 5 gives 5 hours. Then, 5/5=1 new candle, burn it (6 total). Now used is 1. Since 1 <5, stop. So total is 5+1=6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\n10 -> 10 hours. Used=10.\n\n10//3=3 new candles, add 3 (total 13). Used becomes (10 mod3=1) +3=4.\n\n4 >=3: 4//3=1, add 1 (total 14). Used is 1+1=2. Now, 2 <3. So total is 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input as two integers.\n\nCompute the total as described.\n\nPrint the total.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead the line as a string, split into two parts, convert to integers a and b.\n\nInitialize total =a.\n\ncurrent_used =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can convert a certain number of these burned-out candles into new ones to continue burning.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Conversion Loop**: While the number of burned-out candles (current_used) is sufficient to create new candles (at least `b`), do the following:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made from the current_used candles.\n   - Add the number of new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the count of burned-out candles to include any leftovers from making new candles plus the newly burned candles.\n3. **Termination**: The loop stops when the number of burned-out candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total hours by iteratively converting used candles into new ones until it's no longer possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent_used = a\n\nwhile current_used >= b:\n    new_candles = current_used // b\n    total += new_candles\n    current_used = (current_used % b) + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers, `a` and `b`, representing the initial number of candles and the number of burned-out candles needed to make a new one, respectively.\n- **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` is burned, contributing `a` hours to the total.\n- **Loop for Conversion**: Using a while loop, the code repeatedly converts the used candles into new ones as long as there are enough to form at least one new candle. Each iteration adds the number of new candles to the total hours and updates the count of used candles.\n- **Output**: Finally, the total number of hours is printed.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures optimal use of candles, providing the correct result in minimal computational steps.",
