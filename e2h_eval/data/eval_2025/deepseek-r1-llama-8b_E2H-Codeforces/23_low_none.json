            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze needs to draw the minimum number of tiles to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). So, my task is to find the smallest number of additional tiles she needs to draw to have at least one such combination.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' is 1 in suit s. So, I'll need to parse these into a list of tiles, perhaps as tuples of (number, suit). Like for the sample input ['1s', '2s', '3s'], it's easy because they form a shuntsu already.\n\nThe output is three numbers, each corresponding to the minimal draws needed for each of the three possible starting hands. Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the example: the input was three strings, and the output was three integers. Each integer represents the minimal draws required to form a mentsu for each of the three initial hands. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, the problem statement says that the output is the minimal number of tiles she needs to draw so that she can win. But the output has three values, which correspond to each of the three tiles in the input? Or perhaps each of the three tiles starts a separate consideration.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nInput:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nOutput:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nSo, for the first input string, she already has a shuntsu (1s, 2s, 3s), so the minimal draw is 0. For the second, she has a koutsu (all 9m), so 0. For the third, she has 3p, 9m, 2p. She needs to draw one tile to form a shuntsu, like adding 1p or 4p. So the output is [0,0,1].\n\nSo the output is three numbers, each corresponding to each of the three initial tiles. So for each of the three initial hands, compute the minimal draws needed to form a mentsu. Then, output those three numbers.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each of the three initial hands (each consisting of three tiles), compute the minimal number of tiles needed to add to form at least one mentsu. Then, output the three numbers as space-separated strings.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to handling each of the three hands separately. For each hand, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that within the total tiles (original three plus added ones), there's a mentsu.\n\nHow do we model this?\n\nEach hand is a collection of three tiles. We need to consider all possible ways to add tiles (including duplicates) such that after adding, the combined set contains at least one mentsu.\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of tiles to add for each hand.\n\nSo, the steps for each hand are:\n\n1. Find all possible triplets (koutsu or shuntsu) that could be formed, possibly using some existing tiles and adding others.\n\n2. For each possible triplet, calculate how many tiles are missing from the current hand, considering that each added tile can be any tile (including those already present).\n\n3. The minimal number of tiles needed is the minimal count among all possible triplets.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, and we can have multiple copies, perhaps the approach is to generate all possible triplets (koutsu and shuntsu) and compute the minimal additions required.\n\nWait, but considering all possible triplets is manageable since the number is limited.\n\nSo, for each hand, process it as follows:\n\n- Enumerate all possible triplets (koutsu or shuntsu) that could be formed, possibly using some of the current tiles.\n\n- For each triplet, determine how many tiles are missing from the current hand, and thus how many tiles need to be added.\n\n- The minimal number across all possible triplets is the answer for that hand.\n\nBut wait, what's the maximum possible triplet count? Let's see:\n\nFor a koutsu, each is three same tiles. So for each possible tile (like 1m, 2m, etc.), there's a triplet.\n\nSo 9 suits × 9 numbers = 81 possible koutsu.\n\nFor a shuntsu, each is a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for each suit, there are 7 possible sequences (1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9). So 3 ×7=21 shuntsu.\n\nSo total triplets are 81",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current hand of three tiles. Each tile is represented by a number and a suit, and she can draw any tile, including duplicates.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input**: Read the input which consists of three strings, each representing a tile.\n2. **Generate All Possible Mentsu**: For each hand, generate all possible triplets (koutsu) and sequences (shuntsu). A koutsu is three identical tiles, and a shuntsu is three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n3. **Check Each Triplet**: For each possible triplet, determine how many tiles are missing from the current hand. The minimal number of tiles needed to complete any triplet is the answer for that hand.\n4. **Output Results**: For each of the three initial hands, compute the minimal number of tiles needed and print the results.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef min_draws(tiles):\n    # Generate all possible triplets (koutsu and shuntsu)\n    suits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    nums = list(range(1, 10))\n    \n    # Koutsu: all possible triplets of the same tile\n    koutsu = []\n    for num in nums:\n        for suit in suits:\n            koutsu.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Shuntsu: all possible sequences in each suit\n    shuntsu = []\n    for suit in suits:\n        for i in range(1, 7):\n            sequence = [(i, suit), (i+1, suit), (i+2, suit)]\n            shuntsu.append(sequence)\n    \n    # Combine all possible triplets\n    all_triples = koutsu + shuntsu\n    \n    min_add = float('inf')\n    current = {(tile[0], tile[1]) for tile in tiles}\n    \n    for trip in all_triples:\n        trip_set = set(trip)\n        # Count how many tiles are already present\n        present = 0\n        for t in trip_set:\n            if t in current:\n                present += 1\n        # Number of tiles needed to add\n        add = len(trip_set) - present\n        if add < min_add:\n            min_add = add\n    return min_add\n\n# Read input\ntiles_list = input().split()\ntiles = []\nfor t in tiles_list:\n    num, suit = t[0], t[1]\n    tiles.append((int(num), suit))\n\n# Process each hand and find min draws\nresults = []\nfor i in range(3):\n    current_hand = tiles[i:i+3]\n    draws = min_draws(current_hand)\n    results.append(str(draws))\n\nprint(' '.join(results))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Parsing Input**: The input is read and split into individual tiles, each represented as a tuple of number and suit.\n2. **Generating Triplets**: We generate all possible koutsu (triplets of the same tile) and shuntsu (sequences of three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n3. **Checking Each Triplet**: For each triplet, we check how many tiles from the triplet are already present in the current hand. The number of additional tiles needed to complete the triplet is calculated.\n4. **Finding Minimum Draws**: The minimum number of additional tiles needed across all possible triplets is determined for each hand.\n5. **Output**: The results for each of the three initial hands are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu and ensures we find the minimal number of draws needed for each hand.",
