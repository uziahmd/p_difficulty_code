He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Shapur is trying to capture Valerian by opening doors. The problem involves converting a number from base a to base b, but with some special rules if the base is Roman (denoted by 'R'). \n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the input consists of multiple test cases. For each case, we have two lines: the first line has a and b, which are integers representing the starting base and the target base. The second line has a string representing a number c in base a. We need to convert c into base b, following the rules of the Roman numeral system if b is 10 or more, I think. Wait, no, wait—wait, the note says that the second part of the door can be either an integer b or 'R'. So, when the door's second part is R, it's the Roman system. So, for example, if the second part is '2', then it's base 2. If it's 'R', then the target base is 10, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: \"The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R.\" So, the second part being 'R' implies that the target base is 10. Because in Roman numerals, each digit is represented by a symbol, but the overall number is treated as base 10. So, when the door's second part is 'R', the target base is 10. Otherwise, it's the integer value of that part.\n\nWait, no. Let me read again: \"the second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R.\" Oh, wait, no. The second part is either the integer number b (like 5) or R. So, when the second part is R, the target base is 10. Because in the examples given, for instance, one of the inputs is '16 R\\n5', and the output is 'V'. Wait, wait, let's look at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nHmm, so for the second case, the input is 16 in base R (which is base 10), and the output is V, which is 5. So, 16 in base 10 is 16, but wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the second part is R, so the target base is 10. So the number c is in base a, which is 10, and we have to convert it to base 10. Wait, but 16 in base 10 is 16, but the output is V, which is 5. That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the second part is not the target base but is part of the door's mechanism. Oh, the problem statement says: \"c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b.\" So, the target base is b. But if the door's second part is R, then the target base is 10. Wait, the problem statement says that the second part is either an integer number b or R. So, when the second part is R, the target base is 10. Otherwise, it's the integer value of that part.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the second case is a=10, b=R. So, the target base is 10. So, the number c is 16 in base a (base 10), which is 16. Then we convert 16 to base 10, which is 16. But the output is 'V', which is 5. That doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: Each door has four parts. The first is a, the second is either b or R, the third is c, and the fourth is empty. To open the door, c (in base a) must be written in base b. So, the target base is b. But if the second part is R, then b is 10. So, in that case, the target base is 10.\n\nSo, for each test case, the target base is determined by the second part of the door: if it's R, target is 10; else, it's the integer value of the second part.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the second test case is ['16 R\\n5'], which I think is a=16, b=R. So, the target base",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, considering special rules for the Roman numeral system. The problem involves reading multiple test cases, each specifying two bases and a number in one of these bases, then converting the number to the second base while handling special cases for Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** We read multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers representing the starting base `a` and the target base `b`. The second line contains a string representing a number `c` in base `a`.\n\n2. **Determine Target Base:** If the target base `b` is specified as 'R', it means we are converting to base 10 (Roman numerals). Otherwise, `b` is used directly as the target base.\n\n3. **Conversion Logic:**\n   - For non-Roman bases, convert the number from base `a` to base `b` using standard base conversion.\n   - For Roman numerals (target base 10), convert the number to its Roman representation by processing each digit according to Roman numeral rules.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases:** Ensure that leading zeros are omitted in the output and handle numbers up to the maximum constraints efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    \n    def int_from_base(s, base):\n        val = 0\n        for c in s:\n            val = val * base + int(c)\n        return val\n\n    def int_to_base(n, base):\n        if n == 0:\n            return '0'\n        digits = []\n        while n > 0:\n            digits.append(str(n % base))\n            n = n // base\n        return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n    def decimal_to_roman(num):\n        val = [\n            (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        res = []\n        for i, (v, s) in enumerate(val):\n            while num >= v:\n                res.append(s)\n                num -= v\n        return ''.join(res)\n\n    for case in input:\n        if not case:\n            continue\n        a, b_part = case.split()\n        a = int(a)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            target_base = 10\n            b = target_base\n        else:\n            b = int(b_part)\n        \n        c_str = ''\n        while True:\n            line = input[input.index(case) + 1]\n            break\n        parts = line.split()\n        c_str = parts[-1]\n        c_val = int_from_base(c_str, a)\n        if b == 10:\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(c_val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            result = int_to_base(c_val, b)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing each test case.\n- **Base Conversion Functions:** `int_from_base` converts a string in a given base to an integer, and `int_to_base` converts an integer back to the specified base as a string.\n- **Roman Numeral Conversion:** The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal number to its Roman numeral equivalent by iterating through predefined values and symbols.\n- **Handling Each Test Case:** For each test case, the target base is determined, and the number is converted accordingly. The results are printed without leading zeros.\n\nThis approach ensures that each number is accurately converted from its initial base to the target base, handling both standard bases and Roman numerals efficiently.",
