For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for every binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me try to understand what a beautiful multiset is. So, a beautiful multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n. For each string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And we need to find the number of ways to choose all c_s such that the maximum size of such a multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm, but wait, the problem says \"for every binary string s of length from 1 to n\". Oh, wait no—the beautiful multiset is of length exactly n, but the condition applies to all s of lengths 1..n as prefixes. So for each s, count how many strings in the multiset have s as a prefix and ensure that this count is ≤ c_s.\n\nThe task is to compute the number of ways to choose the c_s's so that the maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nSo, first, I think I need to model this as a combinatorial problem where for each possible choice of c_s's, the maximum possible size is f. But since f can be up to 2e5, we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The beautiful multiset can be represented by the counts of each possible string of length n. But perhaps it's better to model this using a trie structure because the constraints on the c_s's form a tree-like hierarchy.\n\nEach node in the trie represents a binary string s. The root is the empty string, but since our strings are of length at least 1, maybe the root isn't considered. Or perhaps the root is considered as the prefix for all single-character strings. Wait, no: for example, for s = \"0\", any string starting with \"0\" will include it as a prefix. So the structure is a trie where each node represents a certain prefix, and the children are the extensions by 0 or 1.\n\nThe c_s for each s determines the maximum number of times s can appear in the multiset, but also affects its descendants. Because if s is a prefix of t, then the count for t depends on the count of s's and their extensions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So for each string t of length m ≤ n, the number of strings in the multiset that start with t is the sum over all extensions of t to length n, multiplied by their counts. No, wait: more precisely, for a given t, the number of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix is equal to the sum of the counts of all the suffixes of t that are of length n. Wait, no: for example, t is \"01\", which is of length 2. The strings in the multiset of length 2 that have \"01\" as a prefix are \"01\" itself. But if n is larger, say 3, then \"010\", \"011\", etc., would also have \"01\" as a prefix.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a given t of length m, the number of strings in the multiset of length exactly n that have t as a prefix is equal to the number of extensions of t to length n. For example, if t is \"00\" (length 2) and n=3, then the extensions are \"000\", \"001\", so two options. So, for each t of length m, the count of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix is equal to the number of possible ways to extend t to length n, which is 2^{n - m}.\n\nWait, no. Because the multiset contains only strings of length exactly n. So for each t of length m, the number of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix is exactly the number of strings of length n that start with t. So for t of length m, this is 2^{n - m}, but only if m <=n. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nSo for each t, the number is 2^{n - |t|} if |t| ≤n, else zero.\n\nBut in our problem, the c_t is given for each t, and the condition is that for each t, the number of such strings in the multiset is ≤ c_t.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is that for every s of length 1..n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, for each s, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. Which is, for a given s, the number of its extensions to length n. So for s of length m, the count is 2^{n - m} multiplied by the number of times s is chosen as a base for the multiset.\n\nWait, no. Because the multiset is a collection of strings of length exactly n. So for a particular s, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. That is, for each t that is an extension of s (i.e., t starts with s and has length n), the count is the sum of the counts of all such t in the multiset.\n\nSo, for example, if s is \"0\", then any string of length n that starts with 0 will contribute 1 to the count for s. So the count is the total number of such t in the multiset.\n\nNow, the problem is to assign c_s for each s such that for all s, the count is ≤ c_s. And we need the maximum possible size of the multiset to be exactly f.\n\nSo, to find the number of valid assignments of c_s's that allow the maximum possible size of the multiset to be f.\n\nHmm. So the approach is to model this as a system of inequalities, where for each s, the count of s's extensions in the multiset is ≤ c_s. The goal is to maximize the total number of strings in the multiset under these constraints, and count the number of c assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nThis sounds like a linear programming problem, but with variables being the c_s's. But since the variables are integers, it's integer programming, which is hard. But given the constraints on n (up to 15), perhaps there's a way to model this efficiently.\n\nWait, another angle: the maximum size is determined by the c_s's. So for each s, the count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix, which is equal to the sum of the multiplicities of all t that are extensions of s. So, for each s, the count is the sum of the multiplicities of all t that start with s.\n\nBut the multiplicities are determined by the c_s's and their subordinates. So perhaps the problem can be modeled as a tree, where each node represents a string s, and the constraints flow from parent nodes to their children.\n\nWait, think of the trie again. Each node s has children s0 and s1, which are the extensions by 0 and 1. For each s, the count of s in the multiset is the number of times s is included, but also contributes to its ancestors. For example, including s contributes 1 to the count of s, and also 1 to each of its ancestors.\n\nWait no. Wait, if s is included, then it contributes 1 to the count of s (since s is a prefix of itself), and also contributes 1 to the count of all its proper prefixes. So including s increases the counts of all of its ancestors in the trie.\n\nTherefore, the count for a node t is the sum of the multiplicities of all its descendants (including itself). Because each descendant contributes 1 to t's count.\n\nAh, right. So for each node t, the count C_t is equal to the sum of the multiplicities of all strings that are extensions of t. So if M_t is the multiplicity of t in the multiset, then C_t = sum_{s extends t} M_s.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nFor each t, sum_{s extends t} M_s ≤ c_t.\n\nAnd the objective is to maximize sum_{t} M_t.\n\nWe need to find the number of c assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm, okay. So this is a problem where we need to model the constraints as a tree, and for each node, the sum of its children and itself is bounded by c_t. We need to find the number of c assignments such that the maximum possible M satisfies the constraints is exactly f.\n\nBut how?\n\nI think we can model this as a dynamic programming problem on the trie.\n\nWait, but the trie can be up to depth n, which is manageable since n is up to 15.\n\nLet me think about the problem as follows:\n\nEach node t has a certain number of M_t, which is the multiplicity of the string t in the multiset.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\nM_t ≤ c_t\n\nFor all parents p of t, M_t contributes to their counts. So for each ancestor p of t, including t itself, the sum of M's along the path from p down to the leaves must be ≤ c_p.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum for p is the sum of all M_s where s starts with p. So for each p, the sum of M_s for all s that are extensions of p must be ≤ c_p.\n\nSo the constraints form a tree where each node's constraint depends on all its descendants.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of a max-flow problem or a hierarchical constraint system.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a tree where each node's M_t can be determined based on its children.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the constraints form a tree, perhaps we can perform a bottom-up DP, where for each node, we determine the maximum possible sum of M's under its subtree, given certain constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of the inclusion of each node's M_t.\n\nEach node t can have 0 or more occurrences in the multiset. The decision to include M_t affects all of its ancestors' constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a tree where each node's M_t contributes to the constraints of its ancestors, and the total is the sum of all M_t's.\n\nSo, the key is to model the constraints as a tree and find for each possible c assignment, whether the maximum possible sum is f.\n\nBut directly enumerating all possible c assignments is impossible because k can be up to 2e5.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding the number of possible c assignments where the maximum sum is exactly f. So, for a given assignment of c's, the maximum sum is f. We need to count the number of such assignments.\n\nBut how do we represent the constraints? It's a bit tricky.\n\nAnother approach: Let’s consider that for a given c assignment, the maximum sum is f if and only if there exists a way to assign M_t's such that all the constraints are satisfied and the sum is exactly f.\n\nSo, for each c assignment, we can compute whether such an M assignment exists, and the sum is exactly f.\n\nBut even this approach may not be feasible because the number of possible c assignments is too large.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's model the problem as a system where each node's M_t can be between 0 and c_t, and for each node, the sum of M_t and all its children's M's is constrained by the ancestors.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find for each node t, the maximum possible sum of M's in the subtree rooted at t, given the c_t's. Then, the overall maximum sum is the sum of all these maximums.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the constraints can be viewed as a tree where each node's sum is bounded by c_t, and the M's are the variables. The problem is to find the number of c assignments such that the maximum possible sum is exactly f.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem as a tree where each node's contribution to the sum is dependent on its own M and those of its descendants. Then, for each node, we can calculate the minimal and maximal possible sums under the constraints.\n\nWait, maybe for each node t, the maximum possible M_t is min(c_t, ...). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of inclusion-exclusion. For a given c assignment, the maximum sum is f if and only if the sum can be f while satisfying all the constraints.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of c assignments where the maximum possible sum is exactly f.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps we can model this using generating functions, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Since the constraints form a tree, perhaps the problem can be broken down into independent subtrees. But that doesn't seem right because the constraints are hierarchical.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints can be rephrased as for each node t, the sum of M_t plus the sum of M's of its children (and their children, etc.) must be ≤ c_t.\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because for each node t, the sum is the sum of M's of all descendants, including itself. So for each t, the sum S_t = M_t + M_t0 + M_t1 + ... (where t0 and t1 are the direct children of t).\n\nThus, for each node t, S_t ≤ c_t.\n\nThe total sum is the sum of all M's, which is the same as the sum of S_root, because the root's S includes all M's.\n\nWait, no. Because S_root is the sum of all M's, since the root is the empty string, and all M's are descendants of the root.\n\nWait, in the trie, the root is the empty string, and each node represents a string. So S_root is the sum of all M_t's, because every M_t contributes to S_root.\n\nYes, because every M_t is an extension of the root.\n\nSo the total sum is S_root, which is subject to the constraint that S_root ≤ c_root.\n\nWait, but the root's c is c_{\"\"}, which is part of the c assignments.\n\nSo, for the multiset to be non-empty, c_root must be ≥ 0.\n\nBut the problem requires that the maximum possible sum is exactly f. So, the sum S_root must be exactly f, and all constraints must be satisfied.\n\nSo, for a given c assignment, the maximum sum is f if and only if S_root can be f, given the constraints.\n\nWait, but how do we model this for all c assignments?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the c assignments as parameters, and for each possible assignment, compute the maximum sum. But again, since the c's can be up to 2e5, this is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of considering all possible c assignments, perhaps model the problem in terms of the maximum sum f and see how the c's can be assigned to allow exactly f.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be seen as a tree where each node t has a variable d_t representing the maximum number of M's that can be taken from the subtree rooted at t, given the constraints.\n\nThen, for each node t, d_t is the minimum between c_t and the sum of d_s for all children s of t.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each node t, the maximum sum of M's in its subtree is the sum of M's in t plus the sum of M's in each of its children. But each M in t contributes to t's c_t constraint, which is c_t >= M_t + sum of M's of its children.\n\nSo, perhaps for each node t, the maximum possible sum of M's in its subtree is min(c_t, sum of d_s for s in children of t) + d_t). Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, for each node t, the maximum M_t is min(c_t - sum of M_s for s in children of t, but that might not capture it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum for a node t's subtree is the sum of M_t plus the sum of the maximum sums of its children, but this sum cannot exceed c_t.\n\nSo, for each node t, the maximum possible sum is min( c_t, sum_{children s} (max_sum(s)) + M_t ). Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node t, the maximum possible sum is the sum of M_t plus the sum of the maximum sums of its children, but this sum must be ≤ c_t.\n\nSo, for each node t:\n\nd_t = min( c_t, M_t + sum_{children s} d_s )\n\nBut M_t can be anything up to d_t, but wait, because M_t is constrained by d_t.\n\nWait, maybe not. Perhaps for the maximum sum, M_t can be up to d_t, but the sum of the children's d's plus M_t must be ≤ c_t.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node t, the maximum sum is the minimum between c_t and the sum of all the M's in the subtree. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum for the entire tree is the sum of all M's, which is the sum of M's for each node. But each M is constrained by its own c_t and all its ancestors.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for similar problems or standard approaches.\n\nWait, this problem resembles the problem of counting the number of ways to assign values to a tree such that certain constraints are met, often solved with dynamic programming on trees.\n\nIn this case, the tree is a trie with each node representing a binary string, and the constraints are that for each node, the sum of M's in its subtree is ≤ c_t.\n\nThe goal is to count the number of c assignments such that the maximum possible sum is exactly f.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model this as a tree where each node t's contribution is the sum of M's in its subtree, which must be ≤ c_t.\n\nThen, the problem becomes determining, for each possible c assignment, whether the maximum sum is exactly f, and count the number of such assignments.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to model this efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the maximum sum is determined by the c assignments. So, for each c assignment, the maximum sum is f if and only if the sum of M's is f, and all constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo, for each c assignment, the maximum sum can be found by solving for the M's that maximize the sum under the constraints.\n\nThis maximum is achieved when for each node t, the sum of M's in its subtree is as large as possible, i.e., M_t is as large as possible, given the constraints.\n\nWait, yes. Because each M_t can be increased until it hits the limit imposed by its parent.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is determined by greedily setting each M_t to the maximum possible value, given the constraints from above.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum for a given c assignment is the sum of the maximum possible M's, which can be computed via a top-down approach.\n\nSo, for each node t, the maximum possible M_t is min(c_t, sum_{children s} M_s + M_t). Wait, that's circular.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum sum for each node t is the minimum between c_t and the sum of the maximum sums of its children plus M_t.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nFor a given c assignment, the maximum sum is the sum of M_t's, where each M_t is as large as possible without violating the constraints.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\nFor each t, sum_{s extends t} M_s ≤ c_t.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{s is child of t, or t itself} M_s ≤ c_t.\n\nSo, for each node t, the sum of M_t and all its descendants must be ≤ c_t.\n\nThus, the maximum sum is achieved when each node's sum is as large as possible, but not exceeding c_t.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum sum can be computed recursively.\n\nSo, for each node t, the maximum possible sum for its subtree is the minimum of c_t and the sum of the maximum sums of its children plus M_t.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe maximum sum for the root node is the sum of all M_t's, which must be ≤ c_root.\n\nFor the root's children, each child t, the sum of M_t plus its own subtree's maximum sum must be ≤ c_root.\n\nSimilarly, for each node t, the sum of M_t plus the sum of the maximum sums of its children must be ≤ c_t.\n\nSo, the maximum sum for t's subtree is the minimum between c_t and (M_t + sum of maximum sums of children of t).\n\nBut since M_t can be as large as possible, perhaps the maximum sum for t's subtree is min(c_t, M_t + sum_children).\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum for t's subtree is the minimum between c_t and the sum of the maximum sums of its children plus the maximum possible M_t.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a problem where for each node t, the maximum sum is the minimum between c_t and the sum of the maximum sums of its children plus some term.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all M_t's, which must satisfy for each node t:\n\nsum_{s is in the subtree of t} M_s ≤ c_t.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is the minimal possible sum that satisfies all these inequalities.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum is the sum of all M_t's, and each inequality is a constraint on the sum of a certain subset.\n\nThis looks like a system of linear inequalities, and the maximum sum is the largest possible value that satisfies all constraints.\n\nSo, for a given c assignment, the maximum sum is the solution to the system:\n\nFor each node t, sum_{s ∈ subtree(t)} M_s ≤ c_t.\n\nWe want to maximize sum M_s.\n\nThis is a linear program. The maximum is achieved when each inequality is tight, i.e., sum M_s = c_t for as many t as possible.\n\nBut since the constraints form a tree, the system can be solved efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this with a greedy algorithm. For each node t, the sum of its subtree is the minimum of c_t and the sum of the children's subtree sums plus something.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum can be computed by traversing the tree from the leaves upwards.\n\nSo, for each node t, the maximum sum for its subtree is the minimum between c_t and the sum of the maximum sums of its children plus the M_t.\n\nWait, but M_t is part of the sum, so it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node t, the maximum sum for its subtree is min(c_t, sum of children's maximum sums + M_t). But then M_t can be as high as possible, so perhaps the maximum sum is min(c_t, sum_children + M_t), but M_t can be set to whatever allows the sum to be as large as possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the problem in terms of the maximum sum.\n\nFor a given c assignment, the maximum sum is the sum of all M_t's, subject to for each t, sum_{s in subtree(t)} M_s ≤ c_t.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that for each t, the sum of its subtree is ≤ c_t.\n\nThe maximum sum is achieved when for each t, the sum of its subtree is exactly c_t, but this may not always be possible due to the hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the sum for a parent t is the sum of its subtree, which includes the sum of its children's subtrees.\n\nSo, for the root, the sum is the sum of all M's. For each child of root, their sum is ≤ c_child, and the sum of the root's subtree is the sum of all M's, which must be ≤ c_root.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nsum_root = sum of M's ≤ c_root.\n\nsum_left_child = sum of M's in left subtree ≤ c_left_child.\n\nsum_right_child = sum of M's in right subtree ≤ c_right_child.\n\nand so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the minimum of all c_t's along the path from the root to the deepest node.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the minimum c_t along the path from the root to any leaf.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's take the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n1 42 2\n\nSample Output:\n3\n\nIn this case, n=1, so the strings are \"0\" and \"1\".\n\nThe c assignments are:\n\nc_0 = 0, c_1=2 → maximum sum is 2.\n\nWait, but according to the note, one of the valid assignments is c_0=0, c_1=2, which gives a multiset {1,1} with size 2.\n\nAnother assignment is c_0=1, c_1=1, giving multiset {0,1}, size 2.\n\nThird assignment is c_0=2, c_1=0, giving multiset {0,0}, size 2.\n\nWait, but in each case, the maximum sum is 2.\n\nSo, the count is 3.\n\nHmm. So, the maximum sum is fixed at f=2, and the c assignments must be such that the maximum sum is exactly 2.\n\nSo, for each c assignment, the maximum sum is f. We need to count the number of c assignments where the maximum sum is exactly f.\n\nSo, how do we compute this?\n\nI think the key is to model the problem as a tree where each node's c_t is a variable, and the constraints are that the sum of all M's in its subtree is ≤ c_t.\n\nThe maximum sum is f, so the sum of M's must be f.\n\nBut how to count the number of c assignments that allow such a sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a tree-based dynamic programming problem, where for each node, we track the possible contributions to the sum.\n\nSo, for each node t, and for each possible value s (the sum contributed by the subtree of t), we can track how many ways to assign the c's such that the sum is s.\n\nThen, the transitions would involve combining the contributions of the children.\n\nBut considering that n is up to 15, the number of nodes is 2^15 = 32768, which is manageable.\n\nBut the sum s could be up to f, which is up to 2e5. So, the DP state needs to track for each node t and possible sum s, the number of ways.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP state is defined as dp[t][s] = number of ways to assign c's in the subtree of t such that the sum of M's in the subtree is s.\n\nBut how to model the constraints.\n\nWait, for each node t, the sum of M's in its subtree must be ≤ c_t.\n\nSo, for the root, the sum must be exactly f, which is given.\n\nSo, the root's sum is f.\n\nFor each node t, when combining its children's sums, the sum of the children plus M_t must be ≤ c_t.\n\nWait, but M_t is part of the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node t, the sum of its subtree is the sum of M_t plus the sum of the children's subtree sums.\n\nSo, for each node t, the sum is s_t = M_t + sum(s_children).\n\nAnd for each t, s_t ≤ c_t.\n\nWe need to count the number of c assignments such that the sum for the root is exactly f.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node t, we can model the possible sum s_t and the minimal required c_t.\n\nBecause for a given s_t, the minimal c_t is s_t.\n\nSo, for each node t and possible sum s_t, we can compute the minimal c_t needed, which is s_t.\n\nBut for the problem, we're to count the number of c assignments that allow exactly f as the sum. So, the minimal c_t's must be such that they allow the sum to be f.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node t, the c_t must be ≥ the sum of its subtree s_t.\n\nBut for our problem, the sum for the root is f, so c_root must be ≥f.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the maximum possible size is f, which implies that the sum cannot be more than f.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nFor each node t, s_t ≤ c_t.\n\nAdditionally, for the root, s_root = f.\n\nSo, for the root, c_root must be ≥f.\n\nFor other nodes, c_t can be any value ≥ s_t.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the sum s_root is f, and for each node t, s_t must be ≤ c_t.\n\nBut for the root, s_root is f, so c_root must be ≥f.\n\nFor the children of the root, their s_t can be any value ≤ c_child, but their sum plus their own s_t's must contribute to s_root.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal c_t for each node t is s_t, but for the problem, the c_t's can be larger than that.\n\nSo, for the problem, the c_t can be any value ≥ s_t, except for the root, which must be ≥ f.\n\nWait, but that's only if the sum is f.\n\nSo, for the root, c_root must be exactly f, or can be larger?\n\nWait, the maximum sum is f, which means that the sum cannot exceed f. So, for the root, s_root must be ≤ c_root.\n\nBut s_root is exactly f, so c_root must be ≥f.\n\nBut the problem allows the sum to be exactly f, so c_root can be any value ≥f.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because other constraints may require c_root to be higher.\n\nNo, because other constraints are s_t ≤ c_t for all t, and s_root = f.\n\nSo, for the root, c_root must be ≥f.\n\nFor other nodes, c_t can be any value ≥s_t.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for a node t, its s_t is the sum of M's in its subtree. This s_t must be ≤ c_t.\n\nBut when considering the subtree of t, the s_t is determined by the sum of M_t and the sum of its children's s's.\n\nSo, for each node t, the sum s_t is M_t plus the sum of the children's s's.\n\nSo, for each node t, s_t can range from 0 to min(c_t, ... ), but the exact range depends on the children.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the problem with dynamic programming, where for each node t, we track the possible s_t values and the number of ways to achieve them.\n\nThe transitions would involve combining the possible s values of the children, adding M_t, and ensuring that s_t ≤ c_t.\n\nBut M_t can vary as long as s_t = M_t + sum_children's s's ≤ c_t.\n\nWait, but M_t is part of the sum s_t. So for each node t, the sum s_t is M_t plus the sum of the children's s's.\n\nSo, the sum s_t can be written as s_t = M_t + sum_children.\n\nBut M_t can be any value between 0 and (c_t - sum_children).\n\nWait, but for the purposes of the DP, perhaps we can model the sum s_t as being M_t plus the sum of the children's s's.\n\nSo, for each node t, and for a given sum s_t, the number of ways is determined by the ways to assign M_t and the children's s's such that s_t = M_t + sum_children and M_t ≤ c_t.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node t and sum s_t, the minimal c_t is s_t, but for our problem, the c_t can be any value ≥s_t.\n\nBut since the problem requires that the sum is exactly f for the root, the c_root must be ≥f.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as:\n\nFor each node t, c_t must be ≥ the sum of M's in its subtree, which is s_t.\n\nBut the sum s_root is exactly f, so c_root must be ≥f.\n\nBut other c_t's can be as low as s_t.\n\nSo, for the problem, the c_t's can be any values ≥ s_t for all t except the root, which must be ≥f.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the c_t's are given as 0 ≤ c_t ≤k.\n\nSo, for each node t, c_t must be ≥ s_t, but also ≤k.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\ns_root = f.\n\nFor each node t, s_t ≤ c_t ≤k.\n\nAlso, for each node t, s_t = M_t + sum_{children s} s_s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of c assignments where:\n\n- s_root = f.\n\n- For each node t, s_t ≤ c_t ≤k.\n\n- For each node t, s_t = M_t + sum_{children s} s_s.\n\nSo, the approach is to model this as a DP on the trie, where for each node t, we track possible s_t values, and for each, compute the number of ways to assign c_t such that s_t ≤c_t ≤k.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think about the DP state.\n\nDefine dp[t][s] as the number of ways to assign c's in the subtree rooted at t such that the sum s_t is exactly s, and the sum s is within [s_min, s_max], where s_min and s_max are determined by the constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each node t, and for each possible s_t, compute the number of ways to assign c's in the subtree such that s_t is achieved, and the c_t is set to a value that allows s_t.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the problem as a product of choices for each node, considering their children.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached recursively.\n\nFor each node t, the sum s_t is M_t plus the sum of s_children.\n\nM_t can be any value from 0 to (c_t - sum_children).\n\nBut since we're trying to find the number of c assignments that allow the sum to be exactly f, perhaps the approach is to model the problem as a tree of possibilities, where each node contributes to the sum and the c constraints.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe problem can be transformed into a product of independent choices for each node, given the constraints from the children.\n\nBut the constraints are hierarchical, so perhaps we can model this with a DP that tracks the sum up to each node.\n\nLet's consider the trie as a rooted tree, with the root as the empty string.\n\nFor each node t, we can define a function that, given the current sum and the constraints, returns the number of ways to assign c's in the subtree of t.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node t, we can compute a generating function that represents the possible sums s_t and the number of ways to achieve them.\n\nThe generating function for t would be the product of the generating functions of its children, each shifted by some variable, and then adding M_t, which can be any value up to the remaining capacity.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, for each node t, the generating function is the convolution of the children's generating functions, scaled by some factor.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node t, the generating function is the sum over s of the number of ways to achieve sum s for the subtree of t, considering the constraints.\n\nFor the leaves, which are the strings of length n, each has a subtree consisting of only themselves. So, for a leaf t, the sum s_t can be either 0 or 1 (since M_t can be 0 or 1), but wait, no. Because M_t can be any value up to c_t, but c_t is a variable.\n\nWait, but in the DP approach, perhaps for each node t, we model the possible sums s_t and the number of ways to achieve them, given the c_t's.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can model the problem by considering each node t and determining the minimal and maximal possible c_t, given the constraints from the children.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node t, the sum s_t is the sum of M_t and the sums of its children's subtrees.\n\nSo, s_t = M_t + sum_{children s} s_s.\n\nBut M_t can be any non-negative integer such that s_t ≤ c_t.\n\nBut the c_t's are variables, and we're to count the number of c assignments that allow s_root = f.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node t, the sum s_t can be any value between 0 and c_t.\n\nBut for the root, s_t must be exactly f.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be thought of as building a tree where each node t has a sum s_t, and the sum is passed up to the parent.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps it's time to look for hints or similar problems.\n\nAfter some thinking, I recall that in some competitive programming problems, similar constraints are handled using a tree DP approach where for each node, we track the maximum possible sum under the constraints, and use memoization to count the ways.\n\nIn this problem, since the constraints are additive, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nFor each node t, the maximum possible sum in its subtree is the minimum of c_t and the sum of the maximum sums of its children plus some value.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node t, the maximum possible sum s_t is the minimum between c_t and the sum of the maximum sums of its children plus M_t.\n\nBut since M_t is part of the sum, perhaps s_t can be as large as c_t, but not larger.\n\nSo, for each node t, s_t = min(c_t",

Each node corresponds to a binary string and has children representing its extensions by '0' and '1'.\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: For each node, a DP table is maintained where keys are possible sums of string counts in the subtree rooted at that node, and values are the number of ways to achieve those sums.\n3. **Generating Functions**: Each node's generating function is computed by combining the generating functions of its children, considering the constraints imposed by \\( c_t \\).\n4. **Root Node Handling**: The root node's sum must be exactly \\( f \\). The number of valid configurations is determined by the number of ways to achieve this sum and the valid range for \\( c_0 \\) (the root's \\( c_t \\)).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the number of valid configurations using dynamic programming on the trie structure, ensuring all constraints are met.",
