String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of \"beautiful\" strings based on certain criteria. The beautiful string has to meet specific conditions regarding the count of 0s and 1s, and also how these counts can be achieved through a series of modifications.\n\nLet me try to break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the string is beautiful if:\n1. It consists only of 0s and 1s.\n2. The number of 0s is exactly n.\n3. The number of 1s is exactly m.\n\nAdditionally, we can modify the string in a specific way to get from some original string to g (which is either 0 or 1). Each modification is replacing the last two characters with one character: if both are 0, replace with 0; else replace with 1.\n\nWait, no—wait, the modification is replacing two last characters with one. So each modification reduces the length by 1. For example, \"01010\" becomes \"0100\" after one modification, then \"011\" after another. Each step replaces the last two chars with one.\n\nBut the initial string can be any length that allows such modifications. Also, the problem says that the modifications can be zero or more. So the modified string must have a certain form that can be obtained via these operations.\n\nWait, but what's the starting point? Oh, right, the problem says that we can obtain g from the string s with some modifications. So s can be any string that can be transformed into a string that ends with g, possibly after some modifications.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The way the problem is phrased is a bit unclear. Let me read again:\n\n\"A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: replace the last two characters with one other character. This character is 1 if it replaces two zeros, otherwise 0.\"\n\nSo each modification reduces the length by 1. So to perform a modification, the string must have length ≥ 2.\n\nNow, the goal is to find all beautiful strings s, which satisfy the counts of 0s and 1s, and such that s can be transformed into a string where the last character is g, using some number of modifications (possibly zero).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the character g is obtained from s via some modifications. So the resulting string after modifications must end with g.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is that you can perform any number of modifications (including zero) to s, and the result must end with g. Or perhaps, the resulting string after some modifications must be equal to a string that ends with g.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct interpretation is that s can be transformed into a string t via some modifications, where t has the same counts of 0s and 1s as s (since each modification replaces two characters with one, so the total count changes by -1. But wait, when you replace two 0s with one 0, the count decreases by 1. Similarly for two 1s into one 1, count decreases by 1. If you have one 0 and one 1, you replace them with 1, so the count of 0s decreases by 1, and 1s remain the same. So the counts can change during the process.\n\nWait, this complicates things because the initial string's counts may not match the final counts after modifications. So the beautiful string s must be such that after some modifications, the final string ends with g. But the final string's counts are different from s's counts.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the beautiful string s meets the criteria of having exactly n 0s and m 1s. So regardless of the modifications, the initial string has those counts. But the problem says that we can obtain g from s via some modifications. So perhaps the process is that s can be modified into a string t, which ends with g, and t has a certain structure that depends on s.\n\nWait, maybe I need to model the problem differently. Let's think about the possible forms a string can take after a series of modifications.\n\nEach modification takes the last two characters and replaces them with one. So the structure of the string evolves as we perform these operations.\n\nLet me consider the possible endings of a string after k modifications. Each modification reduces the length by 1, so starting from some length l, after k steps, the length is l - k.\n\nBut the key thing is the last character after each step. For example:\n\n- Starting with a string like 'a b c d', after one modification, it becomes 'a b c' (the last two 'c d' become something).\n- Then, the next modification would take the last two ('b c') and combine them.\n\nWait, but the order in which you perform modifications can affect the final structure. Hmm, but perhaps there's a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string ending with a specific character 'g' using a series of modifications. Each modification reduces the length of the string by one and replaces the last two characters with a single character based on their values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Modifications**: Each modification reduces the string length by 1. The new character is '0' if both modified characters are '0', otherwise it's '1'. This means the last character after any number of modifications is crucial.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the number of 0s and `j` represents the number of 1s. The value at `dp[i][j]` will store the number of ways to form a string with `i` zeros and `j` ones that can end with 'g'.\n\n3. **State Transitions**:\n   - If the current string ends with '0', consider adding a '0' or combining the last two characters to form '0'.\n   - If the current string ends with '1', consider adding a '1' or combining the last two characters to form '1'.\n\n4. **Base Cases**: Initialize the DP table with base cases where the string starts with either '0' or '1'.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, take modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) at each step to prevent overflow.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\n# dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to have i 0's and j 1's, ending with certain possibilities.\n# Let's represent the state as ending with 0 or 1.\n# So, we'll have two separate DP tables: one for ending with 0 and another for ending with 1.\n\n# dp_end0[i][j]: number of ways to have i 0's and j 1's, ending with 0.\n# dp_end1[i][j]: same, but ending with 1.\n\nmax_len = n + m\n\n# Initialize DP tables\ndp_end0 = [[0]*(m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\ndp_end1 = [[0]*(m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\n# Base case: empty string\ndp_end0[0][0] = 1\ndp_end1[0][0] = 1\n\nfor i in range(max_len + 1):\n    for j in range(m + 1):\n        # Case 1: current string ends with 0\n        if i >= 1:\n            # Add a single 0 at the end\n            dp_end0[i][j] += dp_end0[i-1][j]\n            dp_end0[i][j] %= MOD\n            # Combine two 0s into 0, which requires j >=1 (since total length is i+j)\n            if j >= 1:\n                dp_end0[i][j] += dp_end1[i-1][j-1]\n                dp_end0[i][j] %= MOD\n        else:\n            pass\n        \n        # Case 2: current string ends with 1\n        if j >= 1:\n            dp_end1[i][j] += dp_end1[i][j-1]\n            dp_end1[i][j] %= MOD\n            # Combine two 1s into 1, which requires i >=1\n            if i >= 1:\n                dp_end1[i][j] += dp_end0[i-1][j-1]\n                dp_end1[i][j] %= MOD\n        else:\n            pass\n\n# Now, compute the answer based on g\nif g == 0:\n    answer = (dp_end0[n][m] + dp_end1[n][m]) % MOD\nelse:\n    answer = (dp_end1[n][m] + dp_end0[n][m]) % MOD\n\nprint(answer)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid strings that can be transformed to end with 'g'. By maintaining separate DP tables for strings ending with '0' and '1', we efficiently compute the number of valid configurations considering all possible modifications. The final result is derived from these tables based on the target ending character 'g'.",
