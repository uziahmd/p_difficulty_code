Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of its location. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest radius d where every point on the street [0, l] is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input gives n and l, followed by the list of ai's. So for each lantern, it can cover some interval around its position. The union of all these intervals must cover [0, l]. We need the minimal d where this is true.\n\nWait, but what's the coverage of each lantern? For a lantern at position ai, with radius d, it covers from ai - d to ai + d. But we have to make sure that the union of all these intervals includes [0, l].\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal d such that for every x in [0, l], there exists at least one lantern i where ai - d ≤ x ≤ ai + d.\n\nAlternatively, the entire [0, l] must be covered by the union of all [ai -d, ai +d] intervals.\n\nHow do we find the minimal d?\n\nI remember that this kind of problem can be approached by considering the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns, but perhaps adjusted for the endpoints.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to sort the lantern positions first. Because if the lanterns are not sorted, their coverage might overlap or leave gaps that aren't obvious.\n\nSo step one: sort the array of ai's.\n\nOnce sorted, the idea is to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns (after sorting), as well as the start and end of the street.\n\nFor example, the first lantern may cover from 0 to some point, the next one covers from its position minus d, etc. So the maximum required d would be determined by the largest gap between any two consecutive points, including the start and the end.\n\nWait, let's think about this:\n\nAfter sorting the ai's, we can imagine that each lantern i covers a certain range. The first lantern's leftmost point is ai[0]-d. If this is less than 0, then the coverage starts at 0. Similarly, the last lantern's rightmost point is ai[-1]+d; if this is more than l, then it ends at l.\n\nBut in between, the coverage needs to connect. So the maximum of the following will give us the required d:\n\n- The distance between the start of the street (0) and the first lantern's coverage. That is, if the first lantern's left coverage (ai[0]-d) is less than 0, then the distance from 0 to ai[0]-d is ai[0], so d needs to be at least ai[0] to cover 0. Wait, no. Wait, because the first lantern covers from ai[0]-d to ai[0]+d. To cover 0, we need ai[0] - d <= 0. So d >= ai[0]. Because ai[0] is the position of the first lantern. Wait, no. Because if ai[0] is at position x, then to cover 0, d must be at least x. Because 0 has to be within x-d <= 0 <= x+d. So yes, d >= x.\n\nSimilarly, for the last lantern, the right end must reach l. So l must be <= ai[-1] + d. So d >= l - ai[-1].\n\nThen, between consecutive lanterns, say ai[i] and ai[i+1], the coverage must overlap. So the distance between them should be covered by the sum of their radii. Wait, no, each has radius d, so the coverage of the first extends to ai[i]+d, and the next starts at ai[i+1]-d. These two must meet or overlap. So the condition is ai[i+1] - d <= ai[i] + d. Which simplifies to ai[i+1] - ai[i] <= 2d. So d must be at least (ai[i+1] - ai[i])/2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- ai[0] (to cover the start)\n- (ai[i+1] - ai[i]) / 2 for all consecutive pairs\n- l - ai[-1] (to cover the end)\n\nWait, wait. Because after sorting, the first lantern's position is the earliest, so to cover 0, d must be at least ai[0], because 0 needs to be within ai[0]-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points on a street are covered by the light from one or more lanterns. Each lantern lights up a segment of the street centered at its position with radius \\( d \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps us efficiently analyze the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Coverage Gaps**: We need to ensure that the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\) is covered. The key steps are:\n   - Ensure the first lantern covers the start of the street (0). This requires \\( d \\) to be at least the position of the first lantern.\n   - Ensure the last lantern covers the end of the street (\\( l \\)). This requires \\( d \\) to be at least \\( l - \\) the position of the last lantern.\n   - Ensure each pair of consecutive lanterns overlaps sufficiently. For each pair, the required \\( d \\) must be at least half the distance between them.\n3. **Determine Maximum Requirement**: The minimal \\( d \\) is the maximum value derived from the above considerations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = int(input[1])\n    ai = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    ai.sort()\n    \n    max_d = ai[0]  # To cover 0\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n        current_d = gap / 2\n        if current_d > max_d:\n            max_d = current_d\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - ai[-1])  # To cover l\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to handle the coverage gaps sequentially.\n2. **Initial Check**: If there are no lanterns, the solution is trivial (0).\n3. **First Lantern Coverage**: The first lantern must cover from 0, so \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern.\n4. **Consecutive Gaps**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the coverage must overlap. This is ensured by checking the midpoint distance between each pair.\n5. **Last Lantern Coverage**: The last lantern must cover up to \\( l \\), so \\( d \\) must be at least the distance from the last lantern to \\( l \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal \\( d \\) ensuring full coverage of the street.",
