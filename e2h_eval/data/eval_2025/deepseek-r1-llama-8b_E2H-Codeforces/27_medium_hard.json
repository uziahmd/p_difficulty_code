On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers where each number is either 1 or 2. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subsequence from l to r in the original array. Then, he needs to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the modified array.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the best interval to reverse so that the LNDS is as long as possible.\n\nLet me think about the approach here.\n\nFirst, I know that for a given array, the LNDS can be found efficiently using a dynamic programming approach. But since we are allowed to reverse any subarray, we need to consider all possible reversals and determine which one gives the maximum LNDS.\n\nWait, but trying all possible reversals directly seems computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 2000. The number of possible intervals is O(n^2), which is about 4 million when n=2000. For each such interval, we would have to compute the LNDS, which is O(n) time if done naively. So 4 million * 2000 is 8 billion operations—way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think: what effect does reversing a subarray have on the LNDS?\n\nReversing a subarray will change the order of elements within that interval. So, for each possible interval, the optimal LNDS might involve some elements before the interval, some within, and some after. But how to model this?\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that reversing a subarray allows us to arrange the elements in a way that maximizes the non-decreasing sequence. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, maybe there's a pattern or structure that can be exploited.\n\nWait, another idea: the maximum possible LNDS is either the original array's LNDS or can be improved by reversing some subarray. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way to maximize the LNDS is to make the entire array as non-decreasing as possible. Because with 1s and 2s, the best scenario is having all 1s first followed by all 2s, which gives an LNDS of n.\n\nBut that's only possible if the original array can be arranged that way via some reversal.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible count of 1s followed by 2s, possibly after a reversal. So, the maximum possible LNDS is either the original LNDS or the maximum between the counts when you can arrange the 1s and 2s optimally by reversing some interval.\n\nWait, but how do we model that? Let's think differently.\n\nLet me consider that for any position i, if I can reverse a segment such that all 1s in the prefix of the array come before any 2s in the suffix. Then the LNDS would be the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s, which is n. But that's only possible if the number of 1s is less than or equal to the number of 2s. Or wait, no: the LNDS is the maximum number of non-decreasing elements, so if the array is completely non-decreasing, the LNDS is n.\n\nBut sometimes, the array may not be entirely non-decreasing, but after reversing a certain segment, the overall array becomes more non-decreasing.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find for each possible split point k (where all 1s are on the left and 2s on the right), what is the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before k and 2s after k, considering that the middle part can be reversed to achieve this.\n\nWait, let's formalize this. Suppose we decide that in the modified array, the first m elements are 1s and the remaining are 2s. Then, m must be at least the number of 1s in the original array, but wait, no—because by reversing, we can bring more 1s to the front or 2s to the back.\n\nNo, wait: the total number of 1s and 2s doesn't change because we're just reversing the order. So, the maximum possible LNDS is min(number of 1s, number of 2s + number of 1s). Wait, no—that's not correct. Because the LNDS is the maximum length of a non-decreasing sequence, which could be achieved by a mix of 1s and 2s. For example, a sequence like [1,1,2,2] has LNDS 4, which is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, the maximum possible LNDS is either:\n\n- The original array's LNDS, or\n- The number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of 1s that are after 2s in the original array.\n\nWait, that doesn't quite make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the minimum between the total number of 1s and 2s plus the maximum number of transitions we can eliminate by reversing.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nEach reversal can change the arrangement, but since the elements are only 1 and 2, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum possible count of 1s followed by 2s, without any 2s followed by 1s.\n\nSo, for any possible reversal, the LNDS can be as high as the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after all the 1s. Or something along those lines.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the maximum number of 1s that can be positioned before any 2s, possibly by reversing a certain segment.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding the maximum possible number of 1s that can appear before a certain point, and the rest can be 2s.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nSuppose I fix a point k, meaning that in the modified array, the first k elements are all 1s, and the rest are 2s. Then, the LNDS would be k + (n -k) = n. But that's only possible if we can arrange the array in this way via some reversal.\n\nBut how? Because the original array may have 1s and 2s scattered in any order. By reversing a certain subarray, can I arrange the array to have all 1s first, then 2s?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: 1 2 1 2.\n\nIf I reverse positions 2 and 3, I get 1 1 2 2. Which is exactly all 1s followed by 2s. So the LNDS is 4.\n\nIn the second example, the original array is 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1. Reversing positions 3 to 7 (assuming 1-based index) turns it into 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1. Wait, no. Wait, the reversed segment is from 3 to 7: the original segment is [2,2,2,1], reversed becomes [1,2,2,2]. So the new array is 1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe the exact indices matter. Let me see the sample:\n\nOriginal array: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1].\n\nAfter reversing [3,7], which is the fifth to ninth element (if 1-based), wait no. Wait, the indices are 1-based, so [3,7] would be positions 3 to 7, inclusive. The original elements at these positions are 2,2,2,1,1. Reversing them gives 1,1,2,2,2. So the new array becomes:\n\nPositions 1-2: 1,1\n\nThen positions 3-7: 1,1,2,2,2\n\nThen positions 8-10: 2,2,1.\n\nWait, no, positions 8-10 were originally 2,2,1. So after the reversal, the array becomes:\n\n1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me see:\n\nOriginal array: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]\n\nReverse the subarray from index 3 to 7 (inclusive):\n\nIndices 3-7: values are [2,2,2,1,1]. Reversed: [1,1,2,2,2].\n\nSo the new array is:\n\n[1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1].\n\nWait, no, wait: the array after reversal would be:\n\npositions 1-2: 1,1\n\npositions 3-7: 1,1,2,2,2\n\npositions 8-10: 2,2,1.\n\nWait, that gives the array as [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1], which has 9 elements as 1s and 2s, but the last element is 1. So the LNDS is 9, which is the sample's output.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum LNDS is achieved by having a lot of 1s followed by 2s, except for the last element.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find the earliest position where a certain number of 1s can be moved to the front, and the 2s can be moved to the end.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to consider all possible k, the number of 1s in the prefix, and for each k, determine whether it's possible to have at least k 1s in the array, and then arrange the 2s accordingly.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the array can have 2s interspersed with 1s. So, perhaps for each possible k (from 0 to the total number of 1s), we can check if there exists a way to select a subarray to reverse such that in the new array, the first k elements are 1s, and the rest are 2s.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because after reversal, the 1s can be in any position, as long as they are before the 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible k, which represents the maximum possible number of 1s that can appear before all 2s, we can compute the maximum possible LNDS.\n\nThe maximum LNDS would be the maximum among all possible k's, where k ranges from the minimum of the number of 1s and 2s, to the maximum possible based on the original array.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to compute for each possible k, the maximum number of 1s that can be placed in the first k positions, and then all the remaining are 2s. Then, the LNDS would be k plus the number of 2s in the remaining positions.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the LNDS can be computed as the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum k where k is the number of 1s in the array, but that's only possible if all 1s are before all 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum k, which is the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before a certain point, allowing the rest to be 2s.\n\nSo, for each possible k, we can compute the maximum number of 1s that can be placed in the first k positions, and then the rest are 2s. Then, the LNDS would be k plus the number of 2s in the rest, but that's not correct because some 2s may be in the first k positions, and some 1s in the latter.\n\nWait, no. If after reversal, the first k elements are 1s and the rest are 2s, then the LNDS is k (all 1s) plus the number of 2s in the rest. But the rest may have 2s and 1s, but wait, no, because if you've placed all 1s in the first k positions, then the rest should be 2s. So the LNDS would be k + (number of 2s in the rest).\n\nWait, but how does the reversal help in achieving that? Because the reversal can reorder the elements within a certain interval, but outside of that interval, the elements remain as they are.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding the maximum k such that in the original array, the number of 1s up to position i is at least k, and the number of 2s from position i+1 is at least (n -k). Then, by reversing a certain subarray, we can move the 1s to the front and 2s to the back.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible interval [l, r], reverse it, and then compute the LNDS of the resulting array. Take the maximum over all possible intervals.\n\nBut for n=2000, the number of intervals is 2000*2000/2 = 2e6 approximately. For each interval, computing LNDS is O(n), so 2e6 * 2e3 = 4e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the array. Since each element is either 1 or 2, the LNDS can be determined by the positions of the 1s and 2s.\n\nThe LNDS is the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. So, in the array, for each position, we can track the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at that position.\n\nBut again, after reversing a subarray, the LNDS could change.\n\nWait, but perhaps for any possible reversal, the maximum possible LNDS is either the original LNDS or the maximum between the number of 1s plus the number of 2s in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before a certain point, plus the number of 2s after that point.\n\nWait, let's calculate for each possible k, the maximum number of 1s in the first k positions, and the number of 2s in the last (n -k) positions.\n\nBut how do we model that?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible k, the maximum number of 1s that can be placed in the first k positions is the sum of the 1s in the first part of the array, plus any 1s that can be brought into the first k positions via reversal.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the array consists of 1s and 2s, perhaps the LNDS is maximized when the array is as \"sorted\" as possible. That is, all 1s come before 2s.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum number of 1s that can be arranged before all 2s by reversing some interval.\n\nSo, for each possible k (the number of 1s in the prefix), we need to check if it's possible to have at least k 1s in the entire array, and arrange them in the first k positions. The rest would be 2s, so the LNDS would be k + (n -k) = n.\n\nBut that's only possible if the number of 1s is >= k. Wait, no: the total number of 1s is fixed, say m. So, the maximum possible k is m.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 1, the total number of 1s is 2, 2s are 2. So m=2. So k can be 2, leading to LNDS of 4.\n\nSimilarly, in sample input 2, the total number of 1s is 5, 2s are 5. So maximum k is 5, but in the sample, the LNDS after reversal is 9, which is 5 + 4? No, wait, wait—no, the sample output is 9, which is 5 + 4 is 9, but 5 + 4 is 9, but the total elements are 10. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum possible number of 1s that can be placed before any 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to compute for each possible k, the maximum number of 1s that can be placed in the first k positions, and then all the 2s are in the remaining positions.\n\nWait, but how to compute for each k the maximum possible number of 1s in the first k positions.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position i, compute the maximum number of 1s that can be present in the first i positions, assuming that we can reverse some subarray to arrange the 1s optimally.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible k, find the earliest position where the number of 1s up to that position is at least k, and then the number of 2s after that position is sufficient.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nSince n is up to 2000, perhaps a dynamic programming approach is feasible.\n\nLet me consider that for each possible interval [l, r], reversing it may change the array, and we can precompute for all intervals the effect on the LNDS.\n\nBut again, 2e6 intervals and 2e3 steps each is 4e9 operations, which is too much.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find a way to model the problem differently.\n\nAnother observation: the LNDS of the array is determined by the positions of the 1s and 2s. Each reversal can reorder the elements within a certain interval, but can't change the total count of 1s and 2s.\n\nThus, the maximum possible LNDS is either the original LNDS, or the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before the 2s, possibly by reversing some interval.\n\nWait, but how to find the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before all 2s.\n\nSo, the question becomes: what is the maximum number of 1s that can be placed in the array such that all 1s are before any 2s.\n\nTo find this, for each possible k (the number of 1s in the prefix), we can check if it's possible to have at least k 1s in the entire array, and arrange them in the first k positions. Then, the LNDS would be k + (n -k) = n.\n\nWait, but how to find the maximum k where this is possible.\n\nWait, but the total number of 1s in the array is m. So, the maximum possible k is m, but only if it's possible to arrange all m 1s before all 2s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding whether the array can be rearranged such that all 1s come before all 2s, and if yes, the maximum LNDS is n.\n\nOtherwise, the maximum LNDS is the original LNDS or something else.\n\nWait, but how do we determine if it's possible to arrange the array to have all 1s before all 2s by reversing some interval.\n\nWait, perhaps if the array can be divided into two parts: the first part has all the 1s, and the second part has all the 2s. Then, the maximum LNDS is n.\n\nBut how can we achieve this by reversing a single interval.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample, the array is 1 2 1 2. Reversing the interval 2-3 (values 2 and 1) gives 1 1 2 2. Now, all 1s are before all 2s.\n\nIn the second sample, the array is 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1. After reversing the interval 3-7, it becomes 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1, but wait, the last element is 1, which is a 1. So that's not all 2s after the 1s. So the LNDS is 9, not 10.\n\nHmm, so the maximum possible LNDS depends on how many 1s can be placed before 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before any 2s in the array after a reversal.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem could be:\n\n1. Compute the original LNDS.\n\n2. For each possible interval [l, r], reverse the array within this interval, and compute the new LNDS. Keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut this approach is too slow for n=2000.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe key is to realize that the maximum possible LNDS is either:\n\n- The original LNDS, or\n\n- The maximum possible number of 1s that can be arranged before all 2s, which is min(m, n - s), where m is the total number of 1s, and s is the number of 2s that can be placed after the 1s.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: For each possible split point i (from 0 to n), the maximum LNDS is the maximum number of 1s in the first i positions plus the maximum number of 2s in the last (n-i) positions.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible split i (after the i-th element), the maximum number of 1s in the first i elements is x, and the maximum number of 2s in the remaining (n-i) elements is y. Then, the LNDS would be x + y.\n\nBut how to find the maximum x + y across all possible splits.\n\nWait, but how to compute x and y for each split.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute for each position i, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i positions, and the maximum number of 2s that can be in the last j positions, where j is from 0 to n.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible split point i, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i positions is the number of 1s in the entire array, provided that all 1s can be moved into the first i positions. But that's only possible if the number of 1s is <= i.\n\nWait, but how to model that.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i positions is the number of 1s in the original array, but only if the number of 1s is <= i. Otherwise, it's i.\n\nWait, no. Because some 1s may be in the latter part of the array, and by reversing a certain interval, we can bring them to the front.\n\nSo, for a given i, the maximum number of 1s that can be placed in the first i positions is the minimum between the total number of 1s in the array and i.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, suppose the array is [1,2,1], and i=2. The total 1s is 2. So we can have both 1s in the first two positions by reversing the interval [2,3], which swaps 2 and 1, giving [1,1,2]. So the maximum 1s in first 2 positions is 2.\n\nBut if i is 3, then all 1s are 2, so in the first 3 positions, we can have all 1s if possible.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i positions is the minimum between the total number of 1s and i.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me test this idea.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nn=4, array=[1,2,1,2]. Total 1s is 2.\n\nFor i=2: maximum 1s is 2, because we can reverse the second and third elements to get [1,1,2,2]. So first 2 positions have 2 1s.\n\nFor i=3: maximum 1s is 3? But there are only 2 1s in the array. So no. It can't be more than 2.\n\nWait, so for i=3, the maximum 1s is 2.\n\nHmm, so the maximum number of 1s that can be placed in the first i positions is the minimum of i and the total number of 1s.\n\nSo, for any i, the maximum 1s in first i positions is min(i, m), where m is the total number of 1s.\n\nSimilarly, for the remaining positions (n-i), the maximum number of 2s is min(k, s), where k is the remaining positions, s is the total number of 2s.\n\nWait, but how to find the best i where the sum of the maximum 1s in first i and maximum 2s in the last (n-i) is maximized.\n\nBut then, the maximum possible LNDS would be the maximum over all i of (min(i, m) + min(n -i, s)), where m is the total 1s, s is the total 2s.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, in the first sample, m=2, s=2.\n\nFor i=2, min(2,2) + min(2,2) = 2+2=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample, m=5, s=5.\n\nLooking for i where min(i,5)+min(10-i,5) is maximum.\n\nThe maximum occurs when i=5: min(5,5)=5, and 10-5=5: min(5,5)=5. Sum is 10. But the sample's output is 9.\n\nWait, this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the second sample, after reversal, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1], which has 9 elements in non-decreasing order. So the maximum is 9, not 10.\n\nSo, my approach of considering min(i, m) + min(n-i, s) is incorrect.\n\nBecause in this case, for i=5, the sum would be 5 +5=10, but the actual maximum is 9.\n\nHmm, why?\n\nBecause even though the sum suggests that all 1s are in the first 5 positions and all 2s in the last 5, the actual array after reversal may not allow this. Because the 2s may not be all in the last 5 positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when you reverse a certain interval, you can't necessarily place all the 2s in the last positions. Because some 2s may be in the first part of the array, and reversing their position may not move them to the end.\n\nSo, the initial idea is incorrect because it assumes that all 2s can be placed after the 1s, but that's not always possible.\n\nThus, we need a different approach.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe problem is similar to finding the longest chain of 1s followed by 2s, but the 2s may be scattered in the array. By reversing a certain interval, we can bring a group of 1s to the front, which may merge with existing 1s, and similarly bring 2s to the end, merging with existing 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be placed consecutively before a certain point, followed by all 2s.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding the largest possible number of 1s that can be placed in a prefix, and then the largest possible number of 2s in the suffix.\n\nSo, for each possible i, find the maximum number of 1s in the first i positions and the maximum number of 2s in the last j positions, such that i + j = n, and the 1s and 2s can be arranged to form a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how to find i and j that maximize this sum.\n\nWait, but again, the issue is that the 1s and 2s may not be contiguous, making it difficult.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Two Pointers:\n\nPerhaps we can precompute for each position i, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i positions, and for each position j, the maximum number of 2s in the last j positions.\n\nThen, for each possible i, the maximum possible LNDS is the sum of the 1s in the first i and 2s in the last (n-i) positions, provided that the 1s and 2s can be arranged in such a way.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible split i, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i positions is the minimum of the total 1s and the sum of 1s in the first i positions plus the 1s in the reversed interval.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet’s precompute for each position i, the maximum number of 1s in the first i positions when we can reverse any subarray. Similarly, precompute for each position j, the maximum number of 2s in the last j positions.\n\nThen, for each i, the maximum possible LNDS would be the sum of the 1s in the first i and 2s in the last (n-i) positions.\n\nBut how to compute these maxima.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, the maximum number of 1s in the first i positions is the minimum between the total number of 1s and the maximum number of 1s that can be collected by selecting a subarray to reverse.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute that.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Greedy Approach:\n\nWhat is the maximum possible LNDS? It's the maximum of the original LNDS and the maximum between the number of 1s and 2s in the array.\n\nWait, no. Because in the second sample, the original LNDS is 5 (like 1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1: the LNDS is 5? Or wait, no. Let me compute the original LNDS for the second sample.\n\nWait, the second sample's input is 10 numbers: 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1.\n\nLet me compute the original LNDS:\n\nLooking for the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\n1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1 → the LNDS is 5 (like 1,1,2,2,2 or 1,1,1,2,2).\n\nWait, but the sample's output after reversal is 9. So, the original LNDS was 5, but after reversal, it's 9.\n\nSo, the maximum possible is higher than the maximum of 1s and 2s.\n\nThus, the initial idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Reversal Impact:\n\nWhen we reverse a subarray, the elements within that subarray are reversed, which can potentially merge 1s to the left and 2s to the right.\n\nThus, for any possible interval [l, r], the reversal can change the arrangement of elements within that interval, possibly creating a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut to find the maximum, perhaps the optimal is to find the interval that, when reversed, allows the most 1s to be on the left and 2s on the right.\n\nBut again, it's unclear how to model this.\n\nAnother Idea: The problem is similar to finding a subarray to reverse such that the LNDS is maximized. Since the array consists of 1s and 2s, perhaps the optimal reversal is to create a segment where all 1s are grouped together, followed by all 2s.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of 1s that can be grouped to the left, followed by 2s to the right.\n\nSo, perhaps for each possible k (number of 1s in the prefix), find the earliest position where at least k 1s can be placed in the prefix, and then the 2s follow.\n\nBut how.\n\nPerhaps, for each possible k, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first k positions is the minimum between the total number of 1s and the number of 1s in the first k positions plus the 1s that can be brought into the first k by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Two-Dimensional DP:\n\nLet me think of a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i positions after reversing the subarray starting at j.\n\nBut this might be too complex.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position i, we can compute the maximum number of 1s in the first i positions, regardless of any reversal.\n\nBut that's not considering the reversal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible i, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i positions is the minimum between the total number of 1s and the sum of the 1s in the first i positions plus the 1s that can be moved into the first i by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's precompute for each possible start and end of the reversed subarray, what's the impact on the 1s and 2s.\n\nBut again, for n=2000, this is O(n^2) which is manageable, but each step would require O(n) operations, leading to O(n^3) which is 8e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nThus, perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Since the array is made up of 1s and 2s, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is determined by the maximum number of 1s that can be arranged in a prefix, followed by 2s in the suffix.\n\nThus, for each possible k, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- The original LNDS.\n\n- The maximum number of 1s that can be placed in the first k positions, plus the maximum number of 2s in the last (n -k) positions.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of 1s in the first k positions.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the maximum number of 1s in the first k positions is the minimum of the total number of 1s and the maximum number of 1s that can be collected in the first k positions by selecting a subarray to reverse.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the maximum number of 1s in the first k positions is the total number of 1s, provided that the total number of 1s is <=k. Otherwise, it's the maximum number of 1s that can be collected in the first k positions by reversing any subarray.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first k positions is the total number of 1s, as long as we can arrange the array so that all 1s are in the first k positions. But how.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible to arrange all 1s in the first k positions if and only if the number of 1s is <=k and there exists a way to bring all 1s to the first k positions by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut how to verify that.\n\nWait, for example, in the second sample, m=5, n=10. So, the maximum k is 5.\n\nCan we arrange all 5 1s in the first 5 positions?\n\nYes, by reversing the interval [3,7], which brings the 1s from the end into the first few positions.\n\nWait, in the second sample, the array is:\n\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1.\n\nAfter reversing positions 3-7 (values 2,2,2,1,1), the new array becomes:\n\n1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1.\n\nWait, but the last element is 1, which is a 1. So the first 5 positions are 1s, but the last 5 positions include a 1 and four 2s.\n\nSo, the LNDS is 9, as the last element is a 1, which breaks the non-decreasing sequence.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of 1s in the first 5 positions is 5, and the maximum number of 2s in the last 5 positions is 4. So 5+4=9.\n\nAh, so the initial approach is correct, but the condition is that after reversing, the 2s can be placed in the suffix, but some 2s may still be in the prefix.\n\nWait, no. Because in the reversed array, the 2s are in the middle and end, but the last element is 1. So the LNDS can't include that 1.\n\nSo, the initial approach of min(i, m",
