And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. \n\nHmm, let me break down what's given. We have n days of sleep data and k consecutive days make up a week. So, the number of weeks we need to consider is n - k + 1. For each week (which is a consecutive k days), we calculate the sum of sleep hours, then find the average over all these weeks.\n\nWait, right. So for example, if n=3 and k=2, there are 2 weeks: days 1-2 and 2-3. Each week contributes its sum, then divide by the number of weeks to get the average.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read the list of a_i's.\n3. For every possible window of size k in the list, compute the sum.\n4. Sum all those sums and divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n5. Output the result with sufficient precision.\n\nNow, the constraints are important here. Oh right, n can be up to 2e5. So we need an efficient way to compute the sums. If we do it naively, like for each window sliding one by one, that would be O(nk) time, which for 2e5 * 2e5 is 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a faster method. The standard approach for this kind of sliding window sum is to use a prefix sum array.\n\nYes, the prefix sum array can help us compute the sum for any window in O(1) time after O(n) pre-processing. So here's how:\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array, where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements.\n- For a window starting at index i (0-based?), ending at i + k - 1, the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nWait, but in Python, lists are 0-based, but the initial prefix sum might be 1-based or 0-based. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me create a prefix sum array where prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a_1, prefix[2] = a_1 + a_2, etc. Then for a window starting at index s (0-based) and ending at e = s + k - 1 (inclusive), the sum is prefix[e+1] - prefix[s]. Because e+1 is the end of the window in terms of the prefix array.\n\nSo for each window from s=0 to s = n-k, the sum is prefix[s + k] - prefix[s]. We can loop through each s, compute the sum, add it to a total, then finally divide by the number of windows.\n\nThis approach is O(n) time and O(n) space, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n1. Read n, k, and the list a.\n2. Compute the prefix sum array.\n3. Iterate over each possible window, calculate each window's sum using the prefix array.\n4. Sum all the window sums, then divide by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n5. Output the average with at least 6 decimal digits, ensuring that the output format is correct.\n\nWait, but in Python, dealing with large numbers could lead to floating point issues. But since the problem allows for some error (like absolute or relative up to 1e-6), we should handle it correctly.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the average can be a floating point number, so we need to print it with enough decimal places.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\nFirst, read the input. The input consists of two lines: the first line has n and k, the second line has the a_i's.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input, in the first example, the input is given as ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', ...]. So perhaps in the actual input, it's two separate lines, not as a single string. So in code, perhaps the first line is read as a split, giving n and k, and the second line is the list of a_i's.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via input().split(), but sometimes when multiple test cases are present, it's better to read all at once. But in this problem, there's only one test case.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nassert len(a) == n\n\nThen compute the prefix sum.\n\nprefix = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Each week is defined as k consecutive days, and we need to consider all such windows within the given sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, we read the input values which include the number of days (n), the number of days in a week (k), and the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: We use a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum array helps in calculating the sum of elements from index i to j in constant time.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, we calculate the sum of each window of size k efficiently. For each window starting at index i, the sum is computed as `prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]`.\n4. **Compute Average**: Sum all the window sums and divide by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average sleep time.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the average with sufficient precision to ensure the result is accurate up to six decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sum\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total = 0.0\n    num_windows = n - k + 1\n    for s in range(num_windows):\n        e = s + k\n        total += prefix[e] - prefix[s]\n    \n    average = total / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into individual components for easier processing.\n- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is built such that each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the input list. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n- **Sliding Window Technique**: By iterating over each possible starting point of a window, we compute the sum of each window using the prefix sum array, ensuring efficient calculation.\n- **Average Calculation**: After computing the sum of all windows, we find the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is formatted to ensure it is printed with at least six decimal places, meeting the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle the problem efficiently even for large input sizes, adhering to the constraints and providing the correct result within acceptable time limits.",
