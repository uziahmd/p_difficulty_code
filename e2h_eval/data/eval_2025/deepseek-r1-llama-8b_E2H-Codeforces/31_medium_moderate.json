Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. But since we're trying to minimize the number, we want each new card to contribute as much as possible towards balancing the sum.\n\nLet me think: the initial sum is S = sum of the found cards. The target is 0, so the required sum from the additional cards is -S.\n\nEach additional card can add a value between -x and x. To reach the required sum with as few cards as possible, we should maximize each card's contribution. That means using the largest possible values in absolute terms.\n\nSo, for example, if the required sum is 5 and x is 3, then the minimal number of cards would be 2: one +3 and another +2.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider the direction. If the required sum is negative, say -7, and x is 3, then perhaps the best is to take two cards of -3 each, which sums to -6, but that's not enough. Oh right, so that's why I need to get the absolute value of the required sum.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe required sum is D = -S. So D can be positive or negative. But each new card can contribute up to x (if D is positive) or as low as -x (if D is negative). So the minimal number of cards is determined by the absolute value of D divided by x, rounded up.\n\nWait, that's probably the case. For example, if D is 7 and x is 3, then 7/3 is approximately 2.333, so we need 3 cards: 3+3+1=7.\n\nWait no, wait. Wait, each card can be at most x. So for D=7 and x=3, the minimal number is 3: 3+3+1=7, but wait, no. Because 3+3+1 is 7, but 3+3+1 is allowed because each is <=3. Alternatively, 3+3+1 is 7, but 3*2=6, which is less than 7. So yes, 3 cards are needed.\n\nBut wait, what if D is zero? Then no additional cards are needed.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Compute S, the sum of the found cards.\n2. Compute D = -S.\n3. If D is zero, return 0.\n4. Else, compute the absolute value of D, say |D|.\n5. The minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |D| / x.\n\nBecause each card can contribute up to x towards reducing the deficit.\n\nWait, but wait: what if |D| is exactly divisible by x? Then |D| / x gives the exact number needed. Otherwise, you need to round up.\n\nSo for example, if D is 6 and x is 3: 6/3=2, so 2 cards.\n\nIf D is 7 and x is 3: 7/3 is ~2.333, so 3 cards.\n\nBut wait, what if D is negative? Like D is -5 and x is 3. Then |D|=5, so same logic applies: 5/3 is ~1.666, so 2 cards.\n\nYes, because with two cards, we can have -3 and -2, which sum to -5.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each new card can be any value between -x and x. So when D is negative, the required sum is to add negative numbers (or positive, depending on the situation).\n\nWait no, D is the sum needed. For example, if S is 5, then D is -5. So the sum of the new cards must be -5. So each card can contribute a maximum of x towards that sum. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(5/x).\n\nSo the process is:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards. Then compute the required sum D = -sum_found. If D is zero, nothing to do. Otherwise, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |D| divided by x.\n\nWait, but why can't we have fractions of a card? No, because each card contributes an integer value. So we have to use whole numbers.\n\nSo now, the steps for the code:\n\n- Read n and x.\n- Read the list of n integers.\n- Compute sum_found = sum of the list.\n- D = -sum_found\n- if D == 0: print 0\n- else:\n   abs_D = abs(D)\n   min_cards = (abs_D + x -1) // x   # This is equivalent to ceiling division.\n   print min_cards\n\nWait, but let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput is '3 2\\n-1 1 2'\n\nsum_found = (-1) +1 +2 = 2. So D = -2.\n\nabs_D is 2. x is 2. So 2/2=1. So min_cards is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nInput is '2 3\\n-2 -2'\n\nsum_found is (-2)+(-2) = -4. D is 4.\n\nx is 3. So 4/3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2. So two cards, each 2. Sum is 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if D is 0?\n\nFor example, sum_found is 0. Then D is 0. So no cards needed.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5. Found card is 3.\n\nSum is 3. D is -3.\n\nabs(D)=3. x=5. 3/5 is 0.6, so ceiling is 1. So one card of -3.\n\nAnother case: n=2, x=5. Cards are 5 and 5. Sum is 10. D is -10.\n\nabs(D) is 10. x=5. 10/5=2. So two cards, each -5.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about if the sum is 11, x=5: 11/5=2.2, so 3 cards.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly.\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as two lines: the first line is n and x, the second line is the list of n integers.\n\nIn Python, the code can read them as:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute sum_found = sum(cards)\n\nCompute D = -sum_found.\n\nIf D ==0, output 0.\n\nElse, calculate min_cards as (abs(D) + x -1) // x.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(a)\nd = -s\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    res = (abs(d) + x -1) // x\n    print(res)\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nWait, but what if x is 0? But according to the problem statement, x is >=1. So no problem.\n\nTesting other cases:\n\nTest case where sum is 0: output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=3: requires 2 cards (3+2=5). Wait, no, wait: wait, D is -5. So we need the sum of new cards to be -5. So the new cards can be -3 and -2, which sum to -5.\n\nSo the code correctly computes 5/3=1.666, ceiling is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: x=1.\n\nIf D is 100, then we need 100 cards, each contributing 1.\n\nIf D is 0, output 0.\n\nI think this handles all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and new) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Vanya found some cards, and each card has a value between -x and x.\n   - The goal is to make the sum of all these cards zero by finding the minimum number of additional cards.\n   - Let the sum of the found cards be S. We need the sum of the additional cards to be -S for the total sum to be zero.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Calculate the required sum D as -S.\n   - If D is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, compute the absolute value of D (|D|) and determine how many cards are needed such that each card contributes up to x towards reducing |D|. This is done using ceiling division to ensure we round up when there's a remainder.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the sum of the found cards.\n   - Calculate the required sum D.\n   - If D is zero, output 0.\n   - Otherwise, compute the minimum number of cards needed using ceiling division of |D| by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(cards)\nd = -sum_found\n\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    res = (abs(d) + x - 1) // x\n    print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. The second line reads the values on the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards.\n- **Required Sum Calculation**: Determine the required sum `D` which is the negative of the sum of found cards.\n- **Check for Zero**: If `D` is zero, print 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n- **Ceiling Division**: Use ceiling division to calculate the minimum number of cards needed to achieve the required sum. This ensures that any remainder in the division results in an extra card being counted.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of cards needed by leveraging arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
