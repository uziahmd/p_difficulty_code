On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers where each number is either 1 or 2. Tommy wants to choose a subarray (a contiguous segment) and reverse it. Then, he wants the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the resulting array to be as large as possible. We need to find the maximum possible length of this LNDS after considering all possible reversals of any possible subarray.\n\nHmm, the input is a sequence of 1s and 2s, and n can be up to 2000. So the brute-force approach of trying every possible subarray reversal and computing the LNDS each time might not be efficient enough because there are O(n^2) possible subarrays, and for each, we'd compute the LNDS in O(n^2) time, which would make it O(n^4), way too slow.\n\nWait, but n is 2000. So O(n^2) is 4 million, which is manageable. But for each of those 4 million possibilities, doing an O(n) computation would result in 8 billion operations, which is probably too slow for Python.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what reversing a subarray does to the sequence. Reversing a subarray can change the order of elements, but since all elements are 1s and 2s, maybe there's some pattern or structure we can exploit.\n\nThe LNDS of the original array can be computed quickly. Let's see: the maximum possible LNDS is min( the count of 1s plus the count of 2s, but no, wait, that's not right. Because the sequence needs to be non-decreasing, so the maximum possible is when all 1s come first, then all 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the minimum between the counts of 1s and 2s? Or wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the LNDS is the maximum length of a sequence that is non-decreasing. So for example, if the sequence is 1,2,1,2, then the LNDS is 4 (the whole sequence is non-decreasing). Alternatively, if the sequence is 2,1,2,1, the LNDS is 2 (like 2,2 or 1,2).\n\nWait, no, in that example, 2,1,2,1, the LNDS could be 2,2 or 1,2, which are both length 2. So the maximum is 2. Hmm.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the initial sequence isn't necessarily the best. So after reversing a subarray, perhaps the LNDS increases.\n\nWait, but how does reversing a subarray help? Maybe by arranging the 1s and 2s in a way that allows a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nWait, the LNDS is determined by the arrangement of 1s and 2s. Since 1 ≤ 2, the optimal arrangement is all 1s followed by all 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 comes before a 1 in the array. Or wait, more accurately, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s plus the count of 2s in a non-decreasing way. Oh right, because the entire array can be made into a non-decreasing sequence if we arrange all 1s first, then 2s. So the maximum possible is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s, but only if such a rearrangement is possible by reversing a subarray.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem allows us to reverse any subarray once. So perhaps the optimal scenario is to have all 1s on the left and 2s on the right, regardless of their initial positions. So the maximum possible LNDS is the sum of all 1s and 2s, which is n, but only if we can achieve that arrangement via a single reversal.\n\nBut wait, that's not always possible. For example, if the sequence is 1 2 1 2, then the maximum LNDS is 4 without any reversal. So perhaps the initial arrangement already gives the maximum possible.\n\nSo the key is to find a subarray to reverse such that after reversing, the LNDS is as large as possible.\n\nNow, the question is: how to find the best subarray to reverse to maximize the LNDS.\n\nAn alternative approach: the LNDS can be at most the number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of inversions (since each inversion contributes a decrease in the LNDS). But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the maximum between the current LNDS and some value achieved by reversing a subarray.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is either the original LNDS or can be increased by reversing a certain subarray.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think about the impact of reversing a subarray on the LNDS.\n\nSuppose the subarray is from l to r. After reversing, the elements from l to r are flipped. Now, in terms of the entire array, the new sequence will have some changes in the ordering of the 1s and 2s in that subarray.\n\nI need to find the reversal that maximizes the LNDS.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible reversal, compute the LNDS of the modified array and track the maximum. But with n=2000, this approach would involve 2000*2000/2 = ~2e6 possible subarrays. For each, computing LNDS in O(n) time would be 2e9 operations, which is way too slow for Python.\n\nSo that approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: precompute for each possible subarray [l, r] the effect of reversing it on the LNDS. But even that may not be feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS can be computed efficiently using a DP approach. Let's recall that the standard way to compute the LNDS is O(n) using patience sorting, but that's for the given array.\n\nBut when you reverse a subarray, the array changes, so the LNDS may change.\n\nSo perhaps, for each possible reversal, we can find the new LNDS quickly.\n\nBut again, with 2e6 possible reversals, each requiring O(n) time, it's not feasible.\n\nWait, but what is the maximum possible value of the LNDS? It can be up to n.\n\nIf we can find a way to determine for each possible reversal whether it can improve the LNDS beyond the original, and compute the maximum possible, perhaps we can find a way that doesn't require checking all reversals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is either the original LNDS or can be achieved by some specific kind of reversal, like placing all 1s before 2s in the array.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal scenario is when after reversal, the entire array is non-decreasing, which would give LNDS equal to n.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nIn the sample input:\n\nFirst case: 1 2 1 2 → reversed subarray [2,3], becomes 1 1 2 2 → LNDS is 4.\n\nSecond sample: 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 → reversed [3,7], the array becomes 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1. The LNDS is 9.\n\nWait, in that case, the LNDS is 9 because the first 8 elements are 1s followed by 2s, but the last element is 1, which breaks the sequence. So the LNDS is 8 + 1 (but the 1 at the end can't connect to the previous 2s). Or wait, let's see the array after reversal: [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. So the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2 → length 9.\n\nSo the maximum possible is 9, which is higher than the initial array's LNDS.\n\nSo the idea is that sometimes, reversing a subarray can create a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how to find which reversal to choose.\n\nAlternative Idea: Think about what makes a subarray reversal beneficial. It can fix certain inversions. For example, if the original array has a lot of 2s followed by 1s, reversing a subarray that contains those 2s and 1s can turn them into 1s followed by 2s, thus increasing the LNDS.\n\nBut finding the optimal subarray is tricky.\n\nWait, another thought: The LNDS is the maximum possible for any permutation of the array. However, in this problem, we can only permute a single contiguous subarray. So the problem reduces to finding a contiguous subarray whose reversal leads to a permutation that allows the longest possible non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the optimal solution is to try all possible reversals that could potentially increase the LNDS and compute the maximum among them.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each possible position i, decide whether flipping a certain window around i can help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the maximum of:\n\n- The original LNDS.\n\n- The maximum possible when the reversed subarray is such that all 1s are moved before 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is min(k, n), where k is the maximum between the number of 1s and 2s. No, wait that's not correct. Wait, the maximum possible LNDS is the minimal between the count of 1s and 2s plus the rest, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the entire array as being composed of 1s and 2s. If we can arrange all 1s before 2s, the LNDS is n. Otherwise, it's less.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is either the original, or n, if we can arrange the array to have all 1s before 2s via a single reversal.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: Can we find a subarray to reverse such that the entire array becomes non-decreasing? If yes, then the answer is n. Otherwise, the answer is the maximum between the original LNDS and the next best thing.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, after reversing, the array becomes 1,1,2,2, which is non-decreasing, so the LNDS is 4, which is equal to n. In the second sample, after reversing, the array is not fully non-decreasing, but the LNDS is 9.\n\nWait, but the second sample's output is 9, which is n-1. So perhaps it's possible to get close to n by reversing a subarray that brings almost all 1s before 2s.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the original LNDS. Let's call this original_max.\n\n2. Check if there exists a subarray [l, r] such that reversing it will make the entire array non-decreasing. If yes, the answer is n.\n\n3. If not, find the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal, which could be the maximum between the original_max and some other cases.\n\nBut how to check if such a subarray exists where reversing it makes the entire array non-decreasing.\n\nTo do that, perhaps the array can be partitioned into three parts: a prefix of 1s, a middle part, and a suffix of 2s. So the middle part, when reversed, would become 2s followed by 1s, thus breaking the non-decreasing order. Reversing the entire middle part would swap the 1s and 2s, allowing the entire array to be non-decreasing.\n\nWait, maybe that's a bit vague. Let's think differently.\n\nFor the entire array to be non-decreasing after reversal, the array must be non-decreasing before the reversal in the sense that all 1s are before the reversed subarray, and all 2s are after.\n\nWait, no. Because the reversed subarray could change the relative order.\n\nAlternatively, for the array to be non-decreasing after reversal, the following must hold:\n\n- All elements before the reversed subarray are <= the first element of the reversed subarray.\n\n- All elements after the reversed subarray are >= the last element of the reversed subarray.\n\nWait, no. Because when you reverse a subarray, the elements within the subarray are in reverse order, but their relation to the elements outside depends on their original positions.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider that the reversed subarray is [l, r]. After reversal, the new array is a_1, a_2, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l, a_{r+1}, ..., a_n}.\n\nFor this array to be non-decreasing, the following must hold for all i < j:\n\nif i is before l, and j is in [l, r], then a_i <= a_j (which was a_r, a_{r-1}, etc.)\n\nSimilarly, for j before l and i in [l, r], a_i (original) must be <= a_j (original) because in the reversed array, a_i is now after a_j.\n\nWait, maybe this is not the right approach.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the entire array can be non-decreasing after a reversal if and only if the entire array is non-decreasing except for a contiguous block of elements which, when reversed, becomes non-decreasing and fits into the overall array.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the array after reversal is non-decreasing. Then, for each position, the current element must be <= the next one.\n\nSo, for the entire array, after reversal, it must be non-decreasing.\n\nSo, for the reversed subarray [l, r], the elements a_l ... a_r are reversed. So the new array is a_1, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l, a_{r+1}, ..., a_n.\n\nThis new array must be non-decreasing. So for each consecutive pair, the new a_i <= new a_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for each i in [1, n-1], new_a[i] <= new_a[i+1].\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the new array as:\n\nprefix = a_1 ... a_{l-1}\n\nreversed_sub = a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l\n\nsuffix = a_{r+1} ... a_n\n\nSo the new array is prefix + reversed_sub + suffix.\n\nWe need the entire array to be non-decreasing.\n\nSo, for the prefix and reversed_sub:\n\nEach element in the prefix must be <= the first element of the reversed_sub.\n\nAnd each element in the reversed_sub must be <= the next element in the reversed_sub.\n\nAnd the last element of the reversed_sub must be <= the first element of the suffix.\n\nAnd each element in the suffix must be >= the last element of the reversed_sub.\n\nAdditionally, the elements in the prefix must form a non-decreasing sequence, and the suffix must also form a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nWait, no. Because the prefix is the original a_1 ... a_{l-1}, which may not be non-decreasing. But after the reversal, the entire array must be non-decreasing.\n\nSo, the prefix itself must be non-decreasing, and the reversed_sub must be non-decreasing, and the suffix must be non-decreasing, and the last element of the prefix must be <= the first element of reversed_sub, and the last element of reversed_sub must be <= the first element of the suffix.\n\nMoreover, the suffix itself must be non-decreasing.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_{l-1} (prefix is non-decreasing)\n\n2. a_r <= a_{r-1} <= ... <= a_l (reversed_sub is non-decreasing)\n\n3. a_l <= a_{r+1} ... (last element of reversed_sub <= first element of suffix)\n\n4. a_{r+1} <= ... <= a_n (suffix is non-decreasing)\n\nWait, but condition 2 is that the reversed_sub is non-decreasing, which requires that the original subarray a_l ... a_r is non-increasing.\n\nBecause when reversed, it becomes non-decreasing.\n\nYes, because if a_l <= a_{l+1} <= ... <= a_r, then the reversed subarray would be a_r >= a_{r-1} >= ... >= a_l, which is non-increasing. So for the reversed_sub to be non-decreasing, the original subarray must be non-increasing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the conditions for the entire array to be non-decreasing after reversing [l, r] are:\n\n- The prefix a_1 ... a_{l-1} is non-decreasing.\n\n- The suffix a_{r+1} ... a_n is non-decreasing.\n\n- The original subarray a_l ... a_r is non-increasing.\n\n- Additionally, a_{l-1} <= a_r (if l>1) and a_l <= a_{r+1} (if r <n).\n\nWait, no. Because after reversal, the new array is:\n\n... a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l, a_{r+1}, ...\n\nSo, for the transition between prefix and reversed_sub: a_{l-1} <= a_r.\n\nAnd for the transition between reversed_sub and suffix: a_l <= a_{r+1}.\n\nWait, no. Because the reversed_sub starts with a_r, then a_{r-1}, etc., down to a_l.\n\nSo the last element of reversed_sub is a_l.\n\nThe next element after reversed_sub is a_{r+1}.\n\nSo, a_l must be <= a_{r+1}.\n\nSimilarly, the last element of the prefix is a_{l-1}, which must be <= a_r (the first element of reversed_sub).\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The prefix is non-decreasing.\n\n- The suffix is non-decreasing.\n\n- The subarray a_l ... a_r is non-increasing.\n\n- a_{l-1} <= a_r (if l>1).\n\n- a_l <= a_{r+1} (if r <n).\n\nIf all these conditions are satisfied, then the entire array after reversal will be non-decreasing.\n\nSo, the problem now reduces to finding any [l, r] that satisfies these conditions.\n\nIf such a [l, r] exists, then the maximum LNDS is n.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute for each possible l and r whether the subarray [l, r] is non-increasing.\n\n2. Precompute for each possible l and r whether the prefix up to l-1 is non-decreasing and the suffix from r+1 is non-decreasing.\n\n3. Also, check the transitions between the prefix and reversed_sub and reversed_sub and suffix.\n\nOnce these are precomputed, for each possible [l, r], we can check if it satisfies all the conditions, and if so, the LNDS is n.\n\nIf any such [l, r] exists, the answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, we need to compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal.\n\nBut how to compute the LNDS after any reversal quickly.\n\nAlternative Idea: The LNDS after reversing [l, r] can be found by considering the original LNDS and the changes caused by the reversal. However, this seems unclear.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible [l, r], compute the new array after reversal and find its LNDS. But with n=2000, this is O(n^3) time, which is 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Find the optimal [l, r] to reverse that can maximize the LNDS. Instead of checking all possible [l, r], perhaps focus on certain candidates that are likely to give a good result.\n\nFor example, the optimal [l, r] could be such that the reversed subarray connects as much as possible of the 1s and 2s in a non-decreasing way.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subarray to reverse is a single peak of 2s followed by 1s. So, for example, if the array has a sequence where a group of 2s is followed by a group of 1s, reversing this entire group would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which could help the LNDS.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal reversal is such a group.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find all such groups and check if reversing them can lead to a better LNDS.\n\nBut how to identify such groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best reversal is to reverse a single 2 followed by a 1. Because this would flip them, contributing to a longer LNDS.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal is the largest possible interval where the elements are all 2s followed by 1s. Reversing them would change them to 1s followed by 2s, which could create a longer LNDS.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The LNDS after reversal can be computed based on the original array's properties.\n\nFor each possible [l, r], the reversal affects the array in a specific way. So, perhaps for each [l, r], the new array can be viewed as a combination of the original array with a reversed subarray.\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS after reversal can be considered as the maximum of the original LNDS and some new sequences formed by including elements from the reversed subarray.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS after reversal is the maximum of:\n\n- The original LNDS.\n\n- The LNDS of the array with the reversed subarray.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding for each possible [l, r], the LNDS of the new array.\n\nBut computing this for all [l, r] is O(n^3), which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find a way to compute the LNDS for the new array quickly.\n\nThe standard way to compute LNDS is to use a patience sorting-like approach, which is O(n log n). But for each possible [l, r], this would be O(n) time, leading to O(n^3) which is too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps another Idea: For each possible [l, r], find the effect of reversing it on the LNDS. Maybe there's a way to model this without recomputing the entire LNDS each time.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, perhaps the LNDS can be computed in a simplified way.\n\nIn the original array, the LNDS is the maximum number of elements that can be taken in a non-decreasing order, which is equivalent to the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s, but constrained by the original array's structure.\n\nAfter reversing a subarray, perhaps the LNDS can be found by looking for the longest possible run of 1s followed by 2s, possibly crossing the reversed subarray.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum run of 1s in the array, plus the maximum run of 2s that comes after some point.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal is to find a point where there's a 2 followed by a 1, and reverse those two elements to make them 1 followed by 2. This could increase the LNDS by 1.\n\nBut that's just a local optimization and may not lead to the global maximum.\n\nAnother Idea: The LNDS is the length of the longest sequence of 1s and 2s that are non-decreasing. So, the maximum possible is n if all 1s are before 2s.\n\nThus, perhaps the optimal reversal is to find a subarray [l, r] such that when reversed, the entire array is non-decreasing.\n\nSo, step 1: Check if any such [l, r] exists. If yes, return n.\n\nIf not, then the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum between the original LNDS and some other cases.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, the first step is to precompute for each possible [l, r] whether the conditions I outlined earlier are met.\n\nLet's outline the conditions again:\n\nFor [l, r], after reversal, the array is non-decreasing if and only if:\n\n1. The prefix (1..l-1) is non-decreasing.\n\n2. The suffix (r+1..n) is non-decreasing.\n\n3. The subarray (l..r) is non-increasing.\n\n4. If l > 1, then a[l-1] <= a[r].\n\n5. If r < n, then a[l] <= a[r+1].\n\nSo, to find if any [l, r] exists that satisfies all these conditions.\n\nHow can we compute this efficiently.\n\nFirst, precompute for all l and r:\n\n- Whether the prefix 1..l-1 is non-decreasing.\n\n- Whether the suffix r+1..n is non-decreasing.\n\n- Whether the subarray l..r is non-increasing.\n\nThen, for each [l, r], check conditions 4 and 5.\n\nBut for n=2000, this would be O(n^2) for each of these checks, which is manageable.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nFirst, compute for each l, whether the prefix 1..l-1 is non-decreasing.\n\nWe can precompute a boolean matrix prefix_non_decreasing[l], which is True if a[1..l-1] is non-decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, compute suffix_non_decreasing[r], which is True if a[r+1..n] is non-decreasing.\n\nNext, compute for each l and r whether a[l..r] is non-increasing.\n\nStore this in a 2D array is_non_increasing[l][r].\n\nOnce these are precomputed, for each [l, r], we can quickly check whether the conditions are satisfied.\n\nSo, let's code this step.\n\nNow, the question is, for each [l, r], are prefix_non_decreasing[l], suffix_non_decreasing[r], is_non_increasing[l][r], and the transition conditions met.\n\nOnce we find any [l, r] that meets all the conditions, we can immediately return n as the answer.\n\nIf no such [l, r] exists, then the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum achievable after any reversal.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal.\n\nAnother Idea: The LNDS after reversal can't be more than n. So, if the original array's LNDS is already n, then no need to do anything.\n\nOtherwise, perhaps the maximum possible is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum possible after any reversal.\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible after any reversal.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the LNDS after reversal is at least the original LNDS, but perhaps in some cases, it can be higher.\n\nBut again, without knowing which reversal to choose, it's hard to compute.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the maximum of the original LNDS and the maximum possible when the reversed subarray allows for a longer sequence.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the array consists of 1s and 2s, perhaps for each position, the optimal reversal is to arrange the 1s and 2s in a way that maximizes the number of consecutive 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS after reversal is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum number of 1s in any prefix, plus the maximum number of 2s in the suffix.\n\nWait, that's similar to the standard approach for the LNDS problem.\n\nWait, in the standard problem, the LNDS can be found by keeping track of the smallest possible last element of subsequences of various lengths.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply that here.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the problem is difficult, perhaps for each possible [l, r], we can compute the LNDS after reversal and track the maximum. But since this is O(n^3), it's not feasible for n=2000.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find a way to compute the LNDS after reversal in O(1) time for each [l, r], based on some precomputed information.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS after reversal can be determined by the maximum of the original LNDS and the maximum possible by connecting some 1s before the reversed subarray and some 2s after.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the LNDS after reversing [l, r]. The LNDS can be broken down into segments before l, in the reversed subarray, and after r.\n\nSo, the LNDS after reversal would be the maximum of:\n\n- The LNDS of the prefix.\n\n- The LNDS of the reversed subarray.\n\n- The LNDS of the suffix.\n\n- Plus any connections between the prefix and reversed subarray, and between the reversed subarray and suffix.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nPerhaps, given the time constraints, the best approach is to try to find whether any [l, r] exists that allows the entire array to be non-decreasing after reversal, in which case the answer is n. Otherwise, compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal.\n\nBut even then, the problem remains: how to compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the same as the maximum possible LNDS in the original array plus the maximum possible gain from the reversal.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum number of 1s in the array plus the maximum number of 2s in the array minus something.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nAnother Idea: The LNDS can't be longer than the number of 1s plus the number of 2s, but that's not true because the array has to be non-decreasing.\n\nWait, no, because the array has to be arranged in a way that 1s come before 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is indeed the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s, but only if the array can be arranged that way.\n\nBut in our problem, we can only reverse a single subarray. So the question is, can we arrange the array into all 1s followed by all 2s by reversing a single subarray.\n\nIf yes, then the answer is n.\n\nElse, the answer is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum possible by some other reversal.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nSo, back to the initial plan:\n\n- First, check if any [l, r] exists such that the entire array becomes non-decreasing after reversal. If yes, output n.\n\n- Else, compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal.\n\nAn Idea: For each possible [l, r], compute the new array after reversal and compute its LNDS. Keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut with n=2000, this would be 2e6 * 2000 operations, which is 4e9, which is way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Try to find the best possible [l, r] that can contribute to the LNDS. For example, look for intervals where reversing them can connect as many 1s as possible before and 2s after.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to formalize this.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible l and r, calculate the maximum possible contribution to the LNDS from the reversed subarray.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the problem requires a different approach. Let's think about the problem in terms of the possible maximum.\n\nGiven that the array consists of 1s and 2s, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s. So, the maximum possible is the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s, but only if the array can be arranged that way.\n\nSo, if the array can be made into all 1s followed by 2s via a reversal, the answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, perhaps the maximum possible is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum possible after some reversal.\n\nBut again, how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible is the original LNDS, unless there exists a way to connect a 1 and a 2 across the reversed subarray that wasn't possible before.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps it's better to proceed with the following approach:\n\n1. Precompute for all [l, r] whether the entire array can be made non-decreasing by reversing [l, r]. If yes, output n.\n\n2. Else, compute the original LNDS and compare it with the maximum possible after any reversal. But since we can't compute this for all [l, r], perhaps find another way.\n\nBut this leaves us with the problem of how to compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal.\n\nAlternative Idea: Realize that the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum number of 1s in any prefix plus the maximum number of 2s in the corresponding suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the maximum over all possible l and r of (number of 1s in [1, l] + number of 2s in [r, n]).\n\nBecause, by reversing [l, r], we can potentially take all 1s up to l and all 2s from r onwards, as long as they form a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum of (count_1s_left + count_2s_right) for any split point.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum of (number of 1s in the prefix up to some point) + (number of 2s in the suffix starting from some point), provided that the reversed subarray connects them.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nOriginal array: 1 2 1 2.\n\nReversing [2,3] gives 1 1 2 2. The LNDS is 4.\n\nThe original LNDS is 4.\n\nBut according to this idea, count_1s_left is 2 (prefix up to l=2 is 1,1) and count_2s_right is 2 (from r=3, 2,2). So 2+2=4.\n\nSample 2:\n\nOriginal array: 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1.\n\nThe original LNDS is 5 (for example, 1,1,2,2,2) but after reversing [3,7], the array becomes 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1. The LNDS is 9.\n\nCount_1s_left up to l=3 is 3, count_2s_right from r=7 is 3 (positions 7,8,9 are 2,2,2). So 3+3=6, but the actual LNDS is 9. So this idea doesn't capture it.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative Idea: When we reverse a subarray, the LNDS can include elements from the reversed subarray that allow more 1s to be connected to 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal reversal is to find a range where all elements are 2s, and then reverse it. Or perhaps find a range where all elements are 1s.\n\nBut no, that's not necessarily helpful.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible l, find the earliest r where a_r is 1, and reverse from l to r. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible l, find the longest possible subarray where a_l is 1 and a_r is 2, but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to precompute for each possible [l, r], the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be included in the LNDS after the reversal, but again, this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps I should proceed with writing code that first checks for the possibility of achieving n, and if not, computes the original LNDS and compares it with some potential maximum.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible after any reversal.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum number of 1s in any prefix plus the maximum number of 2s in any suffix.\n\nWait, that's a possibility.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute the original LNDS, max_original.\n\nCompute for all possible l, the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to l, and for all possible r, the maximum number of 2s in the suffix starting at r.\n\nThen, the maximum possible is the maximum of (count_1s_up_to_l + count_2s_from_r) for any l <= r, plus any overlaps.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that l and r can be connected via the reversed subarray.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible after reversal is the maximum of count_1s_up_to_l + count_2s_after_r, for any l and r, provided that the reversed subarray can connect them.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any contiguous subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Complete Non-Decreasing Array**: First, we check if there exists any subarray such that reversing it results in the entire array being non-decreasing.
