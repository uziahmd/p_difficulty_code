In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Japanese mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, and she needs to draw the minimum number of extra tiles to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence). \n\nHmm, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' means suit s, number 1. The output should be three integers: for each of the three input tiles, the minimal number of draws needed so that after adding those, the entire collection contains at least one mentsu. Or wait, no—wait, the output is three numbers corresponding to each input line, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, looking back, the sample input is three lines, but the output is three numbers, like ['0', '0', '1'], which seems to correspond to each of the three initial hands. So I think the problem is, for each of the three initial hands, compute how many tiles need to be drawn to get a mentsu in that particular hand, considering all possibilities.\n\nWait, no. Oh, wait, perhaps the problem statement is asking, given her current three tiles, what is the minimal number of additional tiles she needs to draw so that across all her tiles (current plus drawn), there exists at least one mentsu. But the output is three numbers, one for each initial tile? No, that can't be right. Looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nSo for the first case, she already has a shuntsu (1s,2s,3s). So she needs 0 more. The second case is three 9m's, which is a koutsu, so 0 more. The third case has 3p, 9m, 2p. She can add 1p or 4p to complete a shuntsu (like 2p,3p,4p or 1p,2p,3p). So the output is 1 for the third tile.\n\nWait, but that's per initial tile? Or per the entire set? No, that makes no sense. Oh, perhaps the output is for each of the three initial tiles, what's the minimal number of tiles to add to just that single tile to form a mentsu. But that also doesn't fit the sample.\n\nWait, no, the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the three initial hands. So each initial hand is considered separately. So for each of the three initial hands, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the hand (the three original plus added ones) has at least one mentsu. Because the sample input shows each initial hand is treated individually.\n\nFor example, the third initial hand is [3p, 9m, 2p]. Adding one tile, say 1p, gives four tiles. But do they form a mentsu? Let's see. They are 1p,2p,3p,9m. The 2p,3p,1p form a shuntsu. So yes, a mentsu exists. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the task is: for each of the three given initial hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add so that the total (original plus added) has at least one mentsu.\n\nBut wait, since the tiles can be any, including duplicates, perhaps even more than needed, but we need the minimal number of tiles to add to reach a mentsu.\n\nSo the approach is: for each initial hand, generate all possible ways to add tiles (including any number of any tiles), and find the smallest number of tiles to add such that the resulting set contains a mentsu.\n\nBut that's computationally expensive if done naively. So we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nEach initial hand is a list of three tiles. We can add any number of tiles (possibly zero) to get a larger set. We need to check whether any subset of the combined tiles forms a mentsu.\n\nBut considering all possible added tiles is impossible. So we need to model this smartly.\n\nAn alternative approach is: for each initial hand, determine all possible ways to form a mentsu with the current tiles plus some additions, and find the minimal number of additions needed.\n\nSo for each initial hand, we need to consider all possible mentsus that can include some or all of the initial tiles, and compute the minimal number of tiles to add to complete them.\n\nWait, but mentsu requires exactly three tiles. So, for the initial hand, perhaps the existing tiles can form part of a triplet or sequence, and the missing tiles can be added.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial hand plus added tiles can form a triplet or sequence, and the minimal number of additions is determined by how many tiles are missing from such a triplet or sequence.\n\nSo, let's model this as follows:\n\nFor each initial hand, consider all possible triplets (koutsu) and sequences (shuntsu) that could be formed by adding some tiles. For each possible such mentsu, calculate how many tiles are missing in the initial hand. Then, the minimal number of additions is the minimal such count across all possible mentsus.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each initial hand, examine all possible triplets and sequences that could be formed using the initial tiles plus some added ones.\n\n2. For each such possible mentsu, compute how many tiles are not present in the initial hand.\n\n3. Find the minimal count of such missing tiles across all possible mentsus.\n\n4. The minimal count is the answer for this initial hand.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nFirst, let's think about what constitutes a triplet (koutsu). It's three identical tiles. So, for example, if the initial hand has two 1m, then adding another 1m will form a triplet. Alternatively, if the initial hand has none, then adding three 1m's would form a triplet.\n\nSimilarly, a shuntsu is a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for example, 2p,3p,4p is a shuntsu. If the initial hand has 3p and 4p, then adding 2p would complete it.\n\nSo for each initial hand, we need to find all possible triplets and sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles, and for each, compute the required number of tiles to add.\n\nNow, the question is, how to efficiently generate all possible triplets and sequences that can be formed with the initial hand plus added tiles.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFirst, for a koutsu:\n\nA koutsu is three of the same tile. So for any tile t, the minimal number of tiles to add is 0 (if the initial hand has three of t) or 1, 2, or 3, depending on how many t's are present.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the initial hand has two 1m's, then adding one more 1m will make it a triplet. So for a given tile t, the number of t's in the initial hand is c. The number of tiles needed to add is 3 - c, but only if 3 -c >=0.\n\nSo for any tile t, the number of tiles needed to complete a koutsu is max(0, 3 - count_in_initial(t)).\n\nSo for each tile t, the minimal additions needed is (3 - count_in_initial(t)), but only if that is non-negative. But wait, what about other possibilities? Like, maybe adding more than needed for another triplet.\n\nNo, because for each triplet, we can compute how many tiles are needed, and the minimal across all possible triplets is our candidate.\n\nSo for all possible tiles t, compute 3 - count_in_initial(t). The minimal such value across all t where 3 - count_in_initial(t) is possible is a candidate for the minimal addition.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the initial hand has three 5p's, then for t=5p, 3-3=0, which is the minimal for koutsu.\n\nSo the minimal addition for koutsu is min over t of max(0,3 - count_in_initial(t)).\n\nBut now, for sequences (shuntsu), it's more complicated.\n\nA shuntsu is a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for each suit, we can look for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers, and see how many tiles are missing in the initial hand.\n\nFor example, for suit 'm', the possible shuntsus are:\n\n1m,2m,3m\n\n2m,3m,4m\n\n...\n\n7m,8m,9m\n\nSimilarly for 'p' and 's'.\n\nFor each such possible sequence, we need to compute how many of the three tiles are present in the initial hand.\n\nThe number of tiles needed to add is 3 minus the count of present tiles in the initial hand.\n\nWe can compute this for all possible shuntsus in all suits, and find the minimal such value.\n\nSo, for each shuntsu (each possible triplet of consecutive numbers in a suit), compute the number of tiles in the initial hand that are part of this shuntsu. The required tiles to add is 3 minus that count.\n\nThen, the minimal such value across all possible shuntsus is another candidate for the minimal addition.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each initial hand, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\nThe overall minimal is the smallest between the minimal koutsu additions and the minimal shuntsu additions.\n\nWait, no. Because the minimal could come from either a koutsu or a shuntsu, whichever is smaller.\n\nSo, for each initial hand, we need to:\n\n1. Compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form any koutsu.\n\n   This is the minimal (over all possible tiles t) of max(0, 3 - count_in_initial(t)).\n\n2. Compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form any shuntsu.\n\n   For this, for each possible shuntsu (all possible triplet sequences in each suit), compute how many tiles of that sequence are present in the initial hand. The required additions are 3 minus that count. Find the minimal such value.\n\n3. Take the minimal value between the two computed in steps 1 and 2.\n\n4. That's the minimal number of tiles to add for this initial hand.\n\nSo, the steps for the code would be:\n\nFor each of the three input hands:\n\n- Process the hand into a dictionary (count) that tracks how many of each tile are present.\n\n- Compute the minimal koutsu additions: for each tile t, calculate 3 - count.get(t, 0). The minimal such value, but only if it's <= current count plus 0.\n\nWait, no: for example, if a tile t has 2 in the initial hand, then adding 1 t makes it a koutsu. So for each t, the needed is max(0, 3 - count[t]).\n\nWe take the minimum of these values across all t.\n\nBut wait, the initial hand may have tiles that are part of multiple sequences. For example, initial hand has 1m, 2m, 3m: it's already a shuntsu, so no additions needed.\n\nAnother example: initial hand has 1m, 1m, 2m. For koutsu, the best is to add another 1m (needs 1), or add 3m (needs 2). For shuntsu, the best is to add 3m, which would require 1 (since 1,2,3). So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for each hand, the minimal is the minimum between the minimal koutsu and the minimal shuntsu.\n\nSo now, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each hand, we'll create a frequency dictionary.\n\nThen, compute the minimal koutsu:\n\nInitialize min_k = infinity.\n\nFor each possible tile t (from 1m, 2m, ..., 9m; 1p, 2p, ..., 9p; 1s, 2s, ..., 9s):\n\n   count_t = frequency.get(t, 0)\n\n   needed = max(0, 3 - count_t)\n\n   if needed < min_k:\n\n       min_k = needed\n\nSo min_k is the minimal number of tiles to add for any koutsu.\n\nNext, compute the minimal shuntsu:\n\nInitialize min_s = infinity.\n\nFor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n   for start in 1 to 7:\n\n       sequence = [start, start+1, start+2]\n\n       each tile is suit + str(num) for num in sequence.\n\n       count = 0\n\n       for tile in sequence:\n\n           count += frequency.get(tile, 0)\n\n       needed = 3 - count\n\n       if needed < min_s:\n\n           min_s = needed\n\nSo, for each possible shuntsu, compute how many tiles are already present. The needed is 3 - count.\n\nWe track the minimal needed across all shuntsus.\n\nThen, the overall minimal for this hand is the minimum between min_k and min_s.\n\nWait, but what if the hand has more than three tiles after adding some? Because when we add tiles, the total number of tiles may increase beyond three. But the problem allows that because the mentsu can be any three tiles in the entire collection.\n\nSo for example, if the initial hand is [3p,9m,2p], and you add 1p, you get [3p,9m,2p,1p]. Now, the 1p,2p,3p form a shuntsu, which is a mentsu.\n\nSo the algorithm correctly captures that scenario.\n\nSo, the code will:\n\nLoop through each of the three input hands.\n\nFor each hand:\n\n   Create a frequency dictionary.\n\n   Compute min_k.\n\n   Compute min_s.\n\n   result = min(min_k, min_s).\n\nSo, what about the initial hand having more than three tiles? No, because the initial hand is three tiles.\n\nWait, the problem says that she has three tiles, but after drawing, she can have more. So in the code, the initial hand is three tiles, but after adding, it can have more.\n\nBut the shuntsu and koutsu are based on the entire collection after adding.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\nHand 1: '1s 2s 3s'\n\nFrequency: {'1s':1, '2s':1, '3s':1}\n\nCompute min_k:\n\nFor each tile:\n\n1s: 1 → needed 2\n2s: 1 → 2\n3s: 1 → 2\nothers: 0 → 3\n\nmin_k is 2.\n\nWait, but wait! No, for min_k, we're considering all possible tiles, including those not in the initial hand. So for any tile t, if count is 0, adding 3 tiles of t would form a koutsu.\n\nIn this case, for tile 1s, 3-1=2; 2s, same; 3s, same. Other tiles, like 4s, have 0, so 3-0=3.\n\nSo the minimal for koutsu is 2, but wait, in the initial hand, there's a shuntsu. So the minimal is actually 0, because a shuntsu is already present.\n\nAh, right. So my previous approach is wrong because I didn't account for the fact that the initial hand may already have a shuntsu or koutsu.\n\nSo the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the first hand of the sample input, the initial hand has 1s, 2s, 3s, which is a shuntsu. So the minimal is 0. But according to the previous approach, for min_k, it's 2, and for min_s, it's 0. So the overall minimal is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is still valid.\n\nWait, no, in the first hand:\n\nThe min_k is 2 (for any of the tiles 1s, 2s, 3s). The min_s is 0 (because the initial hand already has a shuntsu). So the overall minimal is 0.\n\nSo the approach correctly finds 0.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle this.\n\nAnother sample case: the second hand is '9m 9m 9m'. So it's a koutsu already. So min_k is 0, min_s is ... well, for any shuntsu, the initial hand has zero tiles, so the needed is 3 for each shuntsu. So the overall minimal is 0.\n\nThird hand: '3p 9m 2p'\n\nFrequency: 3p:1, 9m:1, 2p:1.\n\nCompute min_k:\n\nFor each tile:\n\n3p:1 → 2.\n\n9m:1 → 2.\n\n2p:1 → 2.\n\nOther tiles: 0 → 3.\n\nSo min_k is 2.\n\nCompute min_s:\n\nFor each suit:\n\nm: possible shuntsus are 1-3, 2-4, etc.\n\nLooking for any shuntsu that includes 9m, but 9m is 9, so the only possible shuntsu in m is 7,8,9. Does the initial hand have any of 7m,8m,9m? Only 9m. So for 7m,8m,9m: count is 1. Needed is 2.\n\nFor p:\n\nPossible shuntsus are 1-3, 2-4, up to 7-9.\n\nLooking at the initial hand: 3p and 2p. So for 1p,2p,3p: count is 2 (has 2p and 3p). So needed is 1.\n\nFor 2p,3p,4p: count is 2 (2p and 3p). Needed is 1.\n\nSo the minimal shuntsu needed is 1.\n\nSo overall, the minimal is min(2,1) = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead three lines, each containing three tiles.\n\nFor each line, process the tiles into a frequency dictionary.\n\nCompute min_k and min_s as described.\n\nThe minimal of these is the answer.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is three strings, each with three tiles.\n\nSo, the code can read the three lines, split each into three tiles, and process each as a separate hand.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three hands\n    hands = []\n    for _ in range(3):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        tiles = line.split()\n        hands.append(tiles)\n    \n    for hand in hands:\n        freq = defaultdict(int)\n        for tile in hand:\n            freq[tile] += 1\n        \n        # Compute min_k\n        min_k = float('inf')\n        for suit in ['m','p','s']:\n            for num in range(1,10):\n                t = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n                cnt = freq.get(t, 0)\n                needed = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n                if needed < min_k:\n                    min_k = needed\n        \n        # Compute min_s\n        min_s = float('inf')\n        for suit in ['m','p','s']:\n            for start in range(1,8):  # start can be 1 to 7 inclusive\n                # sequence is start, start+1, start+2\n                seq = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n                cnt = sum(freq.get(t,0) for t in seq)\n                needed = 3 - cnt\n                if needed < min_s:\n                    min_s = needed\n        \n        # Find the minimal between min_k and min_s\n        res = min(min_k, min_s)\n        print(res)\n        \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, for each hand, the code loops through all possible tiles for min_k and all possible shuntsus for min_s.\n\nBut wait, for the min_k calculation, the code loops through all suits and all numbers. For each possible tile, it computes how many are needed to complete a triplet.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nLine 1: '1s 2s 3s' → min_k is 2 (for 1s, 2s, 3s) and min_s is 0 (since the initial hand is a shuntsu). So res is 0.\n\nLine 2: '9m 9m 9m' → min_k is 0, min_s is 3 (since no shuntsu is present). So res is 0.\n\nLine3: '3p 9m 2p' → min_k is 2 (for 3p, 2p, 9m each have count 1). min_s is 1 (for 1p,2p,3p: count is 2, needed is 1). So res is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: initial hand is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nFor koutsu: all tiles have count 1. So needed is 2 for any tile.\n\nFor shuntsu: 1m,2m,3m: count is 2 → needed 1.\n\n4m,5m,6m: count is 1 → needed 2.\n\nSo min is 1.\n\nThus, the code would output 1.\n\nAnother test case: initial hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nFor koutsu: 1m has 2, so needed 1.\n\nFor shuntsu: 1m,2m,3m: count 2 → needed 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nWhat if the initial hand is ['1m', '1m', '1m']: min_k is 0, min_s is 3 (for any shuntsu, since initial has no other tiles). So the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother test case: initial hand is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nFor shuntsu: 1m,2m,3m → count 2, needed 1.\n\n4m,5m,6m → count 1, needed 2.\n\nSo minimal shuntsu is 1.\n\nKoutsu: all have 1, so needed 2. So minimal is 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo, the code as written should work.\n",

Track the minimum number of additional tiles required across all possible sequences.\n5. **Determine Result**: The result for each hand is the minimum value between the results from the koutsu and shuntsu calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three hands\n    hands = []\n    for _ in range(3):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        tiles = line.split()\n        hands.append(tiles)\n    \n    for hand in hands:\n        freq = defaultdict(int)\n        for tile in hand:\n            freq[tile] += 1\n        \n        # Compute minimal tiles needed for koutsu\n        min_k = float('inf')\n        for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n            for num in range(1, 10):\n                t = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n                cnt = freq.get(t, 0)\n                needed = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n                if needed < min_k:\n                    min_k = needed\n        \n        # Compute minimal tiles needed for shuntsu\n        min_s = float('inf')\n        for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n            for start in range(1, 8):  # Start can be 1 to 7 inclusive\n                seq = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n                cnt = sum(freq.get(t, 0) for t in seq)\n                needed = 3 - cnt\n                if needed < min_s:\n                    min_s = needed\n        \n        # Determine the minimal number of tiles to add\n        res = min(min_k, min_s)\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines of input, each containing three tiles.\n- **Frequency Dictionary**: Each hand is processed into a dictionary that counts how many times each tile appears.\n- **Koutsu Calculation**: For each tile, the code calculates how many more tiles are needed to form a triplet. The minimum value across all tiles is tracked.\n- **Shuntsu Calculation**: For each possible sequence in each suit, the code calculates how many more tiles are needed to complete the sequence. The minimum value across all sequences is tracked.\n- **Result Determination**: The minimum number of tiles needed to form either a koutsu or a shuntsu is printed for each hand.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu by considering both triplets and sequences, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and correct.",
