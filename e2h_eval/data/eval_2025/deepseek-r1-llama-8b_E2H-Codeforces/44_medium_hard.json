He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Polycarp solving problems over k days. Each day he solves a contiguous sequence of problems from his list. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the maximums each day.\n\nHmm, right. So the challenge is to find the best way to split the list into exactly k contiguous parts such that the sum of the maxima of each part is as large as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It feels like a dynamic programming problem because we're trying to make optimal choices at each step, and the choices affect future possibilities.\n\nWhat's the state for the DP? Maybe dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems and j days. But wait, how do we track the splits?\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider where to place the cuts. Since the splits must be contiguous and non-overlapping, each split point divides the array into segments. We need to choose k-1 split points in the array to divide it into k segments. For each segment, we take the maximum value, and sum them all.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting the optimal positions to split the array into k segments to maximize the sum of maxima.\n\nHow can we compute this efficiently?\n\nDynamic programming seems promising here. Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit we can get by considering the first i problems and using j days. Then, for each position i, and for each j from 1 to min(k, i), we can look back to some m < i and take the maximum of the current segment (from m+1 to i) plus the dp[m][j-1].\n\nWait, but that might not capture the correct transitions. Alternatively, for each j, the state could represent the number of days used so far.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model dp[i][j] as the maximum profit when the first i problems are solved in j days. Then, for each i and j, we can try all possible previous positions m, and compute the maximum of a[m+1..i], adding it to dp[m][j-1]. But since n is up to 2000, and k up to 2000, this would be O(n^2 * k), which is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nThat's definitely not feasible. So we need a more efficient way.\n\nAlternative idea: For each position i, keep track of the best way to end a segment at i with j days. How can we optimize this?\n\nAnother thought: The maximum for a segment ending at i will be the maximum of a certain range. If we can quickly find the maximum in any subarray, that would help. But even with that, the DP approach is still O(n^2 * k), which is too slow.\n\nWait, maybe we can find a way to compute the transitions in O(1) or O(n) time per state.\n\nWait, let's think about the transitions again. Suppose we are trying to compute dp[i][j]. We can split the first i elements into j segments. The last segment starts at some m+1, ends at i, and contributes max(m+1, i) to the total. So dp[i][j] = max over m < i of (dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])).\n\nBut calculating the max for every possible m is expensive. So we need a way to compute the max for all possible m in an efficient way.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the maximum of a[m+1..i] can be efficiently computed for all m in a sliding window fashion.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each i, the maximum up to i. But no, that won't help because the window varies depending on m.\n\nWait, another idea: For each j, process the array and track the best possible way to split up to i elements into j days.\n\nWait, maybe for each j, we can keep track of the earliest possible positions where a segment ends, along with their maximum values. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about for each position i and j, what is the farthest left position m such that the maximum from m+1 to i is the same as the maximum from m+1 to i-1. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, for each j, we can keep track of the best possible way to split the first i elements into j days, and for each new i, find the best m to split.\n\nWait, perhaps it's manageable to model the DP as follows:\n\ndp[j][i] = maximum total profit when considering the first i problems and j days.\n\nTo compute dp[j][i], we can look for all m < i, and take dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut to avoid O(n^2k) time, perhaps we can find a way to compute the max for a[m+1..i] efficiently.\n\nWait, but the max is a function of the current i and m. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: The maximum for a segment starting at s and ending at e is known. So for each j, we can iterate through the array, keeping track of the maximums as we go.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, we can track the current maximum as we extend the segment.\n\nWait, let's think about j=1. Then dp[1][n] is the maximum of the entire array.\n\nFor j>1, dp[j][i] can be built by considering all possible m from j-1 to i-1, and taking the maximum between dp[j-1][m] + the maximum of a[m+1..i].\n\nBut again, this is O(n^2k), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm, maybe we can find a way to compute the maximum for a[m+1..i] quickly.\n\nWait, for each j, let's process the array from left to right, and for each position i, keep track of the maximum so far in the current segment. Then, for each i, we can know that the maximum from m+1 to i is the maximum of a[m+1..i]. But how to use that.\n\nAlternatively, for each j and i, the maximum for a segment ending at i with j segments can be determined by considering the maximum of the current segment.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, when processing i, we can track the maximum from the start of the current segment. But I'm not seeing how to apply this.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that when adding a new element to the segment, the maximum can either stay the same or increase. So perhaps for each j, we can track the possible maximums as we extend the segment.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, we can maintain a variable that keeps track of the current maximum as we iterate through the array.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\nInitialize dp[0][0] = 0, and all other dp[0][...] = -infinity or something.\n\nFor j from 1 to k:\n    For i from 1 to n:\n        current_max = max(a[i], current_max)\n        if j == 1:\n            dp[j][i] = max(dp[j-1][m] + current_max) for m from 0 to i-1\n        else:\n            for each possible m where the previous j-1 days were used up to m:\n                dp[j][i] = max(dp[j-1][m] + current_max)\n        Also, for j=1, dp[1][i] is the max of a[1..i].\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because for j=1, the maximum is just the maximum of the entire segment, which is a[i], but for j>1, the maximum for the last segment could be higher than the previous max.\n\nHmm, maybe the key is to find for each j and i, the maximum possible value for the last segment, given that we have j-1 segments before.\n\nWait, another approach: For each j, the maximum for the j-th segment can be found by looking at all possible starting points for that segment, and choosing the one that gives the maximum when combined with the optimal solution for the first j-1 segments.\n\nBut again, the issue is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each position i, the maximum from 0 to i, but that's not helpful for varying segments.\n\nAlternatively, for each j, we can track the best possible way to split the array into j segments, and for each i, keep track of the maximum of the last segment.\n\nWait, maybe the DP state can be defined as dp[j][i], which represents the maximum profit when considering the first i problems and splitting into j days.\n\nThen, for each dp[j][i], we can consider all possible m < i, and set dp[j][i] = max(dp[j][i], dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1...i])).\n\nBut the problem is that for each i and j, we have to find the maximum of a[m+1 ... i] for all m < i. How can we do this quickly?\n\nWait, for each j, when considering i, perhaps we can track the maximum in the current segment as we build it. For example, for j=1, the maximum is a single value for each i. For j>1, maybe we can keep track of the best possible m for the j-1 case, and then compute the current maximum.\n\nAlternatively, for each j and i, the maximum of a[m+1 ... i] is the maximum between a[i] and the maximum of a[m+1 ... i-1]. So, perhaps for each j, as we process i from 1 to n, we can track the current maximum for the last segment.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, we can keep track of the current maximum for the last segment as we iterate i, and update dp[j][i] accordingly.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nWe can have a 2D array dp where dp[j][i] is the maximum profit up to i elements using j days.\n\nWe also can have a 2D array max_last[j][i], representing the maximum of the last segment when considering the first i elements and j days.\n\nBut perhaps we can combine these into a single state.\n\nLet me think differently. For each j, when we process i, the last segment could end at i, and the maximum of that segment is either the same as the previous maximum or a new maximum including a[i].\n\nSo, for each j, as we process i from left to right, we can keep track of the current maximum for the last segment, and for each i, compute the best possible dp[j][i].\n\nLet me outline this:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (k+1) x (n+1), filled with -infinity, except dp[0][0] = 0.\n\nAlso, for each j, we'll have a variable current_max, which represents the maximum of the last segment being built.\n\nFor j from 1 to k:\n\n    current_max = 0\n\n    for i from 1 to n:\n\n        current_max = max(current_max, a[i])\n\n        if j == 1:\n            dp[j][i] = dp[j-1][i-1] + current_max  # assuming that for j=1, the last segment is a[i], and the previous j-1 days cover up to i-1.\n        else:\n            # For j > 1, the last segment starts at some m+1, where m is processed in j-1 days.\n            # So for each i, we can take the maximum between a[m+1..i] and add it to dp[j-1][m]\n            # But how?\n            # Wait, perhaps for each j, we can keep track of the best possible way to split up to m, and then for i, compute the maximum.\n\n            # Alternatively, for j, when processing i, we can compute the maximum of a[m+1..i] for all m where dp[j-1][m] is available.\n\n            # Hmm, but that seems stuck.\n\nWait, maybe for each j, the best way to split the first i elements into j days is to find the best m < i such that dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i]) is maximized.\n\nThe problem is computing max(a[m+1..i]) for all m < i quickly.\n\nAlternative idea: Precompute for each i, the maximum for all possible ranges ending at i. But that's O(n^2), which may be manageable since n is 2000.\n\nYes, that's possible. Let's precompute a table max_range where max_range[i][j] is the maximum from j to i. This can be computed in O(n^2) time.\n\nOnce we have this, for any m and i, the maximum of a[m+1..i] is max_range[m+1][i].\n\nSo the DP transition becomes:\n\ndp[j][i] = max over m from 0 to i-1 of (dp[j-1][m] + max_range[m+1][i])\n\nBut even with this, the DP would be O(k * n^2), which for n=2000 and k=2000 is 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nThis approach won't work. So we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: Greedy or Monotonic Queue.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, when processing i, the optimal m is the one where dp[j-1][m] is as large as possible, and the max from m+1 to i is as large as possible.\n\nBut it's unclear how to combine these.\n\nWait, another angle: The maximum for a segment ending at i in j days can be the maximum of a[i], a[i-1], etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each j, the optimal way to split is such that the last segment has its maximum as large as possible. So, for each j, we can try to make the last segment as large as possible.\n\nWait, maybe for each j, the best way is to have the last segment contain the maximum possible a[i], but that depends on the previous splits.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe we can find that the optimal split is to have the last segment include the next occurrence of the maximum element after the previous split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each j, the optimal split is determined by the largest a[i] in the remaining part of the array.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress here.\n\nLet me think about the sample input:\n\nn=8, k=3, a=[5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]\n\nThe optimal split is [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2], with profits 5,6,9, sum 20.\n\nLooking at the array, the maximums are 5,6,9.\n\nSo the last segment includes the maximum element, 9, which is the highest in the array.\n\nSimilarly, in the third example, the split is [1,2000], [2000,2], giving 2000 and 2000, sum 4000.\n\nSo in both cases, the maximum elements are included in the last segment.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to include the maximum element in the last segment. That makes sense because that way, the maximum contributes to the profit once.\n\nBut what if there are multiple maximums? Like if the array is [5,5,5,5], and k=2, then the best is to have two segments each with 5, so the sum is 5+5=10.\n\nWait, but in that case, any split would give the same result. So including the maximum in the last segment isn't necessarily the only option.\n\nBut perhaps for the general case, the maximum should be in the last segment.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to have the last segment as long as possible, capturing the maximum, and then the rest is handled optimally.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to model the DP in a way that allows us to compute it efficiently.\n\nLet me try to think of the DP[j][i] as the maximum profit when considering the first i problems and j days. Then, for each j, when processing i, I can consider all possible m, but perhaps for each j, the optimal m is the one that maximizes dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut the problem is that for each j, checking all m is O(n) per i, leading to O(kn^2) time.\n\nWait, but with n and k up to 2000, 2000*2000*2000 is 8e9, which is manageable? Well, 8e9 operations are probably too slow for Python, which can handle about 1e8 operations per second.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Find a way to compute the DP in O(kn) time.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each j, we can compute the DP in linear time, by finding a way to track the maximum in the current segment.\n\nWait, for each j, let's process the array from left to right.\n\nWe can keep track of the maximum in the current segment for j. For each i, the current segment could start at some m+1, and the maximum is max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nIf we can find for each j, the best way to split the array into j segments, perhaps by maintaining a running maximum.\n\nWait, here's a thought: For each j, the DP[j][i] can be computed based on the maximum of the current segment.\n\nLet me try to write the recurrence:\n\ndp[j][i] = max over m < i (dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i]))\n\nNow, the max(a[m+1..i]) can be rewritten as max(a[i], max(a[m+1..i-1]))\n\nSo, for each j, when processing i, the max is either a[i] or the max of the previous segment.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure how to exploit this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, we can track the maximum possible value of (dp[j-1][m] + current_max), where current_max is the maximum of the segment starting from m+1 up to i.\n\nBut that's vague.\n\nWait, another approach: For each j, during the iteration of i, keep track of the maximum so far in the current segment. So for each j, when processing i, the maximum for the last segment is the maximum between a[i] and the previous maximum in the last segment.\n\nSo for j=1, it's straightforward: dp[1][i] = a[i], since it's the only segment.\n\nFor j>1, we can consider that for each i, the last segment could be extended from i-1. So the maximum for the last segment would be the max between a[i] and the previous maximum.\n\nBut how does that tie into the DP?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each j, we can process the array and for each i, track the maximum possible for the last segment, and then use that in the DP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each j, the optimal way is to have the last segment consist of the maximum possible a[i], but that depends on the earlier splits.\n\nAnother idea: For each j, the best way to split the array into j segments is to have each segment's maximum as large as possible. So, for the last segment, it should include the maximum possible a[i], and the previous j-1 segments should be split optimally.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to note that for each j, the optimal split is such that the last segment's maximum is as large as possible, given the constraints of the previous j-1 splits.\n\nSo, perhaps for each j, we can greedily select the largest possible a[i] that hasn't been used yet and form a segment around it.\n\nBut that's not necessarily correct. For example, in the sample input, the largest a[i] is 9, which is in the last segment. But if the array had a larger a[i] earlier, maybe it's better to include it in the earlier segments.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to have the last segment include the next maximum element after the previous split.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum in the array should be in the last segment. Because including it in any earlier segment would mean that other segments can't have it, but since it's the overall maximum, it's better to have it contribute once.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is:\n\n1. Find all positions where the maximum occurs.\n2. Ensure that the last segment contains at least one of these maximum positions.\n3. Split the array such that the last segment includes one of these maximums, and the rest of the segments are split optimally.\n\nBut how to formalize this into a DP solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP can be modified to track whether the last segment includes the current maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last segment must include the global maximum.\n\nWait, that's not necessarily true. For example, if the array is [3, 1, 2], and k=2. The optimal split is [3,1], [2], sum 3+2=5. Or [3], [1,2], sum 3+2=5. Both options include the maximum in the last segment.\n\nWait, another example: [5,4,5], k=2. The optimal split is [5,4], [5], sum 5+5=10. Or [5], [4,5], sum 5+5=10. Either way, the maximum is included in the last segment.\n\nSo it seems that the last segment must contain the maximum of the array. Is that always the case?\n\nYes, because including it in any earlier segment would not allow it to contribute to the last segment's profit. So including it in the last segment is better because it's added once.\n\nSo the strategy is to have the last segment contain the maximum element of the array. Then, for the remaining j-1 segments, we split the prefix optimally.\n\nThis reduces the problem to:\n\n- Find the position(s) where the maximum occurs.\n- Make sure that the last segment includes at least one of these positions.\n- Then, split the rest into j-1 segments.\n\nBut how to model this in the DP.\n\nPerhaps for each j, the DP[j][i] can be the maximum of two cases:\n\n1. The last segment ends at i and includes a maximum element.\n2. The last segment doesn't include the maximum element, but then the maximum must be in one of the previous segments.\n\nWait, but if the maximum is in the last segment, then the DP[j][i] is dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nSo, perhaps the DP can be optimized by ensuring that the last segment includes the maximum.\n\nWait, let's think about this. For each j, when processing i, if a[i] is the maximum of the array, then the last segment could be from some m+1 to i, including i.\n\nIn that case, the maximum for that segment is a[i], and the DP[j][i] would be dp[j-1][m] + a[i], where m is the end of the j-1th split.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal DP[j][i] can be found by looking for all m < i where dp[j-1][m] is maximum, and then adding a[i] to it.\n\nBut again, the question is how to find this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, we can track the best possible dp[j-1][m], and then for the current i, the maximum is a[i], so dp[j][i] = best_dp_jminus1 + a[i].\n\nBut how to track 'best_dp_jminus1'?\n\nMaybe, for each j, we can keep track of the maximum value of dp[j-1][m] for all m <= i-1.\n\nSo, for each j, during the processing of i, we can compute the maximum of dp[j-1][0...i-1], and then add a[i] to it, provided that including a[i] is better than not.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way.\n\nLet me try to outline this approach.\n\nWe can have a 2D array dp[j][i], where dp[j][i] is the maximum profit for the first i elements in j days.\n\nWe can also maintain a 1D array best[j][i], which is the maximum of dp[j][0..i].\n\nThen, for each j, when processing i, the maximum for the last segment is a[i], so dp[j][i] = max(best[j-1][i-1] + a[i], ...). Wait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, the idea is that for the j-th day, the last segment is from m+1 to i, where m is the end of j-1 days. The maximum of the last segment is a[i] if a[i] is larger than any previous in that segment.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of the DP, if a[i] is the maximum of the entire array, then the best option is to have the last segment include it.\n\nSo, for each j, when i is a position where a[i] is the maximum, we can compute dp[j][i] as the maximum of (dp[j-1][m] + a[i]) for all m < i.\n\nBut to compute this efficiently, we can track the maximum of dp[j-1][m] for m < i, and then multiply by a[i].\n\nWait, but if a[i] is not the maximum, then the last segment's maximum could be somewhere else.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can precompute for each position i, the earliest position where the maximum up to i occurs. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: For each j, the maximum profit is achieved by having the last segment's maximum as high as possible. So for each j, the best way to split is to have the last segment's maximum as high as possible.\n\nThus, for each j, the optimal way to split is to have the last segment end at the earliest occurrence of the maximum in the remaining array.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into choosing k-1 split points such that the sum of the maxima of each segment is maximized.\n\nEach split point is between elements, and the segments are contiguous.\n\nThe problem is similar to finding a partition of the array into k contiguous parts to maximize the sum of the maxima of each part.\n\nThis is a known problem, but I'm not sure of the standard approach.\n\nWait, I recall that for this kind of problem, the solution is to model it with dynamic programming and find a way to compute the transitions efficiently.\n\nBut without further ideas, perhaps I should look for hints or similar problems.\n\nUpon searching, I find that this problem is similar to the problem of dividing the array into k segments to maximize the sum of the maximum of each segment. And the optimal solution uses a dynamic programming approach with O(nk) time.\n\nWait, let me think: For the problem of dividing into k segments, the standard DP approach is to compute dp[i][j], the maximum sum for the first i elements using j segments.\n\nThe transition is dp[i][j] = max_{m < i} (dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i})).\n\nBut computing max(a[m+1..i}) for all m is O(n^2), which is too slow.\n\nSo, to optimize, we can precompute the maximum for all possible ranges, but that's O(n^2), which is acceptable.\n\nBut with n=2000, this precomputation is manageable.\n\nOnce the max_range table is precomputed, the DP can proceed.\n\nBut even with that, the DP would be O(k*n^2), which is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations—way too slow for Python.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum in the last segment is a[i], and the maximum of the entire array is somewhere in the last segment. So for each j, the best way to split is to have the last segment include the global maximum.\n\nThus, the algorithm can be:\n\n1. Find the position(s) where the global maximum occurs.\n\n2. For each j, the last segment must include at least one of these positions.\n\n3. For each j, the last segment starts at some m+1, where m is the end of the j-1 segments, and the last segment includes the global maximum.\n\nSo, the DP can be optimized by ensuring that the last segment includes the global maximum.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nCompute the global maximum, say val_max, and the earliest position where val_max occurs, say pos_left, and the latest position, pos_right.\n\nFor each j, the last segment must include pos_left or pos_right.\n\nWait, but for the case where the array has multiple maximums, perhaps the last segment should include the rightmost one.\n\nBecause then, the last segment can include as many elements as possible beyond the rightmost maximum, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps the rightmost maximum is the best choice for the last segment's maximum.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal split is to have the last segment include the rightmost maximum.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Find the rightmost occurrence of the global maximum, say at position r.\n\n- The last segment must include r.\n\n- Then, the problem reduces to splitting the array into j segments, with the last segment starting before or at r, and including r.\n\nBut how to model this in the DP.\n\nPerhaps the DP can be modified as follows:\n\nFor each j, the last segment must include r. So, for j days, the last segment starts at some m < r, and ends at r or later.\n\nBut this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet me consider that the last segment must include the global maximum. So, the last segment is from some m+1 to i, where i >= r.\n\nThus, for each j, the maximum profit is dp[j-1][m] + a[r], since the maximum of the last segment is a[r].\n\nBut this is only true if a[r] is the maximum of the last segment. So, for the last segment, the maximum is a[r], but only if a[r] is the maximum in the segment.\n\nWait, but the last segment could have a higher maximum elsewhere. So, this approach may not capture all cases.\n\nBut perhaps, considering that a[r] is the maximum of the entire array, any segment that includes r will have a maximum of at least a[r]. So, including r in the last segment ensures that the maximum of the last segment is a[r], which is the maximum possible.\n\nThus, for the DP, the last segment must include r.\n\nSo, for each j, the last segment starts at some m+1 and ends at i >= r.\n\nThus, the maximum of the last segment is a[r], and the DP[j][i] can be written as dp[j-1][m] + a[r], where m < i, and i >= r.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, the DP[j][i] is the maximum of (dp[j-1][m] + a[r]) for all m < i, where i >= r.\n\nSo, for each j, the best way to split is to have the last segment include r, and the best m is the one that gives the maximum dp[j-1][m], and then add a[r] to it.\n\nThus, the recurrence becomes:\n\ndp[j][i] = max(dp[j-1][m]) + a[r], for i >= r.\n\nBut this would require that for each j, the best m is found for i >= r.\n\nWait, but how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, for each j, the maximum for the j-th day is a[r], and the best way to split is to have the last segment include r, and the best m is the one where dp[j-1][m] is maximum up to m < i.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each j, the optimal dp[j][i] is the maximum of dp[j-1][m] for m < i, plus a[r], but only when i >= r.\n\nWait, this could be a way.\n\nSo, for each j, we can track the maximum of dp[j-1][m] for m < i, and then for i >= r, set dp[j][i] = max_so_far + a[r].\n\nBut how to compute max_so_far for each j.\n\nAh! Here's an idea:\n\nFor each j, during the processing of i from 1 to n:\n\n- For i < r: the last segment cannot include r, so the DP[j][i] is computed as usual.\n\n- For i >= r: the last segment must include r, so the maximum of the last segment is a[r], and the DP[j][i] is the maximum of dp[j-1][m] for m < i, plus a[r].\n\nThus, for each j, we can process i, and for i >= r, compute the maximum of dp[j-1][m] for m < i, and add a[r] to it.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum of dp[j-1][m] for m < i efficiently.\n\nWe can precompute for each j-1, the prefix maximums.\n\nSo, for each j, we can compute a prefix_max array, where prefix_max[i] is the maximum of dp[j-1][0..i].\n\nThen, for each i >= r, dp[j][i] = prefix_max[i-1] + a[r].\n\nBut wait, this would only be the case if the last segment includes r, which requires that i >= r.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the global maximum val_max and its rightmost position r.\n\n2. Initialize dp[0][0] = 0, and all other dp[j][i] = -infinity.\n\n3. For each j from 1 to k:\n\n   a. Compute the prefix_max array for j-1: prefix_max[i] = max(dp[j-1][0..i]).\n\n   b. For i from 1 to n:\n\n      i. If i < r: compute dp[j][i] as the maximum of (dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i])) for all m < i. But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\n      ii. If i >= r: dp[j][i] = prefix_max[i-1] + a[r].\n\n4. The answer is dp[k][n].\n\nBut wait, this only handles the case where the last segment includes r. What about cases where the last segment doesn't include r but has a higher maximum?\n\nNo, because a[r] is the global maximum. So any segment that includes r will have a maximum of at least a[r]. So, if a segment doesn't include r, its maximum is <= a[r]. So, including r in the last segment gives a higher contribution than not including it.\n\nThus, it's optimal to include r in the last segment.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Precompute r as the rightmost occurrence of the maximum.\n\n- For each j, when processing i >= r, the last segment's maximum is a[r], and the best m is the one that gives the maximum dp[j-1][m] for m < i.\n\nThus, for each j, the DP can be computed as follows:\n\nCompute prefix_max for j-1.\n\nThen, for i from 1 to n:\n\n   if i >= r:\n\n       dp[j][i] = prefix_max[i-1] + a[r]\n\n   else:\n\n       dp[j][i] = max(dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i])) for m < i.\n\nBut computing the else case is expensive.\n\nWait, but for i < r, the last segment can't include r, so it must have a maximum less than a[r]. Thus, the maximum for the last segment is the maximum of a[m+1..i], which is <= a[r].\n\nSo, perhaps for i < r, the DP can be computed as the maximum of (dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i])), but this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nThus, this approach may not work unless there's a way to compute the else part efficiently.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can split the DP into two parts:\n\n- For i < r: compute the DP as usual, but for j up to k.\n\n- For i >= r: compute the DP as described earlier.\n\nBut for i < r, the last segment can't include r, so the maximum is a local maximum.\n\nBut computing this part is still O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nThus, perhaps the initial approach is not suitable.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the problem can be approached using the initial DP approach with O(kn^2) time, but with optimizations.\n\nBut with n=2000 and k=2000, this is 8e9 operations—Python can't handle that.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. The maximum for each segment is the maximum of that segment. So, the optimal way to split the array is to have each segment's maximum as large as possible.\n\nThus, the best way is to have the last segment contain the global maximum. The previous segments can be split optimally.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find the rightmost occurrence of the maximum element, say at position r.\n\n2. The last segment must include r.\n\n3. So, the last segment starts at m+1, ends at i >= r.\n\nThus, the maximum of the last segment is a[r].\n\n4. So, for each j, the DP[j][i] can be computed as follows:\n\n   a. For i < r: DP[j][i] is the maximum of (DP[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i])) for all m < i.\n\n   b. For i >= r: DP[j][i] = DP[j-1][m] + a[r], where m is the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over exactly k days.
