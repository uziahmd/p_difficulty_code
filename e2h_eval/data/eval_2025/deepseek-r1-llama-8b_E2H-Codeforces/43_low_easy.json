He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, which must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C added them. The count can be equal to both, but that's also allowed.\n\nThe string I'm given must satisfy these conditions. So, I need to verify:\n\n1. The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order is strictly a's first, then b's, then c's.\n\n2. The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\n3. Also, the string must have at least one of each character, because after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nSo, the steps to check are:\n\nFirst, check the structure of the string. It should have a's, then b's, then c's without any mixing.\n\nHow to do that? Well, we can scan the string and make sure that once a character changes from 'a' to 'b', it can't go back to 'a' again. Similarly, once it changes to 'c', it can't go back to anything else.\n\nSo, for example, the string 'aaabccc' is okay. But 'aabc' would not be, because after the 'a's, it goes to 'b's, then 'c's, but wait, no, 'aabc' is 'a','a','b','c'â€”that's correct. Wait no, let me see: the third example in the sample input is 'aabc', which is allowed because it's a's followed by b's, then c's. Wait, but the sample input says the third example is 'aabc' and output is YES. So yes, the structure is correct as long as the letters are in order a, then b, then c.\n\nWait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the note for the second example, the string is 'bbacc'. So the order is 'b's followed by 'a's, which is invalid. Because B appends 'b's to A's string, so the initial part is all 'a's, then 'b's. So the string can't have any 'a's after 'b's.\n\nSo the structure must be a's only, followed by b's only, followed by c's only.\n\nSo, the string must be of the form: all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So the first occurrence of 'b' comes after all 'a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' comes after all 'b's.\n\nSo, how to check this:\n\n- The string starts with one or more 'a's.\n- Then, after the 'a's, there is one or more 'b's.\n- Then, after the 'b's, there is one or more 'c's.\n- There should be no 'a's after any 'b's, and no 'b's after any 'c's.\n\nSo, for the string S:\n\nWe can check that all characters up to some index i are 'a's, then all from i+1 to j are 'b's, then all from j+1 to end are 'c's.\n\nIf any other pattern exists, the string is invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, then we need to compute the counts:\n\nCount_a = number of 'a's.\n\nCount_b = number of 'b's.\n\nCount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nThen, check whether Count_c equals Count_a or Count_b.\n\nAlso, since C appends some c's, Count_c must be >=1, and similarly for a and b.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the initial string after B has at least one a and one b. So the final string (after C) will have a, b, c each at least 1.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Check that the string is structured correctly: a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\n   - Find the positions where the transitions happen.\n   - All a's are before any b's, which are before any c's.\n\n   How to implement this:\n\n   We can iterate through the string and track the current allowed characters.\n\n   Alternatively, split the string into runs. For example, group consecutive same characters.\n\n   For example, the string 'aaabccc' would have runs [a, a, a, b,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific process involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The string must be checked for both structural integrity and specific counts of characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Structural Check**: The string must consist of consecutive 'a's followed by consecutive 'b's, and then consecutive 'c's. There should be no mixing of these characters out of order.\n2. **Count Check**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Additionally, each character 'a', 'b', and 'c' must appear at least once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef check_string(S):\n    # Check if the string is non-empty\n    if not S:\n        return False\n    \n    # Split into runs of the same character\n    runs = []\n    current_char = S[0]\n    count = 1\n    for char in S[1:]:\n        if char == current_char:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            runs.append((current_char, count))\n            current_char = char\n            count = 1\n    runs.append((current_char, count))\n    \n    # Check structure: must be a's, then b's, then c's\n    if len(runs) < 3:\n        return False  # Need at least one a, one b, one c\n    \n    a_count, b_count, c_count = runs[0][1], runs[1][1], runs[2][1]\n    if (runs[0][0] != 'a' or runs[1][0] != 'b' or runs[2][0] != 'c'):\n        return False\n    \n    # Now check if c_count equals a_count or b_count\n    if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Read input\nS = input().strip()\n\n# Check and print result\nif check_string(S):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structural Check**: The string is divided into runs of consecutive characters. We check if the first run is 'a's, the second run is 'b's, and the third run is 'c's.\n2. **Count Check**: After ensuring the correct structure, we check if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If both conditions are met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the required conditions using a linear scan of the string and ensures that the solution handles all edge cases as specified.",
