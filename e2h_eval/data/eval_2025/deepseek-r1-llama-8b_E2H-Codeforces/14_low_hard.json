He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I need to output how many such numbers there are and the list of those numbers in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, and higher multiples contribute more. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division result is zero.\n\nSo the task is to find all n where this sum equals m. But how do I find the possible n's?\n\nWait, the function that counts trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases. That means once n crosses a certain point, the count jumps by more than one. So for a given m, there might be either zero, one, or multiple n's that yield exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nWait no, actually, the function is strictly increasing. Because as n increases by 1, the trailing zeros can only stay the same or increase by one. But because of the multiples of 5, sometimes it can jump by more. For example, when n is 24, 25: 24//5 =4, 24//25=0. Sum is 4. 25//5=5, 25//25=1. Sum is 6. So between 24 and 25, the trailing zeros go from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there are no solutions because no n gives exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nWait wait, let me think again. The function f(n) gives the number of trailing zeros. It's a monotonically non-decreasing function. Each time n passes a multiple of 5, especially higher powers like 25, 125, etc., f(n) increases by more than 1.\n\nSo for a given m, we need to find all n such that f(n) = m. But since f(n) can jump over some values, there can be a range of n's that all map to the same m.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the lower bound of n where f(n) = m.\n2. Check if f(n) remains equal to m as n increases beyond this point.\n3. The maximum n for which f(n) = m is found.\n4. The count is (max_n - lower_bound + 1), and the numbers from lower_bound to max_n are the solutions.\n\nBut how to find these bounds efficiently?\n\nI think binary search could be used here. Because f(n) increases as n increases, so for a given m, we can find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Wait, but perhaps I should find the first n where f(n) >= m and then check if it's exactly m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to find the lower and upper bounds for n where f(n) = m.\n\nWait, let me outline the steps:\n\n- For a given m, determine the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Let's call this low.\n- Then, check if f(low) == m. If not, there are no solutions.\n- If it is, then find the highest n where f(n) == m. Let's call this high.\n- The numbers from low to high inclusive are the solutions.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So how do I implement this?\n\nFirst, I need to write a function to compute f(n), the number of trailing zeros.\n\nFunction count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to perform a binary search to find the minimal n where count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this low.\n\nOnce I have low, I check if count_trailing_zeros(low) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nIf yes, then I need to find the maximal n where count_trailing_zeros(n) == m. How?\n\nWe can incrementally check higher numbers until count_trailing_zeros(n) exceeds m. Or perhaps use another binary search approach.\n\nAlternatively, for the upper bound, since f(n) is non-decreasing, we can start from low and keep increasing n until f(n) becomes greater than m, then the previous value was the high.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nm = input integer.\n\nlow = find the smallest n where f(n) >= m.\n\nif f(low) != m: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   high = low\n\n   while f(high) == m:\n\n       high += 1\n\n   high -= 1\n\nThen, the numbers from low to high are the solutions.\n\nSo the total count",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in \\( n! \\), the number of trailing zeros is effectively determined by the number of times 5 is a factor. This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until \\( n \\) divided by the current power of 5 is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Once the lower bound \\( n \\) is found, check if the count of trailing zeros at this \\( n \\) is exactly \\( m \\). If it is, continue incrementing \\( n \\) until the count exceeds \\( m \\). The previous value gives the upper bound.\n\n3. **Determine Solution Range**: The valid values of \\( n \\) lie between the lower and upper bounds inclusive.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_low(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial guess, can be adjusted if necessary\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input_line)\n    \n    low = find_low(m)\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    high = low\n    while count_trailing_zeros(high) == m:\n        high += 1\n    \n    high -= 1\n    \n    k = high - low + 1\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high + 1))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `count_trailing_zeros`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions from each power of 5.\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: The function `find_low` uses binary search to efficiently determine the smallest \\( n \\) such that the trailing zeros count is at least \\( m \\).\n3. **Finding Upper Bound**: After determining the lower bound, we incrementally check higher values until the trailing zeros count exceeds \\( m \\), giving the upper bound.\n4. **Output**: The number of valid \\( n \\) values and the values themselves are printed based on the determined bounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately find all possible values of \\( n \\) that result in exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros in their factorial.",
