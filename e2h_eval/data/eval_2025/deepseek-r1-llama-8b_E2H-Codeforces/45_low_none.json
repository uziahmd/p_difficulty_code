There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The main rule is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. I need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nHmm, let me think about how the tournament works. Since it's knockout, each game eliminates one player. So for n players, there are n-1 games in total. But the order matters because the winner's path depends on who they face and when.\n\nWait, but the key here is that each opponent must have a game count that's either equal or off by one from the winner's current count. So for the winner to maximize their games, we need to arrange their matches such that each subsequent opponent allows the maximum possible progression.\n\nLet me consider the examples:\n\nIn the first sample with n=2, there's only one game. So the answer is 1.\n\nFor n=3, the winner plays two games: first against someone (say, 2), then against 3. Because after one game, the next opponent has played zero, which is one less than the winner's one game.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the example, the output is 2. So for n=3, the maximum is 2 games.\n\nAnother example: n=4. The output is 2. How? Oh, because the initial matches are arranged as (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4). Then, the winners play each other. So the winner plays two games.\n\nWait, but why isn't it possible for the winner to play three games? Like, maybe the structure allows more.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the grid is structured affects the maximum number of games. So the problem is not just about the total number of players, but how the bracket is arranged.\n\nSo I think the approach is to model the maximum number of games the winner can play by considering that each step, the next opponent must be someone who has played either the same number of games or one less.\n\nSo the winner starts with zero games. Each time they play a game, their game count increases by one. For each new opponent, the opponent must have a game count that is either equal to the winner's current count minus one, or the same as the winner's count.\n\nWait, no. The rule is that two players can only play if the difference in their number of games is at most one. So when the winner is going into a new game, their own game count is k. Their opponent must have a game count of either k-1 or k.\n\nBut how do the opponents' game counts get built up?\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum number of games is determined by finding the largest possible Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is the sum of the two previous terms, but adjusted for the constraints.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because for each step, the winner can choose an opponent who has played k-1 or k games. To maximize the number of steps, perhaps each step adds the maximum possible number of options.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nSuppose the winner's maximum games is f(k). Then, for each step, the number of available opponents is the sum of f(k-1) and f(k-2), or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest number such that the sum of the first m Fibonacci numbers (with certain starting points) is at least n.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Let’s denote f(k) as the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n\nFor k=0, f(0)=1 (no games, just themselves).\n\nFor k=1, they must play at least one game. So the opponent comes from a pool of size 1. So f(1)=2.\n\nFor k=2, after the first game, the opponent has played 1 game. Now, the next opponent must have played either 1 or 2 games. Wait, no, because after the first game, the winner has played 1 game. So the next opponent can be someone who has played 0 or 1 games. But since the winner has already played 1, the opponent can have 0 or 1.\n\nWait, but the opponent would have had to reach that point. So for the second game, the opponent could be someone who has played 1 game. Or someone who has played 0 games.\n\nWait, but for the opponent to have played 1 game, they must have won once. So that requires that they came through a prior game.\n\nHmm, perhaps each time the winner plays a game, they are facing someone who has the maximum possible number of games they can contribute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games is the sum of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that each game can only be played between two players whose number of previously played games differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be approached using a dynamic programming strategy. We need to find the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games. This can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play that many games.\n\n1. **Recursive Insight**: For the winner to play `k` games, they must face opponents who have played either `k-1` or `k` games themselves. This leads us to a recursive relationship where the minimum number of players required for `k` games is the sum of the minimum players required for `k-1` and `k-2` games.\n2. **Base Cases**: \n   - 0 games: 1 player (the winner themselves).\n   - 1 game: 2 players (the winner and one opponent).\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: Using the above relationships, we can build up the solution iteratively until we find the largest `k` such that the number of required players is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    dp = [0] * (n)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    if n >= 1:\n        dp[1] = 2\n    for k in range(2, n):\n        dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]\n    # Find the maximum k where dp[k] <= n\n    max_games = 0\n    for k in range(n):\n        if dp[k] <= n:\n            max_games = k\n    print(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize an array `dp` where `dp[k]` represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games.\n2. **Base Cases Handling**: For `k=0`, `dp[0]` is 1 (the winner alone). For `k=1`, `dp[1]` is 2 (winner and one opponent).\n3. **Filling the DP Array**: For each subsequent `k`, we compute `dp[k]` as the sum of `dp[k-1]` and `dp[k-2]`, representing the sum of players needed for the previous two steps.\n4. **Finding Maximum Games**: After filling the DP array, we iterate through it to find the largest `k` such that `dp[k]` is less than or equal to the given number of players `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum number of games the winner can play using dynamic programming, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n=1018`.",
