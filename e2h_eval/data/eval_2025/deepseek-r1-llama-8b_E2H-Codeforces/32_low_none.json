    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Array Stabilization. We are given an array of integers. The instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array. Our task is to remove exactly one element from the array such that the resulting instability is minimized. We need to find this minimum possible instability.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible element we can remove, we calculate the instability of the remaining array and then choose the smallest among all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 1e5, so a brute-force approach where we try removing each element and compute max and min each time would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think: What's the effect of removing an element on the max and min?\n\nWell, when you remove an element, the new max could be either the original max (if it wasn't removed) or the next highest element. Similarly, the new min could be the original min (if not removed) or the next lowest element.\n\nWait, but if the element being removed is the current max, then the new max will be the second highest. If it's the current min, the new min will be the second min. For elements that are neither, their removal doesn't affect either max or min.\n\nSo maybe the optimal strategy is to consider all possibilities where removing an element affects either the max or the min, or both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability occurs when we remove either the current max, the current min, or some other element that allows the max and min to be as close as possible after removal.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find the global max and min of the original array.\n2. For each element in the array, see what happens if we remove it:\n   a. If the element is the current max, then the new max is the second highest.\n   b. If the element is the current min, then the new min is the second lowest.\n   c. Else, the max and min remain as before, unless the removed element was the only max or min.\n   \nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because if the element being removed is the max, then the new max is the next max, which could be less than the previous max. Similarly, if the element is the min, the new min is the next min.\n\nSo, for each element, after removing it, the new instability is either (new_max - new_min), which depends on whether the removed element was part of the max or min.\n\nSo perhaps we can precompute the two smallest and two largest elements. Then, for each possible element to remove, determine the new max and min based on whether it's a max, min, or something else.\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n- Precompute the sorted array.\n- Identify the first and second max, and the first and second min.\n- Then, for each element in the array, decide what the new max and min would be if we remove it, and calculate the instability.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the sorted array. Suppose the array is sorted as s.\n\nThen, the first element is the min, and the last is the max.\n\nThe second min is s[1], and the second max is s[-2].\n\nIf we remove any element, the new array's min could be either s[0] (if s[0] isn't the one removed) or s[1]. Similarly, the new max could be s[-1] (if not removed) or s[-2].\n\nSo, for each element a[i], when we remove it, the new min is min(s[0], s[i+1]) if i is not 0, else s[1].\n\nWait, no. Wait, when we remove an element, say s[i], the new min is the min of the remaining elements.\n\nBut for example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], and we remove 2, the new min is still 1. So the min remains the same as the original min unless the removed element was the min.\n\nSimilarly, the new max remains the original max unless the removed element was the max.\n\nAh! So for each element, the new max is either the original max (if the element isn't the max) or the second max (if the element is the max). Similarly for the min.\n\nSo, for each element x in the array:\n\n- If x is the current max:\n   new_max = second_max\n- Else:\n   new_max remains as current max\n\n- If x is the current min:\n   new_min = second_min\n- Else:\n   new_min remains as current min.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me test with an example.\n\nSuppose the array is [1,3,3,7]. The current max is 7, current min is 1. The second",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: First, find the current maximum and minimum values of the array. Also, determine the second highest (second max) and the second lowest (second min) values.\n2. **Evaluate Removal Impact**: For each element in the array, consider the effect of its removal on the array's max and min values:\n   - If the element is the current max, the new max becomes the second max.\n   - If the element is the current min, the new min becomes the second min.\n   - If the element is neither the max nor the min, the max and min remain unchanged.\n3. **Calculate Instability**: For each possible removal, calculate the resulting instability using the new max and min values and track the minimum instability encountered.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal instability without resorting to a brute-force method, making it suitable for large arrays up to 100,000 elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Find first and second max\n    max1 = max(a)\n    max2 = -float('inf')\n    for num in a:\n        if num != max1:\n            if num > max2:\n                max2 = num\n    has_max1 = max1 in a\n    \n    # Find first and second min\n    min1 = min(a)\n    min2 = float('inf')\n    for num in a:\n        if num != min1:\n            if num < min2:\n                min2 = num\n    has_min1 = min1 in a\n    \n    candidates = []\n    for num in a:\n        if num == max1:\n            new_max = max2\n        else:\n            new_max = max1\n        \n        if num == min1:\n            new_min = min2\n        else:\n            new_min = min1\n        \n        current_max = new_max\n        current_min = new_min\n        candidates.append(current_max - current_min)\n    \n    print(min(candidates))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an integer `n` and an array `a`.\n- **Finding Extremes**: We determine the maximum, second maximum, minimum, and second minimum values of the array.\n- **Simulating Removals**: For each element, we simulate its removal and compute the new max and min values based on whether the removed element was the current max or min.\n- **Calculating Instability**: For each simulated removal, we compute the instability and track the minimum value.\n- **Output**: The minimum instability found is printed as the result.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging precomputed extreme values and evaluating each removal's impact in constant time, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
