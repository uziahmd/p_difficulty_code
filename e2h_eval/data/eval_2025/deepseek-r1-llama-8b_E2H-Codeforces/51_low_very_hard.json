Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if the pile of letters found in the morning can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly, without any extra letters left. So, essentially, the combined letters of the guest and host should exactly match the pile.\n\nHmm, right. So the approach here is to check if the total count of each letter in the guest and host names equals the count in the pile. If they do for all letters, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this. The steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines: guest, host, pile.\n2. Combine the guest and host into one string.\n3. Compare the frequency of each character in this combined string with the frequency in the pile.\n4. If all counts match, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, first, I need a way to count the frequency of each character. In Python, I can use the Counter class from the collections module. That's efficient and easy to use.\n\nBut wait, what if there are uppercase letters? Oh, the problem states that all letters are uppercase, so no case issues to worry about.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure.\n\n- Read guest, host, pile from input. Note that the input lines might have '\\n' at the end, but since we're using .strip() or something, perhaps not. Wait, the problem says each line is not empty, but does it include newlines? Because the input is given as three lines, each possibly containing newlines. Wait, the input is three lines, each being a string. For example, in the sample input, the first line is 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', which when split into parts, but actually, each line is the name.\n\nWait, no. Let me see the sample input again. It shows three lines, each being a string that includes newlines. Wait, no, maybe the input is given as three separate lines, each line being a single string. For example, the first line is the guest's name, which may contain multiple words separated by spaces or newlines? Or perhaps the entire guest name is on one line, including any newlines as part of their name? Wait, no. Because the input is three lines, each line is a string, which could include newlines as part of the name. But that doesn't make much sense because names don't typically have newlines.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Looking at the problem statement: the first line is the guest's name, the second is the host's, and the third is the pile. So each of these lines is a single string, possibly containing any letters. So, perhaps each line is a sequence of characters, regardless of newlines. Wait, but in the sample input, the guest's name is 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'? That seems odd. Or perhaps the input is three lines, each line being a single string without any embedded newlines. Wait, perhaps the actual input is three lines, each being a single string, and the newline is just part of the input. So, for example, the first line is the guest's name, which is 'SANTACLAUS', and the next is 'DEDMOROZ', etc.â€”no, that can't be because the sample input shows three lines, each as a single string with \\n in them.\n\nWait, perhaps each line is a single string, and the presence of '\\n' in the string indicates that the name consists of multiple parts (like multiple words) separated by newlines. But that doesn't affect the counting of letters, because newlines are not letters. So when processing, I should probably ignore any newlines or other non-letter characters?\n\nWait, the problem statement says that all lines consist only of uppercase letters. So, the lines will not contain any newlines except as separators between the three lines.\n\nAh, right. So the three lines are:\n\nLine 1: Guest's name, which is a string of letters (uppercase), possibly with spaces or other characters? No, wait, the problem says \"each line does not exceed 100\" and \"consist of only uppercase letters\". So each line is a string of uppercase letters, no spaces or newlines.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking back: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" So, each line is a string of uppercase letters, no spaces, no other characters. So for example, the guest's name is a single word, like 'A' or 'ABCD'.\n\nSo, when reading the input, each line is a single string of uppercase letters. So, to process each name, we can just concatenate the letters in each line",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the morning can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that the combined letters of the guest and host names should match exactly with the letters in the pile, without any extra letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Frequencies**: Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined guest and host names and the pile of letters.\n4. **Compare Frequencies**: Check if the frequency of each letter in the combined names matches the frequency in the pile. If they match for all letters, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three lines from input\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n\n    # Combine guest and host names\n    combined = guest + host\n\n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    count_combined = Counter(combined)\n    count_pile = Counter(pile)\n\n    # Compare the counts\n    if count_combined == count_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three lines, each containing uppercase letters. These lines are read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Combining Names**: The guest's name and the host's name are concatenated into a single string to form the combined name.\n- **Frequency Counting**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined name and the pile.\n- **Comparison**: The frequency counters of the combined name and the pile are compared. If they are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names exactly, so we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of letter frequencies, ensuring that no extra letters are present and all necessary letters are included.",
