He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Polycarp solving problems over k days. Each day he solves a contiguous sequence of problems from his list. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the maximums each day.\n\nHmm, right. So the idea is to split the array into exactly k contiguous parts, and for each part, take the maximum element. Then sum all those maxima, and we need to maximize that sum.\n\nWait, but how? Because each part has to be a consecutive sequence, and the order must be preserved as per the original list.\n\nSo, for example, if the list is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2], and k=3, then one possible way is to split into [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2]. The maxima are 5,6,9, summing to 20.\n\nSo the approach is to find such splits where the sum of the maxima is as large as possible.\n\nI remember that similar problems often involve dynamic programming. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming here. Maybe dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit for the first i problems, split into j days.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each position i and j days, we can consider where to split. For example, for each possible m < i, we could split at m, take the maximum up to m (dp[m][j-1]) plus the maximum in the next segment.\n\nWait, but wait. The way the split works is that each segment is a contiguous block. So for the current i and j, the last segment starts at some m+1 and ends at i.\n\nSo, for each i and j, dp[i][j] = max{ dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) }, for all m from j-2 (since each day needs at least one problem) up to i-1.\n\nBut the problem is that computing max(a[m+1..i]) for every possible m and i might be time-consuming if done naively. But given that n is up to 2000, maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute a 2D array that holds the maximum from position l to r for all l and r. That way, when we need the max for a segment, we can just look it up quickly.\n\nYes, let's precompute a 2D max array. Let's call it max_segment, where max_segment[l][r] is the maximum value from a[l] to a[r].\n\nHow to compute this? Well, for all possible l and r, with l <= r.\n\nWe can compute it using a nested loop: for each l from 0 to n-1, and for each r >= l, compute the maximum between a[l] and the max of a[l+1..r]. Wait, but that's O(n^2), which for n=2000 is about 4 million operations—manageable.\n\nOnce we have this max_segment array, then our DP approach becomes feasible.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Precompute the max_segment array.\n2. Initialize a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum profit for the first i elements (indices 0-based) using j days.\n3. Base case: dp[0][0] = 0 (no elements, no days).\n4. For each j from 1 to k:\n   For each i from 1 to n:\n      For each m from j-1 to i-1:\n          dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + max_segment[m][i-1])\n5. The answer will be dp[n][k].\n\nWait, but wait about the indices. Let me clarify.\n\nAssuming the array a is 0-based. Then, for the first i elements, which are a[0] to a[i-1], and we want to split them into j days.\n\nSo, for j=1, dp[i][1] would be the max of a[0..i-1], since all are solved on one day.\n\nFor j>1, for each possible split point m (after j-1 elements), which is from (j-1 - 1) to i-1, because each day must have at least one problem. So m ranges from j-2 up to i-2 perhaps?\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the loops correctly.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nFor each j (number of days) from 1 to k:\n   For each i (number of elements processed) from j (since each day must have at least one element) to n:\n      For m from j-1 to i-1:\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over a given number of days. Each day, Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The goal is to distribute the problems into exactly k contiguous segments to maximize the sum of these maxima.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total profit for solving the first `i` problems over `j` days.\n2. **Precompute Maximums**: We precompute a 2D array `max_segment` where `max_segment[l][r]` gives the maximum value in the subarray from index `l` to `r`. This helps in quickly determining the maximum value for any segment during the DP computation.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible number of days `j` and each possible number of problems `i`, we consider all possible previous split points `m`. The transition is defined as:\n   \\[\n   dp[i][j] = \\max(dp[m][j-1] + \\text{max_segment}[m][i-1])\n   \\]\n   for all valid `m` from `j-1` to `i-1`.\n4. **Initialization and Iteration**: Initialize the DP table with base cases and iterate through all possible values of `i` and `j` to fill the DP table.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Precompute max_segment[l][r] = max(a[l..r])\nmax_segment = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\nfor l in range(n):\n    current_max = a[l]\n    max_segment[l][l] = current_max\n    for r in range(l+1, n):\n        current_max = max(current_max, a[r])\n        max_segment[l][r] = current_max\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\n# Base case: dp[0][0] = 0 (no elements, no days)\ndp[0][0] = 0\n\nfor j in range(1, k+1):\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if j == 1:\n            # Only one day, take the max of the first i elements\n            dp[i][j] = max_segment[0][i-1]\n        else:\n            for m in range(j-1, i):\n                if m >= j-1:\n                    current = dp[m][j-1] + max_segment[m][i-1]\n                    if current > dp[i][j]:\n                        dp[i][j] = current\n\n# Now, reconstruct the solution\nt = [0]*k\ncurrent = n\nlast_day = k\nfor j in range(k, 0, -1):\n    if j == k:\n        start = 0\n    else:\n        start = t[j-1] \n    for m in range(start, current):\n        if m + t[j-1] == current and dp[m][j-1] + max_segment[m][current-1] == dp[current][j]:\n            t[j-1] = current - m\n            break\n    current = m\n\nprint(dp[n][k])\nprint(' '.join(map(str, t)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximums**: The `max_segment` array is computed to store the maximum value for every possible subarray, which allows us to quickly access the maximum value for any segment during the DP step.\n2. **DP Initialization**: The DP table is initialized with base cases where zero elements are handled correctly.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible split point, the DP table is filled by considering all valid previous splits and updating the maximum profit accordingly.\n4. **Reconstruct Solution**: After computing the maximum profit, we backtrack through the DP table to determine the optimal split points for each day, ensuring the distribution of problems into segments maximizes the total profit.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal solution using dynamic programming, ensuring that the constraints are met and the total profit is maximized.",
