Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about matching left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. Each boot has a color which is a lowercase letter or '?'. Two boots are compatible if they are the same specific color, or one is '?'.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible. Also, each boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\nThe input gives two strings, l for left boots and r for right boots, each of length n.\n\nI need to output the maximum number of pairs and list each pair as (a_j, b_j), with all a_j distinct and all b_j distinct.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because it's like a bipartite graph where edges exist between left i and right j if they are compatible. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 150,000. So, standard maximum matching algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp won't work because they are O(√n * E), but here E could be O(n^2), which is way too big.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nEach left boot can be connected to any right boot that satisfies the compatibility condition. So for each left boot, the compatible right boots are those with the same color as l[i] or '?'.\n\nWait, but the other way around: For each right boot, the compatible lefts are those with the same color as r[j] or '?'.\n\nBut how can we model this efficiently?\n\nAnother idea: group the left and right boots by their color (including '?'), and then for each color, count how many lefts and rights are available. The minimum of these counts across all colors would give a possible maximum matching.\n\nBut wait, no. Because a left boot can only pair with one right, and vice versa. So the sum over all colors of the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c] is an upper bound on the maximum possible pairs, but perhaps not achievable due to overlapping constraints.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because some lefts can match to rights that have different colors. But perhaps in this problem, the maximum matching is exactly the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for all c, but only if we can assign them without conflicts.\n\nWait, let's see the example:\n\nIn the sample input, l has 'codeforces' and r has 'dodivthree'. Let's see what the counts are.\n\nBut perhaps that's getting ahead of myself. Maybe the optimal solution is to compute for each color c, the number of lefts with color c or '?', and similarly for rights. Then, for each color c, the number of pairs contributed is min(lc, rc), where lc is the count of lefts compatible with c (i.e., lc = number of lefts with color c plus number of lefts with '?'), and similarly rc is the count of rights compatible with c.\n\nWait, no. Because for a left with color 'a', it can only pair with rights that are 'a' or '?'. So the lefts can be grouped into their own colors, and the rights can be grouped into their own colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is:\n\nFor each left boot, the compatible right boots are those with color equal to the left's color or '?'.\n\nSimilarly, for each right boot, the compatible lefts are those with color equal to the right's color or '?'.\n\nBut again, considering all possibilities directly is computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative approach: We can model this as a bipartite graph and find the maximum matching. However, with n=1.5e5, that's impossible with standard methods.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a greedy approach that works optimally.\n\nWait, another observation: Each left can be matched to any right that is compatible. So, the maximum number of pairs is the maximum possible when we can pair as many as possible, ensuring that each left and right is used once.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to process the lefts in a certain order and match them with the best possible rights.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the \"marriage problem\": To maximize the number of pairs, it's optimal to match each left to the smallest possible right, or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem allows any order of pairing as long as it's maximum, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find for each color c, the number of lefts with color c or '?', and the number of rights with color c or '?'. The sum of min(lc, rc) across all c may give the maximum possible pairs.\n\nWait, but that might overcount because a left can only be paired once.\n\nWait, no. Because each left can contribute to exactly one color, and each right as well.\n\nWait, let's think differently. For each left boot, it can be considered as having a set of compatible right boots. Similarly, each right has a set of compatible lefts.\n\nWe need to select a subset of left-right pairs such that:\n\n- Each left is used at most once.\n\n- Each right is used at most once.\n\n- Each pair is compatible.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a subset is the answer.\n\nThis is exactly the maximum bipartite matching problem. But for n=1.5e5, we can't compute it directly.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a way to compute this using frequency counts and greedily pairing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where edges are between lefts and rights that are compatible. Then, the maximum matching is the answer. But again, computing this is not feasible for large n.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother idea: Let's count for each color c, the number of lefts that have color c or '?'. Similarly, count for each color c, the number of rights that have color c or '?'.\n\nWait, but the lefts with color c can pair with rights that have color c or '?'.\n\nWait, more precisely, for a left boot with color c, it can pair with any right boot that has color c or '?'.\n\nSimilarly, a right boot with color d can pair with any left boot that has color d or '?'.\n\nSo, for each color c, the number of lefts that can be matched is the count of lefts with color c plus lefts with '?'. Similarly for rights.\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Because the lefts with color c can only pair with rights that are c or '?', but the rights with color d can only pair with lefts that are d or '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum over all colors c of the minimum of (left_count[c], right_count[c]), where left_count[c] is the number of lefts compatible with color c (i.e., lefts with color c or '?'), and right_count[c] is the number of rights compatible with color c (i.e., rights with color c or '?').\n\nWait, that might not be correct because a left can only pair with a right if both are compatible.\n\nWait, let's think: For a given color c, any left with color c can pair with any right with color c or '?'. So, the number of lefts compatible with c is L_c = count of lefts with color c + count of lefts with '?'. Similarly, R_c = count of rights with color c + count of rights with '?'.\n\nBut for each c, the maximum possible pairs is min(L_c, R_c). Summing this over all c would give an upper bound, but perhaps not the exact maximum.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sum of min(L_c, R_c) across all c is the maximum possible pairs. Because for each c, you can take as many pairs as possible between the lefts and rights compatible with c.\n\nBut wait, this is not necessarily correct because a left can only be used once, and a right can only be used once. So, for example, a left with color 'a' can be paired with a right with color 'a', but that right can't be paired with any other left.\n\nSo, perhaps the sum of min(L_c, R_c) is an overcount because it assumes that all lefts and rights in c can be paired, which isn't possible.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Because L_c is the total number of lefts that can be paired with c, which includes all lefts with color c or '?'. Similarly for R_c. So, for each c, the maximum possible pairs between lefts compatible with c and rights compatible with c is min(L_c, R_c). But adding these for all c would count the same right multiple times if it can be matched to multiple c's.\n\nSo, that approach would overcount.\n\nThus, perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: Let's model the problem as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes that are compatible with it. Then, the maximum matching in this graph is the desired answer.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, standard maximum matching algorithms are too slow.\n\nTherefore, we need a way to compute this without explicitly building the graph.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting the maximum possible pairs based on the frequencies of each color, including '?'.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet's create a dictionary for lefts and rights:\n\nFor lefts:\nleft_counts: a dictionary where left_counts[c] is the number of left boots with color c.\nleft_q: number of lefts with '?'.\n\nSimilarly for rights:\nright_counts: a dictionary where right_counts[d] is the number of right boots with color d.\nright_q: number of rights with '?'.\n\nThen, for each color c, the number of lefts that can pair with c is left_counts.get(c,0) + left_q.\n\nSimilarly, the number of rights that can pair with c is right_counts.get(c,0) + right_q.\n\nThe maximum possible pairs for color c is min(left_counts.get(c,0)+left_q, right_counts.get(c,0)+right_q).\n\nBut again, the sum over all c of these mins is not correct because a single right can be counted multiple times across different c's.\n\nSo, that's not the way.\n\nAlternative idea: The problem can be seen as an instance of the bipartite graph where the edges are from lefts to rights that are compatible. We can model this as a bipartitioned graph and compute the maximum matching.\n\nBut with n=1.5e5, the standard BFS-based algorithms for maximum bipartite matching (like Hopcroft-Karp) will not work because their time complexity is O(E*sqrt(V)), and E can be up to O(n^2), which is way beyond acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a way to model this as a flow problem with a specific structure that allows for a more efficient solution.\n\nWait, another observation: Each left can be connected to all rights that are compatible, and each right can be connected to all lefts that are compatible.\n\nThis is similar to a bipartite graph where edges are based on compatibility. Now, the question is, what's the maximum matching in such a graph.\n\nBut again, with n=1.5e5, it's impossible to compute directly.\n\nSo, perhaps the key lies in the fact that the graph is highly structured. For example, perhaps the graph is a bipartitioned graph where the adjacency lists can be represented in a way that allows for a greedy approach to find the maximum matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a problem where each left is connected to a subset of rights that can be matched in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works:\n\n1. Sort all the lefts and rights in a certain way.\n\n2. For each left, match it with the earliest possible right that is compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph where the edges are defined by the compatibility, and the graph is a union of cliques.\n\nWait, another idea: Since the compatibility is symmetric in a way—because a left can pair with a right if either is '?', perhaps the maximum matching can be found by considering the number of '?''s and the specific colors.\n\nBut I'm not seeing the connection.\n\nWait, let's think about all the lefts and rights. For each left, the compatible rights are those with color equal to the left's color or '?'. Similarly, for each right, the compatible lefts are those with color equal to the right's color or '?'. \n\nSo, each left can be matched to any right that is compatible, but each right can be matched to any left that is compatible.\n\nThis seems similar to a bipartitioned graph where edges are present based on the above conditions.\n\nBut again, with n=1.5e5, the standard approaches won't work.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartitioned graph where the edges form a certain structure, allowing for an efficient maximum matching algorithm.\n\nWait, perhaps the bipartitioned graph can be considered as a bipartitioned graph with a certain property, like being a DAG, or having a certain order that allows for a greedy approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartitioned graph where each node on the left has edges to a contiguous range of nodes on the right. If this is the case, then perhaps a greedy approach can be applied.\n\nWait, let's sort the lefts and rights.\n\nWait, suppose we sort all the lefts in the order of their color, and sort all the rights in the order of their color.\n\nThen, for each left, the compatible rights are all rights that are >= the left's color, or are '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting somewhere.\n\nWait, let's consider that each left has a color c_l, and each right has a color c_r.\n\nWe can represent each left as a point (c_l, index), and each right as (c_r, index).\n\nNow, for each left, the compatible rights are those with c_r == c_l or c_r == '?'.\n\nSo, for a left with c_l, the compatible rights are those with c_r == c_l or c_r == '?'.\n\nSo, for a given left, the compatible rights can be found quickly if the rights are sorted.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n1. Preprocess the left and right arrays:\n\n   - For each color c, count the number of lefts with color c: left_counts[c].\n\n   - Count the number of lefts with '?': left_q.\n\n   Similarly for rights: right_counts[c], right_q.\n\n2. Compute the maximum possible pairs as follows:\n\n   a. First, pair the lefts and rights that are '?'.\n\n   b. Then, for each color c, pair the lefts with color c and rights with color c.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the cases where a left can pair with '?' and also with its own color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of the number of '?' pairs plus the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for each c, but that's probably not correct because a left can't be paired both as a '?' and as a specific color.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nEach pair must consist of a left and a right that are compatible. So, the maximum possible pairs is the sum for each color c of the minimum of the number of lefts compatible with c and the number of rights compatible with c. But wait, that's not correct because it doesn't account for overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum bipartite matching in a graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible, but the structure is such that the graph is bipartitioned in a way that allows for an efficient solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a bipartitioned graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible, but the graph is a bipartitioned graph where the edges can be processed in a certain order.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem differently.\n\nSuppose we have the following:\n\n- A left can be paired with any right that is either the same color as it or '?'.\n\nSo, for each left, its compatible rights are:\n\n   rights whose color is same as left's color, or '?'.\n\nSimilarly, for each right, compatible lefts are:\n\n   lefts whose color is same as right's color, or '?'.\n\nNow, the problem is to find a maximum matching between lefts and rights based on these constraints.\n\nBut again, with n up to 1.5e5, this is impossible to model directly.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a bipartite graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible. Then, the maximum matching is the answer.\n\nBut again, the problem is the size of the graph.\n\nWait, but perhaps the structure of the graph allows for a certain kind of greedy approach.\n\nLet me think: if we sort the lefts and rights in a certain way, perhaps we can pair them optimally.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem of finding the maximum matching in a bipartitioned graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible.\n\nIf we sort the lefts in increasing order of their color, and the rights in decreasing order, perhaps we can pair them optimally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each color c, we can pair the lefts with c with the rights with c first, and then use the ? to pair the remaining lefts and rights.\n\nWait, let's try to outline a possible algorithm:\n\n1. For each color c, calculate the number of lefts with c and the number of rights with c. Take the minimum of these two as the number of pairs for color c. Subtract these from left_counts and right_counts.\n\n2. After handling all specific colors, the remaining lefts and rights can be paired via '?'. The number of such pairs is the minimum of the remaining lefts and remaining rights.\n\n3. Sum the pairs from step 1 and step 2.\n\nBut wait, this approach ignores the possibility that some lefts could have been paired with rights of a different color if they were '?'. Also, the order in which we process the colors may affect the outcome.\n\nBut perhaps this approach can give the correct maximum.\n\nWait, let's test this against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=10\n\nl = codeforces → let's see what each character is.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual sample input is more complex, but let's think about the general case.\n\nSuppose for color 'a', left_counts['a'] = 3, right_counts['a']=5. So, we can pair 3 pairs here.\n\nThen, for color 'b', left_counts['b']=4, right_counts['b']=2 → pair 2.\n\nLeft after this: left_counts remains with 0 for 'a' and 'b', but other colors.\n\nThen, the remaining lefts are 3+4 - 3-2 = ... Wait, no, perhaps I should track the total.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as:\n\nCompute for each color c:\n\npairs_c = min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])\n\nsum += pairs_c\n\nleft_counts[c] -= pairs_c\n\nright_counts[c] -= pairs_c\n\nAfter processing all specific colors, the remaining lefts and rights are those that have '?'. So, the number of pairs is min(total_left, total_right), where total_left is sum(left_counts.values()) + left_q, and total_right is sum(right_counts.values()) + right_q.\n\nWait, but in reality, the lefts and rights that are unpaired can still form pairs if they have '?', but perhaps this approach misses some possibilities.\n\nWait, no. Because after processing all specific colors, the remaining lefts are those that couldn't find a specific color match. So, their colors can be '? or something else.\n\nWait, but the remaining lefts may have color c, and the remaining rights may have color c. But we've already processed all specific colors. So, perhaps the only way to pair them is if they have '?'.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. For each color c in all possible colors (including '?'), do the following:\n\n   a. Find the minimum of the number of lefts with color c and the number of rights with color c.\n\n   b. Add this to the total pairs.\n\n   c. Subtract this amount from left_counts[c] and right_counts[c].\n\n2. After processing all colors, count the remaining lefts (including '?') and the remaining rights (including '?'). The number of pairs is the minimum of these two.\n\n3. Add this to the total pairs.\n\nBut this is not correct because some lefts may have color c, but after processing color c, they can still be paired with rights of other colors, as long as the right is compatible.\n\nSo, this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is a challenging problem.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the problem as a bipartitioned graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible. The maximum matching in this graph is the answer.\n\nBut given the size, we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nPerhaps the bipartitioned graph is a bipartitioned graph where the adjacency lists can be determined quickly, allowing for a greedy approach.\n\nWait, perhaps for each right, we can determine which lefts are compatible, and then try to pair them in a way that maximizes the matches.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the number of pairs where the left's color is compatible with the right's color, considering all possibilities.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartitioned graph where the edges are such that for each left, the compatible rights are a superset of the rights with the same color. So, for each left, the compatible rights include all rights of the same color and all rights with '?'.\n\nThus, the bipartitioned graph can be thought of as a bipartitioned graph where for each left, the compatible rights are a certain subset.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to exploit this.\n\nWait, perhaps the bipartitioned graph is such that the edges can be represented as a union of cliques based on colors and '?'.\n\nBut again, not helpful.\n\nAlternative Approach: Instead of thinking about each left and right, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the frequency of each color, including '?'.\n\nLet me define:\n\nFor lefts, for each color c, let L[c] be the number of lefts with color c.\n\nSimilarly for rights, R[c].\n\nAlso, let Q_l be the number of lefts with '?'.\n\nQ_r be the number of rights with '?'.\n\nNow, the maximum number of pairs can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. Pairs where both left and right are of the same color, say c.\n\n2. Pairs where either left is '?', or right is '?', or both.\n\nWait, but the first part is just the sum over c of min(L[c], R[c]). The second part is the sum of the number of pairs where at least one is '?'.\n\nBut this is not quite correct because the second part may include overlaps where both are '?'.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of the minimums for each color plus the number of pairs where at least one is '?' minus the overlaps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the maximum number of pairs as the sum over all c of min(L[c], R[c]) plus the number of pairs where left is '?' and right is not c for some c, etc. But this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum over all c of min(L[c], R[c]) plus the minimum of Q_l and Q_r, but this is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum for each color c of min(L[c], R[c]) plus the number of pairs where one is '?' and the other is of some color, but this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as a bipartitioned graph where the edges are between lefts and rights that are compatible. The maximum matching is the answer.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a bipartitioned graph where each left is connected to a range of rights, and thus, the maximum matching can be found using a greedy algorithm.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\nSort the lefts and rights in a certain way, and then for each left, match it to the earliest possible right that is compatible.\n\nBut how to sort them.\n\nHere's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the lefts in increasing order of their color. Sort the rights in decreasing order of their color.\n\n2. For each left in the sorted list, iterate through the rights in the sorted list, and try to find the first right that is compatible (i.e., right's color is same as left's color or '?') and hasn't been used yet.\n\n3. Once a right is used, mark it as used and move to the next left.\n\nThis approach may maximize the number of pairs because we're pairing earlier lefts with earlier rights, which are more likely to have compatible colors.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is optimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps sorting both lefts and rights in the same order (say, increasing) and then pairing them accordingly.\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartitioned graph where each left is connected to a certain subset of rights, and the graph is a bipartitioned graph with a certain structure that allows for the maximum matching to be computed in linear time.\n\nBut I'm not familiar with such a structure.\n\nAnother Idea: Think of the problem as a bipartitioned graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible. Then, the maximum matching can be found by considering the bipartitioned graph as a collection of chains or something similar, allowing for a greedy approach.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure, it's difficult.\n\nGiven that time is limited, perhaps I should look for hints or think about the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs can be found as the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c plus the minimum of Q_l and Q_r, but subtracting any overlaps where both are '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case.\n\nBecause:\n\n- For each color c, the maximum possible pairs is min(L[c], R[c]), which counts the pairs where left and right are both c.\n\n- Then, the remaining lefts are those that couldn't find a matching in their own color. These lefts can be paired with the remaining rights that are either '?' or didn't find a match in their own color.\n\nBut the remaining lefts can be paired with the remaining rights, but only if they are compatible.\n\nWait, perhaps the remaining lefts can be paired with the remaining rights, but the way to count them is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remaining lefts and rights can be handled by counting the number of '?' in lefts and rights.\n\nWait, but the '?' can be paired with any color.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. For each color c, compute pairs_c = min(L[c], R[c]). Add to the total.\n\n2. Subtract pairs_c from L[c] and R[c].\n\n3. Compute the remaining lefts as the sum of L[c] for all c, plus Q_l (the original number of '?' in lefts minus any used in step 1).\n\nSimilarly, compute the remaining rights as sum of R[c] for all c, plus Q_r (original number of '?' in rights minus any used in step 1).\n\n4. The additional pairs is min(remaining_lefts, remaining_rights).\n\nBut wait, the additional pairs are not necessarily all possible because the remaining lefts and rights must be compatible.\n\nWait, no. Because after step 1, any remaining left can be paired with any remaining right, regardless of color, as they can be compatible.\n\nBecause for any left in step 4, it can be paired with any right that is compatible, which includes all rights except those that are incompatible.\n\nBut after step 1, the only incompatible pairs are those that couldn't find a match in their own color.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, for example, a left with color 'a' that couldn't find a matching in step 1 can still be paired with a right of color 'b' if either is '?'. Or, if the left's color is 'a' and the right's color is 'b', they can't be paired unless one is '?'.\n\nBut after step 1, the only lefts that remain are those that couldn't find a matching in their own color. So, their color is not '?', because any left with '?' would have been paired in step 1 if there was a right '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in step 1, we process colors in a certain order, and the '?' may not have been processed yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the step 1 should process the '?' first, and then the specific colors.\n\nLet me rephrase the algorithm:\n\n1. Compute the number of pairs where both are '?'. Let this be q_pairs = min(Q_l, Q_r). Add q_pairs to the total.\n\n2. Subtract q_pairs from Q_l and Q_r.\n\n3. Now, for each color c, compute pairs_c = min(L[c], R[c]). Add to the total.\n\n4. Subtract pairs_c from L[c] and R[c].\n\n5. Now, the remaining lefts are those that couldn't find a pair in their own color, and the remaining rights are the same.\n\n6. Any remaining lefts can be paired with any remaining rights, as long as they are compatible.\n\nWait, but this is not necessarily true. For example, a left with color 'a' and a right with color 'b' can't be paired unless one is '?'.\n\nBut in step 5, the remaining lefts and rights may have various colors, including non-'?'.\n\nWait, perhaps the remaining lefts and rights can form pairs if they are compatible, but the way to count them is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is q_pairs + sum of min(L[c], R[c]) + the number of pairs formed by the remaining lefts and rights that are compatible.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the number of pairs where the left's color is compatible with the right's color, regardless of specific assignments, and the way to maximize this is to pair as many as possible, regardless of the specific order.\n\nBut again, without a clear way to model this, it's challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by treating the '?' as a separate color and processing it first.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Pair as many '?' as possible. The number of such pairs is min(Q_l, Q_r). Add this to the total.\n\n2. Subtract this from Q_l and Q_r.\n\n3. Now, for each color c, pair the lefts with color c with the rights with color c. The number of such pairs is min(L[c], R[c]). Add to the total.\n\n4. Subtract this from L[c] and R[c].\n\n5. Now, the remaining lefts and rights can be paired if they are compatible. But how?\n\nAt this point, the remaining lefts can have any color except '?', and the remaining rights can have any color except '?'.\n\nWait, no, because after step 3, the remaining L[c] could be zero or positive, but the rights R[c] could be zero or positive.\n\nBut now, any remaining left can be paired with any remaining right if they are compatible.\n\nBut the problem is to find the maximum number of such pairs.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the remaining lefts and rights can be treated as a bipartitioned graph, and the maximum matching is the answer.\n\nBut with the remaining sizes possibly being up to 1.5e5, this is not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is indeed the sum of step 1 and step 3, because the remaining lefts and rights cannot form any more pairs.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case.\n\nFor example, imagine a left with color 'a' and a right with color 'b'—they cannot pair with each other unless one is '?'.\n\nBut after steps 1 and 3, both are in the remaining pool, and they can't pair.\n\nSo, the algorithm's steps 1 and 3 would miss such pairs.\n\nThus, the approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a tough problem.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the maximum number of pairs can be found by considering that each left can be matched to a right that is compatible, and the maximum is achieved by pairing each left with the earliest possible right that is compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Sort all lefts in a certain order (like increasing color).\n\n2. Sort all rights in a certain order (like increasing color).\n\n3. For each left in the sorted list, find the earliest right that is compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut the choice of the order is crucial.\n\nPerhaps sorting the lefts in increasing order of their color and the rights in decreasing order of their color.\n\nWhy? Because this way, we try to match lefts with higher colors first with rights that may have lower colors, but are compatible.\n\nWait, let's think through an example:\n\nSuppose left colors are ['a', 'b', 'c'], and right colors are ['c', 'b', 'a'].\n\nIf we sort lefts in increasing order and rights in decreasing order:\n\nlefts: a, b, c\n\nrights: c, b, a.\n\nNow, for left a, we look for the earliest right that is compatible. The earliest right is c, which is compatible (same color). So, pair a with c.\n\nThen, left b, look for earliest right that is compatible. The rights now available are b and a.\n\nb can pair with b, so pair b with b.\n\nThen, left c, look for earliest right, which is a. c can pair with a (if c is compatible with a, which depends on their colors).\n\nWait, but if c and a are different colors, and neither is '?', then they can't pair.\n\nSo, this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order should be such that the lefts are sorted in the order of their colors, and the rights are sorted in the same order.\n\nWait, perhaps the lefts and rights should be sorted in the same order, and then for each left, we try to find the earliest right that is compatible and hasn't been used.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires a more advanced data structure, like a binary indexed tree or a segment tree, to efficiently manage the compatible rights for each left.\n\nBut I'm not seeing how.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as a bipartitioned graph and find the maximum bipartite matching using the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm. However, given the problem constraints, this would not be feasible for n=1.5e5.\n\nWait, but perhaps the bipartitioned graph has a certain structure that allows for a more efficient solution.\n\nWait, considering that each left is connected to a set of rights that include all rights of the same color and all rights with '?', perhaps the bipartitioned graph can be represented as a bipartitioned graph where the edges are such that for each left, the compatible rights are a superset of the same color and the '?'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem is about bipartitioned graphs and maximum matching, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartitioned graph where each left is connected to a range of rights, which can be handled with a greedy approach.\n\nBut I'm not familiar with such a scenario.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for hints or think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartitioned graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible, and the maximum matching can be found by considering the number of pairs where the left's color is compatible with the right's color, including when either is '?'.\n\nBut again, without a way to compute this efficiently, it's not helpful.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the problem can be reduced to the maximum bipartitioned matching where the edges are from lefts to rights that are compatible, and the graph is a DAG, allowing for a topological sort-based approach.\n\nBut I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartitioned graph where each left is connected to a range of rights, and a greedy approach can be used to find the maximum matching.\n\nBut without knowing the structure, it's difficult.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern or think about the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the number of pairs where the left's color is compatible with the right's color, considering that '?' can pair with anything.\n\nBut without knowing the exact way to model this, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as a bipartitioned graph and use a greedy algorithm that sorts the lefts and rights and matches them in a certain order.\n\nBut given that I'm not confident in this approach, perhaps I should refer to similar problems.\n\nWait, I recall a problem where you have to find the maximum number of pairs between two sets, with certain constraints, and the solution involves sorting both sets and using a two-pointer approach.\n\nPerhaps a similar approach can be applied here.\n\nLet me think: Suppose we sort the lefts and rights in a certain way.\n\nFor example, sort the lefts in increasing order of their color, and the rights in increasing order of their color.\n\nThen, for each left, try to find the earliest right that is compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the lefts in the order of their color, and for each left, find the earliest possible right that is compatible.\n\nBut the order of processing matters.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Sort the lefts in increasing order of their color.\n\n2. Sort the rights in increasing order of their color.\n\n3. For each left in the sorted list, find the earliest right in the sorted list that is compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\n4",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots.
