Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Guard Duty. The task is to determine whether it's possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to B bases in such a way that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Also, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect any other such paths. So, the key here is to ensure that the matching between spaceships and bases forms non-intersecting straight lines.\n\nHmm, how to model this? Well, the first thing that comes to mind is that this is a bipartite matching problem. We need to find a perfect matching between the two sets: rebels (spaceships) and bases. But not just any matching—only those that result in no two edges crossing.\n\nWait, but how do we check if the edges in the matching don't cross? Because the matching must be such that when you draw the lines connecting the bases to their assigned spaceships, none of these lines intersect each other.\n\nSo, the approach is probably to generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases and then, for each matching, check whether the corresponding lines are non-intersecting.\n\nBut wait, considering that R and B can be up to 10 each, the number of possible perfect matchings could be up to 10! which is about 3.6 million. That's manageable, right? Because 3.6 million is not too big for a program to handle, especially since each check isn't too computationally expensive.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read all the input data: the positions of the spaceships and the bases.\n2. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases. Since R equals B, each matching uses all spaceships and all bases.\n3. For each matching, check if the lines formed by the assignments do not intersect.\n4. If any matching satisfies this condition, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, output \"No\".\n\nBut wait, how do we efficiently represent the matchings and check for intersections?\n\nLet's think about the representation. Each matching can be represented as a permutation where each index (representing a spaceship) is mapped to a base. For example, if we have spaceships at indices 0, 1, 2 and bases 0, 1, 2, a matching could be [1, 0, 2], meaning spaceship 0 is assigned to base 1, etc.\n\nThen, for each permutation, we need to consider the lines between each spaceship and its assigned base. We need to make sure that no two lines cross each other.\n\nHow to check if lines intersect?\n\nEach line is defined by two points: the spaceship and the base. We can represent each line with two endpoints. Then, for every pair of lines, we check if they intersect, and if they do, the matching is invalid.\n\nSo for each matching, we need to:\n\n- Create a list of pairs (spaceship, base) based on the permutation.\n- For every pair of lines, determine if they intersect.\n- If any two lines intersect, discard this matching; else, it's valid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each perfect matching:\n   create a list of (space_i, base_j) pairs\n   sort them or something?\n   check all pairs of lines for intersection\n\nNow, the question is, how to efficiently implement the line intersection check.\n\nFirst, to represent a line, we can represent it with two points: the spaceship and the base. Then, two lines AB and CD intersect if the points are not colinear and the lines cross each other.\n\nTo check if two line segments AB and CD intersect, we can use the standard computational geometry approach.\n\nSo, the algorithm for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect is as follows:\n\nCompute the orientation of various points. Orientation(p, q, r) returns:\n- 0 if p, q, r are colinear,\n- 1 if p and q are on opposite sides of r,\n- -1 otherwise.\n\nThen, the segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n- AB and CD are not colinear,\n- and the orientations of A,B,C and A,B,D indicate that C and D are on opposite sides of AB,\n- and the orientations of C,D,A and C,D,B indicate that A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to compute the intersection point and see if it lies within both segments.\n\nBut implementing this correctly can be a bit tricky, so I need to make sure I get it right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vector math to find the intersection.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to stick with the standard method.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps for the line segment intersection function:\n\nFunction: segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2)\n   where a1 and a2 are the endpoints of the first segment, and b1 and b2 are the endpoints of the second.\n\nCompute the four orientation values:\no1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\no2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\no3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\no4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n\nIf o1 != o2 and o3 != o4: return True (the lines cross)\nElse: return False (they don't intersect or are parallel and don't overlap)\n\nBut wait, what about when the segments are overlapping or colinear? In that case, if any part of the segments overlaps, the lines are considered to be intersecting.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the paths should not intersect. So even if two lines are colinear and overlapping, that's a problem because their paths would collide.\n\nSo in that case, we need to ensure that for two segments, if they are colinear and overlapping (i.e., share any common point), they are considered to intersect.\n\nTherefore, the function needs to return True not only when the lines cross, but also when they are colinear and share any common point.\n\nSo how to adjust the function?\n\nHmm, perhaps the function should return True in the following cases:\n\nCase 1: The two line segments intersect in their interior (crossing).\n\nCase 2: The two line segments are colinear and at least one point of one segment coincides with a point of the other segment.\n\nSo, the function needs to account for both cases.\n\nThis complicates things a bit.\n\nAn alternative approach is to check if the segments intersect in any way, including overlapping on a line.\n\nSo, the revised function:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if either:\n\na) They cross each other (as per the original condition), or\n\nb) They are colinear and have at least one point in common.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, check if the two lines are colinear. If not, proceed with the original check.\n\nIf they are colinear, then check if any of the endpoints of one segment lie on the other segment.\n\nSo, step-by-step:\n\nFunction segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n\nCheck if the two segments are colinear:\n\nif orientation(a1, a2, b1) == 0 and orientation(a1, a2, b2) == 0:\n\n   Then, they are on the same line.\n\n   Now, check if any of the endpoints of AB lie on CD.\n\n   Check if b1 is on AB, or b2 is on AB, or a1 is on CD, or a2 is on CD.\n\n   Wait, but that's redundant. Because if the lines are colinear, then the segments could overlap. So, to see if the segments share any point.\n\n   So, to check if the segments AB and CD have any point in common.\n\n   One way is to see if the projections of the segments onto the line's direction are overlapping.\n\n   Alternatively, since the points are in integer coordinates (no, wait, the problem says that the input coordinates can be up to 10000, but it's not specified if they are integers. Oh, wait, the input is given as integers? Because the sample input shows integers.)\n\nAssuming that all coordinates are integers, perhaps we can use that to optimize.\n\nBut regardless, perhaps the way to proceed is to collect all points of both segments and see if any of them coincide.\n\nWait, but that's not efficient, but given that the maximum R and B is 10, it's manageable.\n\nSo, for the colinear case:\n\nCheck if any of a1, a2, b1, b2 are equal.\n\nIf any of them are, then the segments intersect.\n\nOtherwise, check if the segments overlap in a way that extends beyond the individual points.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to parametrize the line and see if the segments' intervals overlap.\n\nBut that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the colinear case, we can represent the line as a parametric equation and see if there exists a t value in [0,1] for both segments.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to compute the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates for each segment, and see if their bounding boxes overlap.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because the segments might be on the same line but not overlapping.\n\nWait, for example, two segments on a line that are separate.\n\nSo, for the colinear case:\n\nCheck if the segments have any point in common.\n\nWe can do this by checking if any of the four points (a1, a2, b1, b2) are in the other segment.\n\nWait, but that's not enough because two points on the same line may lie on the same line but not on the same segment.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is:\n\nCheck if the line segments AB and CD are colinear.\n\nThen, project all four points onto a single parameter (like t along the line) and see if the ranges overlap.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: for the colinear case, calculate the distance from a point on one segment to the other segment.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest way is to check if any of the four points lie on the other segment.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct.\n\nBecause, for example, suppose AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), and CD is from (1,1) to (3,3). Then, the entire CD is on the same line as AB, but the two segments don't overlap except at (1,1) and (2,2). So, the segments AB and CD share two points, so they intersect.\n\nAlternatively, if AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), and CD is from (1,1) to (2,2). Then, the segments share a point at (2,2), so they intersect.\n\nSo, in the colinear case, the segments intersect if any of the four endpoints lie on the other segment, or if the segments' ranges on the line overlap.\n\nBut checking if any endpoint lies on the other segment is straightforward.\n\nWait, but wait: For a point P to be on segment AB, it must satisfy that it's collinear (which we've already checked) and that it lies between A and B.\n\nSo, in the colinear case, for each point in CD (b1 and b2), check if it's on AB. Similarly, check if a1 and a2 are on CD.\n\nIf any of these is true, then the segments intersect.\n\nOtherwise, check if the projections of the segments on the line's direction overlap.\n\nWait, but how to represent that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the colinear case, we can compute the relative positions of the segments.\n\nSince the line is straight, the order of the points can be determined by their parameter along the line.\n\nSo, for example, for AB, we can find a parameter t for each point, and for CD as well.\n\nIf the ranges of t for AB and CD overlap, then the segments intersect.\n\nSo, let's try to compute that.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, choose a direction vector for the line (since it's colinear), then express each point in terms of a scalar projection along that vector.\n\nFor example, for line AB, direction vector is (dx, dy) = (a2.x - a1.x, a2.y - a1.y).\n\nBut since it's the same line as CD, dx and dy are the same.\n\nWait, no. Because for the colinear case, the direction vectors for both segments are the same or scaled versions.\n\nSo, for the line L, the direction vector can be represented as (dx, dy). Then, for a point P on L, the parameter t can be calculated as (P.x - a1.x)/dx if dx is not zero, else (P.y - a1.y)/dy.\n\nBut dealing with division and potential division by zero can complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps represent each point on the line as a multiple of some base vector.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to represent the parametric equations for the two segments.\n\nSegment AB can be expressed as a1 + t*(a2 - a1), where t is in [0,1].\n\nSegment CD can be expressed as b1 + s*(b2 - b1), where s is in [0,1].\n\nIf there exist t and s in [0,1] such that a1 + t*(a2 - a1) = b1 + s*(b2 - b1), then the segments intersect.\n\nBut solving for t and s can be done algebraically.\n\nBut perhaps that's a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, since all four points are on the same line, we can compute the distance between the segments and see if they have any overlapping points.\n\nWait, but perhaps the best way is to check if any of the four endpoints lie on the other segment.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because the segments could overlap without any endpoints coinciding.\n\nFor example, AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), CD is from (1,1) to (3,3). The segments share a point at (1,1), (2,2), etc. Wait, no, in this case, the segments would share (1,1) and (2,2), so the endpoints would be on the other segment. So, the initial approach of checking endpoints would catch that.\n\nAnother example: AB is from (0,0) to (1,1), CD is from (0.5,0.5) to (2,2). The segments share the point (0.5,0.5) and (1,1). So, the endpoints are on the other segment.\n\nBut suppose AB is from (0,0) to (3,3), and CD is from (1,1) to (2,2). The segments overlap, but none of the endpoints are on the other segment. So, in this case, our function would miss that the segments intersect.\n\nSo, checking only the endpoints is insufficient.\n\nThus, in the colinear case, we need to do more than just check endpoints.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nIn the colinear case:\n\n1. Check if any of the endpoints of AB lie on CD. If yes, return True.\n\n2. Check if any of the endpoints of CD lie on AB. If yes, return True.\n\n3. Else, check if the projections of the two segments on the line's direction overlap.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWe can compute the minimum and maximum t parameters for each segment.\n\nFor segment AB:\n\nCompute the direction vector (dx, dy). Since it's colinear, for each point, the scalar projection along the direction vector will determine their position.\n\nBut since the direction vector could be zero (all points are the same), but in our problem, it's guaranteed that no three points are colinear, so the direction vector can't be zero unless all points are the same, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, the problem says: 'It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.' So, for the colinear case, the direction vector can't be zero because that would imply all points are the same, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, for each point, compute the t parameter, which is (x - x0)/dx, assuming dx is not zero. But wait, dx could be zero, but in that case, the line is vertical.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to represent each point in parametric form along the line.\n\nLet me pick a base point, say a1, and compute the direction vector (dx, dy). Then, for any point P on the line, the parameter t can be computed as ((Px - a1.x) * dx + (Py - a1.y) * dy) / (dx^2 + dy^2)), but that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps represent the points as fractions along the line.\n\nWait, perhaps for each point, calculate the parameter t such that P = a1 + t*(direction vector).\n\nBut to avoid floating points, perhaps represent t as a ratio of distances.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to represent t as a fraction.\n\nWait, perhaps the direction vector is (dx, dy). For any point P, the scalar product (P.x - a1.x)*dx + (P.y - a1.y)*dy gives the \"signed\" distance along the line, scaled by the length of the direction vector.\n\nWait, no. The scalar product (P.x - a1.x)*dx + (P.y - a1.y)*dy is equal to (dx)(P.x - a1.x) + (dy)(P.y - a1.y), which is the dot product of the vector AP (from a1 to P) and the direction vector (dx, dy). This gives a measure of how far P is along the line, scaled by the length of the direction vector.\n\nBut since the direction vector is normalized, perhaps t can be represented as (AP · direction_vector) / |direction_vector|^2.\n\nBut perhaps it's overcomplicating.\n\nAn alternative idea: for each segment, compute the min and max t values. Then, see if the ranges of t for AB and CD overlap.\n\nBut how to compute t for each point.\n\nAlternatively, for the line, choose a unit vector in the direction of the line. Then, each point can be projected onto this vector, giving a scalar t. The segment's t range can be found, and if the two ranges overlap, the segments intersect.\n\nBut again, this involves some computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimum and maximum x (or y) of each segment and see if their ranges overlap.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because two segments could have overlapping x ranges but not overlapping in y, hence not intersecting.\n\nBut in the colinear case, since all points are on the same line, the x and y are directly related. So, for two segments on a straight line, their x ranges must overlap for their y ranges to overlap as well.\n\nSo, perhaps the following steps:\n\nFor the colinear case:\n\n1. Compute the x_min, x_max of segment AB, and x_min, x_max of segment CD.\n\n   If x_max_AB < x_min_CD or x_max_CD < x_min_AB: the segments do not overlap.\n\n   Else: check further.\n\n2. Similarly, compute y_min and y_max for both segments.\n\n   If the y ranges do not overlap, the segments are on different parts of the line and don't intersect.\n\n3. Else, check if any of the endpoints lie on the other segment.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then the segments intersect.\n\nWait, but step 1 and 2 may not be sufficient because the segments could be on the same line but in different directions, and their x ranges may not overlap.\n\nWait, no. Because if the segments are colinear and their x ranges don't overlap, they are on the same line but in different regions, so they don't intersect.\n\nSo, combining all these:\n\nIn the colinear case, the segments intersect if:\n\n- Either any endpoint of AB is on CD, or any endpoint of CD is on AB.\n\nOR\n\n- The x ranges of AB and CD overlap, and the y ranges of AB and CD overlap, and the segments are not entirely to the left or right of each other.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's redundant. Because for the x and y ranges to overlap, the segments must be in the same area.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor the colinear case:\n\nCheck if any of the four endpoints lie on the other segment.\n\nIf not, compute the x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max for AB and CD.\n\nIf (x_min_AB <= x_max_CD and x_min_CD <= x_max_AB) and (y_min_AB <= y_max_CD and y_min_CD <= y_max_AB), then the segments overlap and thus intersect.\n\nElse, the segments do not intersect.\n\nSo, putting this all together.\n\nImplementing this function is going to be a bit involved, but necessary.\n\nOnce I have this function, I can proceed to check each matching.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read R and B.\n\n2. Read R spaceships' coordinates into a list, say ships.\n\n3. Read B bases' coordinates into a list, say bases.\n\n4. Generate all possible permutations of the bases, where each permutation is a mapping from the ships to the bases. Since R must equal B, each permutation represents a perfect matching.\n\n5. For each permutation:\n\n   a. For each ship i, get the assigned base j (where j = perm[i]).\n\n   b. Collect all the line segments between ships[i] and bases[j].\n\n   c. For each pair of segments in this collection, check if they intersect.\n\n      i. If any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid.\n\n   d. If all pairs are non-intersecting, then this permutation is a valid solution. Return \"Yes\".\n\n6. If after checking all permutations none are valid, return \"No\".\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut considering that R and B are up to 10, the maximum number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, the number of pairs is C(k,2), where k is the number of segments, which is R (since it's a perfect matching). So for each permutation, we have to perform R*(R-1)/2 checks.\n\nFor 10, that's 45 checks per permutation. So total operations are 3.6e6 * 45 = around 162e6 operations. That's acceptable for Python, as each operation is relatively simple.\n\nSo, now, the main tasks are:\n\n- Implementing the line segment intersection function correctly.\n\n- Generating all possible permutations of the bases.\n\nImplementing the permutations: Since the ships are in a certain order, each permutation is a way to assign each ship to a unique base.\n\nBut in Python, permutations are generated using itertools.permutations. So, for the bases, we can generate all possible permutations of length B (but since R and B are equal, each permutation is a perfect matching).\n\nWait, no. The bases are B in number. So, for a perfect matching, each ship is assigned to a base, and each base is assigned to exactly one ship. So, it's a bijection. Hence, the permutations of the bases' indices correspond to the possible assignments.\n\nSo, for example, if there are 3 ships and 3 bases, the possible permutations are the 3! possible ways to assign each ship to a base.\n\nThus, the code can loop through all permutations of the bases' indices, treating each permutation as the assignment.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nships = [...]  # list of ship coordinates\nbases = [...]    # list of base coordinates\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n    # perm is a tuple representing the assignment: ship 0 -> perm[0], ship 1->perm[1], etc.\n    # create list of (ship, base) pairs\n    segments = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        ship_point = ships[i]\n        base_point = perm[i]\n        segments.append( (ship_point, base_point) )\n    \n    # Now, check all pairs of segments for intersection\n    is_valid = True\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n            seg1 = segments[i]\n            seg2 = segments[j]\n            if segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1]):\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n        if not is_valid:\n            break\n    if is_valid:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        exit()\nprint(\"No\")\n\nSo, the key is to implement the segments_intersect function correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about the function.\n\nImplementing segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n\nAs discussed earlier, the function must return True if the two segments AB and CD intersect, including the cases where they are colinear and share a point, or their projections overlap on the line.\n\nSo, the function proceeds as follows:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # First, check if the two lines are not colinear\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    \n    # Case 1: the lines cross each other\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    \n    # Case 2: the lines are colinear\n    # Check if any endpoint is on the other segment\n    if o1 == 0 and on_segment(a1, a2, b1):\n        return True\n    if o2 == 0 and on_segment(a1, a2, b2):\n        return True\n    if o3 == 0 and on_segment(b1, b2, a1):\n        return True\n    if o4 == 0 and on_segment(b1, b2, a2):\n        return True\n    \n    # Case 3: the lines are colinear, but none of the endpoints are on the other segment. Check if the projections overlap.\n    # To do this, check if the x and y ranges overlap.\n    # But for simplicity, perhaps compute the min and max x and y for both segments.\n    # Assuming colinear, so direction is same.\n    # Compute for AB and CD:\n    ab_x_min = min(a1[0], a2[0])\n    ab_x_max = max(a1[0], a2[0])\n    ab_y_min = min(a1[1], a2[1])\n    ab_y_max = max(a1[1], a2[1])\n    \n    cd_x_min = min(b1[0], b2[0])\n    cd_x_max = max(b1[0], b2[0])\n    cd_y_min = min(b1[1], b2[1])\n    cd_y_max = max(b1[1], b2[1])\n    \n    # Check if x ranges overlap\n    if (ab_x_max < cd_x_min) or (cd_x_max < ab_x_min):\n        return False\n    # Check if y ranges overlap\n    if (ab_y_max < cd_y_min) or (cd_y_max < ab_y_min):\n        return False\n    \n    # If all above, the segments overlap on the line.\n    return True\n\nWait, but this is incomplete. Because even if the x ranges and y ranges overlap, the segments might not actually share any points. For example, two parallel lines on the same plane but not overlapping.\n\nWait, no. Because if the lines are colinear and the x and y ranges overlap, the segments must intersect.\n\nWait, because in a colinear line, if the x ranges of the two segments overlap, then their projections on the x-axis overlap, implying that the segments must cross each other somewhere.\n\nWait, no. Because two colinear segments can have overlapping x and y ranges but not share any points. For example, AB is from (0,0) to (1,1), CD is from (0.5,0.5) to (2,2). Their x ranges are 0 to 2 for both, y ranges are 0 to 2 for both. But they share points (0.5,0.5), (1,1), etc. So, the segments do intersect.\n\nWait, another example: AB is from (0,0) to (3,3), CD is from (1,1) to (2,2). The x ranges are 0-3 and 1-2. So, overlapping. The y ranges are 0-3 and 1-2. So, overlapping. And the segments share points (1,1), (2,2), so they intersect.\n\nBut what about AB is from (0,0) to (1,1), CD is from (2,2) to (3,3)? Their x ranges are 0-1 and 2-3, which do not overlap. So, no intersection.\n\nAnother case: AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), CD is from (1,1) to (3,3). x ranges are 0-2 and 1-3. Overlap. y ranges 0-2 and 1-3. Overlap. Segments share (1,1), (2,2). So, intersect.\n\nBut what about AB is from (0,0) to (3,3), and CD is from (1,1) to (4,4). x ranges 0-3 and 1-4: overlap. y ranges 0-3 and 1-4: overlap. The segments share (1,1), (3,3), (4,4)—so they definitely intersect.\n\nSo, perhaps, in the colinear case, if the x and y ranges of the two segments overlap, the segments must intersect.\n\nBut wait, let's think of a scenario where the x and y ranges overlap but the segments are completely separate.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nSuppose AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), and CD is from (1,1) to (3,3). They overlap on x and y. So, definitely intersect.\n\nAnother example: AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), CD is from (0.5,0.5) to (1.5,1.5). x ranges are 0-2 and 0.5-1.5: overlap. y ranges 0-2 and 0.5-1.5: overlap. The segments share (0.5,0.5) to (1.5,1.5), so they do intersect.\n\nAnother example: AB is from (0,0) to (3,3), CD is from (1,1) to (2,2). They share points, so yes.\n\nWhat if AB is from (0,0) to (4,4), CD is from (2,2) to (5,5). They share (2,2), (4,4), so yes.\n\nWait, I'm struggling to find a case where x and y ranges overlap but the segments do not share any points.\n\nWait, perhaps if the segments are arranged in such a way that they are on the same line but the segments are completely separate, but their x and y ranges still overlap.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nFor example, AB is from (0,0) to (3,3), CD is from (1.5,1.5) to (4.5,4.5). Then, x ranges of AB is 0-3, CD is 1.5-4.5. Overlap. y ranges similarly. But the segments AB and CD share the point (1.5,1.5) and (3,3), so they intersect.\n\nAnother example: AB is from (0,0) to (3,3), CD is from (1,1) to (2,2). They share (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) no, wait, CD is from (1,1) to (2,2). So, AB ends at (3,3), CD ends at (2,2). So, they share (1,1) and (2,2). So, yes.\n\nHmm, perhaps in all cases where the x and y ranges of two colinear segments overlap, the segments must intersect. So, perhaps in the function, after checking the endpoints, if the x and y ranges overlap, we can return True.\n\nThus, the function can be written as:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # First, check if the two lines are not colinear\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    \n    # Case 1: the lines cross each other\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    \n    # Case 2: the lines are colinear\n    # Check if any endpoint is on the other segment\n    if o1 == 0 and on_segment(a1, a2, b1):\n        return True\n    if o2 == 0 and on_segment(a1, a2, b2):\n        return True\n    if o3 == 0 and on_segment(b1, b2, a1):\n        return True\n    if o4 == 0 and on_segment(b1, b2, a2):\n        return True\n    \n    # Case 3: the lines are colinear and the segments' projections on the line overlap\n    # Compute x and y ranges for AB and CD\n    ab_x_min = min(a1[0], a2[0])\n    ab_x_max = max(a1[0], a2[0])\n    ab_y_min = min(a1[1], a2[1])\n    ab_y_max = max(a1[1], a2[1])\n    \n    cd_x_min = min(b1[0], b2[0])\n    cd_x_max = max(b1[0], b2[0])\n    cd_y_min = min(b1[1], b2[1])\n    cd_y_max = max(b1[1], b2[1])\n    \n    # Check if x ranges overlap\n    if (ab_x_max < cd_x_min) or (cd_x_max < ab_x_min):\n        return False\n    # Check if y ranges overlap\n    if (ab_y_max < cd_y_min) or (cd_y_max < ab_y_min):\n        return False\n    \n    # If all above, the segments overlap on the line.\n    return True\n\nWait, but in the code above, if the x ranges and y ranges overlap, it returns True, else False.\n\nSo, the function returns True in all cases where the segments intersect, including when they are colinear and share points or have overlapping projections.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement the helper functions: orientation and on_segment.\n\nOrientation(p, q, r) returns:\n\n0 if p, q, r are colinear.\n\n1 if p and q are on opposite sides of r.\n\n-1 otherwise.\n\nThe way to compute this is by calculating the cross product of (q-p) and (r-p).\n\nIf the cross product is zero, they are colinear.\n\nElse, if positive, r is on one side, if negative, on the other.\n\nSo, the function can be implemented as:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0]-p[0])*(r[1]-p[1]) - (q[1]-p[1])*(r[0]-p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\nOn_segment(p, q, r): determines if point r lies on the line segment pq.\n\nFirst, check if r is colinear with p and q (using orientation(p, q, r) == 0).\n\nIf not, return False.\n\nElse, check if r is between p and q.\n\nTo do this, compute the dot product of (r-p) and (q-p). If it's negative, r is before p. If it's positive, after q. Else, between p and q.\n\nBut wait, since p and q are in any order, we can compute:\n\nmin_x = min(p[0], q[0])\n\nmax_x = max(p[0], q[0])\n\nSimilarly for y.\n\nThen, r.x must be between min_x and max_x, and same for y.\n\nBut this is not sufficient due to possible cases where the segment is diagonal. So, to accurately determine if r is on pq, we can check if the point is between p and q.\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute the parameter t, which is the projection of r onto the line pq.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to compute the cross product of (p to r) and (p to q) and see if it's zero (colinear), and then check if the point is within the bounding rectangle of p and q.\n\nWait, but the cross product being zero is not sufficient to be on the segment.\n\nSo, the on_segment function can be implemented as:\n\ndef on_segment(p, q, r):\n    # Check if r is colinear with p and q\n    if orientation(p, q, r) != 0:\n        return False\n    # Check if r is between p and q\n    # Compute the dot product of (r - p) and (q - p)\n    # If it's <= 0, r is before p or exactly p.\n    # If it's >= 0, r is after q or exactly q.\n    # But since we're dealing with integer coordinates, perhaps using integer arithmetic can help.\n    # Or, compute the vectors:\n    # vector_pq = (q.x - p.x, q.y - p.y)\n    # vector_pr = (r.x - p.x, r.y - p.y)\n    # If the dot product of vector_pr and vector_pq is between 0 and |vector_pq|^2, then r is on the segment.\n    # But perhaps it's better to compute using the parametric form.\n\n    # Compute the parametric t for r\n    # Since the line is colinear, r = p + t*(q - p)\n    # So, t can be (rx - px)/(qx - px) if qx != px, else (ry",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship should not intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be modeled as a bipartite matching problem where we need to find a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases. However, we must ensure that the paths (lines) connecting the spaceships to their assigned bases do not intersect.\n\n2. **Intuition**: We need to check all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases. For each matching, we must ensure that the lines formed by connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Bipartite Matching**: Use permutations to generate all possible perfect matchings.\n   - **Line Intersection Check**: For each matching, check if any two lines intersect using computational geometry techniques.\n\n4. **Complexity Consideration**: Given the constraints (R and B up to 10), the number of permutations is manageable (up to 10! = 3.6 million). Each permutation check involves line segment intersection checks, which is feasible.\n\n5. **Line Intersection Check**: Implement helper functions to determine orientation and whether points lie on a segment. Use these to check for intersections between line segments.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\ndef on_segment(p, q, r):\n    if min(p[0], q[0]) <= r[0] <= max(p[0], q[0]) and min(p[1], q[1]) <= r[1] <= max(p[1], q[1]):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    \n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    \n    if o1 == 0 and on_segment(a1, a2, b1):\n        return True\n    if o2 == 0 and on_segment(a1, a2, b2):\n        return True\n    if o3 == 0 and on_segment(b1, b2, a1):\n        return True\n    if o4 == 0 and on_segment(b1, b2, a2):\n        return True\n    \n    ab_x_min = min(a1[0], a2[0])\n    ab_x_max = max(a1[0], a2[0])\n    ab_y_min = min(a1[1], a2[1])\n    ab_y_max = max(a1[1], a2[1])\n    \n    cd_x_min = min(b1[0], b2[0])\n    cd_x_max = max(b1[0], b2[0])\n    cd_y_min = min(b1[1], b2[1])\n    cd_y_max = max(b1[1], b2[1])\n    \n    if (ab_x_max < cd_x_min) or (cd_x_max < ab_x_min):\n        return False\n    if (ab_y_max < cd_y_min) or (cd_y_max < ab_y_min):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    R = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    B = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[idx])\n        y = int(input[idx+1])\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 2\n    \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[idx])\n        y = int(input[idx+1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 2\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of bases\n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            ship_point = ships[i]\n            base_point = perm[i]\n            segments.append((ship_point, base_point))\n        \n        valid = True\n        for i in range(len(segments)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(segments)):\n                a1, a2 = segments[i]\n                b1, b2 = segments[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        \n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    \n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for spaceships and bases.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible ways to assign each spaceship to a base.\n3. **Checking Segments**: For each permutation, we create segments between each spaceship and its assigned base.
