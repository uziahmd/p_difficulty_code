For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given triad (a set of three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The definition of major and minor chords is based on the distances between the notes in a certain order.\n\nHmm, the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the sequence was C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B. But here, it's including H instead of B? Or maybe I'm misreading. Oh no, looking back, the problem says the 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's correct. So after H comes C again.\n\nEach consecutive note has a semitone distance of 1. So from C to C# is 1 semitone, then another for C# to D, etc. So the distance from X to Y is calculated as how many steps you take moving forward in the cycle.\n\nWait, but the distance is measured from the lower tone to the upper one. So, for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones because C->C# (1), C#->D (2), D->D# (3), D#->E (4). But the distance from E to C would be 8 semitones because going the other way around.\n\nSo when determining if a triad is major or minor, we need to consider all possible permutations of the three notes and see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nA major triad requires that, in some order, the first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the second and third are 3 semitones apart. So total 7 semitones apart.\n\nA minor triad requires that the first two are 3 apart, and the second and third are 4 apart. So total 7 semitones again.\n\nSo the approach is: for each possible permutation of the three notes, calculate the distances between consecutive pairs (with wrap-around, since after H comes C). For each permutation (X, Y, Z), compute d1 = distance(X,Y), d2 = distance(Y,Z). Then check if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 (major) or d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 (minor).\n\nIf any permutation meets either condition, we classify the chord accordingly. If none do, it's strange.\n\nBut wait, since the triad is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three notes as a list.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n3. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n   a. Compute the distance between X and Y.\n   b. Compute the distance between Y and Z.\n   c. Check if d1=4 and d2=3: if yes, major.\n   d. Else, check if d1=3 and d2=4: minor.\n4. Once a permutation satisfies either, return the result.\n5. If none satisfy, return 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the answer will always be unambiguous, meaning no chords are both major and minor. So once we find a condition satisfied, we can stop checking further permutations.\n\nNow, the first thing I need is a way to represent the notes in a way that I can compute the distance between two notes. Maybe assign each note an index, and then compute the difference modulo 12.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo let's create a list that maps each note to its position. Let's see:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, no, wait: the problem says the 12 notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the notes were C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B. But perhaps the problem includes H instead of B. So the order is as given.\n\nSo the list should be in the order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says the 12 notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the last note is H. So the next note after H is C again.\n\nSo, let's create a list where each note is in order, and each has an index from 0 to 11.\n\nSo for example, note_to_index = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the note after H is C again. So that's correct.\n\nSo for any two notes, X and Y, their positions are i and j. The distance from X to Y is (j - i) mod 12. Because the scale wraps around. But wait, since the distance is always measured from lower to higher, which means that if Y comes after X in the order, the distance is (j - i). If Y comes before X, the distance is (j + 12 - i). Because moving forward from X to the end and then wrapping around to Y.\n\nWait, no. Because the distance is always from the lower note to the higher one. So for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. C is at 0, E is at 4. So distance is 4. Distance between E and C is 8: because from E (4), moving forward by 8 semitones brings us to C (0 + 8 mod 12 = 8 → 8 is F#? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 0 is C, 1 C#, 2 D, 3 D#, 4 E, 5 F, 6 F#, 7 G, 8 G#, 9 A, 10 B, 11 H. So E is at 4, C is at 0. So the distance from E to C is (0 +12 -4) =8 semitones.\n\nSo the formula for the distance from X to Y is (y_pos - x_pos) % 12 if y >=x, else (y_pos +12 -x_pos) mod 12? Or perhaps it's better to compute (y_pos - x_pos) % 12, but that gives the positive difference.\n\nWait, no. Wait, (y_pos - x_pos) could be negative. So, for example, if x is 4 (E) and y is 0 (C), then (0-4) is -4. Mod 12 would give 8. Which is correct.\n\nWait, let's see: 0 -4 = -4. (-4 mod 12) is 8. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the distance from X to Y is (y_pos - x_pos) % 12.\n\nWait, but wait: the distance is the number of semitones when moving forward from X to Y. So if X is C (0) and Y is C again (0), the distance is 0. If X is C (0) and Y is H (11), the distance is 11. If X is H (11) and Y is C (0), the distance is (0 -11) mod 12 = 1.\n\nWait, no. Because H to C is 1 semitone. So (0 -11) mod 12 is 1, which is correct.\n\nYes, that formula works.\n\nSo for any two notes, their distance is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12.\n\nSo, now, the plan is:\n\nFor each permutation of the three notes:\n\n- Assign X, Y, Z.\n\nCompute d1 = (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12\n\nd2 = (Z_pos - Y_pos) mod 12\n\nCheck:\n\nif d1 ==4 and d2 ==3: major.\n\nelif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4: minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies either, output accordingly.\n\nElse, strange.\n\nSo now, the code steps.\n\nFirst, read the input: three space-separated notes.\n\nThen, for all 6 possible permutations of these three notes.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\nCompute X, Y, Z.\n\nCompute their positions.\n\nCompute d1 and d2.\n\nCheck conditions.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major or minor, output accordingly.\n\nElse, strange.\n\nSo, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent the notes as a list, say notes = [note1, note2, note3].\n\nWe can generate all permutations using itertools.permutations.\n\nEach permutation is a tuple of three elements.\n\nFor each perm in permutations(notes):\n\nx, y, z = perm[0], perm[1], perm[2]\n\nCompute x_pos, y_pos, z_pos.\n\nd1 = (y_pos - x_pos) %12\n\nd2 = (z_pos - y_pos) %12\n\nCheck if (d1, d2) == (4,3): major.\n\nOr (3,4): minor.\n\nIf any permutation hits, we can immediately decide and break.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        print('major')\n        exit()\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        print('minor')\n        exit()\n\nprint('strange')\n\nWait, but what about the possibility that multiple permutations hit? Like, perhaps two different orders satisfy major and minor. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So, once any permutation satisfies, we can return.\n\nBut wait, in code, for each permutation, we check if it's major or minor, and if so, print and exit.\n\nOtherwise, after all permutations, print 'strange'.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, no, the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. So, the first sample input is:\n\nInput line: 'C E G'\n\nWhich is parsed into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nLet's process this:\n\nPossible permutations include (C, E, G).\n\nCompute d1: E is index 4, C is 0. 4-0=4 mod12=4.\n\nd2: G is 7. 7-4=3 mod12=3.\n\nSo d1=4, d2=3: major. So output 'major'.\n\nAnother permutation, like E, C, G:\n\nE to C: (0 -4) mod12=8. Not 3 or4.\n\nC to G: 7-0=7. So not matching.\n\nAnother permutation, G, C, E:\n\nG is 7, C is 0.\n\nd1: (0-7) mod12=5. No.\n\nC to E:4. So 5+4=9, but individual d1 is 5, d2 4: no.\n\nSo the first case correctly outputs 'major'.\n\nSecond test case: 'C# B F' → ['C#', 'B', 'F']\n\nWhat's the note indices?\n\nC# is 1.\n\nB is 10.\n\nF is5.\n\nSo possible permutations:\n\nLooking for any permutation that gives d1=4, d2=3 OR d1=3, d2=4.\n\nLet's try B, C#, F.\n\nB (10), C#(1): d1 is (1-10) mod12 = (1-10)= -9 mod12=3.\n\nd2: F is 5. 5-1=4 mod12=4.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=4: minor. So output is 'minor'.\n\nThird test case: 'A B H' → ['A', 'B', 'H']\n\nA is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCheck permutation A, B, H.\n\nd1: 10-9=1 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H.\n\nd1: 9-10 mod12=11 → no.\n\nWait, perhaps another permutation: H, A, B.\n\nH is 11, A is9.\n\nd1: 9-11 mod12= ( -2 ) mod12=10 → no.\n\nWait, what about permutation A, H, B.\n\nA is9, H is11.\n\nd1:11-9=2 → no.\n\nH to B: 10.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps permutation B, H, A.\n\nB is10, H is11.\n\nd1: 11-10=1.\n\nH to A:9-11= -2 mod12=10.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, permutation H, B, A.\n\nH (11), B (10).\n\nd1:10-11 mod12= -1 mod12=11 → no.\n\nWait, perhaps another permutation: B, H, A.\n\nWait, B is10, H is11, A is9.\n\nd1: (11-10) mod12=1.\n\nd2: (9-11) mod12=10.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe permutation A, B, H isn't working, but perhaps another order.\n\nWait, maybe H, A, B.\n\nH is11, A is9: d1 is (9-11) mod12=10.\n\nA to B is1.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe permutation A, H, B.\n\nA is9, H is11: d1=2.\n\nH to B: (10-11) mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, what about permutation H, A, B?\n\nH is11, A is9: d1=(9-11) mod12=10.\n\nA to B is1.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the notes are A (9), B (10), H (11).\n\nLooking for any permutation where d1 is 3 and d2 is4, or vice versa.\n\nWait, let's consider permutation B, A, H.\n\nB is10, A is9: d1 is (9-10) mod12=11.\n\nA to H: 11-9=2 mod12=2.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, maybe another permutation: A, H, B.\n\nA (9) → H (11): d1 = (11-9)=2.\n\nH (11) → B (10): (10-11) mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps another permutation: H, B, A.\n\nH (11) → B (10): d1= (10-11) mod12=11.\n\nB (10) → A (9): (9-10) mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, seems like none of the permutations satisfy the conditions.\n\nSo the output is 'strange', which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle the sample correctly.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about a chord that is neither major nor minor, but has permutations that may lead to other distances.\n\nLike, for example, C, E, G#.\n\nWait, C is 0, E is4, G# is8.\n\nIn some permutation:\n\nE, C, G#.\n\nd1: (0-4) mod12=8 → no.\n\nOther permutations:\n\nC, G#, E.\n\nd1: G# is8 -0=8.\n\nE is4: 4-8 mod12= ( -4 mod12 )=8 → no.\n\nWait, perhaps another permutation.\n\nWait, maybe the chord is E, G, C.\n\nE is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nd1: 7-4=3.\n\nd2: 0-7 mod12=5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps another example.\n\nWhat about the triad C, D#, G.\n\nWait, C is0, D# is3, G is7.\n\nPermutation C, D#, G:\n\nd1=3-0=3 → no.\n\nBut wait, in this permutation, d1 is3 and d2 is4 (because 7-3=4). So 3 and4: minor.\n\nSo this triad is minor.\n\nSo code would find that permutation and output 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: F, A, C.\n\nWait, F is5, A is9, C is0.\n\nPermutation F, A, C.\n\nd1=9-5=4.\n\nd2=0-9 mod12=3.\n\nSo 4 and3: major.\n\nSo code outputs 'major'.\n\nAnother edge case: the same notes in a different order.\n\nLike, B, D#, G.\n\nB is10, D# is3, G is7.\n\nLooking for any permutation.\n\nIn permutation B, D#, G:\n\nd1=3-10 mod12= (3-10)= -7 mod12=5 → no.\n\nBut permutation D#, B, G:\n\nd1=10-3=7 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: B, G, D#.\n\nd1=7-10 mod12= (7-10)= -3 mod12=9 → no.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps permutation G, B, D#.\n\nG is7, B is10, D# is3.\n\nd1=10-7=3.\n\nd2=3-10 mod12= (3-10)=-7 mod12=5.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=5: no.\n\nWait, another permutation: G, D#, B.\n\nG is7, D# is3, B is10.\n\nd1=3-7 mod12= (3-7)=-4 mod12=8 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code will correctly identify that this chord is neither major nor minor.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nAnother consideration: the same note appearing more than once. But the problem states that it's a set of three notes. Wait, no, the problem says \"unordered set\" implies they are distinct, but the input could have duplicates. But the problem says that Vasya is given three notes, but it doesn't specify they are unique. However, the code doesn't have to worry about that because the same note in two positions would make d1=0, which doesn't fit the required 3 or4 semitones.\n\nSo, for example, if two notes are same, like C, C, E.\n\nBut in any case, the code would process them correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: a chord where the notes are arranged such that in some permutation, the distances are 4 and 3, but others are not.\n\nBut the code would catch the first occurrence.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is three space-separated tokens, which can be read via input().split().\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n\nFor each, compute x, y, z.\n\nCompute d1 and d2.\n\nCheck if any permutation meets the major or minor condition.\n\nElse, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, implement that.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The classification is based on the distances between consecutive notes when ordered in a specific way.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: A major triad is defined by two specific distances between consecutive notes: 4 semitones and then 3 semitones. A minor triad is defined by the reverse order: 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones. The notes are cyclic, meaning after H comes C again.\n2. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: We map each note to an index from 0 to 11 based on their position in the musical scale.\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Since the order of notes can vary, we generate all permutations of the three given notes.\n4. **Calculating Distances**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n5. **Checking Conditions**: Check each permutation to see if it meets the criteria for a major or minor triad. If any permutation satisfies either condition, classify the chord accordingly. If none do, classify it as strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print('major')\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print('minor')\n        exit()\n\nprint('strange')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Mapping Notes**: Each note is assigned an index from 0 to 11, which helps in calculating the distance between notes.\n- **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes to check every potential arrangement.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modular arithmetic to ensure it wraps around correctly after H.\n- **Check Conditions**: For each permutation, we check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If found, we immediately print the result and exit. If no valid permutation is found, we print 'strange'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine the type of triad or classify it as strange, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.",
