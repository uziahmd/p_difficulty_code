He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to convert a number from base a to base b, but the catch is that when the second part is 'R', it means that the target base is the Roman numeral system. So, the problem has two main parts: converting numbers to and from Roman numerals, and handling other bases.\n\nFirst, let me understand the input format. The first line gives a and b, where b can be 'R'. The second line gives c in base a. So, I need to read this c, possibly converting it into an integer, then represent it in base b, which could be the Roman system.\n\nWait, so the steps are:\n\n1. Parse the input c as a number in base a.\n2. Convert this number into an integer (base 10).\n3. Then, if the target base (b) is not Roman, convert the integer to base b as a string.\n4. If the target base is Roman (i.e., 'R'), then we need to represent the integer as a Roman numeral string.\n\nHmm, right. So, the plan is:\n\n- Read a and b. If b is 'R', then the output is a Roman numeral. Else, output the number in base b as a string.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the case where the target base is Roman? For example, if the input is '5 R', meaning the number is 5 in base a, and I need to output it in Roman numerals as 'V'.\n\nSo, the first step is to process the input correctly.\n\nLet's think about the helper functions needed.\n\nI need a function to convert a Roman numeral string to its integer value. And another function to convert an integer back to a Roman numeral string.\n\nAlso, for the base conversion, I need a function that converts a number from base a to base 10, and another that converts from base 10 to base b.\n\nLet me outline the functions:\n\n1. roman_to_int(s): Converts a Roman numeral string to its integer equivalent.\n2. int_to_roman(n): Converts an integer to a Roman numeral string.\n3. str_to_num(s, base): Converts a string in given base to an integer.\n4. num_to_str(n, base): Converts an integer to a string in the given base, without leading zeros.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, each door has four parts. The second part is either b or R. So, when the second part is R, the target base is Roman; otherwise, it's the given base.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\nEach door has four parts: a, b_or_R, c, empty. To open the door, c (in base a) should be written in base b (or Roman if b is R). So, the process is:\n\nc is a number in base a. We convert it to base 10, then write it in base b (if b is not R), else write it as a Roman numeral.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input:\n\nThe first test case is a=10, b=2, c='1' in base 10. So 1 in base 2 is '1', output is '1'.\n\nAnother test case: a=16, b='R', c='5' in base 16. So 5 in base 16 is 5 in decimal, which is written as 'V' in Roman.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read a and b (b can be 'R').\n- Read c, which is a string representing a number in base a.\n- Convert c to a decimal integer (n).\n- If b is 'R', output n as a Roman numeral.\n- Else, convert n to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\nSo, the core is converting c from base a to decimal, then based on b, either convert to Roman or to base b.\n\nNow, the first challenge is writing the function to convert c (a string in base a) to an integer. Also, handling cases where a is larger than 10, which includes letters A-Z (but since a and b are up to 25, letters go up to Y, etc.? Or perhaps it's base 10 with digits beyond 9 represented by letters.)\n\nWait, no. Wait, when a is a base, the digits can be 0-9 and then letters A-Z for 10 onwards. But in the problem statement, each digit is a single character. So, for example, in base 16, the digits are 0-9, A-F.\n\nSo, for the conversion from base a to decimal, each character in the string must be converted to its corresponding value.\n\nSo, for a function str_to_num(s, base):\n\nLoop through each character in s, from left to right.\n\nFor each char, if it's a digit, get its integer value. Else, if it's a letter, compute its position in the alphabet: 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, ..., 'Z' is 35. But wait, since a and b are up to 25, the maximum digit is 25, so letters go up to 'Y' (25).\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the second part is either a number or R. So, for the target base, when it's not R, it's a numerical base.\n\nSo, in the function, the base is given as an integer, except when it's R.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the input, the second line's b can be R. So, in the code, when b is R, we need to output the integer as a Roman numeral. Otherwise, we treat b as a base number.\n\nSo, the first thing is to parse a and b correctly.\n\nIn the input, the first line is a and b. So, for example, in the sample input, one of the lines is '16 R', which is a=16, b='R'.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the sample input:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWait, perhaps the way the input is structured is that the first line is a and b, then the next line is c in base a.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input description, the first line is two integers a and b, the second line is c in base a.\n\nSo, for example, the first test case is a=10, b=2, c=1.\n\nSo, in code, the first line is split into a and b. So, in Python, reading the first line, splitting into parts, a is int(parts[0]), b is parts[1], which can be 'R' or a number.\n\nThen, the second line is the c string.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nRead the first line as a and b.\n\nIf b is 'R', then after converting c to integer, we output it as a Roman numeral.\n\nElse, convert c to integer, then convert it to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nSo, the first task is to write the str_to_num function.\n\nImplementing str_to_num(s, base):\n\ns is a string like '1234', and base is an integer between 2 and 25.\n\nWe need to process each character, mapping it to its value.\n\nFor each character in s:\n\n- If it's a digit, its value is int(c).\n- Else, it's a letter, which represents a value: 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, up to 'Z' is 35. But since base can be up to 25, letters beyond 'Y' (25) won't be needed because base is 25, so digits beyond 9 are 10-25.\n\nSo, for a given base, any digit beyond base-1 is invalid, but according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid.\n\nSo, for each character, if it's a letter, we calculate ord(char) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nchar 'A' → 10\n\nchar 'B' → 11\n\nand so on.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\ndef str_to_num(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            val = int(c)\n        else:\n            val = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + val\n    return num\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNext, for the Roman numeral conversion. We need a function that takes an integer and returns the Roman numeral string.\n\nThe rules for Roman numerals are:\n\n- Thousands, millions, etc., use M, MM, MMM, etc.\n\n- For values 1-3999, the symbols are as follows:\n\nI = 1\n\nV =5 \n\nX=10 \n\nL=50 \n\nC=100 \n\nD=500 \n\nM=1000\n\nAnd subtraction is allowed for 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD), 900 (CM).\n\nSo, the approach is to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the value and the corresponding Roman symbol. These tuples should be ordered from largest to smallest, so that the greedy algorithm can subtract the highest possible values first.\n\nSo, the list would be:\n\n[\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I'),\n]\n\nThen, for each value in this list, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, for 385:\n\n- 1000 is too big, so skip.\n\n- 900 is too big, skip.\n\n- 500 is too big, skip.\n\n- 400 is bigger than 385? No, so move on.\n\n- 100: 385 >=100, so subtract 100, add 'C', remaining 285.\n\nRepeat until all are processed.\n\nWait, perhaps better to loop through the list:\n\nInitialize result as empty string.\n\nFor each (value, symbol) in the list:\n\n    while n >= value:\n\n        result += symbol\n\n        n -= value\n\nSo, this will build the Roman numeral correctly.\n\nSo, the function int_to_roman(n) can be implemented as:\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nThat should handle all cases.\n\nWait, but what about zero? According to the problem statement, c is not zero, so n will be at least 1.\n\nSo, that's covered.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe overall steps:\n\n1. Read a and b from the first line.\n\n   For example, if the first line is '10 2', a=10, b=2.\n\n   If it's '16 R', then a=16, b='R'.\n\n2. Read c from the second line. It's a string in base a.\n\n3. Convert c to integer n using str_to_num(c, a).\n\n4. If b is 'R', output int_to_roman(n).\n\n5. Else, output num_to_str(n, b), which is the string representation of n in base b, without leading zeros.\n\nSo, now I need to implement the num_to_str function.\n\nnum_to_str(n, base):\n\nConverts an integer n to a string in base 'base', without leading zeros.\n\nHow to do this?\n\nWe can repeatedly divide n by the base and collect the remainders.\n\nBut we have to handle the case where the base is higher than 10, which requires letters for digits above 9.\n\nSo, the function would look like:\n\ndef num_to_str(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # rem is 10-25, so map to 'A'-'Y'\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    # Reverse the digits to get the correct order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but wait: for example, for n=5 in base 2, it should return '101'.\n\nWait, no, 5 in base 2 is 101.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting with n=5, base=2:\n\ndigits = [1, 0, 1], reversed gives '101'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=25, base=16: 25 is 19 in hex? Wait, no, 25 in base 10 is 19 in hex? Wait, 16*1 + 9 = 25.\n\nWait, 25 in base 16 is '19'? No, wait: 16 is 10, so 25 is 19 in hex.\n\nWait, 16*1 + 9 = 25. So yes.\n\nSo, the function would process 25 as:\n\nn=25, base=16.\n\nrem = 25 %16 =9. rem is less than 10, so add '9' to digits.\n\nn becomes 25//16 =1.\n\nrem =1%16=1 → add '1'.\n\nn becomes 0.\n\nDigits are ['9','1'], reversed is '19'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=26, base=16: 1*16 + 10 → '1A'.\n\nSo, the function seems correct.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, considering the code structure:\n\nRead the first line: a and b.\n\na is an integer, b can be 'R' or an integer.\n\nRead the second line as c.\n\nThen, process:\n\nn = str_to_num(c, a)\n\nif b == 'R':\n\n    print(int_to_roman(n))\n\nelse:\n\n    print(num_to_str(n, int(b)))\n\nBut wait, wait: in the case where b is 'R', the output is the Roman numeral, regardless of the base.\n\nWait, but for the sample input:\n\nIn the third test case, input is '5 R\\n4'\n\nSo, a=5, b='R', c='4' in base 5.\n\nSo, c is '4' in base 5, which is 4 in decimal. So, output is 'IV'?\n\nWait, no: wait, the sample output for that case is 'IV'.\n\nBecause 4 in Roman is IV.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nWait, another example: '2 2\\n1111001'\n\nSo, a=2, b=2. So, the target base is 2.\n\nc is '1111001' in base 2. Let's see: 1+1*2 +1*4 + ... ?\n\nWait, '1111001' in binary is 1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 +1*2^0.\n\nWait, 64 +32 +16 +8 +1 = 121.\n\nSo, 121 in base 2 is '1111001' → correct.\n\nSo, the code would correctly output '1111001'.\n\nAnother example: '12 13\\nA' → a=12, b=13, c='A' in base 12.\n\n'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal. So, in base 13, 10 is 'A' again.\n\nSo, the output is 'A'.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- When the target base is Roman, and n is 0: but according to the problem statement, c is non-zero, so n can't be zero.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the input c is non-zero. So, n will be at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base b, which is 1. But wait, the constraints say a and b are at least 2, except when b is 'R'.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nNow, let's think about the helper functions.\n\nPotential issue: the function str_to_num may have uppercase letters. So, in code, make sure that letters are treated as uppercase.\n\nIn the function, I used c.upper(), so it should handle lowercase letters as well.\n\nAnother point: in the function str_to_num, each character must be a valid digit for base a. But according to the problem statement, the input is always valid, so we don't need to handle errors.\n\nSo, code-wise, the functions should work.\n\nNow, let's test some cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: a=10, b=2, c='1'\n\nProcessing:\n\nc is '1' in base 10 → 1.\n\nb is 2, so output is '1' in base 2 → '1'.\n\nSample output is '1' → correct.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b='R', c='5' → c is '5' in base 16 → 5 in decimal.\n\nOutput as Roman: 'V' → correct.\n\nTest case 3:\n\na=5, b='R', c='4' → 4 in base 5 is 4 → Roman is 'IV' → correct.\n\nTest case 4:\n\na=2, b=2, c='1111001' → 121 in decimal, base 2 is '1111001' → correct.\n\nTest case 5:\n\na=12, b=13, c='A' → 10 in decimal. In base 13, 10 is 'A' → correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c='FF' → FF in base 10 is 15*16 + 15= 255. So, output is 'FF' in base 16, which is 'ff' in lowercase, but the function outputs uppercase letters.\n\nWait, in the function num_to_str, the digits are built as 'F' and 'F', so the output is 'FF'.\n\nAnother test case: n=1994 → Roman numeral is 'MCMXCIV'.\n\nSo, for a=10, b='R', c='1994' → output is 'MCMXCIV'.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about n=0? According to the problem statement, it's not possible, as c is non-zero.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, base=2 → '11'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead a and b from the first line.\n\nIn Python:\n\nline1 = input().split()\n\na = int(line1[0])\n\nb = line1[1]\n\nBut wait, what if the line is something like '16 R'? Then, line1[1] is 'R'.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, read c from the second line.\n\nc = input().strip()\n\nSo, for example, in the sample, the first test case is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSo, the second line is '1' for the first test case.\n\nThen, process:\n\nn = str_to_num(c, a)\n\nif b == 'R':\n\n    print(int_to_roman(n))\n\nelse:\n\n    print(num_to_str(n, int(b)))\n\nWait, but in the code, when b is not R, it's treated as an integer. So, when the first line is '10 2', b is '2' → correct.\n\nNow, implementing all functions.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing the helper functions:\n\ndef str_to_num(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            val = int(c)\n        else:\n            val = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + val\n    return num\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef num_to_str(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nNow, the main code:\n\na, b = input().split()\na = int(a)\nc = input().strip()\n\nn = str_to_num(c, a)\n\nif b == 'R':\n    print(int_to_roman(n))\nelse:\n    print(num_to_str(n, int(b)))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when the target base is 2, for example, the output is correct.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nSample Input 1: a=10, b=2, c=1 → output '1'.\n\nSample Input 2: a=16, b='R', c=5 → output 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3: a=5, b='R', c=4 → output 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4: a=2, b=2, c=1111001 → 121 → output '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5: a=12, b=13, c=A → 10 → output 'A'.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c=255 → 255 in base 10. Output as base 16: 'FF'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c=256 → 256 is 100 in hex → output '100'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c= '1AB' → 1*16^2 + 10*16 + 11 = 256 + 160 +11= 427 → 427 in hex is 1AB.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What about when the base is 1? Not possible, as per the constraints.\n\n- What about when the number is zero? According to the problem statement, it's not present.\n\n- What about when the number is zero in base 10? But c is non-zero.\n\nSo, the code should handle everything.\n\nSo, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which can either be a numerical base or a Roman numeral system. The solution involves reading the input, converting the number to an integer, and then converting it to the target base or Roman numeral as specified.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains two integers `a` and `b`. The second line contains a string `c` which represents a number in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion Functions**:\n   - `str_to_num(s, base)`: Converts a string from a given base to an integer.\n   - `int_to_roman(n)`: Converts an integer to its Roman numeral representation.\n   - `num_to_str(n, base)`: Converts an integer from base 10 to a specified base (as a string).\n3. **Processing**:\n   - Convert the input string `c` from base `a` to an integer.\n   - If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the integer to a Roman numeral using `int_to_roman`.\n   - Otherwise, convert the integer to the specified base `b` using `num_to_str`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef str_to_num(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            val = int(c)\n        else:\n            val = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + val\n    return num\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef num_to_str(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n# Read input\na, b = input().split()\na = int(a)\nc = input().strip()\n\nn = str_to_num(c, a)\n\nif b == 'R':\n    print(int_to_roman(n))\nelse:\n    print(num_to_str(n, int(b)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line is split into `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R'. The second line is read as the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Integer**: The function `str_to_num` converts the string `c` from base `a` to an integer.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If `b` is 'R', the integer is converted to a Roman numeral using `int_to_roman`.\n4. **Base Conversion**: If `b` is a numerical base, the integer is converted to the specified base using `num_to_str`, ensuring no leading zeros.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both numerical base conversion and Roman numeral conversion, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases as specified.",
