He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to convert a number from base a to base b, but the catch is that when the second part is 'R', it means that the target base is the Roman numeral system. So, the problem has two main parts: converting numbers to and from Roman numerals, and handling other bases.\n\nFirst, let me understand the input. The first line is a and b, which are integers. But b could be 'R' if it's the Roman system. Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement: the second part is either an integer or 'R'. So, in the input, the second number on each line is either an integer (like '2') or 'R' indicating that the base is Roman. So for each test case, we have a number in base a that needs to be converted into base b (which is either a number or R).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the first line contains two integers a and b, but b can be R. Oh wait, no—looking at the sample input, the first line is '10 2', then '16 R', etc. Wait, perhaps each line represents a different test case. Or maybe the first line is a and b, but the next lines are separate inputs for c and the base.\n\nWait, the input structure is unclear. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe input is: The first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system. Then the next line is a single non-negative integer c in base a, possibly with leading zeros, and length up to 103.\n\nSo, the first line is a and b, where b can be 'R' or an integer. Wait, no—the first line has two integers a and b. But in the sample input, it's written as ['10 2', ...], so in the first line, a=10, b=2. Then, the next lines are for c and the base, but wait, no—the next line is the c string in base a. So the second part of the input is for c, but what about the base? Wait, perhaps each test case has a, b, and c, but in the first line, a and b are given, and then the next line is c.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the first line is a and the base for c, and then the second line is c. No, the problem says, \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\". So, each test case is a line with a and b, followed by a line with c in base a.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial problem statement is a bit confusing. Let me read again:\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\nOh right, so each test case is two lines: the first line is a and b, the second line is c in base a.\n\nSo, for each test case, I have to read a and b (where b can be R), and then read c as a string in base a, and convert it to base b.\n\nBut wait, the output is to write c in base b, but without leading zeros.\n\nSo, the steps I need to do are:\n\n1. For each test case:\n   a. Read a and b. If b is 'R', then we are dealing with Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's an integer.\n   b. Read c as a string in base a.\n   c. Convert c from base a to base b, considering whether b is Roman or not.\n   d. Output the result without leading zeros.\n\nSo, the main challenge is to handle the conversion between different numeral systems, including Roman numerals.\n\nLet me break down the problem into functions:\n\nFunction 1: Convert a number from base a (a is an integer) to base b, which can be either an integer or 'R' (Roman). So, if b is 'R', the function will return the Roman representation of the number.\n\nFunction 2: Convert a Roman numeral string to its integer value. This is necessary because when the target base is Roman, the process involves converting the number to integer and then to Roman.\n\nBut wait, no: the conversion from base a to base b when b is R is to convert the number to an integer, then represent that integer as a Roman numeral.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each test case:\n   - Read a and b.\n   - Read c_str, which is the number in base a.\n   - Convert c_str from base a to an integer (value).\n   - If b is not 'R':\n      - Convert this value to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n   - Else (b is 'R'):\n      - Convert the value to a Roman numeral string.\n   - Output the resulting string.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n1. Parsing c_str in base a to get its integer value.\n2. Converting that integer to base b, or to Roman if needed.\n3. Handling Roman numeral conversions correctly, considering all possible subtractive cases.\n\nNow, the first task is to implement a function to convert a string in base a to an integer. That's straightforward.\n\nSecond, implement a function to convert an integer to a Roman numeral. Also manageable, but tricky due to the subtractive notation rules.\n\nThird, implement a function to convert an integer to another base (non-Roman), which is just standard base conversion.\n\nSo, let's outline each function.\n\nParsing base a string to integer:\n\nThis function takes a string s and an integer base a. Each character in s represents a digit in base a. We'll process each character, mapping it to its value, and compute the integer.\n\nFor example, '1' in base 10 is 1, 'A' in base 16 is 10, etc.\n\nWe need to create a mapping from characters to their respective values. For bases up to 25, the digits are 0-9, A-Z (uppercase, since lowercase isn't mentioned). So for a given base a, the allowed digits are 0-9 and A-Z, uppercase.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, c can have leading zeros, but when converting to base b, we must omit leading zeros.\n\nSo, the parsing function needs to process each character, treating '0'-'9' as their numeric values, and 'A'-'Z' as 10-35 respectively.\n\nWait, but the base a can be up to 25. So, for base a, the maximum digit is a-1. So, for a=16, digits can be 0-15, which includes F (15). So, for a base a, the allowed digits are 0-9, then letters A-Z up to (a-1), but only if a is larger than 10.\n\nSo, during parsing, any character that is not a valid digit in base a should cause an error, but according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nSo, the parsing function can proceed under the assumption that the input is correct.\n\nImplementing the parser:\n\nCreate a dictionary that maps each character to its value. For example, '0' →0, '1'→1, ..., '9'→9, 'A'→10, 'B'→11, ..., 'Z'→35.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the number is in base a, which can be up to 25. So, for a=25, the digits can go up to 24, which is represented by 'O' (since 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 24 O).\n\nSo, the mapping is correct.\n\nNow, for the parser function:\n\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n    mapping = {\n        '0': 0,\n        '1': 1,\n        ... up to '9':9,\n        'A':10, 'B':11,... up to 'Z':35\n    }\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        digit = mapping[c]\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the string starts with '0'? Like '00123' in base 10. The function correctly parses it as 123.\n\nNow, the function to convert an integer to Roman numerals.\n\nThe rules for Roman numerals are as follows:\n\n- The symbols are ordered from largest to smallest: M (1000), CM (900), D (500), CD (400), C (100), XC (90), L (50), XL (40), X (10), IX (9), V (5), IV (4), I (1).\n\nEach symbol can be used up to certain times. For example, M can be used up to three times (for 3000), but in the problem statement, the maximum number is 300010 when using Roman numerals.\n\nWait, the problem note says that when using Roman numerals, the number is ≤300010. So, our function must handle numbers up to 300010.\n\nSo, the approach is to build the Roman numeral string by subtracting the largest possible values and appending the corresponding symbols.\n\nWe can create a list of tuples, each tuple containing the value and the corresponding Roman symbol. The list should be in descending order of the values.\n\nThe standard list is:\n\n[\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I'),\n]\n\nSo, for a given integer n, we iterate through this list and for each (value, symbol), while n >= value, append the symbol to the result string and subtract value from n.\n\nFor example, 254 becomes 'CCLIV'.\n\nSo, the function int_to_roman(n) will work as:\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res += r\n            n -= i\n    return res\n\nYes, that should handle all cases up to 300010.\n\nNext, the function to convert an integer to a different base, not Roman. So, for example, converting from base 10 to base 2, etc.\n\nThe standard way is:\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    res = []\n    while n > 0:\n        res.append(str(n % base))\n        n = n // base\n    # Reverse the list and join\n    res.reverse()\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nBut this function returns a string, which may have leading zeros if the base is higher than 10 and the digits are zero-padded. But in our case, since the output must not have leading zeros, the function is correct.\n\nWait, but in the function, for n=0, it returns '0', which is correct.\n\nTesting this function:\n\nint_to_base(5, 2) → '101'\n\nint_to_base(10, 13) → 'A' because 10 is 'A' in base 13.\n\nWait, no. 10 divided by 13 is 0, remainder 10. So, the function appends '0', then 10. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, for n=10, base=13:\n\nn//base is 0, so the loop runs once.\n\nres starts as empty. 10 % 13 is 10, which is added. Then n becomes 0. The loop ends, and res is [str(10)], reversed gives [str(10)] → joined is '10'. But in base 13, 10 is represented as 'A'.\n\nAh, right. So, the function as written will return '10', which is incorrect for base 13.\n\nSo, the function needs to map the digits beyond 9 to their corresponding letters.\n\nSo, the function should have a way to map the remainder (digit) to the correct character when the base is higher than 10.\n\nWait, but in the general case, the function is supposed to take any base (but according to the problem statement, bases are up to 25). So, for base 25, the digits can be 0-24, which are 0-9, then A-P (10-24).\n\nSo, the function needs to convert the remainder (digit) into the correct character.\n\nSo, the function int_to_base should handle this:\n\ndigits = []\nfor i in range(len(res)):\n    digit = int(res[i])\n    if digit < 10:\n        digits.append(chr(ord('0') + digit))\n    else:\n        digits.append(chr(ord('A') + digit - 10))\n\nThen, the digits are reversed and joined.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to create a helper function that converts a digit (integer) to the corresponding character for a given base.\n\nAlternatively, modify the int_to_base function.\n\nLet me think: for each remainder, if it's less than 10, use the digit as is. Else, for 10, use 'A', 11 'B', etc.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # rem is 10-35?\n            # Since base is up to 25, rem can be up to base-1, which is 24.\n            # So for rem 10, 'A'; 11 'B', etc.\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    # Now, reverse the digits to get the correct order\n    digits.reverse()\n    return ''.join(digits)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting this function:\n\nn=10, base=13 → rem=10 → 'A', n becomes 0. So the digits are ['A'], joined as 'A'.\n\nn=5, base=2 → rem 1, then 0. digits are ['1','0'], reversed → '10'.\n\nn=25, base=25 → rem 0, then 1. digits are ['0','1'], reversed → '10'.\n\nn=26, base=25 → 26//25=1, rem=1 → digits are '1' and '1' → reversed '11'.\n\nAnother test: n=40, base=14 → 40 ÷14 is 2, rem 12. So, 12 is 'C' (since 10 is A, 12 is C). So digits are 'C' and '2' → 'C2' when reversed? Wait, no:\n\nWait, 40 divided by 14 is 2, rem 12.\n\nLoop:\n\nn=40 → rem=40%14= 40-14*2=12 → rem=12 → 'C'.\n\nn = 2.\n\nn=2 → rem=2 → '2'.\n\ndigits are ['C', '2'].\n\nReversed → '2C'.\n\nWhich is correct because 2*14 + 12 = 40.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the function should now correctly handle any base up to 25.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo, the steps for each test case:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf b is 'R', then we need to convert the number to an integer, then to a Roman numeral.\n\nElse, convert the number to base b as a string.\n\nNow, the main steps:\n\nRead the first line as a and b.\n\nRead the second line as c_str.\n\nConvert c_str from base a to integer, say num.\n\nIf b is 'R':\n\n   output = int_to_roman(num)\n\nElse:\n\n   output = int_to_base(num, b)\n\nPrint the output.\n\nSo, now, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: c_str is '0' in base a. According to the problem statement, the number is not zero, so this is not a concern.\n\nWait, no: the problem says it's guaranteed that the number is not zero unless it's in the Roman system, but in that case, zero is not allowed either. So, in our function, we don't have to handle zero, except when the output is zero, which for non-Roman bases is '0'.\n\nWait, no: for non-Roman bases, the output cannot have leading zeros. So, if the number is zero, the output is '0'. But according to the problem statement, the number is never zero, so we can ignore that.\n\nOther edge cases:\n\n- When a and b are same: e.g., a=10, b=10 → output is same as c_str.\n\n- When the number is 0: but the problem says it's not allowed.\n\n- When the number is 1 in base a: e.g., a=2, c_str is '1' → in base b=10, it's '1'.\n\n- For Roman numerals:\n\n   For example, num=4 → 'IV'.\n\n   num=9 → 'IX'.\n\n   num=3999 → 'MMMCMXCIX'.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the maximum number when using Roman numerals is 300010. So, our function must handle numbers up to that.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at the int_to_roman function, the maximum value it can handle is 300010.\n\nWait, the highest possible in the problem is 300010. So, our function must correctly represent that.\n\nLet me see:\n\n300010 in Roman numerals:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n300000 = 300 × 1000 → 'MMM'\n\nThen 10: 'X'\n\nSo, MMMX... but wait, 300010 is 300,010.\n\nWait, 300,010 = 300,000 + 10.\n\nSo, Roman is MMMX.\n\nYes, because:\n\n300,000 is 300 × 1000 → MMM.\n\n10 is X.\n\nSo, the Roman numeral is 'MMMX'.\n\nWait, but 300,010 is MMMX.\n\nSo, the int_to_roman function handles this.\n\nBut wait, the function is built with the list in order from largest to smallest. So, for 300010, the function will process 1000 (M), subtract as many as possible.\n\nWait, 300010 ÷1000 is 300. So, 300 Ms, but wait, the function uses 1000, 900, etc. So, 300000 is 300 Ms.\n\nWait, 300010:\n\nn = 300010.\n\nStart with 1000: 300010 >= 1000 → add M, subtract 1000 → 299010.\n\nAgain, 299010 >= 1000 → add M, subtract → 298010.\n\nThis continues until 1000 is subtracted 300 times, leaving 10.\n\nSo, the function adds 'MMM' and then processes 10.\n\nIn the list, 10 comes after 9, etc. So, 10 is processed as 'X'.\n\nSo, the result is 'MMMX'.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: num=400 → 'CD'.\n\nnum=4000 → 'MMMM' ?\n\nWait, but according to the rules, 4000 is written as 'MMMM' (four M's), as there's no specific subtractive case for 4000.\n\nSo, the function correctly outputs 'MMMM'.\n\nThus, the function seems to handle all required cases.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe code steps:\n\nRead the first line: a and b.\n\nBut wait, the first line is read as a string, so for example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2', which splits into a=10, b=2.\n\nBut for cases where b is 'R', the second part is 'R'.\n\nSo, in Python, the first line is split into two parts. If the second part is 'R', then b is 'R'.\n\nElse, it's treated as an integer.\n\nSimilarly, the second line is read as c_str.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef str_to_num(c_str, base):\n    mapping = {}\n    for i in range(10):\n        mapping[str(i)] = i\n    for i in range(26):\n        c = chr(ord('A') + i)\n        mapping[c] = 10 + i\n    num = 0\n    for c in c_str:\n        if c not in mapping:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid character in c_str\")\n        num = num * base + mapping[c]\n    return num\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res += r\n            n -= i\n    return res\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    digits.reverse()\n    return ''.join(digits)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        # Split into a and b\n        a_b = line.strip().split()\n        a = int(a_b[0])\n        if len(a_b) == 2:\n            b = a_b[1]\n        else:\n            # Wait, the first line is two integers, but sometimes 'R' is in the second position.\n            # Hmm, no, the first line is a and b, which are two integers. But according to the problem statement, only b can be R.\n            # Wait, no, the first line is two integers, but in some cases, the second is 'R'?\n\n            # Wait, the problem says: the first line contains two integers a and b.

So, in base 2, it's '1111001' → output is same as c_str.\n\nAnother test case: '12 13\\nA' → a=12, b=13, c_str='A' which is 10 in base 12.\n\nSo, converting 10 to base 13: 10 is 'A' → output is 'A'.\n\nBut wait, wait. The code is reading the second line as c_str, which is in base a. So, for a=12, c_str='A' is 10 in decimal.\n\nThen, converting to base 13: 10 is less than 13, so it's 'A' → output 'A'.\n\nAnother test case: '5 R\\n4' → a=5, b='R', c_str is '4' → which is 4 in base 5 (decimal 4). So, converting to Roman: 'IV'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: '16 R\\n5' → a=16, b='R', c_str is '5' → which is 5 in base 16 (decimal 5). So, Roman is 'V'.\n\nSample output is 'V'.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if the c_str is empty? According to the problem statement, it's non-zero, and length ≥1.\n\n- What if the base is 1? But according to the problem statement, a and b are ≥2, so no problem.\n\n- What about leading zeros in c_str? The function str_to_num correctly ignores leading zeros because the integer value is the same regardless.\n\n- What about the case where the number is zero? The problem says it's not allowed, so no need to handle.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the first line is split into a and b. How?\n\nIn the code:\n\na_b = line.strip().split()\n\nIf the line is '10 2', a_b is ['10', '2'], so a is 10, b is 2.\n\nIf the line is 'R 13', a is 13, b is 'R'? No, wait, no: the first line is a and b. So, if the line is '10 R', a is 10, b is 'R'.\n\nYes, because a_b is split into two elements: '10' and 'R'.\n\nSo, the code correctly sets a=10, b='R'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother point: when converting to base b, which is an integer, the function int_to_base expects n as an integer.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nBut I think the code is correct.\n\nSo, the final code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which can either be a standard integer base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves parsing the input number, converting it to an integer, and then converting it to the target base or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains two integers `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R' indicating Roman numerals. The second line contains the number in base `a` as a string.\n2. **Parsing the Input Number**: Convert the input string from base `a` to an integer.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**:\n   - If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the integer to a Roman numeral string.\n   - Otherwise, convert the integer to the specified base `b`.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the result without leading zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef str_to_num(c_str, base):\n    mapping = {}\n    for i in range(10):\n        mapping[str(i)] = i\n    for i in range(26):\n        c = chr(ord('A') + i)\n        mapping[c] = 10 + i\n    num = 0\n    for c in c_str:\n        if c not in mapping:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid character in c_str\")\n        num = num * base + mapping[c]\n    return num\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res += r\n            n -= i\n    return res\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    digits.reverse()\n    return ''.join(digits)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        a_b = line.strip().split()\n        a = int(a_b[0])\n        b = a_b[1] if len(a_b) > 1 else 'R'\n        if b == 'R':\n            b = int(b)\n        else:\n            try:\n                b = int(b)\n            except:\n                b = int(a_b[1])\n        c_line = input[input.index(line) + 1].strip()\n        c_str = c_line.split()[0]\n        try:\n            num = str_to_num(c_str, a)\n        except:\n            print(\"\")\n            continue\n        if b == 'R':\n            print(int_to_roman(num))\n        else:\n            print(int_to_base(num, b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line. The first line is split into `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R'.\n2. **Parsing the Input Number**: The function `str_to_num` converts the input string from base `a` to an integer using a dictionary to map characters to their respective values.\n3. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', the function `int_to_roman` converts the integer to a Roman numeral string using predefined values and their corresponding symbols.\n4. **Conversion to Base `b`**: The function `int_to_base` converts the integer to the specified base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number and mapping remainders to their respective characters.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed without leading zeros, ensuring the correct format for both numeric bases and Roman numerals.",
