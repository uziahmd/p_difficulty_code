    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Array Stabilization. We are given an array of integers. The instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array. Our task is to remove exactly one element from the array such that the resulting instability is minimized. We need to find this minimum possible instability.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I think is, what's the approach here? Well, let's see.\n\nLet me think about the sample input they provided. For example, in the first case, the array is [1,3,3,7]. If we remove 7, the min is 1 and max is 3, so instability is 2. Alternatively, if we remove any of the other elements, say 1, then the array becomes [3,3,7], with max 7 and min 3, which gives a higher instability of 4. So removing 7 gives the best result.\n\nIn the second example, the array is [1,100000]. Removing either 1 or 100000 leaves an array where both elements are the same, so the instability is zero.\n\nSo the goal is to find, among all possible arrays formed by removing one element, the one with the smallest max - min.\n\nNow, how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to find the current max and min of the entire array. Then, for each element, consider removing it and see what the new max and min would be, and calculate the difference. Then pick the smallest such difference.\n\nBut wait, if I do this naively, for each element, I would need to compute the new max and min of the remaining n-1 elements. But n can be up to 1e5, so doing this for each element would be O(n^2), which is way too slow.\n\nThat won't work. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what happens when we remove an element. The new array's max could be either the original max (if the removed element wasn't the max) or the next highest value. Similarly, the new min could be the original min (if the removed element wasn't the min) or the next lowest value.\n\nWait, that's a good point. So, perhaps, if I precompute for each position the next maximum and next minimum, I can quickly determine what the new max and min would be after removing an element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the best candidates for removal without checking every single possibility.\n\nLet me think: The optimal element to remove is probably either the current maximum, the current minimum, or some other element that is very close to the current max or min.\n\nWait, but not necessarily. For example, suppose the array is [1,2,3,4]. The current max is 4, min is 1. The instability is 3. If I remove 2, the new array is [1,3,4], max 4, min 1. Instability is still 3. So in this case, removing any element doesn't help. So the minimal instability is 3.\n\nBut wait, in another case: array [1,5,6,7]. Max is 7, min is 1. If I remove 7, the new max is 6, min is 1. So instability is 5. If I remove 1, new min is 5, max is7. Instability is 2. Oh! So that's better. So in this case, removing the min gives a better result than removing the max.\n\nSo, the initial idea is that removing either the max or the min might give us the minimal instability. But sometimes, removing other elements might yield a better result.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the previous example, when I removed 1, the new array's max is 7, min is 5, so 2. That's better than when I remove 7, which gives 6-1=5. So in that case, removing the min is better.\n\nSo, perhaps, the optimal strategy is to try removing each occurrence of the current max or min. Or maybe even all occurrences of max or min.\n\nWait, because if there are multiple max or min elements, removing one might not change the max or min.\n\nLike, for example, if the array is [3,3,3,5]. The current max is 5, min is 3. So, if I remove one 3, the array remains [3,3,5], so max is 5, min is 3. No change. So removing a non-max or non-min element may not help in this case.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal approach is to:\n\n- Find all the positions where the element is equal to the current max or min.\n\n- For each of these positions, consider removing",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Elements**: The primary candidates for removal are the current maximum and minimum elements of the array. Removing either of these can potentially reduce the instability.\n2. **Check All Extremes**: For each occurrence of the maximum and minimum values, check what the new instability would be if that element is removed. This involves:\n   - Finding the next maximum value if the current maximum is removed.\n   - Finding the next minimum value if the current minimum is removed.\n3. **Compute Instability**: Calculate the instability for each scenario and keep track of the minimum instability found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently consider the most impactful elements for removal, leading to an optimal solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n_and_rest = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(n_and_rest[0])\n    a = list(map(int, n_and_rest[1:n+1]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    current_max = max(a)\n    current_min = min(a)\n    \n    # Find all indices where a[i] is current_max or current_min\n    candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] == current_max or a[i] == current_min:\n            candidates.append(i)\n    \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    for idx in candidates:\n        # Create a temporary array without the current element\n        temp = a[:idx] + a[idx+1:]\n        new_max = max(temp)\n        new_min = min(temp)\n        inst = new_max - new_min\n        if inst < min_instability:\n            min_instability = inst\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the array `a`.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only one element, the instability is trivially zero.\n3. **Finding Extremes**: The current maximum and minimum values of the array are identified.\n4. **Candidates for Removal**: Indices of elements that are either the current maximum or minimum are collected.\n5. **Evaluate Each Candidate**: For each candidate index, the array is temporarily modified by removing the element at that index. The new maximum and minimum values are computed, and their difference (instability) is evaluated.\n6. **Determine Minimum Instability**: The smallest instability from all evaluations is tracked and printed as the result.\n\nThis method efficiently narrows down the potential elements to remove, ensuring we find the optimal solution without unnecessary computations.",
