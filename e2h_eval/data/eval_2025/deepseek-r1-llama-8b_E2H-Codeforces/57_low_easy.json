His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasya's Olympiad results. The teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points in total from both tours. But the results are given for each participant in two separate lists—first tour points and second tour points. The order of these lists isn't aligned with the participants' names, which complicates things because we don't know which a_i corresponds to which b_j.\n\nThe task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved. \n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements:\n\n- Each participant has a score from the first tour (a_i) and the second tour (b_i). These are not in any particular order.\n- The total points for each participant is a_i + b_j. But since the lists are not ordered, we don't know which a and b go together.\n- The rankings are based on the sum of these two scores, sorted in descending order. If sums are equal, the jury can arrange the ranks however they want.\n\nSo, for each possible pair (a_p, b_q), their sum is s = a_p + b_q. All participants' sums are considered, but we have to find all possible sums considering that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nWait, no. Because each participant has one a and one b. So for n participants, each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, but the pairing isn't known. So the problem is to find all possible permutations of the b's to the a's such that the sum for each participant is a permutation where each a is matched to exactly one b.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't about finding all possible sum combinations, but rather figuring out the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve, given that his sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but how? Because the way the pairs are arranged affects the total sums of others and thus their rankings.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, we want as few participants as possible to have a higher sum than Vasya. Conversely, for the worst possible rank, we want as many participants as possible to have a sum higher than Vasya.\n\nBut since the pairing isn't known, we need to find the best and worst possible scenarios across all possible pairings.\n\nThis sounds a bit tricky. How can I model this?\n\nLet me think: For each possible a_i and b_j, compute the sum a_i + b_j. Then, for each possible way to assign the b's to the a's, we can compute the total sums and then determine Vasya's rank in that scenario.\n\nBut wait, the number of possible assignments is n! which is way too big for n=105. So we can't brute force all possibilities.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: To find the best possible rank, find the minimal possible number of participants who have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's maximum possible sum. Wait, no. Because Vasya's sum depends on which a and b he uses.\n\nWait, but Vasya must be part of the pairings. So perhaps, for the best possible rank, we should maximize Vasya's sum, so that as few others can exceed it. But also, when others are paired, their sums might be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps to find the best possible rank:\n\n1. Find the maximum possible sum that Vasya could have, which is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. Because if he takes the highest a and highest b, his sum is as large as possible.\n\nThen, in the best case, the other participants' sums would be as low as possible, which would allow Vasya to have a high rank.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when we assign the maximum a and maximum b to Vasya, the other a's and b's are distributed in a way that may result in more participants having higher sums.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because in the best case, the other participants' sums would be as small as possible, allowing Vasya to be first.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank:\n\n- Assign the highest a and highest b to Vasya. His sum is s_v = a_max + b_max.\n\nThen, for the remaining a's and b's, pair them in a way that minimizes the number of participants with sums > s_v. Ideally, none or as few as possible.\n\nBut how to calculate that.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank is 1. Because if Vasya's sum is s_v, and all others have sums <= s_v, then he's first.\n\nIs that possible? It depends on whether there exists a pairing where all other participants' sums are <= s_v.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Maybe by assigning the largest remaining a and b to others in a way that their sums don't exceed s",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given as two separate lists, but we don't know which participant corresponds to which result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each participant has a score from the first tour (list `a`) and the second tour (list `b`). The total score for each participant is the sum of their scores from both tours. The rankings are based on these total scores, sorted in descending order. If two participants have the same total score, the jury can assign places arbitrarily.\n\n2. **Best Possible Rank**: To achieve the best rank, Vasya should have the highest possible total score. This is achieved by pairing the maximum value from list `a` with the maximum value from list `b`. Then, we check if all other possible pairs can be arranged such that no one else has a higher total score than Vasya.\n\n3. **Worst Possible Rank**: To achieve the worst rank, we need to consider the scenario where Vasya's total score is as low as possible while still meeting the minimum requirement `x`. We then calculate how many participants could have a higher total score than Vasya, which gives us the worst possible rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# To compute all possible sums, generate all possible a[i] + b[j], but since each a and b must be paired exactly once, it's not straightforward.\n# Instead, find the maximum possible sum for Vasya and minimum required sum.\n\nmax_vasya_sum = max(a) + max(b)\nmin_vasya_sum = max(0, 2 * x - (sum(a) + sum(b)))\n\nbest_rank = 1\nworst_rank = n\n\n# Best case: maximize Vasya's sum\nvasya_sum_best = max(a) + max(b)\nothers_sums = []\nfor ai in a:\n    for bi in b:\n        if ai == max_a and bi == max_b:\n            continue\n        others_sums.append(ai + bi)\nothers_sums.sort(reverse=True)\ncount = 0\nfor s in others_sums:\n    if s > yasya_sum_best:\n        count +=1\nif count ==0:\n    best_rank =1\nelse:\n    pass  # It's possible that some have higher sum, so best_rank might be more than 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach here. Let me rethink.\n\nActually, the best possible rank for Vasya is 1 if there exists a way to pair the a's and b's such that no other participant's sum exceeds Vasya's maximum possible sum. Similarly, the worst rank is determined by the number of participants who could have a higher sum than Vasya's minimum possible sum.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\n- For the best rank, find the maximum possible sum Vasya can have (sum of the highest a and highest b), then check if all other possible sums can be arranged such that none exceed this maximum. If yes, best rank is 1.\n\n- For the worst rank, find the minimum possible sum Vasya can have (such that it's at least x), then count how many participants could have a sum higher than this minimum. That count plus one (since Vasya is included) gives the worst rank.\n\nBut considering all possible pairings is computationally expensive. So instead, we can use the following strategy:\n\n1. **Best Rank Calculation**:\n   - Compute the maximum possible sum for Vasya by pairing the highest a and highest b.\n   - Check if all other possible pairs can be arranged such that their sums do not exceed Vasya's sum. If this is possible, the best rank is 1.\n\n2. **Worst Rank Calculation**:\n   - Compute the minimum possible sum for Vasya that is at least x. This is done by ensuring that the sum of the smallest a and largest b or the largest a and smallest b is at least x.\n   - Calculate the number of participants who could have a higher sum than this minimum possible sum of Vasya. The worst rank is this count plus one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\nmax_a = max(a)\nmax_b = max(b)\nmin_vasya_sum = float('inf')\nfor ai in a:\n    for bi in b:\n        if ai + bi >= x:\n            min_vasya_sum = min(min_vasya_sum, ai + bi)\n\nbest_possible = max_a + max_b\nworst_possible = min_vasya_sum\n\nbest_rank = 1\n# Check if all other a_i + b_j <= best_possible\nother_max = 0\nfor ai in a:\n    for bi in b:\n        if ai == max_a and bi == max_b:\n            continue\n        s = ai + bi\n        if s > other_max:\n            other_max = s\nif other_max <= best_possible:\n    best_rank = 1\nelse:\n    # Need to see how many have sum > best_possible\n    count = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        for bi in b:\n            if ai == max_a and bi == max_b:\n                continue\n            s = ai + bi\n            if s > best_possible:\n                count += 1\n    best_rank = count + 1\n\n# For worst rank:\nothers_count = 0\nfor ai in a:\n    for bi in b:\n        s = ai + bi\n        if s > worst_possible:\n            others_count += 1\nworst_rank = others_count + 1\n\nprint(best_rank, worst_rank)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the best and worst possible ranks by considering the maximum and minimum possible sums for Vasya and checking the possible sums of other participants accordingly.",
