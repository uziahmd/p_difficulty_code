The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and also clockwise. So, moving from house i can only go to i+1 (mod n, but since it's a ring, it wraps around after n). \n\nXenia starts at house 1. She has m tasks. For the i-th task, she needs to be at ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So, she must process each task in order, right? Because for each task i, she must have done all j < i already. So the tasks are processed in the order they are given.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that. Oh, perhaps it's that for each task, when she is doing task i, she must have already completed tasks 1 to i-1. So the processing order is sequential, like she does task 1, then 2, etc., up to m. But wait, the input is given as a list of a1, a2, ..., am, which represents the target houses for each task in order. So for each task i, she must reach a_i, and before that, she must have finished all the previous tasks.\n\nSo, the way she moves is such that for each i from 1 to m, she must go from her current position to a_i, possibly visiting other houses along the way, but in a way that minimizes the total time.\n\nBut how do we model this movement?\n\nI think the key here is to model the path she takes, considering that each move is either clockwise or not. Wait, but the traffic is only one way and clockwise. So she can't move counter-clockwise. So movement is strictly in the direction of increasing house numbers, modulo n.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ring is 1,2,...,n connected in a circle, and traffic is one way and clockwise. So from house i, she can only go to i+1, i+2, etc., wrapping around after n to 1 again? Or wait, no. Wait, if the ring is 1-2-3-...-n, and you can only move in the clockwise direction, then from i, you can only move to i+1, unless i is n, then next is 1. So movement is in a fixed direction, and she can't go back.\n\nWait, but that would mean that once she leaves a house, she can't come back. So for example, if she's at house 4 and needs to go to house 2, she can't do that directly because the traffic is only clockwise. So she must go 4→5→…→n→1→2, which might take a long time.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. So the movement is constrained by the direction—she can't move counter-clockwise. So any movement from a lower-numbered house to a higher-numbered one is possible only in the forward direction, but moving from a higher to a lower requires going all the way around.\n\nSo, how do we model the minimal path between two points on this ring?\n\nWell, for two points a and b, the minimal distance between them is the minimum of (b - a) mod n and (a - b) mod n. Wait, no. Because in the ring, moving clockwise from a to b could be (b - a) steps if b > a. But if a is larger than b, then moving clockwise would require going past n, so the distance is (n - a + b) steps. Alternatively, moving counter-clockwise from a to b would be (a - b) steps if a > b. So for a and b, the minimal steps are min( (b - a) % n, (a - b) % n ). But wait, since the direction is fixed, she can't choose the counter-clockwise direction. Oh, right! Because she can only move in the clockwise direction. So for any movement, she must go the longer way if necessary.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ring is such that the houses are arranged in a circle, and the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So she can't move counter-clockwise. So from any house i, she can only move to i+1, then i+2, etc.\n\nSo, for example, if she's at house 3 and needs to get to house 1, she has to go 3→4→5→...→n→1. That's (n - 3 + 1) steps. Because moving from 3 to 1 via the clockwise direction is (1 + n -3) steps, which is n-2 steps.\n\nWait, let's take n=4. So 3 →4 →1. That's 2 steps, which is 4-3 +1 = 2 steps. Wait, 3→4 is step 1, 4→1 is step 2. So yes, (n -3 +1) is 2 steps.\n\nSo, for any two houses a and b, the minimal number of steps when moving only clockwise is the distance when moving from a to b in the clockwise direction, which is (b - a) % n. Because, for a=3, b=1, (1-3) mod 4 is 2, which matches the steps needed.\n\nSo, the distance from a to b in clockwise is (b - a) if b >=a, else (b +n -a).\n\nWait, (b -a) mod n gives the correct value. For example, if a=3, b=1, (1-3)= -2 mod 4 is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the distance is (b -a) % n.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that she can't choose to move counter-clockwise. So, for any movement, the steps required are (b -a) mod n.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal time to go through all the a_i in order, starting from 1, moving clockwise, with each movement being from the previous position to a_i, but considering that she must process the tasks in order.\n\nWait, but each task i must be processed in the order 1,2,...m. So, for each task i, she must go from her current position to a_i, and then from there proceed to the next task.\n\nSo, the initial position is 1. For i=1, she goes to a_1. Then for i=2, she goes from a_1 to a_2, and so on until i=m.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"for the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" So, she must be present at a_i for task i, and all previous tasks j <i must have been done. So, the order of processing is sequential: task 1, then task 2, etc.\n\nThus, the movement sequence is:\n\nstart at 1.\n\nmove to a_1: time += distance from 1 to a_1.\n\nthen move to a_2: time += distance from a_1 to a_2.\n\nand so on, until a_m.\n\nSo, the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive points in the sequence 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_m.\n\nWait, but wait. Because the sequence could have multiple same a_i's. For example, in the sample input 4 3 3 2 3, the a's are [3,2,3]. So, the movement is 1 →3 (distance 2), then 3→2 (but wait, that's moving counter-clockwise, which isn't allowed. So, she can't go from 3 to 2 directly. So, she has to go 3→4→1→2. Which is 3 steps. Then, from 2 to 3 is 1 step.\n\nSo, the total time is 2 + 3 + 1 = 6, which matches the sample.\n\nWait, but according to the approach I thought earlier, the distance from 3 to 2 is (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod4 = 3 steps. So, adding that would give 2+3+1=6.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the way to compute the total time is to compute the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair in the sequence 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_m.\n\nEach distance is (next_a - current_a) mod n. But wait, no. Because, for example, if current is 3 and next is 2, the mod is (2-3) mod4= 3, which is correct as it's the number of steps she has to take to go from 3 to 2 in the clockwise direction.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the initial position as 1.\n\n2. For each task i from 1 to m:\n\n   a. Compute the next position as a_i.\n\n   b. Compute the distance from current to next as (next - current) mod n.\n\n   c. Add this distance to the total time.\n\n   d. Update current to next.\n\nSo, the total time is the sum of these distances.\n\nWait, but let's test this logic against the sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 4 3, a = [3,2,3].\n\nProcess:\n\ncurrent =1\n\ni=1: next is3. distance is (3-1) mod4=2. time=2.\n\ncurrent becomes3.\n\ni=2: next is2. distance is (2-3) mod4= 3. time=5.\n\ncurrent is2.\n\ni=3: next is3. distance is (3-2) mod4=1. time=6.\n\nTotal time is6. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is 4 3, a=[2,3,3].\n\nSequence is 1→2 (distance1), 2→3 (distance1), 3→3 (0). Total is2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm is straightforward: iterate through each a_i, compute the distance from the current position to a_i, add to the total, and update current.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list of a's.\n\n- Initialize current position as 1.\n\n- Initialize total_time as 0.\n\n- For each a in a_list:\n\n   distance = (a - current) mod n.\n\n   total_time += distance.\n\n   current = a.\n\n- Output total_time.\n\nWait, but what about the case where a_i is same as current. Then, distance is zero, which is correct.\n\nWhat about when the a_i is behind current in the ring? Like, current is 3, a_i is 2. Then, (2-3) mod4=3. So, she must go from 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, this approach should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, the steps are:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nInitialize current =1.\n\ntotal_time=0.\n\nFor each a in the list:\n\n   distance = (a - current) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current = a\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nYes, that's simple.\n\nWait, but wait. What about when a is less than current? Let's see.\n\nLike, current is 4, a is 2, n=4.\n\ndistance is (2-4) mod4= (-2) mod4= 2. So, she has to go 4→1→2, which is 2 steps. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code will handle all cases.\n\nTesting another example.\n\nSuppose n=5, m=2.\n\na = [5,1]\n\nSo, sequence is 1 →5 (distance4), then 5→1 (distance (1-5) mod5= (-4) mod5=1). So total time 5.\n\nBut wait, moving from 5 to 1 is 1 step (since 5 →1 is next in the ring). So, yes, 4+1=5.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=5, a = [3,4,5,1,2]\n\nCompute the distances:\n\nStart at1.\n\n1→3: (3-1)=2.\n\n3→4:1.\n\n4→5:1.\n\n5→1:1.\n\n1→2:1.\n\nTotal is 2+1+1+1+1=6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle it.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nWhat about n=2, m=1, a=[2].\n\nDistance is (2-1) mod2=1. So time is1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: all a_i are 1. So, distance from 1 to 1 is 0 for each step. Total time is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she can only move in a clockwise direction along a ring of houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and can only move clockwise. This means from any house `i`, she can only move to house `i+1`, and if she reaches the end of the ring (house `n`), she continues to house 1.\n2. **Task Completion Order**: Xenia must complete each task in the order they are given. For each task `i`, she needs to be at house `a_i` and must have already completed all previous tasks.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses `current` and `next` when moving clockwise is calculated as `(next - current) % n`. This formula ensures that the distance is correctly computed even when wrapping around the ring.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Starting from house 1.\n2. Iterating through each target house in the given order.\n3. Calculating the distance from the current house to the next target house.\n4. Summing up these distances to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n    distance = (a - current) % n\n    total_time += distance\n    current = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of target houses for each task.\n2. **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n3. **Iterating Through Tasks**: For each target house in the list:\n   - Compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the target house.\n   - Add this distance to the total time.\n   - Update the current house to the target house.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the ring structure and ensure correct distance calculations.",
