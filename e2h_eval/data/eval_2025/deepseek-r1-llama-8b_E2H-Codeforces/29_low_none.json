            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Substitutes in Number\n\nAndrew and Eugene are playing a game. Initially, Andrew has string s, consisting of digits. Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a string of digits through several substitution queries and then computing the result modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo, Andrew has a string s. Eugene sends queries like \"di->ti\", which means replace every occurrence of digit di in s with the substring ti. For example, if s is '123123', a query '2->00' changes it to '10031003'. Another query '3->' replaces all 3s with nothing, turning it into '1212'.\n\nAfter all queries, we need to compute the number represented by s, ignoring leading zeros, modulo 1e9+7. If s is empty, it's zero.\n\nWait, but the note says that leading zeroes are not removed, like in the third sample where after substitution, leading zeros might be present. So, for example, when you have something like '0007', it's treated as 7? Or wait, no: the note says that leading zeroes are ignored when representing the number, but the string can have them. So the output is the number, but the string s is processed as is, including leading zeros, except when considering the numeric value.\n\nWait, the note says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeros; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\nSo, for example, if after substitution, s becomes \"0007\", the numeric value is 7, but the string itself is \"0007\". But for the purpose of the modulo calculation, it's treated as 7, right?\n\nBut wait, how do I handle leading zeros when computing the number? Because when the string is, say, \"0007\", the numeric value is 7. So, when converting the string to a number, leading zeros are stripped.\n\nHmm, but for processing substitutions, the string's actual digits matter. So the substitutions affect the string, including any leading zeros that may appear.\n\nSo, my approach is to model the substitutions and track the effect on each digit in the original string, applying the queries in order.\n\nBut since the queries can be applied in any order, but each one is replacing a specific digit, perhaps we can model this using a substitution map that keeps track of what each digit is replaced with at each step.\n\nWait, but the queries are applied sequentially. So, for each query, every occurrence of di in the current string is replaced with ti. So, the order of applying the queries is important.\n\nBut directly applying each query to the string step by step might be computationally feasible because the maximum size of the string is 105, and the number of queries is up to 105. So even with 105 steps, each potentially expanding the string, the total operations are manageable.\n\nWait, but for each substitution, each character in the string could be replaced by multiple characters. So the string's length can grow exponentially. Oh, but the constraints say that the sum of the lengths of ti across all queries is 105. So each substitution adds a certain number of characters, but the total added is manageable.\n\nWait, the initial string is up to 105 characters, and each substitution can add up to, say, 10^5 or more? Wait no, the sum of ti lengths is 105, so the maximum possible string length after all substitutions is 105 + 105 = 210. So it's manageable.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to process each query in order, modifying the string as per each substitution.\n\nBut wait, the substitution is not just a single replacement but can change multiple digits at once. However, the order matters. So for example, if a query comes first that replaces 'a' with 'b', and then another that replaces 'b' with 'c', the first substitution must be done before the second.\n\nBut processing each query in the given order, and for each, replacing all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n\n- For each query in order:\n\n   - di is a single character (the digit to replace)\n\n   - ti is the replacement string.\n\n   - Replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n\n- After processing all queries, convert the resulting string to a number, stripping leading zeros, and compute mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the substitution can be applied multiple times. For example, if a query replaces '2' with '22', and another replaces '2' again with '222', the order in which they are processed matters. So the first substitution will create more '2's which are subject to the next substitution.\n\nSo, processing each query in sequence is necessary.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model the string efficiently after each substitution. Since each substitution can expand the string, but the total length is manageable,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a string through a series of substitution queries and then compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). The substitutions can potentially modify each digit in the string, and the order of these substitutions is crucial.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given initial string `s`.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given replacement string.\n3. **Handle Modulo Operation**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string to a number, ignoring leading zeros, and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor q in queries:\n    di, ti = q.split('->')\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\n# Now compute the number mod MOD\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    num_str = s.lstrip('0')\n    if not num_str:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(num_str)\n        print(num % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial String Processing**: The initial string `s` is read and processed through each query.\n- **Query Execution**: Each query specifies a digit to replace and a string to substitute it with. The replacements are done in the order they are received.\n- **Modulo Calculation**: After all substitutions, the resulting string is converted into a numeric value. Leading zeros are stripped, and the result is taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is applied correctly and efficiently, handling the constraints provided by the problem.",
