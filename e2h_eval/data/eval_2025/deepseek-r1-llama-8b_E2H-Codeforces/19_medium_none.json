    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a nation called Panel which has districts connected in such a way that there's exactly one path between any two districts. So the districts form a tree structure. Each district has a contestant whose fan count is 2^i, where i is the district number. The president wants to remove k contestants, and after removal, all remaining districts must form a connected subtree. Also, he wants to maximize the sum of their fans. We need to find which k districts to remove.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to select as many high-fan districts as possible, ensuring that after removing the others, the selected ones are still connected. Since each district has a fan count of 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute much more. So our strategy should aim to include as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nWait, but since the districts form a tree, if we remove certain nodes, the remaining must form a connected subtree. So the approach might be to find the largest possible subtree (in terms of sum of 2^i) by removing the least number of nodes possible, and then see which nodes to remove to fit into k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as finding a subtree where the sum of 2^i for its nodes is maximum, and the size is n - k. Wait, because when you remove k nodes, you're left with n -k nodes, which must form a connected subtree. So the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree of size m = n -k, such that the sum of 2^i for its nodes is as large as possible.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the problem becomes: find a connected subtree of size m = n -k, with the maximum possible sum of 2^i, and then return the nodes not in this subtree as the ones to remove.\n\nSo the key is to find the optimal subtree of size m.\n\nHow do we compute this? Well, for trees, often dynamic programming approaches are used. For example, for each node, we can compute the maximum sum we can get in subtrees rooted at that node, considering whether or not we include the node itself.\n\nBut wait, since the sum is 2^i, which is exponential, the contribution of higher nodes is much larger. So perhaps the optimal subtree is one that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and as few low-numbered nodes as needed to keep the subtree connected.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by selecting the m largest 2^i values in the tree, but ensuring they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, that's not necessarily true. Because the tree structure might require some lower-numbered nodes to connect the higher ones. For example, if the higher nodes are arranged in such a way that without including a lower node, they can't form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the tree. Since each node contributes 2^i, the higher the node, the better. So we want as many high-numbered nodes as possible in the subtree.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Determine which nodes to include in the subtree, aiming to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but ensuring the subtree is connected.\n\n2. Once the subtree is identified, the nodes not included are the ones to remove.\n\nSo how to model the selection of the subtree.\n\nWait, the subtree must form a connected component. So, perhaps the minimal set of nodes needed to connect the highest m nodes is what we need.\n\nBut how do we find that?\n\nAnother approach: the subtree should include all the nodes from some range [a, b], where a <= b, and all these nodes form a connected subtree. But in a tree, consecutive numbers are connected only if the parent of a is a-1, etc. So perhaps the optimal subtree is a contiguous sequence of nodes, but that's not necessarily always the case.\n\nWait, no. Because the tree could have a structure where a higher node is connected through a lower node that's not adjacent. So perhaps the subtree can be a chain of nodes that are connected via their paths.\n\nBut given that 2^i is exponentially increasing, it's better to include as many higher-numbered nodes as possible, even if it requires including a few lower ones to keep them connected.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal subtree will consist of a path that starts somewhere and ends at a higher node, including as many high nodes as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to model this as a problem where we need to find a subtree of size m, and within that subtree, the sum of 2^i is maximized.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be approached with a greedy algorithm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a star-shaped subtree where the highest node is the center, and it connects to the next highest nodes directly or via a single intermediate node.\n\nWait, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3\n\nThe roads are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 3, 4, 6.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\n1\n|\n2\n/ | \\\n3 4 6\n   |\n   5\n\nIn the sample, n=6, k=3, so m = 6-3=3.\n\nThe optimal subtree is 2, 6, 5. Their 2^i are 4, 64, 32. Sum is 100.\n\nSo the sum is 4+64+32 = 100.\n\nWait, but 2 is included, which is not the highest node. Hmm, but why not include 6,5, and maybe others?\n\nWait, in this case, the subtree needs to have exactly 3 nodes. So including 2,6,5 gives a connected subtree. Alternatively, including 6,5, and another node (like 3), but that would sum 64 +32 +8=104, which is less than 100. So the initial selection is better.\n\nWait, but 6 is higher than 2. So why is 2 included?\n\nBecause 6 can't form a connected subtree with 5 alone; 6 and 5 are connected, but adding 2 allows 6 to connect to the rest.\n\nWait, but 2 is connected to 6, so if the subtree includes 2,6,5, it's connected. So that's three nodes.\n\nIf we tried to include 6,5, and 4, that's also three nodes, but 4 is lower than 2, so 2^4 is 16, which is worse than 2's 4. So 4's inclusion would reduce the total.\n\nSo the optimal subtree is 2,6,5, which gives a sum of 4+64+32=100.\n\nSo the solution is to remove the other nodes (1,3,4). So the output is 1 3 4.\n\nSo the key is to include the highest possible nodes, but sometimes including a slightly lower node that allows connecting more higher nodes is better.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nIdea: The optimal subtree is a subtree that includes a path from some node up to a higher node, including as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and possibly including some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which path to take.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe need to select a connected subtree S of size m = n -k. We want the sum of 2^i for i in S to be as large as possible.\n\nEach node contributes exponentially more as its number is higher. So the optimal S should contain as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but connected in a way that forms a subtree.\n\nBut the tree structure may require including some lower nodes to connect the high ones.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal S is the subtree formed by a path that starts at some node and goes up to a high node, including all possible high nodes along the way.\n\nWait, but how to find that path.\n\nAnother thought: the subtree S must form a connected component. So the minimal number of edges to remove is (size of S) - 1. But in this problem, we are allowed to remove k nodes, but the resulting S must be connected. So the nodes in S must form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding a subtree of size m, where the sum of 2^i is as large as possible, and then the nodes not in S are the ones to remove.\n\nThe challenge is to find such a subtree.\n\nNow, considering the constraints (n up to 1e6), we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nAn efficient approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree.\n\nEach node has a parent except the root (assuming a rooted tree). So, perhaps for each node, we can compute the best possible subtree that can be formed by including this node and extending upwards.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nAnother idea: the subtree S must be a connected component. So, for each node u, the subtree can be built by choosing a root, and including all descendants down to certain levels, but that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain that starts at some node and extends upward, including as many high nodes as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path from some node u to v, where v is the highest node in the tree, and u is as low as possible.\n\nBut again, how to find u and v.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree consists of all the nodes in the tree except for the leaves beyond a certain point. Or maybe it's a chain that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a problem where we need to find a subtree of size m that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, regardless of their position, as long as the subtree is connected.\n\nBut how to efficiently find such a subtree.\n\nAnother angle: Since 2^i is exponentially increasing, the optimal subtree S will consist of the m largest possible 2^i values, but arranged in a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the sample, the m=3 largest nodes are 6 (64),5 (32), and 4 (16). Including 6,5, and 4 gives a sum of 112, which is higher than the sample's 100. But in that case, the subtree would be 4,6,5, which is connected. So why isn't this the optimal choice?\n\nWait, because 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6. So 4,6,5 is connected. So including 4,6,5 would give a sum of 16+64+32= 112, which is higher than 100. But in the sample, the output is 2,6,5. So why is that?\n\nAh, because in the sample, the m is 3, and including 4,6,5 is 3 nodes. So that's a valid choice. But why doesn't the sample choose that?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample analysis.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is 1 3 4 being removed. So the remaining nodes are 2,6,5. So the sum is 4+64+32=100.\n\nBut if the remaining nodes were 4,6,5, sum is 16+64+32= 112, which is better. So why isn't that chosen?\n\nAh, perhaps because the tree structure doesn't allow it. Wait, let's see the tree structure:\n\nThe tree is rooted at 1.\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 3,4,6.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5.\n\nSo 4,6,5 are all connected through 2 and 6. So 4,6,5 form a connected subtree of size 3.\n\nSo why isn't this the chosen subtree?\n\nBecause including 4 adds 16 to the sum, but in the sample, the sum is 100, but in this case, it would be 112. So why is the sample output different?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample explanation.\n\nWait the sample says that the maximum sum is 100. But according to this, including 4,6,5 gives a higher sum.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misread the sample. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the output is 1 3 4. So the remaining nodes are 2,6,5, which sum to 4+64+32=100.\n\nBut if 4 is included instead of 2, the sum would be 16+64+32=112. So why isn't that better?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree is different. Let me re-examine the input lines.\n\nInput for the first sample:\n\n6 3\n\nThen 5 lines:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo the tree is:\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 3,4,6.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo yes, 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, connected to 5.\n\nSo 4,6,5 are connected and form a subtree of 3 nodes.\n\nSo why isn't that the chosen subtree?\n\nBecause perhaps the sum is higher when including 4,6,5. So the sample's output seems wrong according to this.\n\nBut that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample says that the maximum sum is 100, achieved by removing 1,3,4. So the sum is 4+64+32=100.\n\nBut including 4,6,5 gives 16+64+32=112, which is higher.\n\nSo perhaps the sample is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the subtree size is not 3, but 3 nodes, but perhaps the way the tree is structured, including 4,6,5 is not possible because the subtree is not connected.\n\nWait, 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So 4,6,5 are connected via 2 and 6.\n\nSo that's a connected subtree.\n\nSo why is the sample's sum 100 instead of 112?\n\nHmm, perhaps the sample's note is wrong, but I think perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree is being considered in a different way, such as the root being 2 instead of 1.\n\nWait, no, the tree is undirected. So the root choice shouldn't affect the connectivity.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is correct because including 4,6,5 is not a valid option because the subtree is not connected. But that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the sum. Let's see:\n\nIf the removed nodes are 1,3,4, the remaining are 2,5,6.\n\nSum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100.\n\nIf we include 4,6,5, the sum is 16+64+32=112, which is better.\n\nSo why is the sample not choosing that?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the sample is wrong, but that's unlikely. So perhaps my understanding is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtree cannot include 4,6,5 because when you remove the other nodes, the subtree must form a connected component.\n\nWait, no, 4,6,5 is connected through 2 and 6. So if we remove 1 and 3, but not 2, then 4 is part of the remaining nodes, connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So 4,6,5 are in the subtree.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the sample. Let's move forward.\n\nAssuming that the problem is correctly stated, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but perhaps the minimal subtree that connects them.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the subtree of size m that contains the largest possible sum of 2^i, and then output the nodes not in that subtree.\n\nThe question is, how to find this subtree.\n\nAn alternative idea: The optimal subtree will include all the highest m nodes, but arranged in a way that they form a connected subtree. But this may not always be possible because the tree structure might not allow it.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find a subtree that includes as many of the highest m nodes as possible, and the minimal required lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo, to model this, perhaps we can perform a greedy approach:\n\n1. Identify the m nodes with the highest 2^i values (i.e., the m largest node numbers).\n\n2. Then, find the minimal number of additional nodes needed to connect them into a connected subtree.\n\n3. If the number of required additional nodes is <= (total nodes - m), then proceed. Else, adjust.\n\nBut how to find the minimal number of nodes required to connect these m nodes.\n\nWait, the minimal number of nodes to connect m nodes is (m-1), because a connected tree on m nodes requires m-1 edges, which correspond to m-1 nodes (since each edge connects two nodes).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. For example, in a linear chain, the number of edges is m-1, but the number of nodes is m. So in this case, the number of required nodes is m, but they are already included.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of nodes to form a connected subtree of size m is m, as any connected subtree of m nodes requires exactly m-1 edges, which implies that the subtree is a tree with m nodes, so the number of nodes is m.\n\nSo, in order to form a connected subtree of m nodes, we don't need to add any other nodes beyond those m, provided they form a connected tree.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting m nodes in the tree such that:\n\n- They form a connected subtree.\n\n- The sum of 2^i is maximized.\n\nThus, the task is to find such a subset.\n\nSo, the key is to find a connected subtree of m nodes with maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nSince 2^i grows exponentially, the optimal subset will include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, with the minimal number of lower nodes required to connect them.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the longest possible path in the tree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and then include all nodes along that path.\n\nBut how to find this path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree that contains the m largest 2^i values, but arranged in a way that forms a connected tree.\n\nWait, but the sum is 2^i, so higher numbers are better. So the optimal subtree must include the m largest nodes possible, provided they can form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Collect the m largest nodes (those with the highest i) in the tree.\n\n2. Check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, that's our answer.\n\n3. If not, find the minimal set of lower nodes needed to connect them into a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother approach: since the tree is connected, the subtree is determined by the nodes included. For the sum to be maximum, we need to include as many high i as possible.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes in a certain range [a, b], where a and b are chosen to maximize the sum.\n\nBut in a tree, ranges can be arbitrary. So perhaps the optimal subtree is a path from some node u to v, where u and v are as high as possible, and the path includes as many high nodes as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the path that starts at some node and goes up to the highest possible node, including as many high nodes as possible.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n- Find the node with the highest number, say x.\n\n- Then, find the node y, which is the highest-numbered node in the subtree rooted at x, such that including y and as many higher nodes as possible.\n\nWait, but this is vague.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to perform a post-order traversal, and for each node, keep track of the maximum sum possible for a subtree of a certain size.\n\nWait, for each node u, let's define dp[u][s] as the maximum sum achievable for a subtree rooted at u with size s.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, this approach is not feasible due to memory and time constraints.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the sum is 2^i, which is exponential, the optimal subtree must include as many high i as possible, and the minimal number of lower i to make the subtree connected.\n\nThus, the approach could be to find the largest possible subtree that includes the m highest i, plus as few lower i as needed to connect them.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Identify the m highest i.\n\n- Check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, then we're done.\n\n- If not, find the minimal number of nodes to add to connect them.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the m highest i's are all in a subtree that is connected via their common ancestor.\n\nFor example, if the m highest nodes are all descendants of a certain node, then their subtree is connected.\n\nSo, in that case, including all of them is acceptable.\n\nBut if the m highest nodes are spread across the tree, then we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal number of nodes to add is equal to the number of components minus 1.\n\nWait, but for m nodes, if they are in multiple disconnected components, we need to add enough nodes to connect them.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe optimal subtree will consist of a path that starts from some node and goes up to the highest possible node, including as many high i as possible.\n\nBut how to find this path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain where the nodes are as high as possible, and the path is as long as possible.\n\nBut I'm not making progress on the algorithm.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nGiven that 2^i is exponentially increasing, the optimal subtree will consist of the m largest possible 2^i, and the minimal number of lower nodes to connect them.\n\nThus, the steps could be:\n\n1. Select the m largest nodes, sorted in descending order of i.\n\n2. Check if these nodes form a connected subtree. If yes, that's the answer.\n\n3. If not, find the minimal set of nodes to add to connect them.\n\nBut how to check if they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the m largest nodes are all in the same connected component when considering the tree.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe problem can be transformed into finding a subtree S of size m, which has the maximum sum of 2^i for its nodes. Then, the nodes not in S are the ones to remove.\n\nSo, the task is to find S.\n\nGiven that 2^i is exponential, the sum is maximized when S contains the m largest i's.\n\nThus, the approach is to find the largest m i's, and arrange them into a connected subtree.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\na. Select the m nodes with the highest i.\n\nb. Find the minimal set of nodes to connect them into a connected subtree.\n\nc. Ensure that the total nodes in the subtree is exactly m.\n\nWait, but the m nodes are already selected, and the minimal set of nodes is zero, because the subtree is formed by these m nodes.\n\nWait, no, because the subtree may not be connected. So we need to find the minimal number of nodes to add to make it connected.\n\nWait, but adding a node would increase the size of the subtree beyond m, which is not allowed. So, perhaps the initial m nodes must form a connected subtree. But this is not always possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is to find the largest m-node connected subtree, with the highest sum of 2^i.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree of size m, which has the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to finding a connected induced subtree with size m that has the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nNow, considering that the tree is a general tree, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that starts at some node and goes up to the highest possible node, including as many high i as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can model the problem by performing a BFS starting from the highest node and moving downwards, trying to collect as many high nodes as possible, while keeping the subtree connected.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of i.\n\n2. Try to include as many as possible in a connected subtree.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, let's try to model the process.\n\nWe start with the highest node, say x.\n\nWe include x. Then, we look for the next highest node that is in the same connected component as x, but not yet included.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient, as higher nodes may be connected via lower nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the process as building a tree that includes the highest possible nodes, and whenever we need to add a new node, we add the highest possible node that is connected to the current tree.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe sum is maximized when the subtree includes as many high i as possible. So, the optimal subtree is the one that contains the m highest i's, and is connected. If the m highest i's are not connected, then the subtree must include some lower i's to connect them.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes in a certain path from the highest node down to some lower node, such that the path includes as many high i's as possible.\n\nWait, but in a tree, a path from the highest node to a lower node would include all the nodes along that path.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that starts at the highest node and goes down to some lower node, including as many high i's as possible.\n\nThus, the approach could be:\n\n1. Find the highest node x.\n\n2. Then, find the next highest node that is a child of x, and include it.\n\n3. Continue this until we have included m nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can represent the tree as a collection of chains, where each chain is a path from a leaf to the root.\n\nEach chain has a certain length. For example, the chain for node x is the path from x up to the root.\n\nThe problem is to find a chain where the sum of 2^i is maximized, and the chain has a certain length.\n\nWait, but this is similar to the problem of finding the path in a tree with maximum sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by selecting a path that starts at some node and extends upwards as far as possible, including as many high i's as possible.\n\nThus, for each node, we can calculate the maximum sum achievable by selecting a subtree that starts at that node and extends downwards.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a straight path from the highest node down to some lower node, such that the number of nodes in the path is m.\n\nBut how to find such a path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain that starts at the highest node and includes the next highest nodes along the path.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nPerhaps, for each node, we can compute the maximum possible sum of a subtree that can be formed by including this node and as many of its children as possible, forming a connected subtree.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the subtree must form a connected component, and thus, any subtree is a connected subgraph.\n\nTherefore, the sum of 2^i for the nodes in the subtree is the sum of 2^i for the nodes in S.\n\nTo maximize this sum, S must include as many high i's as possible.\n\nThus, the optimal S is the set of m nodes with the highest i's, provided they form a connected subtree. If they don't, then we need to include some lower i's to connect them.\n\nThus, the problem can be broken down into:\n\n1. Select the m nodes with the highest i's.\n\n2. Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n   a. If yes, then S is this set.\n\n   b. If no, then find the minimal number of additional nodes needed to connect them.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, but including additional nodes would exceed the size m. So this approach is not applicable.\n\nThus, perhaps the m nodes must form a connected subtree. Otherwise, the problem is to find the largest subset of m nodes that is connected and has the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nThis brings us back to the original problem.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe problem can be modeled as finding a connected subtree with exactly m nodes, and the sum of 2^i is as large as possible.\n\nThus, the key is to find the connected subtree with m nodes that has the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the approach is to find such a subtree.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nGiven that n is up to 1e6, we need an O(n) approach.\n\nAn alternative Idea inspired by the fact that 2^i is exponentially increasing: the optimal subtree will consist of a path that starts at the highest possible node and goes down to some lower node, including as many high i's as possible.\n\nThus, the approach is to find the path that includes the highest m nodes.\n\nBut how to find this path.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path from a node to its parent, grandparent, etc., up to a certain depth, including as many high i's as possible.\n\nThus, the approach could be:\n\n- For each node, determine the path from that node upwards, collecting the highest i's.\n\n- Among all possible paths of length m, select the one with the maximum sum.\n\nBut this is O(n) time, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe optimal subtree is a path that starts at a node and goes upwards, including the node, its parent, grandparent, etc., such that the number of nodes in the path is m.\n\nThus, for each node, we can compute the maximum sum of a path starting at that node and going upwards, including the next m-1 highest nodes.\n\nBut again, the issue is how to find this.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by the Sample:\n\nIn the sample, the optimal subtree is 2,6,5, which is a connected subtree. The nodes 6 and 5 are higher than 2, but including 2 allows them to be connected.\n\nSo, the sum is 4+64+32=100.\n\nBut why not include 6,5, and 4, which are 3 nodes and sum 16+64+32=112.\n\nAh, because 4 is connected to 2, which is not in the subtree. So 4,6,5 is a connected subtree of 3 nodes.\n\nWait, no. Because 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So 4,6,5 are connected via 2 and 6.\n\nThus, 4,6,5 form a connected subtree.\n\nBut why isn't the sum 112 the maximum.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the sample is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtree can't include 4,6,5 because the president is to remove k=3 contestants, leaving m=3 nodes. But including 4,6,5 would require that the other nodes (1,2,3) are removed.\n\nWait, no. The nodes to be removed are the ones not in S.\n\nIn the sample, the output is to remove 1,3,4. So the remaining nodes are 2,6,5, sum 100.\n\nBut if the subtree is 4,6,5, then the nodes removed would be 1,2,3.\n\nWhich leaves 4,6,5, sum 112.\n\nWhich is higher than 100.\n\nThus, the sample's output seems to contradict this.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the nodes are arranged in such a way that 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So 4 is not directly connected to 6. Thus, the subtree 4,6,5 is not connected unless 2 is included.\n\nWait, no. Because 4 is connected to 2, and 6 is connected to 2. So 4 and 6 are connected via 2.\n\nThus, 4,6,5 form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the sum is 16+64+32=112.\n\nThus, the sample's output is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the sample is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the subtree is 4,6,5, but the path is 4-2-6-5. So the subtree includes 4,2,6,5, which is four nodes. That's more than m=3.\n\nNo, because m is 3.\n\nThus, including 4,6,5 is 3 nodes, and it's a connected subtree.\n\nThus, why is the sample's sum 100.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the sample is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement was misunderstood.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the president removes k contestants, leaving n-k participants.\n\nEach participant is from a district that is reachable from all others.\n\nThus, the remaining districts form a connected component.\n\nSo, in the sample, after removing 1,3,4, the remaining are 2,6,5. These form a connected component.\n\nIf the president chooses to remove 1,2,3, the remaining are 4,6,5, which is a connected component.\n\nThus, both options are valid.\n\nBut why does the sample choose the sum of 100 over 112.\n\nAh, perhaps because the problem statement requires that the president chooses to remove k contestants, but the selection of which ones depends on the sum of the remaining.\n\nSo, the president wants to maximize the sum of the remaining.\n\nThus, in the sample, the maximum sum is 112, achieved by removing 1,2,3.\n\nBut the sample's output is removing 1,3,4, which leaves 2,6,5, sum 100.\n\nThus, the sample is wrong.\n\nBut that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample's note is correct, but I'm misinterpreting the tree structure.\n\nPerhaps the tree is built differently.\n\nLooking back at the sample input:\n\nIt's written as:\n\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3']\n\nSo the roads are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nThus, the tree is:\n\n1 connected to 2.\n\n2 connected to 3,4,6.\n\n6 connected to 5.\n\nSo, in this case, 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5.\n\nThus, 4,6,5 are connected via 2 and 6.\n\nSo, including 4,6,5 as a subtree is possible.\n\nThus, the sample's note is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the sample is correct because the sum is 100, not 112.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that 4 is not included in the subtree.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the sum is 100, which includes 2,6,5.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem is to find the maximum sum possible, which is 100, but why.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the initial assumption that 4,6,5 is a valid subtree is incorrect.\n\nBut that's not the case.\n\nThus, perhaps the sample's note is incorrect, but the code should follow the problem statement.\n\nWell, regardless of that, let's proceed.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a connected subtree of size m, with maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nThus, the approach is to find the largest possible sum for a connected subtree of size m.\n\nNow, the question is, how to find this.\n\nAn efficient way is needed.\n\nAn Idea Inspired by the fact that the optimal subtree is a chain:\n\nWe can precompute for each node the maximum sum of a subtree that includes the node and some of its children, forming a chain.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe maximum sum connected subtree of size m is a path that starts at some node and goes upwards, including as many high i's as possible.\n\nThus, the approach is to find the path with the maximum sum of m nodes, connected in a line.\n\nThus, for each node, we can compute the maximum sum for a path starting at that node and extending upwards, collecting the next highest nodes.\n\nBut how.\n\nAn alternative Idea: Since 2^i is exponentially increasing, the optimal subtree is a chain where the nodes are ordered in decreasing order of i.\n\nThus, the subtree is a path that includes the highest m nodes possible, arranged in a straight line.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\n1. For each node, determine the path upwards that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\n2. Among all possible paths of size m, select the one with the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother Idea inspired by the fact that the subtree must be connected and have size m:\n\nThe subtree must include a certain node and its children in a way that the total number of nodes is m.\n\nBut again, not helpful.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that includes the m highest nodes, and ensure that they form a connected subtree. If not, find the minimal number of nodes to add to connect them.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is a star",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree with the maximum possible sum of fans. Each district's fan count is given by \\(2^i\\), where \\(i\\) is the district number.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more to the total fan count. Therefore, we aim to include as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring the remaining districts form a connected subtree.\n\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fan Sum**: We need to find a connected subtree of size \\(m = n - k\\) that maximizes the sum of \\(2^i\\) for its nodes.\n3. **Greedy Strategy**: To maximize the sum, we should include the highest possible districts.
