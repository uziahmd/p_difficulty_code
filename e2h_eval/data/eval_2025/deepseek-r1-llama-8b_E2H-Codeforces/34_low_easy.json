And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Hmm.\n\nSo, the input gives me n and k, where n is the number of days and k is the number of consecutive days considered a week. Then there's a sequence of n integers representing the sleep times for each day.\n\nMy goal is to calculate the average of all these possible week averages. Oh right, because each window of k days forms a week, and I need to find the average of all those weeks' total sleep times divided by k.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, the number of weeks is n - k + 1. For each week starting at day i (from 0 to n-k), I need to sum the k elements a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i+k-1], then divide by k to get the average for that week. Then, sum all these averages and divide by the number of weeks.\n\nBut wait, if I do this naively, for each window, sum the k elements and add to a total sum, then at the end compute the average. That would be O(nk) time, which could be acceptable since n is up to 2e5. But 2e5 squared is 4e10 operations, which is way too much. So this approach isn't efficient enough.\n\nI need a more efficient way to calculate the sum for all windows. Oh right, sliding window technique with prefix sums.\n\nYes, the idea is to precompute the prefix sums of the array. Then, for any window from i to j, the sum is prefix[j] - prefix[i]. So, applying this to our problem.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array of the sleep times.\n2. Iterate through each possible window (each start index i from 0 to n-k):\n   a. The window ends at i + k - 1.\n   b. The sum of this window is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n3. Sum all these window sums, then divide by (number of windows * k) to get the average.\n\nWait, no. Because each window's average is sum/k, and we have m = (n - k + 1) such windows. So the total sum of all averages is (sum of all window sums) / k * (m). No, wait: each window contributes an average of (window_sum)/k. So the total is sum_over_windows( (window_sum)/k ) = (sum_of_window_sums) / k. Then, the overall average is (sum_of_window_sums) / (m * k) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nEach window has a sum S_i. The average for window i is S_i / k. We have m = (n - k + 1) windows. So the average across all windows is (S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_m) / (m * k). Wait, no. Because each average is S_i/k, so the average of all averages is equal to (sum of S_i) / (m * k). Or is it?\n\nWait, no. Because each average is S_i/k. So the average of these averages is (sum(S_i/k)) / m. Which is equal to (sum(S_i)) / (k*m).\n\nYes. So the overall average is (total_sum_of_all_window_sums) / (k * m).\n\nAlternatively, since each window is a sum of k elements, the total sum across all windows is the sum of all k-length consecutive subarrays. So perhaps I can compute that total and then divide by (k * m).\n\nHmm, but how?\n\nLet me think: Each element a_j is included in exactly (n - k + 1 - (j - i))... Wait, maybe it's better to model how many times each a_j appears in all the windows.\n\nFor example, for a_j, how many windows include a_j? It's equal to the number of windows that start before or at j and end after or at j, considering the window size is k.\n\nThe first window that includes a_j starts at max(0, j - k + 1). Wait, maybe not. Let's see: a_j is at position j (0-based). The earliest a window can start such that it includes a_j is when the window starts at j - k + 1, but that can't be less than 0. So the earliest start is s_min = max(0, j - (k - 1)). The latest start is s_max = min(j, n - k). Wait, no, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, the window must contain a_j. So the start index s must satisfy s <= j <= s + k",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of k days, and we need to find the average of these weekly averages.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given `n` days and `k` days per week. The goal is to calculate the average sleep time over all possible windows of `k` consecutive days. Each window's average sleep time is the sum of the window divided by `k`, and we need the average of all these values.\n\n2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Instead of calculating the sum for each window from scratch, which would be inefficient, we use a sliding window technique with prefix sums. This allows us to compute the sum of any window in constant time after an initial preprocessing step.\n\n3. **Prefix Sums**: Compute the prefix sum array of the sleep times. This helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.\n\n4. **Sliding Window Technique**: For each possible start index of a window, compute the sum of the current window using the prefix sums. Sum all these window sums and then compute the overall average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    m = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(m):\n        end = i + k\n        s = prefix[end] - prefix[i]\n        total_sum += s\n    \n    average = total_sum / (m * k)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers `n` and `k`, and the list of sleep times `a`.\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: We create a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n\n3. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: For each possible start index of a window, we compute the sum of the window using the prefix sums. This avoids recalculating the sum from scratch each time, making the solution efficient.\n\n4. **Total Sum and Average Calculation**: We accumulate the sum of all window sums and then compute the overall average by dividing this total by the number of windows multiplied by `k`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.",
