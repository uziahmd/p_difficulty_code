    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. Let me break down what's given.\n\nWe need to find the number of different arrays containing N sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_N such that:\n\n1. Each set can contain integers from 1 to K, including zero or more.\n2. There exists a way to rearrange the array into S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N where each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nAlso, two arrays are different if any index has different sets, and the same for the sets themselves.\n\nThe definition of a child: A is a child of B if for every x in A, x+1 is in B.\n\nSo, for example, if A contains 1, then B must contain 2. If A contains 2, B must contain 3, etc. But if A is empty, then it's trivially a child of B because there are no elements to check.\n\nHmm. So the key is that when we arrange the sets in order, each set is a subset that is \"child\" of the next one.\n\nWait, but the arrangement can be any permutation. So the array as a whole must be such that there's some permutation where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nI think the approach here is to model this with some kind of state transitions. Each set must have a certain structure relative to the next one.\n\nBut how? Let's think about what the chain of sets looks like when arranged properly.\n\nLet me think about the possible sequences. For each i, S'_i must be a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nWhat's the minimal condition for S'_i to be a child of S'_i+1?\n\nFor every element x in S'_i, x+1 must be present in S'_i+1.\n\nSo, for example, if S'_i contains 1, then S'_i+1 must contain 2. Similarly, if S'_i contains 2, S'_i+1 must contain 3, and so on.\n\nThis suggests that the sequence of sets must form a kind of non-decreasing chain in terms of their maximum elements. Or perhaps in terms of which numbers they include.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: For the entire array, after rearrangement, each set must be a subset of the next set in some way. Wait, no—because the child condition is about every x in S'_i being present in S'_i+1 as x+1. So, S'_i can't have elements that are not covered by the next set.\n\nBut the sets can have multiple elements, not necessarily just the max.\n\nWait, let's think about the properties of the sets in the rearranged array.\n\nSuppose that in the sequence S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_n, each S'_i is a subset (in terms of child) of S'_{i+1}.\n\nSo, S'_1 is a child of S'_2, which is a child of S'_3, and so on until S'_{n-1} is a child of S'_n.\n\nWhat does this imply about the entire sequence?\n\nIt implies that for any x in S'_1, all the way up to S'_n, the x must be present in all the sets after the one it's in.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose S'_1 has 1. Then S'_2 must have 2. Then S'_3 must have 3, etc. So, if S'_1 has 1, then S'_n must have 1, 2, 3, ..., up to some value.\n\nBut wait, S'_2 could have 2 and 3. So S'_3 must have 3 and 4. Hmm, but perhaps the key is that the presence of certain elements propagates forward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum element in the entire array determines something. Because for S'_n, since it's the last set, it doesn't have any constraints except that whatever it contains, the previous sets must have the necessary elements.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum element in the entire array must appear only in S'_n, or at least, the highest element in S'_i must be less than or equal to the next set's highest element.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model each set in the sequence as follows: For the i-th set in the rearranged array, S'_i can have elements up to a certain value, say m_i. Then, for S'_i to be a child of S'_{i+1}, every element in S'_i must be present in S'_{i+1} as x+1.\n\nSo, if S'_i contains x, then x+1 must be in S'_{i+1}. So, the maximum element of S'_i must be <= the maximum element of S'_{i+1} - 1.\n\nWait, yes. Because if S'_i has x as its maximum, then x+1 must be in S'_{i+1}, implying that the maximum of S'_{i+1} is at least x+1. So, the maximum of S'_{i+1} must be >= x+1, which is greater than x. So, the maximum of S'_i is less than or equal to the maximum of S'_{i+1} minus 1.\n\nTherefore, in the rearranged array, the maximum elements of the sets must form a non-decreasing sequence, but each step can only increase by at least 0 (since it's allowed to stay the same or increase by 1).\n\nWait, no. Because if S'_i's maximum is m, then S'_i+1's maximum must be >= m+1. Because S'_i contains m, so S'_i+1 must contain m+1. So S'_i+1's maximum is at least m+1.\n\nWait, no. Because S'_i+1 can have a maximum of m+1, but it might have higher elements as well. So, the maximum of S'_i+1 is >= m+1.\n\nThus, the maximum of the sequence is non-decreasing, but each step increases by at least 1.\n\nWait, but the maximum of S'_i can be anything, but each next S'_i+1 must have a maximum at least one higher than the current maximum.\n\nWait, no. Suppose S'_i has a maximum of m. Then S'_i+1 must contain m+1, so the maximum of S'_i+1 is at least m+1. So, the maximum of the sequence is strictly increasing.\n\nBecause S'_1's maximum is m_1, S'_2's must be at least m_1 +1, S'_3's must be at least m_2 +1 >= m_1 +2, and so on. So, the maximums form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nAh, that's a key insight. So, in the rearranged array, the maximum elements of the sets form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nThat's a crucial observation. So, the maximums are m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n.\n\nEach m_i is between 0 and K, inclusive. Wait, but wait, the sets can be empty, so for the first set S'_1, m_1 could be 0 (if it's empty), but S'_2 would then need to have 1, so m_2 >=1. Then S'_3 must have 2, so m_3 >=2, etc.\n\nSo, the maximums form a strictly increasing sequence m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, where each m_i can be 0,1,...,K.\n\nWait, but m_1 can't be larger than m_2-1, but since m_1 < m_2, and m_2 < m_3, etc., it's a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nSo, the first thing is that the maximums form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nNow, for each position i in the array, the set S'_i can have elements up to m_i.\n\nBut also, for each x in S'_i, x+1 must be present in S'_i+1.\n\nSo, for each i, S'_i can have any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i}, but subject to the condition that for each x in S'_i, x+1 is present in S'_i+1.\n\nWait, but S'_i+1 has a maximum of m_{i+1}, which is >= m_i +1.\n\nSo, for S'_i, the elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i}, but for each x in S'_i, x+1 must be present in S'_i+1.\n\nBut S'_i+1 may have a higher maximum, so it can contain elements beyond m_i +1.\n\nWait, but the presence of x+1 in S'_i+1 is required only if x is present in S'_i.\n\nSo, the sets S'_i and S'_i+1 can be thought of as having some overlapping requirements.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each i, the set S'_i must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i}, and S'_i+1 must contain all x+1 for x in S'_i.\n\nBut S'_i+1 can have more elements beyond that.\n\nWait, but for S'_i to be a child of S'_i+1, all x in S'_i must have x+1 in S'_i+1.\n\nSo, for example, if S'_i has elements {1,3}, then S'_i+1 must have 2 and 4.\n\nBut S'_i+1's maximum is m_{i+1}, which is at least m_i +1 (since m_i is the maximum of S'_i). So, in this case, m_{i+1} must be at least 4.\n\nSo, the structure of each set S'_i depends on the sets before and after.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe we can model this using dynamic programming, considering the possible maximums and the elements present.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the state based on the current maximum and the presence of certain elements.\n\nBut with K up to 2e5, we need an efficient solution. So, O(N*K) approaches are probably too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: For each set S'_i, the elements it can have are determined by the elements in the previous sets.\n\nWait, but the arrangement is arbitrary; the sets can be arranged in any order that satisfies the chain.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the entire sequence of sets as being built upon the maximums, which must form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nSo, the maximums m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n. Each m_i can be from 0 to K, but must form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nAdditionally, for each i, the set S'_i can include any subset of {1, ..., m_i}, but for each x in S'_i, x+1 must be present in S'_i+1.\n\nWait, but S'_i+1's maximum is m_{i+1}, which is >= m_i +1.\n\nSo, for each x in S'_i, x+1 can be anywhere up to m_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for example, if S'_i has x = m_i, then S'_i+1 must have x+1 = m_i +1, which is <= m_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for each i, the elements in S'_i can be any subset of {1, ..., m_i}, but the subsets must satisfy that for each x in the subset, x+1 is in S'_i+1.\n\nBut how do we count the number of valid arrays given these constraints?\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps consider that the entire array must form a chain where each set's elements are a subset of the next set's elements plus some constraints.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the problem by thinking about the maximums and then the inclusion of elements.\n\nLet me think about the maximums first. Since they form a strictly increasing sequence, m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n.\n\nEach m_i can be chosen as any integer from 0 to K, but the sequence must be strictly increasing.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the maximums is the number of strictly increasing sequences of length n where each element is between 0 and K.\n\nThe number of such sequences is C(K+1, n), since we're choosing n distinct values from 0 to K in order.\n\nWait, because m_1 can be any from 0 to K-1, m_2 from m_1+1 to K, etc. So the total is the product of (number of choices for each m_i given the previous). Which is (K) * (K-1) * ... * (K - n + 1) ) = C(K, n) * n! ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, for n=1, it's K+1 options (0,1,...,K). For n=2, it's K*(K-1) options. For n=3, K*(K-1)*(K-2), etc. So, the total is P(K+1, n) = (K+1 choose n) * n!.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut that's just the number of possible maximum sequences. Now, for each such sequence, we need to compute the number of valid arrays of sets, and sum over all possible maximum sequences.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each possible maximum sequence m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, compute the number of valid arrays, multiply by the number of ways to choose the maximum sequence, and sum all those products.\n\nWait, no. Because for each maximum sequence, the way to choose the sets is dependent on the maximum sequence.\n\nSo, the total number of arrays is the sum over all possible maximum sequences m of the product of the number of valid set arrays for that particular maximum sequence.\n\nSo, the problem is now: for each maximum sequence m, compute f(m) = the number of ways to assign the sets S_1, ..., S_n such that m_i is the maximum of S_i, and each S_i is a subset of {1..m_i}, and for each x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}.\n\nThen, the answer is the sum of f(m) multiplied by the number of ways to choose the maximum sequence m.\n\nWait, but the maximum sequence is determined by the m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. So, for a given m, the number of ways is the product of the number of valid assignments for each S_i given m_i, considering the constraints from the previous sets.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this with DP.\n\nLet me try to model the problem differently.\n\nSince the maximums are m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, and for each i, S'_i is a subset of {1..m_i}, and S'_i+1 must contain all x+1 for x in S'_i.\n\nMoreover, S'_i+1's maximum is m_{i+1} >= m_i +1.\n\nSo, perhaps for each i, the elements in S'_i are constrained by the elements in S'_i+1.\n\nWait, but the maximum of S'_i is m_i, which is less than m_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for S'_i, the elements can be any subset of {1..m_i}, but for each x in S'_i, x+1 must be in S'_i+1.\n\nBut S'_i+1's maximum is m_{i+1}, which is at least m_i +1.\n\nSo, for x in S'_i, x+1 can be up to m_{i+1}.\n\nBut in the next step, for S'_i+1, it's similar: for each x in S'_i+1, x+1 must be in S'_i+2.\n\nSo, the dependencies propagate.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can find a way to model the state for each i based on the current maximum and some information about which elements are present.\n\nWait, but considering that the maximums are fixed as m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, perhaps each S'_i can be considered independently, given the maximums.\n\nNo, because S'_i's elements affect S'_i+1.\n\nWait, but since the maximums are fixed, perhaps the constraints can be translated into certain conditions.\n\nFor example, for each i, the set S'_i can contain any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i}, provided that for each x in S'_i, x+1 is present in S'_i+1.\n\nBut since S'_i+1's maximum is m_{i+1}, which is >= m_i +1, and x+1 can be up to m_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for each x in S'_i, x+1 must be in S'_i+1, which is a subset of {1..m_{i+1}}.\n\nSo, for each i, the set S'_i can be any subset of {1..m_i}, but for each x in S'_i, x+1 must be present in S'_i+1.\n\nBut S'_i+1 can have any elements as long as they are within {1..m_{i+1}}}.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for each i, the set S'_i can include any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i}, as long as for each x in S'_i, x+1 is present in S'_i+1.\n\nBut since S'_i+1's maximum is m_{i+1}, which is >= m_i +1, the x+1 for x in S'_i can be as high as m_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but for x in S'_i, x+1 must be in S'_i+1, which is a subset of {1..m_{i+1}}}.\n\nSo, for each x in S'_i, x+1 must be in S'_i+1.\n\nSo, for i from 1 to n-1:\n\nS'_i ⊆ {1, ..., m_i}\n\nfor each x ∈ S'_i: x+1 ∈ S'_i+1\n\nAnd S'_i+1 is a subset of {1, ..., m_{i+1}}}.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, for each i, the set S'_i can have any subset of {1..m_i}, but with the condition that any x in S'_i implies x+1 is in S'_i+1.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of a 'prefix' in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps the sets can be modeled as having certain required elements based on the previous set.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think recursively. For the first set S'_1, it can be any subset of {1..m_1}. But since m_1 is fixed, the number of possibilities for S'_1 is 2^{m_1}.\n\nBut then, S'_2 must include all x+1 for x in S'_1. So, S'_2 must include all x where x = y+1 for y in S'_1.\n\nWait, no. For each x in S'_1, x+1 must be in S'_2. So, S'_2 must contain all x+1 for x in S'_1. But S'_2 can have other elements as well.\n\nSo, the minimal required elements for S'_2 are the x+1's for x in S'_1.\n\nBut S'_2 can have any elements beyond that, as long as they don't violate the child condition for the next set.\n\nWait, but for S'_3, it must include x+1 for each x in S'_2. And so on.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a chain of constraints where each set's elements are a superset of the required elements based on the previous set.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: For each i, define the set of elements that must be included in S'_i based on the previous sets.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear path.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, the set S'_i can be any subset of {1..m_i}, but with the condition that for each x in S'_i, x+1 is in S'_i+1.\n\nWhich can be rephrased as S'_i+1 must include the set {x+1 | x ∈ S'_i}.\n\nSo, S'_i+1 must contain this set as a subset.\n\nThus, S'_i+1 can be any superset of {x+1 | x ∈ S'_i}, and also a subset of {1..m_{i+1}}.\n\nSo, the number of choices for S'_i+1 is the number of subsets of {1..m_{i+1}}} that include all elements in {x+1 | x ∈ S'_i}.\n\nWait, but this seems like a multiplicative factor that can be handled combinatorially.\n\nSo, for each i, the number of ways to choose S'_i given S'_{i-1} is:\n\nIf S'_i is a subset of {1..m_i}, and includes all x+1 for x in S'_{i-1}.\n\nWait, no. Because S'_i must include all x+1 for x in S'_i-1.\n\nWait, no, S'_i must include x+1 for x in S'_i-1.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nS'_1 can be any subset of {1..m_1}.\n\nThen, S'_2 must be a subset of {1..m_2} that includes all x+1 for x in S'_1.\n\nSimilarly, S'_3 must be a subset of {1..m_3} that includes all x+1 for x in S'_2.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, this makes sense. So, the choice for S'_i depends on the choice of S'_{i-1}.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor i = 1, S'_1 can be any subset of {1..m_1}: 2^{m_1} options.\n\nFor i >1, S'_i must be a subset of {1..m_i} that includes all x+1 for x in S'_i-1.\n\nBut wait, S'_i can include other elements as well, as long as for each x in S'_i, x+1 is present in S'_i+1.\n\nWait, no. Because S'_i must have x in S'_i implies x+1 is in S'_i+1.\n\nBut S'_i+1 is the next set. So, for S'_i, the condition is on the next set.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier.\n\nThe condition is that for each x in S'_i, x+1 must be in S'_i+1.\n\nSo, S'_i+1 must include all x+1 for x in S'_i.\n\nSo, for S'_i, the condition is on S'_i+1, not on itself.\n\nThus, for S'_i, the choice is any subset of {1..m_i}, but S'_i+1 must include all x+1 for x in S'_i.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nChoose S'_1: any subset of {1..m_1}.\n\nThen, for S'_2: any subset of {1..m_2} that includes all x+1 for x in S'_1.\n\nThen, for S'_3: any subset of {1..m_3} that includes all x+1 for x in S'_2.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each S'_i is chosen after S'_{i-1}, under the constraint that S'_i must include all x+1 for x in S'_i-1.\n\nWait, but S'_i is a subset of {1..m_i}, so it can't include elements beyond m_i.\n\nBut for each x in S'_i-1, x+1 must be in S'_i.\n\nSo, S'_i must include all x+1 for x in S'_i-1, and must be a subset of {1..m_i}.\n\nThus, the minimal elements that S'_i must include are the x+1 for x in S'_i-1, but S'_i can include any additional elements as long as they are <= m_i.\n\nSo, the number of choices for S'_i is the number of subsets of {1..m_i} that include all the required elements.\n\nWait, yes. The number of subsets is the number of supersets of R_i, where R_i is the set {x+1 | x ∈ S'_i-1}, intersected with {1..m_i}.\n\nSo, for each i, the number of subsets S'_i is 2^{(m_i - |R_i|)} }, assuming that R_i is a subset of {1..m_i}.\n\nWait, no. Because R_i is the set of elements that must be included in S'_i.\n\nSo, the number of subsets is the number of subsets of {1..m_i} that include all elements of R_i.\n\nWhich is equal to 2^{ (m_i - |R_i|) }, since for each element not in R_i, it can be either included or excluded.\n\nBut wait, only if R_i is a subset of {1..m_i}.\n\nWhich it is, because S'_i-1 is a subset of {1..m_{i-1}}, and m_i >= m_{i-1} +1.\n\nSo, R_i is a subset of {1..m_{i-1} +1}.\n\nBut since m_i >= m_{i-1} +1, R_i is a subset of {1..m_i}.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nSo, for each i >=2, the number of choices for S'_i is 2^{ (m_i - s) }, where s is the size of R_i, which is the number of elements in S'_i-1 +1.\n\nWait, no. R_i is the set {x+1 | x ∈ S'_i-1}.\n\nBut S'_i-1 is a subset of {1..m_{i-1}}.\n\nSo, the size of R_i is equal to the size of S'_i-1, since each x in S'_i-1 contributes x+1 to R_i, and since all x are unique, the x+1 are unique as well.\n\nSo, |R_i| = |S'_i-1|.\n\nWait, but S'_i-1 is a subset of {1..m_{i-1}}, which is a subset of {1..m_i -1} since m_i >= m_{i-1} +1.\n\nSo, R_i is a subset of {2..m_i}.\n\nSo, the number of subsets S'_i is 2^{(m_i - |R_i|)}.\n\nWait, no. Because R_i is a subset of {1..m_i}.\n\nThe number of subsets of {1..m_i} that include R_i is 2^{(m_i - |R_i|)}.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each i >=2, the number of choices for S'_i is 2^{(m_i - |R_i|)}.\n\nBut wait, R_i is {x+1 | x ∈ S'_i-1}, which is a subset of {2..m_i}.\n\nSo, the required elements for S'_i are exactly R_i.\n\nThus, the number of subsets for S'_i is 2^{(m_i - |R_i|)}.\n\nSo, for each i, the number of choices is 2^{(m_i - k)}, where k is the number of required elements.\n\nBut wait, k is |R_i| = |S'_i-1|.\n\nSo, for each i >=2, the number of subsets is 2^{m_i - |S'_i-1|}.\n\nBut |S'_i-1| can vary based on the choices made in the previous steps.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can model this with DP.\n\nWait, but the maximums are fixed as m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n.\n\nSo, perhaps for each maximum sequence, the number of valid arrays is the product of the number of choices for each S'_i, given the constraints.\n\nBut each S'_i's choices depend on the previous S'_{i-1}.\n\nWait, but the maximums are fixed, so for each i, m_i is known.\n\nBut the choices for S'_i are dependent on the choices for S'_{i-1}.\n\nThis seems difficult, but perhaps we can find a way to represent the state in terms of the maximums and some other parameters.\n\nWait, but perhaps the DP state can be represented as the current maximum and the size of the current set.\n\nWait, for each i, the state is (current_max, size_of_set).\n\nBut the size_of_set can vary, which would make it impossible for large K.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: For each i, the number of subsets S'_i is 2^{m_i - t}, where t is the number of elements in the required set R_i.\n\nBut R_i is determined by S'_{i-1}.\n\nSo, for each i, the number of subsets S'_i is 2^{m_i - |R_i|} = 2^{m_i - |S'_i-1|}.\n\nBut |S'_i-1| varies based on the choices made.\n\nThis seems challenging because the number of possible |S'_i-1| is up to m_{i-1}, which can be up to 2e5, making this approach computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sum over all possible |S'_i-1| can be represented in a way that allows us to precompute certain exponents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given maximum sequence m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, the total number of valid arrays is the product for each i from 1 to n of (number of choices for S'_i given S'_{i-1}).\n\nBut for each i, the number of choices depends on |S'_i-1|.\n\nThis seems difficult, but perhaps for a fixed maximum sequence, the total number of arrays can be expressed as the product of certain factors, each depending on the maximums and some cumulative variables.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Think of the entire array as a chain of sets where each set must include all x+1 for x in the previous set. So, the minimal required elements for each set are the x+1 of the previous set.\n\nBut the maximums are fixed as a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nPerhaps for a fixed maximum sequence, the number of valid arrays is the product of the number of subsets S'_i that include all required elements, considering the previous set's elements.\n\nBut again, this requires knowing the size of the previous set.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given maximum sequence, the number of arrays is the product of (sum_{k=0}^{m_i} ...) terms, but this seems vague.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the number of valid arrays is determined by the product of (sum over possible sizes of S'_i) multiplied by certain factors.\n\nWait, for i=1, S'_1 can be any subset of {1..m_1}, which has 2^m_1 possibilities.\n\nFor i=2, S'_2 must include all x+1 where x is in S'_1. The number of subsets S'_2 is 2^{m_2 - |S'_1|}.\n\nSimilarly, for i=3, the number is 2^{m_3 - |S'_2|}, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of arrays for a given maximum sequence is the product over i=1 to n of the number of choices for S'_i.\n\nBut the number of choices for S'_i depends on the size of S'_i-1.\n\nThis seems recursive, but perhaps for a fixed maximum sequence, the total can be written as the product of the initial term times the product of the subsequent terms, each of which is a function of the previous size.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, the number of choices is 2^{m_i - |R_i|} where |R_i| = |S'_i-1|.\n\nBut |R_i| can vary, so for each i, the number of choices is the sum over all possible |S'_i-1| of (number of ways to choose S'_i given |S'_i-1|) multiplied by the number of ways to have |S'_i-1|.\n\nBut this sounds like a dynamic programming approach.\n\nSo, for each i, we can model the possible sizes of S'_i and the number of ways to reach those sizes.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet dp[i][k] be the number of ways to choose S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_i such that S'_i has size k.\n\nThen, for i=1, dp[1][k] is 1 for each k from 0 to m_1, because S'_1 can be any subset of size k.\n\nWait, no. For i=1, S'_1 can be any subset of {1..m_1}, so the size k can range from 0 to m_1.\n\nSo, dp[1][k] = C(m_1, k), which is the number of ways to choose a subset of size k.\n\nBut for i>1, dp[i][k] is computed as follows: for each possible size l of S'_i-1, and for each possible size k, the number of ways is the sum over l of (dp[i-1][l] multiplied by the number of subsets S'_i of size k that include all x+1 for x in S'_i-1).\n\nBut this seems complicated because for each l, the number of subsets S'_i with size k is not straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given l, the number of subsets S'_i is 2^{m_i - l}, as R_i is a set of size l.\n\nSo, for each l, the number of subsets S'_i is 2^{m_i - l}, and among these, the subsets can have any size from l (since R_i must be included) up to m_i.\n\nSo, for each i, the possible sizes of S'_i can range from l (the size of R_i, which is the size of S'_i-1) to m_i.\n\nThus, for each i, the number of subsets S'_i of size k is C(m_i - l, k - l), because we have to include the l elements of R_i, and choose k-l additional elements from the remaining m_i - l elements.\n\nSo, for each i, the transition is:\n\ndp[i][k] = sum_{l=0}^{m_{i-1}}} dp[i-1][l] * C(m_i - l, k - l) \n\nwhere k ranges from l to m_i.\n\nBut wait, m_i is known for each step, and l can be up to m_{i-1}, which is <= m_i -1.\n\nBut for N up to 2e5, and K up to 2e5, this approach is O(N*K^2), which is way too slow.\n\nSo, this seems impractical.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps, for a fixed maximum sequence, the number of valid arrays can be expressed as the product of (sum_{k=0}^{m_i} ...) terms, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of ways for each i is 2^{m_i - l}, where l is the size of S'_i-1.\n\nBut the overall product would then be the product of 2^{m_i - l_i}, where l_i is the size of S'_i.\n\nBut this depends on the l_i's, which vary.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Notice that for each i, the number of subsets S'_i is 2^{m_i - |R_i|} = 2^{m_i - |S'_i-1|}.\n\nSo, the total number of arrays is the product over i=1 to n of 2^{m_i - |S'_i-1|}.\n\nBut |S'_i-1| is the size of the previous set.\n\nThis suggests that the total is 2^{sum_{i=1 to n} (m_i - |S'_i-1|)}.\n\nBut the sum telescopes in a way. Let's see:\n\nsum (m_i - |S'_i-1|) for i=1 to n.\n\nBut for i=1, S'_0 is undefined. So perhaps for i=2 to n.\n\nWait, for i=2: m_2 - |S'_1|.\n\nFor i=3: m_3 - |S'_2|.\n\n...\n\nFor i=n: m_n - |S'_n-1|.\n\nSumming from i=2 to n: (m_2 - |S'_1|) + (m_3 - |S'_2|) + ... + (m_n - |S'_n-1|).\n\nWhich equals (m_2 + m_3 + ... + m_n) - (|S'_1| + |S'_2| + ... + |S'_n-1|).\n\nBut the total sum from i=1 to n is m_1 (for i=1) plus the above, which gives:\n\nTotal sum = m_1 + (m_2 + ... + m_n) - (|S'_1| + |S'_2| + ... + |S'_n|).\n\nWait, no. Because for i=1, the term is m_1 - |S'_0|, but S'_0 is undefined. So perhaps the initial term is",
