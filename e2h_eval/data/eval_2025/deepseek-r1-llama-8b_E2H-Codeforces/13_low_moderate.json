For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given triad (a set of three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The definition of major and minor chords is based on the distances between the notes in a certain order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. These are arranged cyclically, meaning after H comes C again. The distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. So, each step from one note to the next adds a semitone.\n\nA major triad has three notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and from Y to Z is 3 semitones. So the total is 7 semitones from X to Z. A minor triad is the opposite: X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4, totaling 7 semitones.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, I need to check all possible orderings of the three notes to see if any of them fit the major or minor condition. And since the problem states that the answer is unambiguous, no triad will satisfy both conditions.\n\nSo my approach should be:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n3. For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes.\n4. Check if any permutation forms a major or minor triad.\n5. Based on which one it is, output the result; otherwise, output 'strange'.\n\nWait, but wait—what's the correct way to represent the order? Because the triad can be ordered in any way, I need to try all possible orderings and see if any of them satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nBut let me think: the chord is an unordered set, so for each permutation of the three notes, I can compute the distances between the first and second, and second and third. Then, check if those distances match either the major or minor pattern.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the cyclic nature of the notes? Because after H comes C, so the distance between H and C is 1 semitone.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I should assign each note a numerical value, like 0 to 11, representing their position in the list [C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H]. Then, the distance between any two notes can be computed by taking the minimum of (y - x) mod 12 and (x - y) mod 12, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says the distance is always measured from the lower note to the higher one, so it's the number of semitones going up. So for example, from C to E is 4 semitones. From E to C is 8 semitones.\n\nSo when calculating the distance between two notes, we can represent each note as a number from 0 to 11. Then, for two notes a and b, where a < b, the distance is (b - a). But if a > b, then the distance is (12 - a + b). Wait, no. Wait, the distance is always calculated as the number of steps moving forward from the lower note to the higher one. So for any two distinct notes, the distance is (b - a) mod 12 if a < b, else (b - a + 12) mod 12? Or maybe it's better to represent each note as a number, and then compute the distance as (y - x) if y >= x, else (12 - (x - y)).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can create a list of the notes in order, then for any two notes, find their positions, and compute the forward distance.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo first, I'll create a list of the notes in order:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nEach note can be assigned an index from 0 to 11.\n\nThen, for any two notes, say x and y, their indices are i and j. The distance from x to y is (j - i) if j >=i, else (12 - (i - j)). Wait, no: because if i is higher than j, then the forward distance is (12 - (i - j)), right? Because from x to y, moving forward.\n\nWait, for example: H is index 11, C is 0. The distance from H to C is 1 semitone. So if i is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The problem is based on the cyclic nature of musical notes and specific distance criteria for major and minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Note Order and Distances**: The notes are arranged in a cyclic order with 12 notes, each separated by one semitone. The distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone.\n2. **Major and Minor Triads**: A major triad has distances of 4 and 3 semitones between its notes when ordered correctly, while a minor triad has distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n3. **Cyclic Distance Calculation**: Since the notes are cyclic, after H comes C again. We need to handle this cyclic nature when calculating distances.\n4. **Permutations of Notes**: For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations to check each ordering for the major or minor criteria.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input notes\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\n# Define the order of the notes\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n# Create a dictionary to map note names to their indices\nnote_indices = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\n# Function to calculate the forward distance between two notes\ndef get_distance(note1, note2):\n    i = note_indices[note1]\n    j = note_indices[note2]\n    if j >= i:\n        return j - i\n    else:\n        return (12 - (i - j))\n\n# Generate all possible orderings of the three notes\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    # Check all possible pairs for the first two and last two notes\n    d1 = get_distance(perm[0], perm[1])\n    d2 = get_distance(perm[1], perm[2])\n    \n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\n# If none of the permutations fit, it's strange\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three space-separated notes.\n2. **Note Ordering**: Each note is assigned an index from 0 to 11 based on their position in the musical scale.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The function `get_distance` computes the forward distance between two notes, considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Permutations Check**: Using permutations, we check all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, we print \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the notes to correctly classify the chord.",
