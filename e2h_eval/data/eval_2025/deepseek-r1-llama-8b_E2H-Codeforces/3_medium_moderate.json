Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm. So, the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d where every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The street is a line from 0 to l. Each lantern i is at position ai. The area it covers is [ai - d, ai + d], but we have to make sure that this doesn't go beyond 0 or l. Wait, no, because if ai -d is less than 0, the coverage starts at 0. Similarly, if ai +d exceeds l, it ends at l.\n\nWait, no, the lantern's coverage is any point on the street that is at most d away. So for each lantern, the interval it covers is [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)]. But since all lanterns must cover the entire street, the union of their intervals must be exactly [0, l].\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal d such that the union of all these intervals covers [0, l].\n\nHow do I compute this? Well, maybe I can model this as covering the street completely with the intervals from each lantern, and find the minimal d that allows this.\n\nAn approach could be to sort the lantern positions, then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns, and see what the maximum required d is based on those gaps.\n\nWait, yes! Because if the lanterns are sorted, the critical points are the areas between them. For example, suppose two lanterns are at x and y (x < y). Then the first lantern can cover up to x+d, and the second starts at y-d. Wait, no: the second lantern's coverage starts at y - d, so the gap between x+d and y-d must be zero or negative for the street to be fully covered.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's see. The first lantern's right end is x + d, and the next lantern's left end is y - d. The area between x +d and y -d must be <= 0 for no gap. So the minimal required is that x + d >= y -d. Which simplifies to x +d >= y -d → 2d >= y -x → d >= (y-x)/2.\n\nBut also, each lantern's own coverage must extend to the ends of the street. So for the first lantern, 0 must be covered by its left end: 0 >= ai[0] - d → d >= ai[0]. Similarly, the last lantern must have d >= l - ai[-1].\n\nWait, that's correct. Because for the first lantern, its coverage starts at max(0, ai[0]-d), which must be <=0. So ai[0] -d <=0 → d >= ai[0]. Same logic for the last lantern: ai[-1]+d >= l → d >= l - ai[-1].\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n\n2. Compute the initial candidate for d as the maximum of (ai[0], l - ai[-1]).\n\n3. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the required d to cover the gap between them. The required d for the gap between x and y is (y - x)/2. So for all consecutive pairs, take the maximum of these (y-x)/2 values.\n\n4. The overall minimal d is the maximum between the initial candidate and the maximum of all consecutive gaps' required d.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the initial candidate ensures the ends are covered, and the maximum of the gaps ensures that the middle parts are covered.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWait, wait, the first line in the sample is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which I think represents n=7, l=15, and the lanterns are at [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. So when sorted, they are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nCompute initial d: the first lantern is 0, so d must be >=0. The last is 15, so d >=15-15=0. So initial d is 0.\n\nNow look at the consecutive gaps:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: (3-0)/2 = 1.5\n\nBetween 3 and5: (5-3)/2=1\n\nBetween 5 and7: (7-5)/2=1\n\nBetween 7 and9:1\n\nBetween 9 and14: (14-9)/2=2.5\n\nBetween 14 and15:0.5\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. So the required d is the maximum between 0 and 2.5, which is 2.5.\n\nBut wait, in the sample output, the answer is 2.0000000000. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the sample. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the second sample input is written as:\n\n['2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSo n=2, l=5. The lanterns are at 2 and 5.\n\nSort them: [2,5].\n\nInitial d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.\n\nCheck the gaps: between 2 and5 is 3. The required d for this gap is (5-2)/2 = 1.5.\n\nSo the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. So the output is 2.0000000000, which matches the sample.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, why isn't the output 2.5?\n\nWait, the first sample's input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0']\n\nWhich after sorting is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nCompute initial d: max(0, 15-15=0) →0.\n\nThen check the gaps:\n\n0-3: 1.5\n\n3-5:1\n\n5-7:1\n\n7-9:1\n\n9-14:2.5\n\n14-15:0.5\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5, so the output should be 2.5, but in the sample, the output is 2.5000000000, which matches.\n\nWait, but looking back, the sample given shows the first sample's output as ['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000'], which suggests that for the first case, the output is 2.5.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the first sample's input. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the problem statement, the first sample input is written as:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSo the first line is n=7, l=15, and the lanterns are at [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. When sorted, they are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nSo initial d is max(0, 15-15)=0.\n\nGaps are:\n\n0-3: (3)/2=1.5\n\n3-5:1\n\n5-7:1\n\n7-9:1\n\n9-14: (14-9)/2=2.5\n\n14-15:0.5\n\nSo the maximum of these is 2.5.\n\nSo the output is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output is 2.5000000000, which is what the code would produce.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the lanterns are at [0, l], then the initial d is max(0, l- l=0) →0. The only gap is between 0 and l, which requires (l)/2. So the minimal d is (l)/2. For example, l=5: d=2.5.\n\nAnother case: lanterns at [1,4], l=5.\n\nInitial d: max(1,5-4=1) →1.\n\nGap is 4-1=3. Required d for gap is 1.5.\n\nSo the maximum is max(1,1.5)=1.5. So the minimal d is 1.5.\n\nWhich is correct because the first lantern covers [1-1.5, 1+1.5] = [-0.5, 2.5], but since the street starts at 0, the coverage is [0,2.5]. The second lantern covers [4-1.5=2.5, 6.5], but the street ends at 5, so it covers [2.5,5]. Thus, the entire street is covered.\n\nAnother edge case: all lanterns are at 0. Then initial d is 0, but the street needs to be covered. Since all lanterns are at 0, the coverage is [0, d]. So to cover up to l, d must be >= l. So the minimal d is l.\n\nSimilarly, if all lanterns are at l, d must be l.\n\nWhat about when there's only one lantern? Then it's at some position. To cover the entire street, d must be at least max(ai[0], l - ai[0]). For example, if ai is at 5, l is 10. Then d must be 5, because 5 -5 =0, and 5+5=10, covering the entire street.\n\nSo the algorithm handles all cases.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and l.\n\n- Read the list of ai.\n\n- Sort the ai.\n\n- Compute the initial d as the maximum of ai[0] and (l - ai[-1]).\n\n- For each consecutive pair in the sorted ai, compute (current - previous)/2, and keep track of the maximum.\n\n- The minimal d is the maximum between the initial d and the maximum of the consecutive gaps.\n\nSo now, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, in Python, read the input.\n\nWe can read the first line as n and l.\n\nThen, read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen, sort this list.\n\nThen, compute the initial d.\n\nIf n is 1, then initial d is max(ai[0], l - ai[0]).\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, compute the gaps.\n\nInitialize max_gap as 0.\n\nLoop from i=1 to len(ai)-1:\n\n   current = ai[i]\n\n   previous = ai[i-1]\n\n   gap = current - previous\n\n   required_d = gap / 2\n\n   if required_d > max_gap:\n\n       max_gap = required_d\n\nThen, the minimal d is the maximum between initial_d and max_gap.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nai.sort()\n\nif n ==0:\n\n    # Not possible, since n>=1 per problem statement.\n\nelif n ==1:\n\n    d_initial = max(ai[0], l - ai[0])\n\n    print(d_initial)\n\nelse:\n\n    initial_d = max(ai[0], l - ai[-1])\n\n    max_gap = 0.0\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n\n        prev = ai[i-1]\n\n        curr = ai[i]\n\n        gap = curr - prev\n\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n\n        if required_d > max_gap:\n\n            max_gap = required_d\n\n    minimal_d = max(initial_d, max_gap)\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(minimal_d))\n\nWait, but wait: in the case when n is 1, the code correctly computes the minimal d as max(ai[0], l - ai[0]).\n\nTesting this against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 2: n=2, ai=[2,5]. Sorted as [2,5].\n\ninitial_d = max(2, 5-5)=2.\n\ngap is 3, required_d=1.5.\n\nmax_gap is 1.5.\n\nso minimal_d is max(2, 1.5)=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, ai=[0], l=5. Initial_d is max(0,5-0)=5. So minimal_d is 5.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, ai=[0,4,8], l=8.\n\ninitial_d is max(0, 8-8)=0.\n\ngaps: 4-0=4 → required_d=2; 8-4=4 → required_d=2. So max_gap is 2.\n\nso minimal_d is 2.\n\nWhich is correct because each lantern covers 0±2, 4±2, 8±2.\n\n0+2=2, 4-2=2, 8-2=6. So the street is covered from 0 to 8.\n\nWait, but what about the coverage from 2 to 6. Wait, 4-2=2, but 4+2=6. So yes, 2 to 6 is covered by the second lantern. The first lantern covers 0-2, and the third covers 6-8. So the entire street is covered.\n\nAnother case: lanterns at [0, 6], l=10.\n\ninitial_d is max(0, 10-6)=4.\n\ngap is 6 units, required_d is 3.\n\nso minimal_d is max(4,3) →4.\n\nBecause:\n\nWith d=4, the first lantern covers 0-4, and the second covers 6-10 (since 6+4=10).\n\nWait, but the middle is 4 to 6. Are those points covered?\n\nNo. So what's wrong here.\n\nWait, wait, that's a problem. Because in this case, the initial_d is 4, which comes from the last lantern needing to reach l=10: 6 +d >=10 →d>=4.\n\nThe gap between 0 and6 is 6, required_d is 3. So the maximum of 4 and 3 is 4.\n\nBut with d=4, the first lantern covers 0-4, the second covers 6-10. What about the point at 4.5? It's not covered by either. So the entire street isn't lit.\n\nSo my approach is wrong.\n\nOh no, that's a problem. So my initial logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, why is that happening?\n\nBecause the initial approach only considers the ends and the consecutive gaps, but perhaps in some cases, the initial_d is larger than the required gap, but the middle still has uncovered regions.\n\nSo what's wrong with the approach.\n\nIn the above example, n=2, ai=[0,6], l=10.\n\nsorted ai is [0,6].\n\ninitial_d is max(0, 10-6)=4.\n\nthe gap is 6, so required_d is 3.\n\nso the minimal d is 4.\n\nBut with d=4, the first lantern covers 0-4, the second covers 6-10. So the region 4-6 is not covered.\n\nThus, the approach is wrong.\n\nSo what's the correct way to calculate d.\n\nHmm, I think my approach misses some cases where the initial d is sufficient for the ends but leaves a gap in the middle.\n\nSo I need to rethink the problem.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe minimal d is the minimal value such that the union of the intervals [ai_i -d, ai_i +d] for all i covers [0,l].\n\nThis can be seen as a set cover problem, but since the intervals are on a line, perhaps we can model it as finding the minimal d where all the intervals together cover [0,l].\n\nAn alternative idea is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe entire street must be covered. So for each point x in [0, l], there exists at least one lantern i such that |x - ai_i| <=d.\n\nWe need to find the minimal d where this holds.\n\nThis can be approached by considering all the critical points where the coverage changes.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the minimal d such that for all x in [0, l], the nearest lantern to x is at most d away.\n\nSo, for each x, the distance to the closest lantern is <=d. So the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances from any point x to the nearest lantern.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances across all points x in [0, l].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWell, the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances, which occurs at some point between two lanterns.\n\nWait, for example, between two consecutive lanterns, the maximal minimal distance occurs at the midpoint.\n\nBecause between two lanterns at x1 and x2 (x1 <x2), the minimal distance to any lantern is maximized at the midpoint.\n\nAt the midpoint m=(x1+x2)/2, the distance to x1 is m -x1 = (x2 -x1)/2, and to x2 is x2 -m = same. So the minimal distance is (x2 -x1)/2.\n\nAdditionally, the minimal d must also be at least the distance from the first lantern to 0, and the last lantern to l.\n\nSo, the overall minimal d is the maximum between:\n\n- (x1)/2, where x1 is the first lantern's position.\n\n- (l -x_last)/2, where x_last is the last lantern's position.\n\n- (x_{i} -x_{i-1})/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nSo, this is different from the initial approach.\n\nIn the earlier example:\n\nn=2, lanterns at 0 and6, l=10.\n\nThe first lantern's distance to 0 is 0.\n\nThe last lantern's distance to 10 is 4.\n\nThe gap between 0 and6 is 6, so the required d is 3.\n\nSo the maximum of 0,4,3 is4.\n\nBut in reality, the coverage is [0-4, 6+4] = [-4, 10], but the street is 0-10. So 4-6 is not covered. So the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Wait, with d=4, the first lantern covers 0-4, the second covers 6-10. So 4-6 is not covered. So the approach is wrong.\n\nSo why is the approach not working?\n\nBecause the approach is taking the maximum of the initial d (which is 4) and the gaps' (3), but the actual minimal d is higher.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- The initial_d (distance from first to 0 and last to l).\n\n- The maximum of (x_i - x_{i-1}) / 2 for all consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo in the example, the maximum is 4.\n\nBut in reality, with d=4, the coverage is insufficient.\n\nSo what's wrong here.\n\nAh, perhaps I was mistaken in the initial model. Because the initial_d is computed as the maximum of ai[0] and (l - ai[-1]), which is correct.\n\nBut when you have a gap between two lanterns, the required d is not just the gap divided by two, but also that the initial_d plus the gap's required d may not be sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the required d as the maximum of:\n\n- (ai[0]) (to cover 0)\n\n- (l - ai[-1]) (to cover l)\n\n- and for each consecutive pair, (ai[i] - ai[i-1])/2.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier. But in the sample case, this gives 4, but it's insufficient.\n\nSo perhaps my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's think again: the minimal d must satisfy that for each lantern, it covers a certain range, and the union of these ranges covers the entire street.\n\nIn the example with lanterns at 0 and6, l=10:\n\nIf d=4:\n\nLantern 0 covers 0-4.\n\nLantern6 covers6-10.\n\nSo the street from 4 to6 is not covered.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal d must be greater than4.\n\nWhat's the minimal d in this case?\n\nWe need to choose a d where the coverage overlaps in such a way that the entire street is covered.\n\nSo perhaps, in addition to the initial conditions, the middle gaps must be considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimal d as the maximum of:\n\n- The initial_d (max(ai[0], l - ai[-1]))\n\n- The maximum of (x_i - x_{i-1})/2 for consecutive lanterns.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum is 4, but the coverage is insufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nHmm. So what is the correct way to model this.\n\nAlternative idea: The minimal d is the maximum of the following values:\n\n1. The distance from the first lantern to the start (ai[0]).\n\n2. The distance from the last lantern to the end (l - ai[-1]).\n\n3. The maximum of (x_i -x_{i-1})/2 for all consecutive lanterns.\n\nBut in the example, this gives 4, but the coverage is incomplete.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the initial approach doesn't account for the fact that the required d must cover both ends and the middle.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to compute the minimal d as the maximum of the initial_d and the maximum of the gaps.\n\nBut in the example, the initial_d is 4, the gaps require 3, so the maximum is 4, but it's not sufficient.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this differently.\n\nEach lantern contributes a circle (interval) of radius d. The entire street must lie within the union of these intervals.\n\nTo ensure that, for each point x in [0, l], x is covered by at least one lantern.\n\nThe minimal d is the smallest value such that this is true.\n\nSo the minimal d is the minimal number for which the union of all [ai_i -d, ai_i +d] covers [0, l].\n\nThis can be found by looking at the points where the coverage is just sufficient.\n\nThese points are:\n\n- 0: must be covered by at least one lantern. So 0 >= ai_j -d →d >= ai_j, for some j.\n\n- l: similarly, d >= l - ai_k for some k.\n\n- The midpoints between two consecutive lanterns: (x_i +x_{i+1})/2. At this point, the distance to the left lantern is (x_i +x_{i+1})/2 - x_i = (x_{i+1} -x_i)/2. Similarly for the right. So for this point to be covered, d must be at least (x_{i+1} -x_i)/2.\n\nSo the minimal d must be the maximum of:\n\n- The minimal d needed to cover 0 (which is the minimal ai_j, since d must be >= ai_j for some j).\n\nWait, no. Because 0 is covered by any lantern j where ai_j >=0 -d →ai_j >= -d. Since ai_j is non-negative, this condition is automatically satisfied if d >=0.\n\nWait, no, for 0 to be covered by a lantern at ai_j, we need 0 >= ai_j -d →d >= ai_j.\n\nSo for 0 to be covered, at least one lantern must have ai_j <=d.\n\nSo the minimal d must be >= the minimal ai_j? No, because d can be smaller than that if another lantern covers 0.\n\nWait, no: 0 is covered if 0 >= ai_j -d →d >= ai_j.\n\nBut if a lantern is at ai_j = 5, then d must be at least 5 to cover 0.\n\nWait, no. If ai_j is 5, then 0 is covered only if d >=5.\n\nYes, because 0 >=5 -d →d >=5.\n\nSo for 0 to be covered, at least one lantern must be at or before 0, or d must be >= the position of the lantern.\n\nWait, no. For example, if there's a lantern at 2, then for d=3, 0 is covered because 0 is within 2-3 = -1 to 2+3=5. So 0 is covered.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 0 is in [2-3, 2+3] → [-1,5]. So yes, 0 is covered.\n\nSo, for 0 to be covered, it's sufficient that the lantern's coverage includes 0. So, 0 >= ai_j -d →d >= ai_j -0 →d >= ai_j.\n\nSo for 0 to be covered, d must be >= the minimal ai_j.\n\nWait, no: because if a lantern is at 5, and d=4, then 0 is not covered by 5-4=1, which is less than 0. So 0 is not covered.\n\nSo, to cover 0, there must exist a lantern at a_j <=d.\n\nSo, for the minimal d, the minimal d must be >= the maximum of all a_j that are at the beginning, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d must be >= the maximum of (a_i) for the first part, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to model this differently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe minimal d is the minimal value such that:\n\nfor all x in [0, l], there exists a lantern i where |x - ai_i| <=d.\n\nWe can model the minimal d as the maximum of:\n\n- The minimal distance from any point x in [0, l] to the nearest lantern.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances across all points x.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nThe minimal distance for each x is the distance to the nearest lantern.\n\nThe maximum of this function over x in [0, l] is the minimal d.\n\nSo, to compute this, we can consider all the points x where this maximum occurs.\n\nThese points are either at the endpoints (0 or l) or between two consecutive lanterns.\n\nFor example, between two consecutive lanterns at a and b, the minimal distance is maximized at the midpoint m=(a+b)/2. At this point, the distance to a is (b-a)/2, and to b is same.\n\nSo, the maximum minimal distance in this interval is (b-a)/2.\n\nAlso, the endpoints 0 and l must be considered.\n\nAt 0, the minimal distance is the distance to the first lantern a_0, which is a_0.\n\nAt l, the minimal distance is l - a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- a_0,\n\n- (l - a_{n-1}),\n\n- and all (a_i - a_{i-1}) / 2 for consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo, the initial approach was correct.\n\nBut why in the earlier example, it didn't work.\n\nLet me re-examine the example:\n\nn=2, lanterns at 0 and6, l=10.\n\nCompute:\n\na_0=0, a_1=6.\n\na_0=0, so the first term is 0.\n\nl - a_{n-1}=10-6=4.\n\nThe consecutive gap is (6-0)/2=3.\n\nSo the maximum is 4.\n\nSo the minimal d is4.\n\nBut in that case, as discussed, the coverage is insufficient.\n\nWhat's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is correct, but the coverage is sufficient.\n\nWait, with d=4, the first lantern covers 0-4, the second covers6-10.\n\nSo, the street is 0-10.\n\nWhat about the point 4: it's covered by the first lantern.\n\nPoint5: 5 is not covered by either. Because 5>4 (first lantern's end) and 5<6 (second lantern's start). So 5 is not covered.\n\nThus, the model is incorrect.\n\nSo, why is the model giving 4, but the coverage is insufficient.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the model is wrong.\n\nSo, what is the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is correct, but I'm making a mistake in thinking about the coverage.\n\nWait, no, because with d=4, the first lantern covers 0-4, the second covers6-10. So the street is not fully covered.\n\nSo the model's result is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the model is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is considering that the minimal d is the maximum of a_0, (l - a_{n-1}), and the gaps, but perhaps in some cases, the required d is higher than that.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is correct, but in that example, the required d is indeed 4, but the coverage is not complete. So the model is wrong.\n\nBut that can't be, because the model is supposed to capture all necessary conditions.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is incorrect because the minimal d is not just the maximum of those terms, but also the maximum of all (a_i - a_{i-1})/2 and the initial terms.\n\nWait, but in the example, the model says the maximum is4, but the coverage is insufficient.\n\nSo perhaps the model is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is correct, and the example is correct, but I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is correct, and the example is correct.\n\nWait, in the example, the minimal d is4, but with that d, the street is not fully covered.\n\nSo the model is wrong.\n\nSo what is the correct approach.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n1. The distance from the first lantern to 0 (ai[0]).\n\n2. The distance from the last lantern to l (l - ai[-1]).\n\n3. The maximum of (ai[i] - ai[i-1])/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nBut perhaps that's not sufficient.\n\nIn the example:\n\n1. ai[0]=0 → condition1=0.\n\n2. ai[-1]=6 → condition2=4.\n\n3. (6-0)/2=3.\n\nSo the model says d=4.\n\nBut in reality, with d=4, the coverage is 0-4 and6-10.\n\nThus, the street is not covered from4-6.\n\nSo, the model is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to find the maximum of:\n\n- The initial conditions (ai[0] and l - ai[-1]).\n\n- The maximum of the (ai[i] - ai[i-1])/2.\n\nBut in the example, the initial conditions are 0 and4, and the maximum gap is3.\n\nThus, the model suggests d=4.\n\nBut the coverage is not complete.\n\nSo, what is wrong with the model.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is correct, but I made a mistake in evaluating the coverage.\n\nWait, for d=4, the first lantern covers 0 to4.\n\nThe second lantern covers6 to10.\n\nSo the street is from0 to10.\n\nWait, but what about the point at5: it's not covered by either.\n\nThus, the model is incorrect.\n\nSo, what is the correct approach.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nPerhaps the correct model is to find the maximum of:\n\n- The initial conditions (ai[0], l - ai[-1]).\n\n- The maximum of (ai[i] - ai[i-1])/2.\n\nBut in the example, this is4, but the coverage is incomplete.\n\nThus, the model is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct model is to compute the minimal d such that the union of the intervals covers [0, l].\n\nThus, the minimal d must be such that for all x in [0, l], there exists an interval [ai_i -d, ai_i +d] that contains x.\n\nTo find the minimal d, perhaps we can perform a binary search on possible d values.\n\nYes, that's a better approach.\n\nSo, binary search over d:\n\nThe minimal d is the smallest value where the union of the intervals [ai_i -d, ai_i +d] covers [0, l].\n\nSo, how to model this.\n\nWe can perform a binary search on d.\n\nFor a given d, we can check whether the union of the intervals covers [0, l].\n\nIf it does, we can try a lower d.\n\nOtherwise, we need a higher d.\n\nThe question is, how to implement the check efficiently.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Sort the ai array.\n\n- Binary search for the minimal d.\n\n- For each candidate d during binary search:\n\n   - Create the union of the intervals [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)] for each lantern.\n\n   - Check if the union covers [0, l].\n\n   - If yes, try lower d.\n\n   - Else, try higher d.\n\nBut for n=1000, this might be efficient enough.\n\nBut how to implement the check.\n\nThe union of the intervals can be represented as a list of merged intervals.\n\nOnce merged, we can check if the merged intervals cover [0, l].\n\nBut merging intervals is O(n), which is manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps.\n\nImplement binary search:\n\nlow = 0.0\n\nhigh = max(l, 2*l) # Or higher, but perhaps (l -0)/2 is sufficient.\n\nWait, the minimal d can't be more than (l -0)/2, because with a single lantern at the middle, d would be l/2.\n\nWait, no, because for a single lantern at the middle, the coverage is [mid -d, mid +d], which must cover [0,l].\n\nSo, mid -d >=0 →d >= mid.\n\nmid +d >=l →d >= l -mid.\n\nSince mid = l/2, d must be >= l/2.\n\nThus, high can be set to (l)/2.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps set high to l.\n\nBut in the binary search, it's better to set a proper upper bound.\n\nSo, for the binary search:\n\nlow = 0.0\n\nhigh = (l) * 2 # Just to be safe.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nNow, for each d_candidate in binary search:\n\nCompute all intervals as [max(0, a_i -d_candidate), min(l, a_i +d_candidate)].\n\nMerge overlapping intervals.\n\nCheck if the merged intervals cover [0, l].\n\nIf yes, then we can try a lower d.\n\nElse, we need higher d.\n\nSo, the key is to implement the merge function.\n\nImplementing the merge:\n\n- Sort the intervals by their start.\n\n- Iterate through the sorted intervals, merging them into non-overlapping intervals.\n\n- Finally, check if the merged intervals cover 0 and l.\n\nAlternatively, during the merge, if the current merged interval already covers 0 and l, we can break early.\n\nBut for the purposes of correctness, let's proceed.\n\nImplementing this:\n\ndef is_covered(d, ai, l):\n\n    intervals = []\n\n    for a in ai:\n\n        start = max(0.0, a -

For each candidate \\( d \\) during the binary search, we check if the union of intervals covered by all lanterns covers the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\).\n\n1. **Binary Search**: We perform binary search on the possible values of \\( d \\).
