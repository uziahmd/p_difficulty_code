The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a snowflake graph with n vertices exists. The snowflake graph is defined in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure.\n\nThe snowflake graph starts with one vertex. Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices, where k>1. So after this step, there are 1 + k = k+1 vertices. Then, each vertex that has only one edge (so those k new ones) must each connect to k more new vertices. This last step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when each of those k nodes adds another k leaves, making a total of 1 +k +k^2.\n\nWait, let's think: initial node has degree k. Each of the k nodes then adds k children. So each of those k nodes now has degree k+1. So after the second step, the graph has 1 + k + k*k = 1 +k +k² vertices.\n\nBut wait, what if we do more steps? Like, after adding the second layer, can we add a third layer? Because in the problem statement, it says each vertex with degree 1 (i.e., those in the last added layer) must be connected to k new nodes. So for each step, you process all current leaves and add k children to each. So each step increases the depth by one layer.\n\nSo the snowflake graph is built in layers. The first layer is the root (depth 0). Then, the next layer is depth 1, each with k nodes. Then, the next layer is depth 2, each of the previous layer's nodes adding k children, so k² nodes. And so on, until some m layers.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the step of adding should be done at least once. So the minimal structure is when we have two steps beyond the initial. Or wait, no: the initial step is adding the first layer, and then the step is done at least once. So the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes), and then the step (adding another layer) is done once. So the minimal snowflake has 1 +k +k² vertices.\n\nBut wait, maybe the step is done more than once. So the graph can have multiple layers beyond that. For example, if after the initial step, we add another layer, then another, etc.\n\nSo the number of vertices in a snowflake is determined by how many times the step is performed. Let's model this.\n\nLet’s denote m as the number of times the step is performed. So the initial step is step 0: the root (1 node). Then, step 1: add k nodes (total 1 +k). Step 2: each of these k nodes adds k nodes, so total becomes 1 +k +k². If we do step 3, each of the k² nodes adds k children, adding k³, so total becomes 1 +k +k² +k³. Wait, no: because each node in the previous step adds k children, which is multiplicative.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\n- After step 0: 1 node.\n- After step 1: add k nodes → total 1 +k.\n- After step 2: each of the k nodes adds k → total 1 +k +k^2.\n- After step m: total is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m}).\n\nWait no, because each step adds a new layer. The number of nodes added at each step is k^s, where s is the step number (starting from 1). So the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{s=1 to m} k^s. But wait, no: because in each step, every current leaf node (from the previous step) adds k new nodes. So the number of nodes after m steps is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nInitially, 1 node.\n\nStep 1: Add k nodes connected to it. Now total is 1 +k.\n\nEach of these k nodes has degree 1 (connected only to the root). So in the next step, each of them adds k new nodes. So step 2: each of the k nodes adds k → total new nodes added is k*k. So total becomes 1 +k +k².\n\nNow, each of these new nodes (the k²) has degree 1, so in step 3, each adds k new nodes. So step 3 adds k³, total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo yes, for m steps, the total is 1 +k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1} ) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m.\n\nBecause the steps are step 1, step 2, ..., step m, each adding k^s for s from 1 to m.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k² + ... +k^m.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the step must be done at least once. So m >=1.\n\nWait, no: the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the step is done at least once. So the initial step is step 1, and then step 2 is done. So the minimal is m=2 steps?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the initial step (adding the first layer) is step 1. Then, the step is done at least once, meaning that step 2 must be done. So the minimal number of layers is 3: the root, then level 1 (k nodes), then level 2 (k² nodes). So the total is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for a given n, we need to find if there exists a k>1 and m>=2 such that n = 1 +k*(k^{m-1}) / (k-1)? Wait, no. Wait, the sum 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m is a geometric series.\n\nThe sum S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Because sum_{s=0}^m k^s = (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1). So S = (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1) - 1? No, wait: the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^m = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nYes.\n\nSo for the snowflake, n must equal (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m >=2 (since the step is done at least once, which implies that the sum has at least three terms: 1 +k +k²).\n\nWait, because the step is done at least once, the minimal is m=2 (sum is up to k², which is 1 +k +k²). So m starts from 2.\n\nWait, no: m is the exponent in the sum. So for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for the problem, n must be equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m >=2, and k>1.\n\nAlternatively, since m is the maximum exponent, the sum is S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for our problem, S can be written as such.\n\nSo, for a given n, we need to check if there exists k>1 and m>=2 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nOur task is to determine for each n whether such k and m exist.\n\nHmm, but how to compute this efficiently, given that n can be up to 1e18.\n\nWe need to find for each n whether it can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with ratio k>1, starting from 1, having at least three terms (so m+1 >=3, so m>=2).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to iterate over possible k values, and for each k, check if (n*(k-1)+1) is a perfect power of k, and that the exponent is at least 3.\n\nWait, because n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) → n(k-1) +1 = k^{m+1}.\n\nSo for each k, compute n*(k-1) +1, and see if it is a perfect power of k, and the exponent is at least m+1 >=3.\n\nWait, no. Because m+1 can vary. So, for each k>1, we can compute x = n*(k-1) +1. Then, check whether x is a power of k, i.e., x = k^p for some p >=3.\n\nIf yes, then n is valid.\n\nBut how to choose k? Because k can be up to sqrt(n), but for n up to 1e18, iterating all possible k is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible k, compute x = n*(k-1)+1 and check whether x is a perfect power of k, and the exponent is at least 3.\n\nBut how to find the possible k's.\n\nWait, for a given n, k can't be larger than n. Because for k> n, the sum 1 +k +k² would be larger than n.\n\nWait, but for n=1e18, trying all possible k is impossible.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about possible exponents. For a given n, the maximum possible exponent is log_2(n), since 2^p <=n → p <=60.\n\nBut perhaps for each possible exponent p (starting from 3 up to log_2(n)), we can compute if there exists a k such that x = n*(k-1)+1 = k^p.\n\nSo for each p from 3 to max_p (like 60), we can try to find a k such that k^p = n*(k-1)+1.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can rearrange the equation:\n\nk^p - n*k + (n-1) =0.\n\nThis is a nonlinear equation, but for a given p, perhaps we can find integer solutions for k.\n\nAlternatively, for each p, compute k such that k^p ≈ n.\n\nWait, for each p, compute k as the integer part of n^(1/p). Then check nearby values to see if any satisfy the equation.\n\nFor example, for p=3, compute cube root of n, then check k = floor(n^(1/3)) -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, etc., to see if any satisfies k^3 = n*(k-1)+1.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, the maximum p is around 60.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n < 3. Since the minimal snowflake has 1 +k +k², which is at least 1+2+4=7, so for n <7, output NO.\n\nWait, wait, wait: for k=2, minimal sum is 1+2+4=7. So n must be at least 7.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial step is adding k nodes, which requires k>1. So for k=2, minimal sum is 7.\n\nSo for n<7, the answer is NO.\n\nSo for n=1,2,3,4,5,6 → output NO.\n\nThen, for n >=7:\n\nCheck for p from 3 up to log_2(n) (since 2^p <=n → p <=60).\n\nFor each p, compute k such that k^p = n*(k-1)+1.\n\nWe can approximate k as roughly the p-th root of n.\n\nSo for each p, we can perform a binary search on k in [2, n], but that's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, for each p, compute the integer k_candidate as the floor of (n)^(1/p), and check k_candidate-1, k_candidate, k_candidate+1.\n\nBecause for large p, the function is increasing, so the solution for k is unique if it exists.\n\nSo for each p from 3 to 60:\n\nCompute low and high as possible k candidates.\n\nCompute k_candidate = int(n^(1/p)).\n\nCheck k_candidate-1, k_candidate, k_candidate+1.\n\nFor each of these k, compute x = n*(k-1)+1.\n\nCheck if x is equal to k^p.\n\nIf yes, then check if p >=3.\n\nIf any such k and p exist, output YES.\n\nOtherwise, after checking all p, output NO.\n\nAdditionally, we need to handle cases where k is 1, but the problem states k>1, so no.\n\nSo for each test case:\n\n- If n < 7 → output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nLoop p from 3 to 60:\n\n   compute k_candidate as the integer part of (x)^(1/p), where x is n*(k-1)+1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a given p, we have x = k^p.\n\nSo for each p, we can compute k as the integer near (x)^(1/p) = k.\n\nWait, but x is n*(k-1)+1. Hmm, this seems circular.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the equation for a fixed p:\n\nWe have x = k^p.\n\nBut x is also equal to n*(k-1) +1.\n\nSo x = n(k-1) +1 → x = nk -n +1 → x = nk - (n-1).\n\nBut x is k^p.\n\nSo substituting: k^p = nk - (n-1).\n\nRearranged: k^p -n k + (n-1) =0.\n\nThis is a polynomial equation in k, but it's hard to solve for arbitrary p.\n\nAn alternative approach is to fix p and find k such that k^p is approximately equal to n*k.\n\nBut for each p, the possible k is roughly around (n/k)^{1/(p-1)}}, which might not help directly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each p, we can compute k as the floor of (n)^(1/p). Then, we can check the small variations around that value.\n\nWait, for example, for p=3, n=9:\n\nWe have 9 = (k^3 -1)/(k-1) → which is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, no: 1 +k +k² is the sum for m=2, which is p=3.\n\nWait, 1 +2 +4=7, 1+3+9=13, etc.\n\nWait, for n=9, let's see:\n\nLooking for p=3:\n\nWe need k^3 = 9*(k-1)+1.\n\nSo 9k-9 +1 =k^3 → 9k-8 =k^3.\n\nTesting k=2: 18-8=10 → 2^3=8 → 10 !=8.\n\nk=3: 27-8=19 → 27=19? No.\n\nk=1: 9*0 +1=1 → 1^3=1 → yes, but k must be >1.\n\nSo no solution for p=3.\n\nWhat about p=4:\n\nk^4 =9*(k-1)+1 → 9k-8 =k^4.\n\nTesting k=2: 18-8=10 → 16 ≠10.\n\nk=3: 27-8=19 → 81≠19.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, but n=9 is in the sample input and the output is 'NO'.\n\nWhich aligns with our approach.\n\nAnother example: n=6.\n\nWe know the sample output is 'NO' for n=6.\n\nBecause 6 can't be written as 1 +k +k² for any k>1.\n\nLet me check for p=3:\n\nEquation: k^3 =6(k-1)+1 →k^3=6k-5.\n\nTry k=2: 8=12-5=7→ no.\n\nk=1: 1=6-5=1 → yes, but k>1.\n\nNo solution.\n\nSimilarly for higher p.\n\nSo n=6 is invalid.\n\nAnother sample input: n=255.\n\nSample output is 'YES'.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nWe can compute for p=4:\n\nCheck if 255 = (k^4 -1)/(k-1) → sum 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo 1 +k +k² +k³ =255.\n\nTrying k=4: 1+4+16+64=85 <255.\n\nk=5: 1+5+25+125=156 <255.\n\nk=6: 1+6+36+216=259>255.\n\nHmm, no.\n\nWait, perhaps for a higher p.\n\nWait, 255 is 256-1, which is 2^8-1. So for p=8, and k=2.\n\nWait, 2^8=256.\n\nSo for p=8, x=2^8=256.\n\nThen, x = n*(k-1) +1 → 256 =255*(2-1)+1 →256=255+1=256. Yes.\n\nSo for p=8, k=2.\n\nSo n=255 = (2^8-1)/(2-1) = 255/1=255.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo in this case, the function returns 'YES'.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n >=7:\n\nFor p from 3 to 60:\n\n   Compute k such that k^p = n*(k-1) +1.\n\n   To find k, compute the approximate value as (n)^(1/p), and check a few integers around it.\n\nSo for each p, we'll try k in the range of floor((n)^(1/p) -2) to ceil((n)^(1/p)+2), and see if any of them satisfies the equation.\n\nIf any such k exists for any p >=3, then output 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this efficiently.\n\nIn Python, for each test case:\n\nIf n <7: output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nFor p in 3 to 60:\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = n\n\n   while low <=high:\n\n      mid = (low + high)//2\n\n      Compute x = mid^p.\n\n      If x ==n*(mid-1)+1 → found.\n\n      Else if x < n*(mid-1)+1 → mid is too small.\n\n      Else → mid is too big.\n\nBut wait, binary search may not work because the function isn't strictly increasing for all p. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since p is small (up to 60), for each p, compute an approximate k and then check nearby values.\n\nSo for each p, compute k_candidate = round( (n)^(1/p) )\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, computing k_candidate as the integer part of n^(1/p) is needed.\n\nImplementing this in code:\n\nWe can use binary search to compute the integer k_candidate for each p.\n\nBut perhaps using the math.pow function and taking the integer part.\n\nWait, but for very large p, like 60, the k_candidate will be 2 or 1.\n\nWait, for p=60, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is n's maximum.\n\nSo for p=60, k can be 2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nif n <7 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\nfor p in 3 to 60:\n\n   compute k_min = 2.\n\n   compute k_max = n.\n\n   while k_min <=k_max:\n\n       mid = (k_min +k_max) //2\n\n       compute x = mid**p\n\n       compute target =n*(mid-1) +1\n\n       if x == target → return YES.\n\n       elif x < target → need bigger k.\n\n       else → need smaller k.\n\n   Also, after the loop, check mid and mid±1 in case the binary search missed.\n\nWait, perhaps binary search is not the best approach here, because for each p, it's O(log n) time, which for t=1e4 and p=60, gives 6e5 operations, manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each p, compute the approximate k via the p-th root of (n*(k-1) +1), but perhaps it's easier to binary search.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to compute k such that k^p is as close as possible to (n*(k-1)+1). So for each p, we can compute k as the integer closest to (n)^(1/p), and then check a few values around it.\n\nSo for each p:\n\n   k_low = 2\n\n   k_high = n\n\n   k_candidate = int( (n) ** (1/p) )\n\n   for k in [k_candidate-2, k_candidate-1, k_candidate, k_candidate+1, k_candidate+2]:\n\n       if k <2 → skip.\n\n       compute target =n*(k-1)+1.\n\n       if k^p == target → return YES.\n\nSo this approach reduces the number of computations per p, as we're only checking a few k's per p.\n\nThis is probably more efficient.\n\nSo in code:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n <7: print NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      for p in 3 to 60:\n\n          k = int( (n) ** (1/p) )\n\n          for delta in [-2,-1,0,1,2]:\n\n              candidate_k =k +delta\n\n              if candidate_k <2: continue.\n\n              target = n*(candidate_k-1)+1\n\n              # compute candidate_k^p\n\n              computed = candidate_k **p\n\n              if computed == target:\n\n                  print YES and proceed to next test case.\n\n      after all p, print NO.\n\nBut wait, for very large p, say p=60, and n=1e18:\n\nk_candidate is 2, since 2^60 is ~1e18.\n\nSo testing k=2 is sufficient.\n\nWait, but for p=60 and k=2:\n\ntarget =n*(2-1)+1=1e18 +1.\n\ncomputed =2^60=1,152,921,504,606,846,976.\n\nWhich is larger than 1e18+1.\n\nSo no match.\n\nBut in code, for each candidate, compute target and see if it equals k^p.\n\nBut in Python, calculating k^p for k=1e9 and p=60 is computationally expensive, but for p up to 60, and k up to 1e9, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but for k=1e9 and p=60, k^p is way beyond 1e18. So in practice, for p=60, the k_candidate is likely small.\n\nSo in code, the steps are:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\n   if n <7 → output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      for p in 3 to 60:\n\n          k_candidate = round( (n) ** (1/p) )\n\n          for delta in (-2,-1,0,1,2):\n\n              k = k_candidate + delta\n\n              if k <2 → skip.\n\n              target =n*(k-1)+1.\n\n              computed =k **p\n\n              if computed == target → output YES and break all loops.\n\n      if none found → output NO.\n\nBut wait, the exponentiation in Python can be done with pow, but for large exponents, it's expensive.\n\nWait, but for each p, the k_candidate is such that k_candidate^p is approximately n. So for p=60, k_candidate is around 2.\n\nSo for each p, the maximum k is 2+2=4, so 4^60 is way larger than 1e18.\n\nThus, even for p=60, the computation is manageable.\n\nWait, but wait: for k=2 and p=60, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is okay for Python to compute.\n\nSo in code, for each p, compute k_candidate as the integer part of n^(1/p), then check k_candidate-2, -1, 0, +1, +2.\n\nBut wait, perhaps a better way is to compute k_candidate as the integer part of (n)^(1/p), and then check in a range from k_candidate -2 to k_candidate +2, ensuring k>=2.\n\nWait, but sometimes the exact k is not in that range. For example, suppose for p=3, n=28.\n\nn=28.\n\nWe need to find k and p where k^p =28*(k-1)+1.\n\nLet me compute for p=3:\n\nequation: k^3=28(k-1)+1 → k^3=28k-27.\n\nWe can try k=3: 27=84-27=57 → no.\n\nk=4:64=112-27=85 → no.\n\nk=2:8=28-27=1 → no.\n\nk=1:1=28*0 +1 → yes, but k>1.\n\nNo solution for p=3.\n\nWhat about p=4:\n\nequation: k^4=28(k-1)+1 →k^4=28k-27.\n\nk=2:16=56-27=29 → no.\n\nk=3:81=84-27=57 → no.\n\nk=4:256=112-27=85 → no.\n\nNo solution.\n\nWait, but 28 is 1+3+24=28? No, 1+3+24=28, but 3 is k, and the next layer is 3²=9 nodes, sum is 1+3+9=13, not 28.\n\nHmm, maybe n=28 is a 'NO' case.\n\nBut regardless, the point is that for some p, the k may not be in the small delta range.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is not sufficient.\n\nWait, but for larger p, the required k is small, so the delta approach covers it.\n\nFor example, for p=60 and n=1e18, the k is 2, so checking 0,1,2,3,4 is sufficient.\n\nBut for p=3 and n= (1e9)^(1/3)=1e3, so checking 999,1000,1001,1002,1003 is manageable.\n\nSo for each p, the code checks a few candidates around the approximate k_candidate.\n\nThus, the code should handle most cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's test some examples.\n\nSample Input 1: n=6 → less than 7 → output 'NO'.\n\nSample Input 2: n=13 → check if 13 can be written as 1 +k +k².\n\n1 +k +k²=13 →k² +k -12=0 →k=3 (since 3²+3=12, 1+12=13). So yes, k=3, p=3.\n\nSo in code, for p=3, k_candidate is cube root of 13, which is approx 2.35. So the code checks k=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nk=3: 3^3=27. target=13*(3-1)+1=26+1=27. Yes, so output 'YES'.\n\nSample Input 3: n=15.\n\nCheck for p=3: k_candidate is cube root of 15 ~2.47. Check k=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nk=2: 8 → target=15*(1)+1=16 → 8 !=16.\n\nk=3:27 → target=15*2+1=31 →27 !=31.\n\nk=4:64 → target=15*3+1=46 → no.\n\nk=5:125 → target=15*4+1=61 → no.\n\np=4: k_candidate is 15^(1/4) ~1.95 → check k=1,2,3.\n\nk=2: 16 → target=15*1+1=16 → 16=16. Yes. So p=4, k=2.\n\nThus, 15 is a valid case.\n\nWait, but 15 is 1 +2 +4 +8 → sum is 1+2+4+8=15.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the code should find it.\n\nSo in code, for p=4, k=2 is considered.\n\nAnother sample input: n=255.\n\nAs discussed earlier, for p=8, k=2.\n\nSo in code, for p=8, k_candidate is (255)^(1/8) ~2. So check k=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nk=2: 2^8=256. target=255*(1) +1=256. So yes.\n\nThus, code returns 'YES'.\n\nAnother sample input: n=10101.\n\nSample output is 'NO'.\n\nWe can check.\n\nBut perhaps in code, for various p, it won't find any.\n\nAnother sample input: n=1e18.\n\nWhat is 1e18?\n\nCheck for p=60: k=2.\n\ntarget=1e18*(2-1)+1=1e18+1.\n\nk^p=2^60=1,152,921,504,606,846,976.\n\nWhich is larger than 1e18+1.\n\nNo match.\n\nWhat about p=59: 2^59 is about 5.76e17.\n\ntarget=1e18*(2-1)+1=1e18+1.\n\n5.76e17 <1e18+1 → no.\n\np=60: 2^60 is 1.15e18 >1e18+1 → no.\n\nThus, no solution.\n\nThus, output 'NO'.\n\nSo the code works for all samples.\n\nNow, considering the code:\n\nIn Python, for each test case, loop p from 3 to 60.\n\nFor each p:\n\n   k_candidate = int( (n) ** (1/p) )\n\n   for delta in [-2,-1,0,1,2]:\n\n       k =k_candidate +delta\n\n       if k <2 → continue.\n\n       compute target =n*(k-1)+1.\n\n       compute computed =k **p.\n\n       if computed == target → return YES.\n\nThus, the code needs to compute for each p, and each delta.\n\nBut in Python, exponentiation is manageable.\n\nBut wait, for very large exponents, like p=60, computing k^p could take time, but since k is small (like 2), it's manageable.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut wait, how to compute the p-th root accurately.\n\nIn Python, using n ** (1/p) is not precise due to floating-point inaccuracies.\n\nFor example, for n=255 and p=8, (255) ** (1/8) is approximately 2.000 something.\n\nBut when cast to int, it becomes 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut for cases where the exact k is just above the integer, like n= (3^4) =81.\n\n(81) ** (1/4)=3 → correct.\n\nBut what about n=80:\n\n(80)^(1/4) is about 2.99 → int is 2.\n\nBut 2^4=16, and 80*(2-1)+1=81. 16 !=81 → no.\n\nBut 3^4=81, and 80*(3-1)+1=81*2 +1=163. 81 !=163.\n\nThus, no.\n\nBut for n=82: 82*(3-1)+1= 83 →3^4=81<83 → no.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nBut what about when the k_candidate is wrong due to floating-point imprecision.\n\nLike, for example, n= (k^p) -1, and k is large.\n\nWait, perhaps for n= (k^p) -1, where k is a large number, the p-th root may be off by one.\n\nThus, in code, perhaps it's better to compute k_candidate as the integer part, and then also check k_candidate +1.\n\nBut perhaps, for the code, the best way is to compute k_candidate as the integer part of (n) ** (1/p), and then check in a window around it.\n\nBut in any case, for code, let's proceed as:\n\nFor each p from 3 to 60:\n\n   compute k_candidate as int( (n) ** (1/p) )\n\n   for delta in (-2,-1,0,1,2):\n\n       k =k_candidate +delta\n\n       if k <2 → continue.\n\n       target =n*(k-1)+1.\n\n       computed =k**p.\n\n       if computed == target → return YES.\n\nThus, the code.\n\nBut wait, how to compute (n) ** (1/p) accurately?\n\nIn Python, using the ** operator with floats may lose precision, especially for very large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using logarithms.\n\nBut even then, for very large n, taking the p-th root accurately is tricky.\n\nAnother approach is to perform a binary search for k, within a certain range.\n\nBut that's more code.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, the initial approach is sufficient.\n\nTesting for the sample inputs.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nBut let's think about possible optimizations.\n\nWait, for each p, the minimal k is 2.\n\nThe maximum possible k is such that k^p <=n*(k-1)+1.\n\nBut for a given p, the maximum possible k is around (n)^(1/p) +1.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, writing the code:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\n   if n <7 → print NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      for p in range(3, 61):\n\n          #

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with `n` vertices can exist. The snowflake graph is defined in a specific way, starting with one vertex and expanding by adding layers of vertices according to certain rules. The goal is to check if such a graph can be constructed for the given number of vertices `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding `k` new vertices at each step. Each new vertex added must also add `k` new vertices in subsequent steps. The minimal structure has 3 layers (root, first layer, second layer), resulting in `1 + k + k^2` vertices.\n\n2. **Geometric Series Insight**: The total number of vertices in the snowflake graph can be represented as a geometric series sum. For a given `n`, we need to check if it can be expressed as `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)` for some `k > 1` and `m >= 2`.\n\n3. **Efficient Checking**: For each possible exponent `p` from 3 to 60, compute if there exists an integer `k` such that `k^p` equals `n * (k - 1) + 1`. This approach leverages the fact that for large values of `n`, the possible values of `k` are relatively small.\n\n4. **Binary Search**: For each exponent `p`, use binary search to efficiently find the integer `k` that satisfies the equation. This avoids the computational overhead of checking all possible values directly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_p = 60\n    for p in range(3, max_p + 1):\n        left = 2\n        right = n\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            try:\n                x = mid ** p\n            except OverflowError:\n                x = float('inf')\n            target = n * (mid - 1) + 1\n            if x == target:\n                return True\n            elif x < target:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n\nt = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    if is_snowflake(n):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple test cases.\n- **Initial Check**: For `n` less than 7, immediately returns \"NO\" as such values cannot form a valid snowflake graph.\n- **Loop Over Exponents**: For each possible exponent `p` from 3 to 60, perform a binary search to find a suitable `k`.\n- **Binary Search**: For each `p`, the binary search checks if there exists an integer `k` such that `k^p` equals `n * (k - 1) + 1`.\n- **Result Check**: If any valid `k` is found for any `p`, returns \"YES\"; otherwise, returns \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each possible configuration using mathematical properties and binary search, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal for large values of `n`.",
