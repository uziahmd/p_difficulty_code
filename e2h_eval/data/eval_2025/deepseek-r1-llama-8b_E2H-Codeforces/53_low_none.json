It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I'm given a string, and I need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, the input is a single string, which can be up to 100 characters long. My goal is to check all possible substrings of the string, starting from the longest possible down to the shortest, and see if any of them appear more than once. Once I find the maximum length that satisfies this condition, I return it.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently check for substrings? Since the string isn't too long, maybe a brute-force approach is acceptable here. Because 100 characters aren't that big, even nested loops might work.\n\nLet's break it down. For each possible length L, starting from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1, because a substring can't be longer than the entire string minus one character) down to 1, I check all substrings of length L. If there are at least two identical substrings, then L is the answer. So I should return the first L where this condition is true.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the string is \"ababa\", the substrings of length 3 are \"aba\" (positions 0-2), \"bab\" (1-3), and \"aba\" (2-4). So two \"aba\"s. So the maximum is 3.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Iterate L from the maximum possible down to 1.\n2. For each L, collect all substrings of length L.\n3. Check if any substring appears at least twice.\n   - How to do this? Maybe using a set to track seen substrings. For each substring, if it's already in the set, return L as the answer.\n   - Or, for each substring, compare it with all previously collected ones.\n4. As soon as we find an L where a duplicate substring exists, return L.\n\nWait, but for efficiency, perhaps checking from largest L first is better because once we find the maximum possible, we can stop immediately.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n    Create a dictionary or a set to keep track of substrings of length L.\n    For each starting index i from 0 to len(s)-L:\n        substring = s[i:i+L]\n        if substring is in the set:\n            return L\n        else:\n            add substring to the set\n    After checking all, if no duplicates found, continue to L-1.\n\nIf after checking all Ls down to 1, none found, then return 0? Wait, no. Because the problem says the string is non-empty. But wait, what if the string has only one unique substring? Like \"aaa\". Then the maximum is 2, because the substring \"aa\" appears twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2).\n\nWait, no. Let me think. For \"aaa\", the substrings of length 2 are \"aa\" (0-1), \"aa\" (1-2). So yes, they appear twice. So the maximum is 2. So for L=2, it will find a duplicate.\n\nWait, but for the string \"a\", the maximum possible is zero because it's only one character, but according to the sample input, when the string is 'abcd', the output is 0. Because all substrings are unique.\n\nSo, in our code, after trying all L from len(s)-1 down to 1, if none have duplicates, then the answer is 0.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    create a set.\n    for i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n        sub = s[i:i+L]\n        if sub in set:\n            return L\n        else:\n            add to set\nif nothing found, return 0\n\nWait, but in the sample input ['zzz'], the output is 2. So for a string of length 3, the maximum L is 2. Because the substrings are 'zz' (0-1), 'zz' (1-2). So both are same, so L=2 is the answer.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababa' is length 5. So L starts at 4, then 3, etc. For L=3, there are three substrings: aba, bab, aba. So the second aba is a duplicate, so return 3.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string. Then, for each possible L starting from len(s)-1 down to 1, check all substrings of length L.\n\nImplementing this:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_length = 0\nn = len",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking each possible substring length starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we collect all substrings and check if any of them appear more than once. The first length where this condition is met will be our answer.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the longest possible substring length (which is one less than the length of the string) and go down to 1.\n2. **Collect Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: Use a set to keep track of seen substrings. If a substring is found in the set, it means it has appeared before, so return the current length as the result.\n4. **Return Result**: If no duplicate substrings are found for any length, return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the longest possible substring efficiently by leveraging the fact that we start from the longest possible substrings and move towards shorter ones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Over Lengths**: We loop from the maximum possible substring length down to 1.\n- **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n- **Check for Duplicates**: Use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is found in the set, print the current length and exit.\n- **Handle No Duplicates**: If no duplicates are found for any length, print 0.\n\nThis solution efficiently checks each possible substring length and ensures that the longest valid substring is found quickly.",
