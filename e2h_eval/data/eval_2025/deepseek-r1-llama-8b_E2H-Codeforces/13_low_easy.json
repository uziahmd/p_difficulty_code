For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given triad (a set of three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The definition of major and minor chords is based on the distances between the notes in a certain order.\n\nHmm, the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the musical notes go C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, and then back to C. But the problem says after H comes C again. Oh wait, maybe H is the same as B? Because in some notations, H is used for B. So perhaps the sequence given is a typo, but according to the problem statement, the correct order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, and then repeats.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem lists them as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes in total. So each consecutive pair is one semitone apart. So from C to C# is 1 semitone, etc.\n\nSo the distance is measured along the scale, and when moving from a higher note to a lower one, the distance wraps around. For example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones, not 4. Because from E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, ..., H (which is B?) to C is 12 - 1 = 11 semitones? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the uppermost. So for two notes X and Y, the distance is the number of semitones when you go up from X to Y. So if X is C and Y is E, that's 4 semitones. If Y is C and X is E, then the distance is 8 semitones because from E to C is 8 steps forward (since the scale loops).\n\nWait, but in the example given, the chord C E G is major because C to E is 4, E to G is 3. So the triad is ordered such that the first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next is 3, making 7 semitones total.\n\nFor a minor triad, the order must have the first two notes 3 apart, and the next two 4 apart.\n\nSo the task is: given three notes, check all possible permutations of these three notes, and see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nBecause the triad is an unordered set, so we need to consider all possible orderings of the three notes and check if any of them forms a major or minor chord.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the three notes as input.\n2. For each permutation of the three notes, compute the semitone distances between consecutive notes in that permutation.\n3. Check if any permutation has distances [4,3], which would make it a major chord.\n4. Also check if any permutation has distances [3,4], which would make it a minor chord.\n5. If any permutation is major, output 'major'. If any permutation is minor, output 'minor'. Otherwise, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Vasya will always get an unambiguous answer, meaning that the input cannot be both major and minor. So once a permutation is found to be major or minor, we can stop checking further permutations.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model the notes and their ordering correctly.\n\nFirst, let's model the order of the notes as per the problem statement. So the list is:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but wait. In music theory, H isn't a standard note. Maybe the problem uses H as B? Or perhaps it's a typo, and the correct sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, and then C again. But according to the problem statement, the given order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, and then repeats. So H is the 12th note.\n\nSo the index of each note in this list is its position. So the semitone distance between note i and note j is (j - i) mod 12, but since we're considering the distance from lower to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The problem is based on the distances between consecutive notes in the musical scale, which are measured in semitones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Note Order**: The notes are given in a specific order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. This sequence repeats cyclically.\n2. **Calculate Semitone Distances**: For any permutation of the three notes, calculate the distances between consecutive notes. The distance is the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher note, wrapping around if necessary.\n3. **Check for Major and Minor Triads**:\n   - A major triad has distances of 4 and 3 semitones between the first and second, and second and third notes respectively.\n   - A minor triad has distances of 3 and 4 semitones between the first and second, and second and third notes respectively.\n4. **Determine the Result**: Check all permutations of the three notes to see if they form a major or minor triad. If a permutation matches either, return the corresponding result. If none match, return 'strange'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\ndef get_semitone_distance(note1, note2):\n    idx1 = notes_order.index(note1)\n    idx2 = notes_order.index(note2)\n    return (idx2 - idx1) % 12\n\ndef is_major(triad):\n    for perm in permutations(triad):\n        d1 = get_semitone_distance(perm[0], perm[1])\n        d2 = get_semitone_distance(perm[1], perm[2])\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_minor(triad):\n    for perm in permutations(triad):\n        d1 = get_semitone_distance(perm[0], perm[1])\n        d2 = get_semitone_distance(perm[1], perm[2])\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ntriad = input().split()\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nif len(triad) != 3:\n    print(\"strange\")\nelse:\n    if is_major(triad):\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor(triad):\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three space-separated notes.\n2. **Semitone Distance Calculation**: The function `get_semitone_distance` computes the distance between two notes using their indices in the predefined list.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using permutations from the `itertools` module, we check each possible ordering of the three notes.\n4. **Major and Minor Checks**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` iterate through permutations to determine if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, the program prints 'major', 'minor', or 'strange' as appropriate.",
