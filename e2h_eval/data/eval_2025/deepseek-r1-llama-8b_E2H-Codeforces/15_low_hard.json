They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine all the winning integers x for a given tournament setup. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the tournament is a knockout style with 2^n teams. Each phase of the tournament has a certain number of games, and the outcome of each game depends on the character in the string s. For each phase i, if s[i] is '0', then the lower-skilled team wins each match. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins each match.\n\nThe task is to find all integers x such that there exists a permutation p of the numbers 1 to 2^n, where the team with skill x wins the entire tournament.\n\nHmm. So, the first thing I need to model is how the tournament progresses based on the string s and the permutation p.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament:\n\n- The tournament is divided into n phases. Phase 1 has 2^(n-1) games, and so on until phase n, which has a single game.\n- In each phase i, the games are structured in a way that the winners from the previous phase face off. For example, in phase 1, the matches are 1v2, 3v4, etc. Then, in phase 2, the winners of 1v2 play against the winners of 3v4, and so on.\n\nWait, no, maybe not exactly. Let's see: the initial phase (phase 1) splits the 2^n teams into pairs, each pair plays. So, for phase i=1, it's 2^(n-1) games, each between consecutive teams. After that, the next phase (i=2) has 2^(n-2) games, where each game is between the winners of two adjacent groups from phase 1.\n\nWait, perhaps each phase i corresponds to grouping the remaining teams into blocks of size 2^i, and each block's winner moves on to the next phase. Or maybe the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each phase i is the (i)th round, and the number of games in phase i is 2^{n-i}. Because for n=3, the total games are 7 (2^3 -1). So phase 1 has 4 games (2^(3-1)), phase 2 has 2 games (2^(3-2)), phase 3 has 1 game.\n\nSo for each phase i, the number of games is 2^{n - i}.\n\nAnd for each phase i, the games are determined by the current arrangement of the teams. How? Well, in phase 1, the teams are paired as 1v2, 3v4, etc. In phase 2, the winners of 1v2 and 3v4 form a new group, and the winners of 5v6 and 7v8 form another group. Then, those two groups play against each other, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe phase i has the teams grouped into blocks of size 2^{n-i+1}, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps each phase i corresponds to grouping the teams into 2^{n-i} games, each of which is a match between two teams from the same group of the previous phase.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the tournament as a binary tree. Each game is a node, and the leaves are the initial matches. The root is the final game. Each internal node represents a match between the winners of its two children.\n\nBut considering the phase-wise structure, each phase determines the way the next phase is formed. So, for phase i, the structure of the games is determined by the string s[i], which dictates whether the higher or lower skill wins.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to model the tournament as a series of rounds, and for each round, determine which teams can reach the next round based on their skill and the current phase's rule (s[i]).\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother thought: since the permutation p defines the skill levels, we can model the possible winners at each phase.\n\nFor example, in phase 1, each match is between two consecutive teams (1&2, 3&4, etc.). The winner of each match proceeds to phase 2. The result of each match is determined by s[0] (since phase i=1 corresponds to index 0 in the string).\n\nWait, wait! Wait, the string s is of length n, and the phases are 1-based or 0-based? Looking back at the problem statement: \"s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase...\" So phase indices start at 1. Wait, no, because in the input description, it says the string is of length n, and the i-th phase is the one with 2^{n-i} games. So phase 1 has",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the winning integers for a given tournament setup. The tournament is structured in phases where each phase has a specific rule that dictates which team wins each match. The goal is to identify all possible integers x such that there exists a permutation of skill levels where the team with skill x can win the entire tournament.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of `n` phases, each with a specific number of games. Each phase `i` has `2^(n-i)` games. The outcome of each game in a phase depends on whether the higher-skilled team ('1') or lower-skilled team ('0') wins.\n2. **Permutation and Skill Levels**: We need to consider all possible permutations of skill levels to determine if a given integer x can be the winner of the tournament under the given rules.\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Use a DP array to keep track of the minimum and maximum possible ranks of the winner at each phase. This helps in determining the feasible winners at each subsequent phase based on the current phase's results.\n4. **Backtracking and Pruning**: For each phase, backtrack through possible winners and prune impossible paths to efficiently explore all valid permutations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Precompute for each phase the possible groupings\n    # Each phase i corresponds to the i-th character in s, 0-based\n    # The number of groups in phase i is 2^(n - i)\n    # For example, phase 0 (i=0) has 2^3 = 8 groups (if n=3), each group being two teams\n    \n    # Let's represent the tournament as a list of rounds, each round having certain constraints\n    # We'll process each round from 0 to n-1\n    \n    # For each round, we'll compute the possible winners and their possible ranks\n    # We'll use a list of tuples (min_rank, max_rank) representing the possible range of ranks for the winner of this round\n    # Initially, for the first round (phase 0), each group is two consecutive teams, so the possible winners are either the lower (if s[0] is '0') or higher (if s[0] is '1')\n    \n    # We'll model this with a dynamic programming approach, tracking the possible min and max ranks at each step\n    \n    dp = []\n    current_min = current_max = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        c = s[i]\n        if i == 0:\n            if c == '0':\n                # Lower skill wins; so in each pair, the lower one advances\n                # So the possible winners are the even-numbered teams (since they are the smaller ones in each pair)\n                new_min = 2\n                new_max = 2 * (2**((n-1)-i)) // 2 * 2  # Wait, perhaps it's better to think differently\n                # Wait, no: for phase 0, each group is two teams, so possible winners are the lower (if c=='0') or higher (c=='1')\n                # So for phase 0, the possible winners are the first or second in each pair\n                # So for each group of two, the possible winner is either the first or the second, depending on c\n                # So after phase 0, the possible winners are 2^(n - 0 -1) teams, each being the winners of their respective group\n                # So the min_rank and max_rank for phase 0's winners would be 2 to 2^(n-1) if c is '0' (since lower skills win)\n                # Or 1 to 2^(n-1) if c is '1' (higher skills win)\n                \n                if c == '0':\n                    new_min = 2\n                    new_max = 2**(n-1)\n                else:\n                    new_min = 1\n                    new_max = 2**(n-1)\n                dp.append( (new_min, new_max) )\n            else:\n                # c == '1', higher skill wins\n                new_min = 1\n                new_max = 2**(n-1)\n                dp.append( (new_min, new_max) )\n        else:\n            # For phase i >=1, the previous phase's winners form groups of size 2^(n - (i-1) -1) ?\n            # Maybe not.

So, possible winners are 2,4,6,8.\n                # So, for phase 0, each leaf node's min and max are 2,2; 4,4; 6,6; 8,8.\n            \n            # Phase 1: rule '0' (s[1]='0')\n                # Node 8 (combines 2 and 4): rule '0' → new min = min(2,4)=2, new max = max(2,4)=4.\n                # Node 9 (combines 6 and 8): rule '0' → new min = 6, new max =8.\n                # So, possible winners are 2 and 6.\n                # But according to the rule, the winners are the min of each pair, so 2 and 6.\n            \n            # Phase 2: rule '1' (s[2]='1')\n                # Node 14 (combines 2 and 6): rule '1' → new min = max(2,6)=6, new max = min(2,6)=2. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n                # Alternatively, perhaps the new min is the max of left and right min, and the new max is the min of left and right max.\n                # So, for node 14: left min=2, left max=4 (from node 8?), right min=6, right max=8 (from node 9?).\n                # Wait, no. Node 8's possible winners are 2 and 4, so min=2, max=4.\n                # Node 9's possible winners are 6 and 8, so min=6, max=8.\n                # So, for node 14 (rule '1'):\n                    # new_min = max(left min, right min) = max(2,6)=6\n                    # new_max = min(left max, right max) = min(4,8)=4\n                    # So, new_min=6, new_max=4.

Therefore, I'm stuck and unable to find an efficient solution within the time constraints.\n\nThe assistant acknowledges the complexity of the problem and the difficulty in finding an efficient solution, especially considering the constraints. Despite several attempts to model the tournament structure and phase transitions, the assistant couldn't devise a correct approach that handles all cases efficiently. The problem remains unsolved for now.",
