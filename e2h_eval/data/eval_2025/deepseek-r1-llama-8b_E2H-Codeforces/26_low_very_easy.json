Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on their sides. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides x, y, z. The conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, it's required that x, y, z form a non-degenerate triangle, which means x + y > z must hold because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since z is the largest here (because C ≤ z ≤ D and C ≥ B), the condition simplifies to x + y > z.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Because x can be up to B, y can be up to C, but z starts at C and goes up to D. So in all cases, z is at least as big as y and x. So for the triangle inequality, the only necessary condition is x + y > z. Because if z is larger than or equal to y, then x + z will definitely be larger than y, and y + z is larger than x. So the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo, the approach is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) where x is between A and B, y is between B and C, z is between C and D, and x + y > z.\n\nBut considering the ranges, especially when A, B, C, D are up to 5e5, we need an efficient way to compute this without iterating through all possibilities, which would be O(N^3) and way too slow.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's note that for each z, we can determine how many (x, y) pairs satisfy x + y > z, with x in [A, B], y in [B, C].\n\nSo maybe for each possible z, calculate the number of valid (x, y) pairs, and sum over all z in [C, D].\n\nThat sounds manageable, but z can go up to 5e5, so we need an O(1) way to compute for each z the number of valid pairs.\n\nLet's formalize:\n\nFor a fixed z, what is the number of x in [A, B], y in [B, C] such that x + y > z?\n\nWe can rephrase this as y > z - x.\n\nBut since y must also be at least B, perhaps there's a way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the minimal and maximal possible values of x and y.\n\nThe minimal x is A, and minimal y is B. So the minimal x + y is A + B.\n\nSimilarly, the maximal x is B, and maximal y is C. So the maximal x + y is B + C.\n\nFor a given z, the condition x + y > z can be rewritten as y > z - x.\n\nBut since x can vary from A to B, for each x, the required y must be > (z - x). But y has its own constraints: y >= B, y <= C.\n\nSo for each x, the lower bound on y is max(B, z - x + 1), and the upper bound is C. So the number of y's for a particular x is max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nWait, no. Because y has to be an integer. So for a particular x, the minimum y is max(B, (z - x) + 1). And the maximum y is C. So if the minimum is less than or equal to the maximum, then the count is (C - min_y + 1), else zero.\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nBut since x varies from A to B, we can model this as summing over x from A to B of max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nThis seems manageable, but doing this for every z from C to D could be time-consuming if not optimized.\n\nWait, but z ranges up to 5e5, and for each z, x ranges up to 5e5 as well. So doing this naively would be O(D * (B - A + 1)), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the possible ranges of z.\n\nFor a given z, the x can be in [A, B], and for each x, the required y is in [max(B, z - x + 1), C]. So for each x, the lower limit for y is either B or (z",
