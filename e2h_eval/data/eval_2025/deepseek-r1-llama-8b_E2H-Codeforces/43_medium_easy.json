He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, which must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C added them. The count can be equal to both, but that's also allowed.\n\nThe string I'm given must satisfy these conditions. So, I need to verify:\n\n1. The string must consist of a block of 'a's followed by a block of 'b's followed by a block of 'c's. So, the order is strictly a's first, then b's, then c's. If any other order is present, it's invalid.\n\n2. Let's denote:\n   - count_a = number of 'a's\n   - count_b = number of 'b's\n   - count_c = number of 'c's\n\nThen, after B appends his 'b's, the string has count_a 'a's and count_b 'b's. So when C appends 'c's, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nAdditionally, since C appends 'c's, the entire string must start with a's, then b's, then c's without any interleaving. So, the string should be in the form a^+ b^+ c^+.\n\nSo, the steps to solve this problem are:\n\nFirst, check the structure of the string. It should be all a's, followed by all b's, followed by all c's. So, for example, the string cannot have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b'.\n\nHow to check this? We can iterate through the string and make sure that once we switch from 'a' to 'b' or 'b' to 'c', we don't switch back.\n\nOnce the structure is confirmed, we can compute the counts.\n\nThen, check if count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where C's addition makes count_c equal to either? Because C adds the 'c's after seeing the current counts. So, for example, if A's string is 'aaa', B appends 'bb', so before C adds, count_a=3, count_b=2. Then C adds 3 'c's (equal to count_a) or 2 'c's (equal to count_b), or maybe even 0? Wait no, because the problem says \"appends some number of letters 'c'\". So it's possible that C adds zero 'c's only if the string already ends with 'c's, but according to the note, it's possible that C appends zero 'c's only if the previous string didn't have any 'c's? Or wait, the initial string may have some 'c's?\n\nWait, no. Because the process is: A gives a string of a's, then B appends some b's. So the string after B is a bunch of a's followed by a bunch of b's. So, the string before C appends is a's + b's. So, when C appends, he adds c's, which could be zero? Or is the number of c's required to be non-zero? Let's look at the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" It says \"some number\", which implies zero or more. But in the note, the third example has 'aabc', which is a string like 'a a b c c'? Wait, no, let me check the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input was ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], and the outputs were ['YES', 'NO', 'YES'].\n\nLooking at the third example, 'aabc'—wait, that's 'a a b c c'? No, no. Let's see: 'aabc' is 'aa' followed by 'bc'? That's not correct. Oh, wait, perhaps I misread. Wait, the third example's output is 'YES', but let me think.\n\nWait, the third example's string is 'aabc'—so it's 'a','a','b','c'? So, the structure is a a b c. So, the blocks are a's (count 2), b's (count 1), c's (count 1). So count_c is 1. Now, count_a is 2, count_b is 1. So count_c (1) equals count_b (1), so that's valid.\n\nSo the structure is okay, and count_c matches either a or b.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, the structure must be a's, then b's, then c's, and the count_c must equal either count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check that the string is structured correctly: starts with a's, then b's, then c's, with no interleaving.\n\nIf the structure is incorrect, output NO.\n\n2. Once the structure is correct, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\n3. Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, how to implement step 1.\n\nWe can iterate through the string, keeping track of the current phase. The phases are:\n\n- Phase 0: expecting 'a's.\n- Phase 1: expecting 'b's.\n- Phase 2: expecting 'c's.\n\nOnce a character is found that doesn't match the current phase, we switch to the next phase, provided that we haven't passed that phase before.\n\nFor example, if we encounter a 'b' in phase 0, we switch to phase 1.\n\nIf we encounter a 'c' in phase 0 or 1, it's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if we encounter an 'a' in phase 1 or 2, it's invalid.\n\nMoreover, the phases must be visited in order: 0 → 1 → 2. So, once phase 1 is entered, phase 0 can't come again, and phase 2 can't be entered until phase 1 is done.\n\nSo, let's model this with variables:\n\ncurrent_phase: starts at 0.\n\nfor each char in s:\n\n    if char is 'a':\n        if current_phase == 0:\n            continue\n        else:\n            invalid, break\n    elif char is 'b':\n        if current_phase == 1:\n            continue\n        else:\n            if current_phase == 0:\n                current_phase = 1\n            else:\n                invalid, break\n    elif char is 'c':\n        if current_phase == 2:\n            continue\n        else:\n            if current_phase == 1:\n                current_phase = 2\n            else:\n                invalid, break\n\nAfter processing all characters, if current_phase is not 2, then it's invalid (since C must have appended 'c's, so the string must end with 'c's).\n\nWait, no. Because C appends some 'c's, but it's possible that C appends zero 'c's. Wait, but the problem statement says that after A and B, the string has at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'some' 'c's, which can be zero or more. Wait, no: the problem says, \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\nWait, the way it's written, C must append at least as many as the minimum of a and b? Or is zero allowed?\n\nWait, the problem says \"some number of letters 'c'\", which typically means zero or more. But in the context of the problem, since C is appending 'some', but the original string may already have some 'c's? Wait, no.\n\nWait, the process is: A creates a string of 'a's. Then B appends 'b's, so the string becomes a bunch of a's followed by a bunch of b's. So before C appends, there are no 'c's.\n\nSo, when C appends, he appends 'c's. So, in the resulting string, all the 'c's are at the end, added by C. So, the 'c's in the string are all added by C, and their count is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that the string is built as:\n\nA gives a string S_a of some 'a's.\n\nB appends some 'b's, resulting in S_ab (S_a followed by S_b, where S_b is some 'b's).\n\nC appends some 'c's, which is equal to the count of 'a's or 'b's in S_ab. So, the count of 'c's is either count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, in the final string, the 'c's are all at the end, and their count is exactly equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nTherefore, the 'c's in the string can't be zero, because C appends some (could be zero?) or is it required to append at least one? Wait, the problem says \"some number of letters 'c'\".\n\nIn programming terms, \"some\" can include zero. So, C could append zero 'c's.\n\nWait, but if C appends zero 'c's, then the string remains as S_ab, which is a's followed by b's. So, the structure is a's followed by b's, with no c's.\n\nSo, in that case, the count_c is zero.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial steps are:\n\n\"A ... appends some 'b's, ensuring that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist.\"\n\nThen C appends some 'c's. So, the count_c can be zero.\n\nBut in the problem, the task is to check whether the string could have been produced via this process. So, for the count_c to be zero, it must be equal to either count_a or count_b.\n\nWhich would require that count_a is zero or count_b is zero, but earlier steps ensure that count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nSo, count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\nWhen C appends 'c's, count_c can be zero, but then count_c (zero) must be equal to count_a (>=1) or count_b (>=1). Which is impossible. So, count_c can't be zero because that would require count_c to be equal to either count_a or count_b, which are at least 1.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Because if C appends zero 'c's, then count_c is zero, which can't equal count_a or count_b (which are >=1). So, count_c must be at least 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"some number of 'c's\"—can it be zero? Hmm.\n\nLooking back: The problem statement says, \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" So, if the number is zero, it must equal either count_a or count_b. But since count_a and count_b are >=1, zero can't be equal to either. So, in that case, it's invalid.\n\nWait, but that's not possible. So, C must append at least one 'c's, because zero would make count_c zero, which can't equal count_a or count_b. So, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b, and both are >=1.\n\nTherefore, in our code, after checking the structure, we can proceed to check whether count_c equals count_a or count_b, but count_c must be >=1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"some number\" of 'c's. So, is zero allowed? Or is it implied that at least one is added?\n\nLooking back: The note says that in the third example, count_c equals count_b.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's not explicitly stated whether zero is allowed. However, looking at the note, the third example's count_c is 1, which equals count_b which is 1.\n\nHmm, but let's think: if C appends zero 'c's, then the string is S_ab. But count_c is zero, which must equal either count_a or count_b, which are >=1. So, this is impossible. Therefore, count_c must be >=1 and equal to either count_a or count_b.\n\nThus, in the code, after ensuring the structure is correct, we compute count_c, and check if it equals count_a or count_b, and that count_c is at least 1.\n\nWait, but what if count_c is 1, count_a is 3, count_b is 2. Then count_c is 1, which doesn't equal either, so it's invalid.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nCheck the structure:\n\n- The string must be a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's.\n\n- Once you switch from 'a' to 'b' or 'b' to 'c', you can't go back.\n\nIf structure is invalid: output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nCheck if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nAlso, count_c must be >=1.\n\nIf both conditions are met: output YES.\n\nElse: NO.\n\nSo, let's outline how to code this.\n\nIn Python, the string is given as input.\n\nFirst, check the structure:\n\nInitialize current_phase to 0.\n\nallowed_chars = {'a':0, 'b':1, 'c':2}\n\ncurrent_phase = 0\n\nfor c in S:\n\n    if c not in allowed_chars:\n\n        # but according to the problem statement, the string consists of a, b, c only.\n\n        # so no need to handle this.\n\n        pass\n\n    if allowed_chars[c] < current_phase:\n\n        # invalid, because the current character is a lower phase than current_phase.\n\n        # For example, if current_phase is 1 (expecting 'b's or 'c's), and c is 'a' (phase 0), which is less than 1. So, invalid.\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif allowed_chars[c] == current_phase:\n\n        # same phase, continue.\n\n        pass\n\n    else:\n\n        # higher phase: move to next phase.\n\n        current_phase +=1\n\n        # check if current_phase exceeds 2, which is invalid.\n\n        if current_phase > 2:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            exit()\n\nAfter processing all characters, check if current_phase is 2. Because C must have appended 'c's, so the string must end with 'c's. So, if current_phase is less than 2, it's invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because if C appends 'c's, then the string ends with 'c's. So, the last character must be 'c', and the current_phase must be 2 after processing all characters.\n\nSo, after the loop, if current_phase != 2: output NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNext, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\ncount_a is the number of 'a's before the first 'b'.\n\ncount_b is the number of 'b's between the a's and c's.\n\ncount_c is the number of 'c's at the end.\n\nSo, to compute these counts, perhaps during the structure check, we can also track the positions where the phase changes.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFind the indices where the phase changes.\n\nFor example:\n\nphase 0: a's.\n\nphase 1: b's.\n\nphase 2: c's.\n\nWe can find the first index where the character is 'b' or 'c'.\n\nSimilarly, find the first index where the character is 'c'.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, count_a is the number of 'a's up to the first 'b' (or until the end if no 'b's, but in that case, it's invalid because B must have added 'b's, so 'b's must be present).\n\nWait, no: the problem says that after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So, the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nSo, during the structure check, if the string is all 'a's, it's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if after a's comes 'c's without 'b's, it's invalid.\n\nSo, during the structure check, if after processing all characters, current_phase is 2, and the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nSo, after the structure check, we need to make sure that count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nSo, perhaps during the counting, after the structure is validated, we can compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nLet me think of how to compute these counts.\n\nAnother approach: during the structure check, we can keep track of the transitions.\n\nOnce the structure is determined to be valid, the string is a series of a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo, the count_a is the number of a's before the first b.\n\ncount_b is the number of b's between the first b and the first c.\n\ncount_c is the number of c's from the first c to the end.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nstart_a = 0\n\nstart_b = len(a's)\n\nstart_c = len(a's + b's)\n\ncount_a = start_b - start_a\n\ncount_b = start_c - start_b\n\ncount_c = len(s) - start_c\n\nBut how to find start_b and start_c.\n\nAlternatively, during the iteration, when we detect a transition from a to b, we can record the position. Similarly, transition from b to c.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntransitions = []\n\ncurrent_phase = 0\n\nfor i, c in enumerate(s):\n\n    if allowed_chars[c] < current_phase:\n\n        # invalid, break and return NO\n\n    elif allowed_chars[c] == current_phase:\n\n        continue\n\n    else:\n\n        transitions.append(i)\n\n        current_phase +=1\n\n        if current_phase >2:\n\n            break\n\nif current_phase !=2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # check that transitions happened: from a to b, and then to c.\n\n    if len(transitions) < 2:\n\n        # didn't transition to b, or transitioned to c but not to b.\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        # transitions[0] is the index where a turns into b.\n\n        # transitions[1] is the index where b turns into c.\n\n        count_a = transitions[0]\n\n        count_b = transitions[1] - transitions[0]\n\n        count_c = len(s) - transitions[1]\n\n        # now, check count_c == count_a or count_b.\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where the transitions occur at the end of the string? Like, the last character is 'c' but the transition occurs at len(s)-1, meaning count_c is 1.\n\nBut in that case, it's okay.\n\nSo, for example, in 'aabbc':\n\ntransitions = [2,3]\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\nSo, count_c equals count_b.\n\nWhich is valid.\n\nAnother example: 'aaabccc'\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=2, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c equals count_a (3), so valid.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the transitions are recorded as the indices where the phase changes. So, the count_a is the number of a's up to the first transition. Then count_b is the number of b's up to the second transition. count_c is the rest.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the string is like 'aabbaaccc'? That would have a's, then b's, then a's again. Which is invalid, and the code would have broken earlier.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nWait, but let's test the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nStructure: a's (3), b's (2), c's (3). Transitions at 3 and 5.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=2, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c=3 equals count_a=3 → valid. So output is YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc'\n\nStructure: 'b's first? No.\n\nWait, the first character is 'b', so current_phase is 0. 'b' is allowed_chars 'b' which is 1>0, so current_phase becomes 1. Then next 'b's are fine.\n\nThen 'a' comes. current_phase is 1, but 'a' is allowed_chars 0 <1 → invalid. So, the code returns NO, which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc'\n\nStructure: a's (2), b's (1), c's (1). Transitions at 2 and 3.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c=1 equals count_b=1 → valid. Output YES.\n\nSo, the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: 'ab'\n\nThis is a's followed by b's. But no c's. So, the structure is a→b, but phase after processing is 1, not 2 → invalid.\n\nBecause C must have appended 'c's, so the string must end with 'c's. So, 'ab' is invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abc'.\n\nStructure: a→b→c. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c=1 equals count_a=1 and count_b=1 → valid. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbbc'.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=3, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c=1. Does it equal a or b? 1 !=2 and 1 !=3 → invalid. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbc'.\n\ncount_c=3. count_a=3, count_b=3 → count_c=3 equals both. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc'.\n\ncount_c=3. count_a=1, count_b=3.\n\nSo, count_c=3 equals count_b=3 → valid. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaabbbcc'.\n\nStructure: a's, then b's, then a's again. Invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abcb'.\n\nStructure: a→b→c→b. When processing 'b' after 'c', the current_phase is 2, and 'b' is allowed_chars 1 <2 → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc'.\n\nStructure: a→b→b→b→c. So transitions at 1 and 4.\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c=1 equals count_b=3? No. 1 equals count_a=1 → yes. So output YES.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, what about a string where count_c is zero.\n\nFor example: 'aabb' → no c's. Structure is a→b, phase is 1. So, invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abcabc' → structure is a→b→c, then a again. Invalid.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaabbbcc' → structure is a→b→a... invalid.\n\nSo, the code will catch that.\n\nSo, now, the plan is to code this logic.\n\nImplement the steps:\n\nRead the string.\n\nCheck the structure:\n\n- Iterate through each character.\n\n- Track current_phase (0,1,2).\n\n- When a character is found that is allowed_chars[c] < current_phase → invalid.\n\n- When allowed_chars[c] > current_phase → transition to next phase, add to transitions.\n\n- When allowed_chars[c] == current_phase → do nothing.\n\nAt the end, if current_phase !=2 → invalid.\n\nAlso, check that transitions have at least two elements (from a to b, and then to c).\n\nIf transitions are less than 2 → invalid.\n\nCompute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nCheck if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nIn Python:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nallowed = {'a':0, 'b':1, 'c':2}\n\ntransitions = []\n\ncurrent_phase = 0\n\nn = len(s)\n\nvalid = True\n\nfor i, c in enumerate(s):\n\n    if allowed[c] < current_phase:\n\n        valid = False\n\n        break\n\n    elif allowed[c] > current_phase:\n\n        transitions.append(i)\n\n        current_phase +=1\n\n        if current_phase >2:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    # else: same phase, do nothing\n\nif not valid or current_phase !=2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelif len(transitions) <2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # compute counts\n\n    a_end = transitions[0]\n\n    b_end = transitions[1]\n\n    count_a = a_end\n\n    count_b = b_end - a_end\n\n    count_c = n - b_end\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the sample input 3, the string is 'aabc', which is 'a','a','b','c'.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: 'a' → allowed 0, phase 0.\n\ni=1: 'a' → same phase.\n\ni=2: 'b' → allowed 1>0 → phase increases to 1, transitions added at 2.\n\ni=3: 'c' → allowed 2>1 → phase increases to 2, transitions added at 3.\n\nSo, transitions = [2,3].\n\ncount_a = 2.\n\ncount_b = 3-2=1.\n\ncount_c =4-3=1.\n\ncount_c=1 equals count_b=1 → valid.\n\nSo, code works.\n\nAnother test: 'aaabccc' → transitions at 3 and 5.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=2, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c=3 == count_a=3 → valid.\n\nAnother test: 'aabbaabbbcc' → during the loop, when 'a' is encountered after 'b's, allowed_chars['a']=0 < current_phase=1 → invalid.\n\nSo, code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother test: 'abc' → transitions at 0 and 1.\n\nWait, wait, let's see.\n\nWait, no: for 'a','b','c':\n\ni=0: 'a' → allowed 0 == phase 0.\n\ni=1: 'b' → allowed 1>0 → phase increases to 1, transitions added at 1.\n\ni=2: 'c' → allowed 2>1 → phase increases to 2, transitions added at 2.\n\ntransitions = [1,2].\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=2-1=1, count_c=3-2=1.\n\ncount_c=1 == count_a=1 → valid.\n\nSo, code works.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbbc' → count_a=2, count_b=3, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c=1 → is it equal to a or b?\n\nNo. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaabbbcc' → during the loop, when 'a' is found after 'b's, allowed_chars['a']=0 < current_phase=1 → invalid.\n\nSo, code returns NO.\n\nNow, another edge case: minimal string.\n\nWhat's the minimal string that satisfies the condition?\n\nIt must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nSo, 'abc' is the minimal.\n\nWhich is handled correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabbc' → count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c=1 is not equal to a or b → invalid.\n\nSo, code returns NO.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific process involving three stages of appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The string must follow a strict order of 'a's followed by 'b's and then 'c's, with the number of 'c's being equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must be structured such that it starts with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and ends with one or more 'c's. This ensures that the string transitions from 'a' to 'b' and then from 'b' to 'c' without any interleaving.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the structure, count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nallowed = {'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}\ntransitions = []\ncurrent_phase = 0\nvalid = True\n\nfor i, c in enumerate(s):\n    char_value = allowed[c]\n    if char_value < current_phase:\n        valid = False\n        break\n    elif char_value > current_phase:\n        transitions.append(i)\n        current_phase += 1\n        if current_phase > 2:\n            valid = False\n            break\n\nif not valid or current_phase != 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif len(transitions) < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    a_end = transitions[0]\n    b_end = transitions[1]\n    count_a = a_end\n    count_b = b_end - a_end\n    count_c = len(s) - b_end\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The code iterates through each character in the string, checking if the sequence follows the required order of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. It tracks transitions from one phase to another (from 'a' to 'b', and from 'b' to 'c').\n2. **Transitions and Phases**: The transitions are recorded, ensuring that the string progresses correctly through the phases without reverting back to a previous phase.\n3. **Count Calculation**: After confirming the correct structure, the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are calculated based on the transition points.\n4. **Validation**: The number of 'c's is checked against the counts of 'a's and 'b's to ensure it meets the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies both the structure and the character counts, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
