Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm. So the goal is to find the smallest possible d where every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably sort the positions of the lanterns. Because if they're not sorted, it's harder to figure out the coverage gaps between them.\n\nOnce they are sorted, I can look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each gap, the required d must be enough to cover that entire gap when considering the reach of the left and right lanterns.\n\nWait, but also the first lantern covers from its position -d to position +d, but we have to make sure the beginning of the street (0) is covered. Similarly, the last lantern must cover up to l.\n\nSo maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the coverage starting from 0. The first lantern must cover from its left end (-d) to ai +d. But since 0 is the start, the maximum between (ai[0] -d) and 0 must be <= 0, which isn't directly helpful. Wait, perhaps it's better to see what's the maximum distance from 0 to the nearest lantern. That would determine part of the required d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum of two things:\n\na) The distance from 0 to the first lantern, minus any overlap with the next lantern's coverage.\nb) The distance from l to the last lantern, similarly.\n\nAnd also, for the middle lanterns, the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two, because each gap requires that the sum of the left and right lantern's coverage is at least the gap length.\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nAfter sorting the lantern positions, the street is divided into segments before the first lantern, between lanterns, and after the last lantern.\n\nFor each segment, we compute how much coverage is needed.\n\nThe first segment is from 0 to a_0. The required coverage here is that the first lantern must cover at least up to a_0 +d, but wait no— the first lantern covers a_0 -d to a_0 +d. So for 0 to be covered, the first lantern's left end must reach 0. So a_0 -d <= 0 → d >= a_0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if a_0 is the first lantern, then its coverage is [a_0 -d, a_0 +d]. To cover 0, 0 must be within this interval. So a_0 -d ≤ 0 and 0 ≥ a_0 -d. Wait, that's just 0 ≥ a_0 -d → d ≥ a_0.\n\nWait, no, wait: For 0 to be covered, it has to be ≥ a_0 -d. So a_0 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a_0.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern's coverage must reach l. So a_n-1 +d ≥ l → d ≥ l - a_n-1.\n\nSo those are two constraints.\n\nThen, for the segments between lanterns, say between a_i and a_{i+1}, the sum of the left reach (a_i +d) and the right reach (a_{i+1} -d) must be ≥ a_{i+1} - a_i.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The left lantern's coverage extends to a_i +d, and the right lantern's starts at a_{i+1} -d. So the total coverage between them is (a_i +d) + (a_{i+1} -d) = a_i + a_{i+1} → but wait, no. Wait, the coverage from the left is up to a_i +d, and from the right starts at a_{i+1} -d. So the combined coverage is from (a_i -d) to (a_{i+1} +d). But for the middle segment a_i+1 to a_{i+1}, we need that the coverage from the left and right lanterns overlaps enough to cover the entire segment.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, a_prev and a_curr, the distance between them is delta = a_curr - a_prev. The required condition is that the right coverage of a_prev plus the left coverage of a_curr is at least delta. Since the coverage for a_prev is d on both sides",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points on a street are illuminated by lanterns placed at various positions. The street is defined from point 0 to point \\( l \\), and each lantern lights up all points within a distance \\( d \\) from it.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the analysis of coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Coverage Gaps**: We need to ensure that the entire street is covered without any gaps. This involves checking three segments:\n   - From the start of the street (0) to the first lantern.\n   - Between each pair of consecutive lanterns.\n   - From the last lantern to the end of the street (\\( l \\)).\n3. **Calculate Minimum Radius**:\n   - For the segment from 0 to the first lantern, the required radius \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern.\n   - For the segment from the last lantern to \\( l \\), the required radius \\( d \\) must be at least \\( l \\) minus the position of the last lantern.\n   - For each segment between consecutive lanterns, the combined coverage of the two lanterns must cover the entire segment, which translates to ensuring that the sum of their coverage radii is sufficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_min_d(n, l, ai):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0.0  # No lanterns, but per problem statement n >=1?\n    ai = sorted(ai)\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check first lantern's coverage\n    max_d = max(max_d, ai[0])\n    \n    # Check last lantern's coverage\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - ai[-1])\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        delta = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n        # The left can cover up to ai[i] + d, the right starts at ai[i+1] - d\n        # So ai[i] + d >= ai[i+1] - d => d >= (ai[i+1] - ai[i])/2\n        # Also, check if there's any gap beyond what's covered\n        # The maximum d needed is the maximum of current max_d and (delta)/2\n        required = (delta) / 2\n        if required > max_d:\n            max_d = required\n    \n    return max_d\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    l = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    ai_str = input[ptr].strip()\n    ai = list(map(int, ai_str.split()))\n    ai = [float(x) for x in ai]\n    d = compute_min_d(n, l, ai)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Lanterns**: By sorting the lantern positions, we can easily analyze the coverage between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial Checks**: The first and last lanterns must cover the ends of the street, so their positions directly influence the minimum radius \\( d \\).\n3. **Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each segment between two lanterns, the radius must be large enough to ensure their combined coverage covers the entire segment. This is calculated as half the distance between the lanterns, ensuring that each lantern's coverage overlaps sufficiently.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value derived from the above checks gives the minimum radius \\( d \\) required to illuminate the entire street.",
