String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of \"beautiful\" strings based on certain criteria. The beautiful string has to meet specific conditions related to the counts of '0's and '1's, as well as how modifications can be applied to reach a certain state.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the string s consists only of 0s and 1s. It must have exactly n zeros and m ones. So the total length is n + m. \n\nAdditionally, we can perform some modifications to get to a target character g (which is either 0 or 1). Each modification is replacing the last two characters with one character. For example, if the last two are both 0, replace them with a single 0. If they're different, replace them with 0.\n\nWait, no: the problem says, \"exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" Oh right, so if the two last characters are both 0, they become a 1. Wait, wait. Let me recheck:\n\nNo, wait. When you replace two last characters, you replace them with one. The new character is 1 if the two were 0s, else 0. So for example, if the last two are 00, replace with 1. If they are 01 or 10, replace with 0. And if they are 11, replace with 0? Because it's not two zeros. So that's the rule.\n\nEach modification reduces the string length by 1, because two characters are replaced by one. But the initial string must have at least two characters to perform a modification.\n\nThe goal is to find the number of beautiful strings (those with exactly n 0s and m 1s) such that after some number of modifications (possibly zero), the resulting string ends with g. Or wait, no: the modifications can be done any number of times, and the final character after all modifications must be g.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So the process is, starting from the original string s, perform some modifications (each reducing the length by 1) until we can't modify anymore, and the resulting string's last character is g.\n\nWait, but each modification changes the last two characters into one, so the last character after each step is determined by the previous two. So after each step, the last character is the result of merging the last two.\n\nSo the process is: starting from the string s, which is of length L = n + m. We can perform k modifications, where k can be from 0 up to L-1, since each modification reduces the length by 1. After each modification, the last two characters are replaced by one, which affects the last character.\n\nBut the key is that after all modifications, the resulting string's last character is g. So we need to model the possible ways the string can be modified such that the last character becomes g.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky. So for a given string s, we need to compute whether it can end up with g after some modifications, and count all such s that satisfy the beautiful string condition.\n\nBut since n and m can be up to 105 each, the total length is up to 210. So enumerating all possible beautiful strings is impossible because there are C(n+m, n) possibilities, which for n=105 and m=105 is way too big.\n\nSo we need a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of dynamic programming states.\n\nWhat's the state? Maybe the current position in the string, the number of 0s used so far, the number of 1s used so far, and the last one or two characters that determine what the next modification would do.\n\nWait, perhaps the state needs to capture the current last character(s) because each modification depends on the last two characters.\n\nWait, but each modification reduces the string length by one, so the process is like building the string from the end towards the beginning. Or maybe thinking recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the DP state as the current length of the string, the number of 0s left, the number of 1s left, and the last character (since the next modification depends on the last two). Hmm, but that might not capture all necessary information.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each modification step can be thought of as combining the last two characters into one, which depends on their values. So the outcome of each step depends on the last two bits.\n\nThus, the process is a chain of decisions based on the previous two bits. So the DP state can be defined as:\n\ndp[k][a][b] = number of ways to reach a state where the last two characters are a and b, and we've used k modifications so far.\n\nWait, but then when we perform a modification, we combine a and b into a new character c, which reduces the length by 1. So the next state after modifying would be dp[k+1][c].\n\nWait, maybe that's the way to go. Let's try to model this.\n\nInitially, the string is of length L = n + m. Before any modifications, the last two characters could be anything, but since no modification has been done, the last character is part of the initial string.\n\nWait, but in the initial string, the last two characters could be 00, 01, 10, or 11. Each of these will lead to different results when modified.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP should track the last one or two characters, depending on whether a modification has been made or not.\n\nAlternatively, since each modification step reduces the string length by 1, perhaps the state can represent the current string length, the number of 0s and 1s left, and the last character (or last two, for the next step).\n\nHmm, perhaps the state is:\n\n- len: the current length of the string.\n- a: the last character (could be 0 or 1).\n- zeros: number of 0s remaining.\n- ones: number of 1s remaining.\n\nWait, but len can be up to 210, and a can be 0 or 1, and zeros and ones can each be up to 105. So the state space is manageable.\n\nBut how do transitions work?\n\nEach transition represents a modification. But wait, when len >=2, you can choose to perform a modification or not. Wait, no: each modification reduces the length by 1, so you can perform it multiple times.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as building the string from the end towards the front, considering each possible modification step.\n\nWait, maybe the state is (zeros_used, ones_used, last_char). Because the last_char determines what can happen next.\n\nWait, for example, if the last two characters are 0 and 0, then modifying them will result in 1. So the next last_char becomes 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the last two are 0 and 1, modifying them gives 0.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the last two are needed to perform a modification. So the state needs to capture the last character and the second last character.\n\nHmm, maybe the state is (a, b), where a is the last character and b is the second last. Then, when you modify, you combine a and b into a new character c, and the state becomes (c, ...?), but wait, after the modification, the length decreases by 1. So the new state would have a length of len-1, and the last character is c.\n\nWait, perhaps the state can be represented as (last_char, len), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state is (pos, last_two), where pos is the current position, and last_two is the last two characters.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each possible state, we can track the number of ways to reach it, and for each possible modification, see how it transitions to other states.\n\nLet me think of the DP as follows:\n\nWe have a DP table where dp[len][a][b] represents the number of ways to have a string of length len, ending with the last two characters a and b, and having used a certain number of modifications.\n\nWait, but len can be up to 210, and a and b can each be 0 or 1. So the state space is 210 * 2 * 2 = 840, which is manageable.\n\nThe initial state would be for the full string of length L = n + m. But since the initial string can be any permutation of n 0s and m 1s, the last two characters can vary.\n\nSo the initial DP is built based on all possible last two characters in the full string.\n\nWait, but the initial string is built in all possible ways, and for each way, the last two characters are known. So for each possible pair (a, b) that can appear as the last two characters in any valid string, we count how many such strings exist.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWell, perhaps the initial state is built by considering all possible ways to arrange the 0s and 1s in the string, and for each arrangement, record the last two characters.\n\nBut since the string can be up to 210 characters long, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: model the DP as the current length, and the last two characters, along with the counts of 0s and 1s used so far.\n\nWait, but the counts of 0s and 1s are fixed (n and m), so perhaps the state can be (current_length, last_two_chars, zeros_used, ones_used).\n\nBut that's four dimensions, which may be too large.\n\nWait, but zeros_used can be up to n, and ones_used up to m. With n and m up to 105, that's 105^2 = 11025 possible combinations. Multiply by 210 (length) and 4 possible last_two_chars (since each can be 00, 01, 10, 11), the total state space is 210 * 4 * 105^2 = around 44 million. That's a lot, but maybe manageable with optimizations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to reduce the state.\n\nWait, perhaps the zeros_used and ones_used can be tracked as separate variables, but in the DP, we can precompute the required counts. Since the sum is fixed as len, perhaps we can express ones_used as len - zeros_used.\n\nWait, yes! Because len is the current length, and zeros_used + ones_used = len. So, for a given len and zeros_used, ones_used is determined as len - zeros_used.\n\nSo the state can be simplified to (len, a, b, zeros_used), where a and b are the last two characters.\n\nWait, but even so, len can be up to 210, a and b are 2 options each, and zeros_used up to len. So for each len, a, b, zeros_used is up to len. So for each len, the number of states is 4 (for a and b) multiplied by len+1 (since zeros_used can be 0 to len). So for len=210, 4*(211) = 844 per len. For 210 len, that's 210*844 = ~177,000 states. That's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- The DP state is (len, a, b, zeros_used), where:\n   - len is the current length of the string.\n   - a and b are the last two characters (a is the penultimate, b is the last character).\n   - zeros_used is the number of 0s used so far.\n\n- For each state, we can decide whether to perform a modification or not. Wait, but each modification reduces the length by 1, so for len >=2, we can perform a modification.\n\nWait, but performing a modification is optional. Because the problem allows for any number of modifications, including zero.\n\nWait, no. Because each modification is a step that can be taken, but you can choose to stop at any point. So for each state, the next steps are either:\n\n1. Do not perform a modification: in this case, the string remains of length len, and the last two characters are a and b. But wait, no—because the last two characters are a and b, and if we don't modify, then the string is still of length len, and the last two are a and b. So for the next step, we can either modify again or not.\n\nWait, but the process can involve any number of modifications, so the transitions are:\n\n- For each state (len, a, b, z), where len >=2, we can choose to perform a modification. This leads to a new state of len-1, with the new last character being c (determined by a and b as per the modification rules). The new zeros_used is z (since the modification doesn't change the count of zeros or ones; it just reduces the string length by 1).\n\nWait, no. Because the modification replaces two characters with one. So when you modify a and b, you remove them and add c. So the count of zeros and ones can change.\n\nWait, oh right! Because when you merge two 0s into a 1, you lose two 0s and gain one 1. Similarly, merging two 1s into 0, you lose two 1s and gain one 0. Merging a 0 and 1 (in either order) gives 0. So the counts of 0s and 1s can change during the process.\n\nThis complicates things, as the state must track the current counts of 0s and 1s as well as the last two characters.\n\nHmm, this makes the state more complex. So the state now is (len, a, b, zeros_used, ones_used). But that's five dimensions, which is probably too much.\n\nWait, but len is the sum of zeros_used and ones_used. So len = zeros_used + ones_used. Therefore, we can eliminate len from the state, keeping only zeros_used and ones_used.\n\nSo the state can be (a, b, zeros_used, ones_used). Because len is known as zeros_used + ones_used.\n\nThat's four dimensions. But a and b are each 0 or 1, so 4 possible pairs. Zeros_used can be up to 105, ones_used up to 105. So the total state space is 4 * 106 * 106 = 4 * 11236 = 44944. That's manageable.\n\nSo the DP state is (a, b, z, o), where a and b are the last two characters, z is the number of 0s used, o is the number of 1s used.\n\nThe transitions are:\n\n1. If len >=2, perform a modification. The new last character is c, which depends on a and b. Then, the new state is (c, None, z', o'), but wait, because after modification, the length decreases by 1, and the new last character is c. So the new state is (c, ...) Wait, no: after modification, the last two characters are now just c, because we've merged a and b into c. So the next state will have a single character as the last one, but in the next step, if we perform another modification, we'll need the previous two characters, which in this case would be the new last character and whatever was before.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently.\n\nWait, each modification step reduces the length by 1. So for a state (a, b, z, o), the next state after modification is (c, _, z', o'), where c is the result of merging a and b. What happens to the counts? Well, when you merge a and b, you lose a and b, and add c.\n\nSo if a and b are both 0, then you lose two 0s and gain one 1. So z' = z - 2, o' = o + 1.\n\nIf a and b are both 1, you lose two 1s and gain one 0. So o' = o - 2, z' = z + 1.\n\nIf a and b are different, you lose one 0 and one 1, and gain one 0. So z' = z -1, o' = o -1.\n\nWait, but wait: when a and b are 0 and 1 (either order), the result is 0. So the modification reduces the count of 1s by 1, and 0s remain the same? Or wait, no: the two characters are removed and replaced by one 0. So for example, if a is 0 and b is 1, you remove one 0 and one 1, add one 0. So overall, 0s decrease by 0 (since you remove one 0 and one 1, but add one 0: net 0 for 0s, minus one 1). So in this case, z' = z -1, o' = o -1.\n\nWait, no: the initial state has a 0 and 1. So in the string, those two are removed and replaced by a 0. So the total 0s in the string is (z - 1 + 1) = z, because you removed one 0 and one 1, added one 0. So 0s: -1 (from removing 0) + 1 (added) → 0. So z remains the same.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the effect on z and o:\n\nCase 1: a and b are both 0:\n- Remove two 0s → z decreases by 2.\n- Add one 1 → o increases by 1.\nSo z' = z - 2, o' = o + 1.\n\nCase 2: a and b are both 1:\n- Remove two 1s → o decreases by 2.\n- Add one 0 → z increases by 1.\nSo z' = z + 1, o' = o - 2.\n\nCase 3: a and b are 0 and 1 (order doesn't matter):\n- Remove one 0 and one 1 → z decreases by 1, o decreases by 1.\n- Add one 0 → z remains the same.\nSo z' = z -1, o' = o -1.\n\nWait, no: initial state has a 0 and 1. Removing them subtracts 1 from z and 1 from o. Then adding 0 adds 1 to z. So overall, z becomes (z -1 +1) = z, o is o -1.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo for each case, the new z and o are computed.\n\nNow, the initial state is when the string is of length L = n + m. In this state, a and b are the last two characters of the string. The number of ways to have a particular (a, b) pair is equal to the number of beautiful strings that end with a and b.\n\nWait, but the beautiful string must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So for the initial state, the string has n 0s and m 1s, but the last two can vary.\n\nSo the initial state is built by considering all possible ways to arrange n 0s and m 1s, and for each, note the last two characters.\n\nBut instead of enumerating all possible strings, which is impossible, perhaps the initial state can be built by considering all possible (a, b) pairs and the number of ways to arrange the rest of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial count for each (a, b) is equal to the number of ways to have a string of length L, ending with a and b, with exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n\nHow can we compute that?\n\nWell, the last two characters are a and b. The rest of the string (the first L-2 characters) must contain (n - a_0) 0s and (m - a_1) 1s, where a_0 is 1 if a is 0, else 0. Similarly for a_1.\n\nSo for each possible (a, b), the number of ways is the combination of (L-2 choose (n - a_0)) multiplied by the number of ways to arrange those 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, no: the entire string has n 0s and m 1s. So the last two are a and b, so the remaining L-2 positions must have (n - (a == 0 ? 1 : 0)) 0s and (m - (b == 1 ? 1 : 0)) 1s.\n\nWait, but a and b can't be outside the counts. So for a given (a, b), the remaining 0s and 1s must be non-negative.\n\nSo for a in {0,1}, b in {0,1}, the initial count for (a, b) is C((n + m - 2), (n - (a == 0 ? 1 : 0)), (m - (b == 1 ? 1 : 0))) ), but only if (n - (a==0)) >=0 and (m - (b==1)) >=0.\n\nWait, but the order matters. The first L-2 characters can be arranged in any way, as long as they have the correct counts.\n\nSo for each (a, b), the number of ways is comb(n + m -2, (n - (a==0)) + (m - (b ==1))), but that's not quite right. Because the sum is (n - a0) + (m - b1) = (n + m) - (a0 + b1). But the remaining L-2 positions must sum to (n + m) - (a0 + b1) = (L-2) - (a0 + b1) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the initial string has n + m characters. The last two are a and b. So the remaining L-2 have (n - a0) 0s and (m - b1) 1s, where a0 is 1 if a is 0, else 0. Similarly, b1 is 1 if b is 1, else 0.\n\nSo the number of ways to arrange the remaining is C( (n - a0) + (m - b1), (n - a0) ), provided that (n - a0) >=0 and (m - b1)>=0.\n\nSo for each (a, b), the initial count is comb( (n - a0) + (m - b1), (n - a0) ) if the above conditions hold, else 0.\n\nBut this is only for the initial state where no modifications have been performed yet.\n\nOnce the initial state is built, the DP proceeds by considering possible modifications.\n\nSo the transitions are:\n\nFor each state (a, b, z, o):\n\n- If len >=2, we can choose to perform a modification, which changes the last two characters to c (as per the rules), and updates z and o accordingly.\n\nSo for each (a, b), we compute c, then the new state is (c, _, new_z, new_o). The new state's len is len-1.\n\nWait, but after modification, the last two characters are now (None, c), but in the next step, when we want to perform another modification, we'll need the previous two characters. Wait, no: after the modification, the string has length len-1, and the last two are now [something, c]. Wait, no: the string after modification has len-1, and the last character is c. So the last two characters are not available, unless we have another step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nEach modification step reduces the string length by 1. After the modification, the string's last character is c, which is determined by the previous last two characters a and b.\n\nSo, for the DP state, after a modification, the last two characters are (c, something), but wait, the string is now shorter by one. So in the new state, the last two characters would be (the new last character and the previous one, which is now the second last). But wait, how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the state needs to track the last two characters, regardless of whether a modification has been performed or not.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the state is (a, b, z, o). When you perform a modification, you replace a and b with c. So the new state is (c, x, z', o'), where x is the new second last character, but wait, in this case, the string is len-1, so the new state's last two characters are (previous second last, c). But that's not captured in the state. So this suggests that the state is not sufficient.\n\nAh, I see the problem. The state (a, b, z, o) captures the last two characters, but after a modification, the last two are now (something, c). But the 'something' is the previous character before a and b.\n\nWait, that suggests that the state must include the last three characters, which isn't feasible due to the state size.\n\nHmm, perhaps the state needs to track the last two characters, and for each possible modification, track the new last two.\n\nWait, but after a modification, the last two are (prev_prev, c). But the prev_prev is the third last character in the original string.\n\nWait, perhaps the state needs to track the last two characters, but when a modification is performed, it's possible that the previous last two were a and b, leading to c. So the new state's last two are (something, c). But what is 'something'? It's the third last character of the previous state.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's model the state as the last two characters, and the counts of 0s and 1s. Because when you perform a modification, the new last two characters depend on the previous two.\n\nSo, for the DP state (a, b, z, o), when you perform a modification, you compute c based on a and b, then the new state is (b, c, new_z, new_o).\n\nWait, no: because after modifying a and b, the new last two characters are (b, c)? No, wait. Let me think: the original string had ... , a, b. After modification, it's ... , c. So the last two characters are now (the previous second last character, which was a, and the new last character, c). Wait, no. Because in the original string, the last two were a and b. After merging them into c, the new last character is c. So the last two characters of the new string are (a, b) → replaced by c, so the new last two are (something, c). But the 'something' is the third last character of the previous string.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Perhaps I should model the state as the last two characters, and the counts. Then, each modification step will change the last two to (something, c), but without knowing what 'something' is, which is the third last character.\n\nThis suggests that the state is insufficient, and we need to track more information. But that's not feasible because of the state space.\n\nAlternative idea: the state is (a, b, z, o), and for each possible (a, b), when a modification is performed, the new state is (b, c, new_z, new_o). Because the last two characters after modification are b and c.\n\nWait, perhaps. Because the original last two were a and b. After modification, they become c. So the new last two are (b, c)? No, because when you replace a and b with c, the new string is one character shorter, and the new last character is c. So the new last two are the previous second last character and c.\n\nWait, but the previous second last character is a. So the new last two are (a, c). Because the string before modification was ... x a b. After modification, it's ... x c. So the last two are x and c. But x is a.\n\nSo the new last two are (a, c).\n\nWait, that's correct. So after modification, the last two are (a, c). So the new state is (a, c, new_z, new_o).\n\nWait, but in the state, the a and b represent the last two. So when you perform a modification, the new a is the previous b, and the new b is c.\n\nWait, no: the new last two are (previous second last, c). So the new state's a is the previous second last, which was b, and the new b is c.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the string is ... A B, where A is the second last, B is the last.\n\nAfter modification, B and A are replaced by C. So the new string ends with C.\n\nThe new last two are A and C.\n\nWait, no. Because the last two were A and B, and after modification, they are replaced by C. So the new string ends with C. So the last two are the previous second last (A) and the new last (C).\n\nSo the new state's a is A, and the new b is C.\n\nSo in the state, after modification, the new a is the previous b (B), and the new b is C.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the previous a was A, and b was B. After modification, the last two are A and C. So the new a is A, and the new b is C.\n\nSo the state transitions from (A, B) to (A, C).\n\nWait, but according to the initial state (A, B), after modification, the new state is (A, C).\n\nSo for the DP, the state is (a, b), and when a modification is performed, the new state is (a_prev, c), where a_prev is the previous a, and c is the new last character.\n\nWait, no. Because a_prev is the previous a, which is the second last character before the modification.\n\nSo in the initial state (A, B), after modification, the new state is (A, C).\n\nSo the transition is (A, B) → (A, C).\n\nHmm, okay, that makes sense.\n\nSo for the DP transitions, for each state (a, b, z, o), when a modification is performed, the new state is (a, c, new_z, new_o), where c is determined by a and b.\n\nAnd the new_z and new_o are computed based on a and b as discussed earlier.\n\nWait, but in the initial state, the len is L = n + m. So when len >=2, we can perform a modification.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1. Precompute all possible combinations for the initial state. For each possible (a, b), compute the number of ways to have a string ending with a and b, using n 0s and m 1s.\n\n2. Initialize the DP table with these initial counts.\n\n3. For each possible state in the DP table, consider the possibility of performing a modification (only if len >=2, i.e., the current len is at least 2). For each such state, compute the new state after modification and update the DP accordingly.\n\n4. After processing all possible states, the answer is the sum of all DP states where the last character (b in the state) is equal to g.\n\nWait, but when a modification is performed, the last two characters become (a, c). So the last character is c.\n\nWait, no: the last two characters are (a, c), so the last character is c. So in the state, after modification, the last character is c.\n\nBut in the DP state, the last two are (a, c), so the last character is c.\n\nSo to check if the resulting string ends with g, we need to see if the last character is g.\n\nWait, no. Because the process can have any number of modifications. So the final string can have its last character as g, regardless of how many modifications were done.\n\nSo the desired condition is that the final state's last character is g. But the state is (a, b), so the last character is b.\n\nWait, no. Because in the DP state, the last two characters are a and b. So the last character is b.\n\nSo to find the total number of beautiful strings that can end up with last character g, we need to sum all DP states where b is equal to g.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute the initial DP for all possible (a, b) pairs, with the counts as described.\n\n- For each state (a, b, z, o), if len >=2, perform a modification to get (a, c, new_z, new_o), and add the number of ways from (a, b, z, o) to (a, c, new_z, new_o).\n\n- After processing all states, sum all the DP states where the last character (b) is equal to g.\n\nSo, now the problem is to implement this.\n\nBut how to compute the initial state?\n\nThe initial state is for len = L = n + m. For each possible (a, b), the number of ways is comb(L-2, (n - a0) + (m - b1)), where a0 is 1 if a is 0, else 0; b1 is 1 if b is 1, else 0.\n\nBut this is only if (n - a0) >=0 and (m - b1) >=0.\n\nOtherwise, the count is zero.\n\nWait, for example, if a is 0, then a0 is 1. So n must be >= a0.\n\nSo for each (a, b), compute:\n\nrequired_zeros = n - (a == 0)\nrequired_ones = m - (b == 1)\n\nif required_zeros < 0 or required_ones < 0: \n    count = 0\nelse:\n    count = C(L-2, required_zeros)\n\nwhere C is the combination function.\n\nBut how to compute combinations modulo 1e9+7, especially for large L-2 (up to 209)?\n\nWe can precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to 210, and then use them to compute combinations.\n\nSo, first, precompute fact and inv_fact arrays up to 210.\n\nThen, for each (a, b), compute the required_zeros and required_ones, check if they are non-negative, and if so, compute the combination.\n\nSo, the initial DP is built by iterating over all a and b, and computing the initial count as described.\n\nOnce the initial DP is set up, we process the transitions.\n\nNow, the transitions are as follows:\n\nFor each state (a, b, z, o) in the current DP:\n\n- Compute len = z + o.\n\n- If len >= 2:\n\n   - Perform a modification, compute c based on a and b.\n\n   - Compute new_z and new_o based on a and b.\n\n   - The new state is (a, c, new_z, new_o).\n\n   - Add the current count to the new state's count.\n\nBut wait, the len after modification is len - 1, which is (z + o) - 1 = new_len.\n\nBut in the new state, the len is new_len, which is len - 1.\n\nWait, but in the state, len is z + o, which is the same as the current len.\n\nSo for each transition, when len >=2, we can perform a modification, and create a new state.\n\nSo in code, we can represent the DP as a dictionary or a 2D array for (a, b), and for each possible (a, b), track the count.\n\nBut perhaps using a memoization approach with a dictionary.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps using a 2D array for (a, b) and updating it iteratively.\n\nBut let's think of the DP as a dictionary where the keys are tuples (a, b), and the values are dictionaries mapping (z, o) to counts.\n\nWait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps using a 2D array for each (a, b), and for each (a, b), keep track of all possible (z, o) combinations.\n\nBut that's a lot of data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP can be represented as a dictionary for each (a, b), and for each (a, b), track a dictionary of (z, o) to counts.\n\nBut that's complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the DP as a list of dictionaries, where each (a, b) maps to a dictionary of (z, o) counts.\n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps using a 2D array for (a, b), and for each (a, b), a dictionary of (z, o) to counts.\n\nBut in code, perhaps using a defaultdict or a 2D array of dictionaries.\n\nBut for the sake of time, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp_ab where dp_ab[a][b] is a dictionary of (z, o) → count.\n\nInitially, for each (a, b), dp_ab[a][b] is empty except for the initial state.\n\nCompute the initial state by iterating through all (a, b) pairs and computing the required_zeros and required_ones. For each (a, b), if required_zeros >=0 and required_ones >=0, then compute the combination and add to dp_ab[a][b][(n - a0, m - b1)].\n\nWait, but (n - a0) is the required_zeros, and (m - b1) is the required_ones.\n\nWait, no: required_zeros is (n - (a == 0)), and required_ones is (m - (b == 1)). So in code:\n\na0 = 1 if a == 0 else ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of \"beautiful\" strings that can be transformed into a string ending with a specific character `g` after a series of modifications. A beautiful string is defined as a string consisting only of '0's and '1's, with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones. The allowed modification reduces the length of the string by replacing two characters with one.\n\n### Approach\nThe solution involves dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently count the number of valid strings. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Precompute Combinations**: Use combinatorial mathematics to precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to the maximum possible length of the string to efficiently calculate combinations modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n2. **Initialize DP Table**: Set up a DP table where each state is represented by the last two characters of the string, along with the counts of zeros and ones used so far.\n\n3. **Transition States**: For each state, consider the possibility of performing a modification.
