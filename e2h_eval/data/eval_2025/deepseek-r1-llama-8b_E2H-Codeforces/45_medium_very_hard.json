There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner could participate in.\n\nHmm, let me think about how the tournament structure affects this. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So for n players, there are n-1 games in total. But the order of these games matters because the winner's path depends on the matchups.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of games the winner can play isn't necessarily n-1. Because the structure of the bracket might limit that. For example, in a 3-player tournament, the winner plays two games: first against someone, then against the next. But wait, no—because with 3 players, there are two rounds. So the winner must play two games.\n\nBut in the sample input, when n=4, the output is 2. Hmm, why? Oh, because in a standard knockout bracket with four players, the winner would play three games (like a single elimination tree). Wait no, wait. Let's see:\n\nWait, perhaps the way the matches are arranged affects how many times the winner can play. Because the initial bracket has to follow the rule that any two players can face each other only if their number of games played differs by at most one.\n\nSo the approach is to model the possible paths the winner can take through the bracket, ensuring that each step follows the rule.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's say the winner is W. To maximize the number of games W plays, we need to arrange the bracket such that W can face opponents with varying game counts, each time increasing by one or staying the same.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to building a Fibonacci-like sequence. Because each new opponent must have a game count that's either equal or differs by one from the current W's count.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest k such that the sum of some Fibonacci numbers up to k is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, let's think about it differently. Each time the winner plays a game, they eliminate an opponent. So after m games, the winner has eliminated m opponents. But these opponents must themselves form a chain where each opponent's path leads to a point where they can meet the winner.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games W can play is the largest k where F(k+2) <= n, where F is the Fibonacci sequence. Because each step in the Fibonacci sequence represents adding a new possible opponent, which allows the winner to play another game.\n\nWait, let's test this with the examples given.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2. The maximum is 1. Because W plays one game, and that's it.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. The maximum is 2. So F(4) is 3, which is equal to n=3. So k=2 is correct.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4. The output is 2. Wait, but according to the Fibonacci idea, F(4)=3 which is less than 4. So k would be 2, which aligns with the sample.\n\nWait, but what about n=10? The sample output is 4. Let's see the Fibonacci numbers beyond 2:\n\nF(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=2, F(3)=3, F(4)=5, F(5)=8, F(6)=13. So for k=4, the required n is F(6)=13, but 10 is less than 13. So perhaps the approach is not directly using the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum number of games is the largest k where F(k+2) - 1 <= n.\n\nWait, let's calculate F(k+2):\n\nFor k=1: F(3)=2 → 2-1=1 ≤n=2 → yes.\n\nk=2: F(4)=3 → 3-1=2 ≤3 → yes.\n\nk=3: F(5)=5 →5-1=4 ≤4 → yes.\n\nk=4: F(6)=8 →8-1=7>10? No. Wait, 8-1=7, which is less than 10. So for k=4, it's okay. Then why the sample says for n=10, the maximum is 4?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think recursively.\n\nThe maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the structure of the tournament bracket. Each time the winner plays, they must have an opponent whose number of games is either equal to or one more than theirs.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of games, we want the winner to play as many opponents as possible, each time requiring the opponent to have a game count that is just one less than the winner's current count.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a matter of arranging the bracket in such a way that the winner's path requires them to have a certain number of opponents, each of whom have their own chains leading up to meeting the winner.\n\nThis feels like it's related to the Fibonacci sequence because each new opponent may require adding a new branch, which in turn adds more players.\n\nLet me think about it as a binary tree. Each node is a match between two players. For the winner to reach depth k, each step must have a valid opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games is F(k+2), where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(0)=1, F(1)=1, etc.\n\nSo for k=1, F(3)=2 → 2 players. That's correct.\n\nk=2: F(4)=3 → 3 players. The sample for n=3 gives 2, which is correct.\n\nk=3: F(5)=5 →5 players. So for n=5, the maximum is 3.\n\nk=4: F(6)=8 →8 players. So for n=10, which is larger than 8, but less than F(7)=13, the maximum is 4, since 8<=10<13.\n\nAh! So the maximum number of games is the largest k where F(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo our approach is to compute the largest k such that F(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to a point where F(k+2) exceeds n.\n\n2. Find the largest k where F(k+2) <=n.\n\nThen return k.\n\nSo let's test this with the samples.\n\nSample 1: n=2.\n\nCompute F(2)=1, F(3)=2. So F(3)=2 <=2. So k=1.\n\nSample 2: n=3.\n\nF(3)=2, F(4)=3. So F(4)=3<=3 →k=2.\n\nSample 3: n=4.\n\nF(4)=3<=4, F(5)=5>4. So k=2.\n\nSample 4: n=10.\n\nF(6)=8<=10, F(7)=13>10. So k=4.\n\nYes, all samples fit.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nF(5)=5, so k=3.\n\nSo the maximum is 3.\n\nWhat about n=6? F(5)=5<=6, F(6)=8>6. So k=3.\n\nWait, but with 6 players, can the winner play 3 games? Let's see.\n\nRound 1: 3 matches.\n\nSuppose the winner plays 3 matches:\n\nEach time, the opponent must have played either the same or one less game.\n\nIn the first match, W has 0 games, so opponent can have 0 or 1. Wait, but opponent has just come into the tournament, so they have 0 games. So W can play against them.\n\nAfter that, W has 1 game. The next opponent must have 0 or 1 games.\n\nWait, perhaps the arrangement is possible.\n\nSo the maximum is indeed 3.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the plan is to generate the Fibonacci numbers until F(k+2) exceeds n, then find the largest k.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n- Read n from input.\n\n- Generate Fibonacci numbers starting from F(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=2, etc.\n\n- For each generated F, check if F <=n. Keep track of the maximum k where F(k+2) <=n.\n\nWait, wait. Wait the indexing.\n\nWait, the Fibonacci sequence starts as F(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=2, F(3)=3, F(4)=5, F(5)=8, F(6)=13, etc.\n\nEach k corresponds to the maximum number of games being k.\n\nWe need to find the largest k where F(k+2) <=n.\n\nWait, for k=1, F(3)=2. So if n=2, k=1.\n\nFor k=2, F(4)=3. So n=3, k=2.\n\nSo the formula is to find the maximum k such that F(k+2) <=n.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nInitialize F(0)=1, F(1)=1.\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor k in 1,2,...:\n\n    f = F(k+2)\n\n    if f >n: break\n\n    else: max_games =k\n\nSo, how do I generate F(k+2)?\n\nPerhaps precompute until F(k+2) exceeds n.\n\nSo, let's implement this.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nif n ==2:\n\n    print(1)\n\nelse:\n\n    compute Fibonacci terms until F(k+2) exceeds n.\n\nSo, let's implement a loop.\n\nLet's initialize a list fib with [1,1]. Then for each step, compute next fib as sum of last two.\n\nWait, no. Because F(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=2, etc. So the list will be [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...].\n\nWe can start with fib = [1, 1], then for each step, add the next term.\n\nWe need to find the maximum k where fib[k+2] <=n.\n\nWait, no. Because for k=1, fib[3] is 2.\n\nWait, the index is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps keep track of a and b as the two previous terms.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of variables a and b.\n\nWe can start with a=1, b=1 (which are F(0) and F(1)).\n\nThen, for each step, compute c =a +b. Then, check if c <=n. If yes, then current k is the current step's value.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as:\n\nWe are looking for the maximum m such that F(m) <=n.\n\nWait, no, because m is the index, but how does that relate to k.\n\nWait, perhaps for each step, we compute F(m) and see if it's <=n.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact mapping.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can simulate the process of the Fibonacci sequence and for each new term, see if it's within n.\n\nInitialize prev =1, curr=1.\n\nWe can iterate, keeping track of the current index.\n\nWe can create a variable, say, current_max_k.\n\nWe'll start with current_max_k=0.\n\nprev, curr = 1,1\n\nindex=2.\n\nThen, for each step:\n\nnext_val = prev + curr\n\nif next_val <=n:\n\n    current_max_k +=1\n\n    prev = curr\n\n    curr = next_val\n\n    index +=1\n\nelse:\n\n    break\n\nWait, but wait. For example, when n=2.\n\nInitially, prev=1, curr=1.\n\nnext_val=2 <=2 → current_max_k becomes 1.\n\nThen, prev=1, curr=2, index=3.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nnext_val=3>2 → break.\n\nSo current_max_k is 1, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3.\n\nInitial step: next_val=2 <=3 → current_max_k=1.\n\nThen, next_val=3 <=3 → current_max_k=2.\n\nThen, next_val=5>3 → stop.\n\nSo current_max_k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example, n=5:\n\nprev=1, curr=1 → next_val=2 <=5 → current_max_k=1.\n\nprev=1, curr=2 → next_val=3 <=5 → current_max_k=2.\n\nprev=2, curr=3 → next_val=5 <=5 → current_max_k=3.\n\nNext step: next_val=8>5 → stop.\n\nSo current_max_k=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the logic is, for each new Fibonacci number (starting from 2), if it's <=n, then increase current_max_k by 1.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\ncurrent_max_k =0\n\na, b =1,1\n\nwhile True:\n\n    c = a + b\n\n    if c >n:\n\n        break\n\n    current_max_k +=1\n\n    a, b = b, c\n\nSo, the code will look like this.\n\nOnce this loop breaks, the current_max_k is the maximum number of games.\n\nWait, let me test this with n=10.\n\nLoop steps:\n\na=1, b=1 → c=2 <=10 → current_max_k=1. a=1, b=2.\n\nc=3 <=10 → current_max_k=2. a=2, b=3.\n\nc=5 <=10 → current_max_k=3. a=3, b=5.\n\nc=8 <=10 → current_max_k=4. a=5, b=8.\n\nc=13>10 → break.\n\nSo current_max_k=4, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6.\n\nc=2→1, c=3→2, c=5→3, c=8>6 → current_max_k=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=7.\n\nc=2→1, c=3→2, c=5→3, c=8>7 → current_max_k=3.\n\nSo the maximum is 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=8.\n\nc=2→1, c=3→2, c=5→3, c=8→4.\n\nNext c=13>8 → current_max_k=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to correctly calculate current_max_k.\n\nSo, the plan is to implement this loop.\n\nNow, write the Python code.\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nHandle the case where n=1? Well, the constraints say n >=2.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nIf n <2, but according to the problem statement, n>=2, so no need.\n\nInitialize a=1, b=1, current_max_k=0.\n\nloop:\n\nc = a+b.\n\nif c> n: break.\n\ncurrent_max_k +=1.\n\na, b = b, c.\n\nContinue.\n\nAfter the loop, print current_max_k.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2 → output 1.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3 → output 2.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4 → output 2.\n\nSample Input 4: n=10 → output 4.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5 →3.\n\nn=6→3.\n\nn=8→4.\n\nn=13→5.\n\nn=14→5.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in. The tournament follows a specific rule where two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the structure of the tournament can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. Each time the winner plays a game, they eliminate an opponent, and each subsequent opponent must have played a number of games that is either equal to or one less than the winner's current count. This leads us to consider the Fibonacci sequence, where each term represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Generate Fibonacci numbers until the next term exceeds the number of players `n`.\n2. Track the maximum number of games the winner can play, which corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na, b = 1, 1\nmax_games = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    c = a + b\n    if c > n:\n        break\n    max_games += 1\n    a, b = b, c\n\nprint(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n`, representing the number of players.\n2. **Fibonacci Initialization**: We initialize two variables `a` and `b` to 1, representing the first two Fibonacci numbers.\n3. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: Using a loop, we generate the next Fibonacci number by summing the previous two values (`a` and `b`). If the next Fibonacci number exceeds `n`, we exit the loop.\n4. **Tracking Maximum Games**: Each time we generate a valid Fibonacci number (i.e., it does not exceed `n`), we increment the count of maximum games the winner can play.\n5. **Output Result**: Finally, we print the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to model the tournament structure, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 1018`.",
