Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The definition they give is specific. So, Valera's paper is a square with n x n letters, where n is odd. The letters form an 'X' if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, for each test case, I need to:\n\n- Check that the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is all the same character.\n- Check that the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) is all the same character.\n- Ensure that both diagonals have the same character. Wait, no: the problem says both diagonals are the same. So the diagonal and anti-diagonal must consist of the same letter each, but all the other cells must be another single letter.\n\nWait, let me re-read the condition.\n\nThe teacher thinks it's an \"X\" if:\n- On both diagonals, all letters are the same.\n- All other squares not on the diagonals contain the same letter, which is different from the diagonals.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Read n and the grid.\n2. For the grid, check the two diagonals:\n   a. Are all elements in the main diagonal (i == j) the same?\n   b. Are all elements in the anti-diagonal (i + j = n-1) the same?\n3. Also, check if the two diagonals have the same character. Because if they have different characters, then the condition fails.\n4. Then, check all the non-diagonal cells to see if they are all the same and not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nWait, let me think: the first two points (a and b) ensure that both diagonals are uniform. But point 3 ensures that both are the same. So step 3 is necessary because otherwise, even if both diagonals are uniform, but their letters are different, it's not an X.\n\nSo steps:\n\nFor each grid:\n\n- Check that main diagonal is all same. Let's call this char d1.\n- Check that anti-diagonal is all same. Let's call this char d2.\n- If d1 != d2, then it's invalid.\n- Now, check all non-diagonal cells. They should all be the same, let's say c, and c must not be equal to d1 (or d2, since they are same).\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each grid:\n\nLoop through each cell (i,j). For the main diagonal, i == j. For anti, i + j == n-1.\n\nCollect the characters along the main and anti diagonals. Then check if all are same.\n\nIf both diagonals are same, proceed. Else, output NO.\n\nOnce diagonals are same, collect the non-diagonal cells. Check if all are same and not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nLet's outline the steps in code.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. So grid is a list of strings, each of length n.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nd1_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != d1_char:\n        condition fails.\n\nSimilarly for anti-diagonal:\n\nd2_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n-1 - i\n    if grid[i][j] != d2_char:\n        condition fails.\n\nThen, check if d1_char == d2_char.\n\nIf any of these checks fail, output NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for the non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diag_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        current_char = grid[i][j]\n        if non_diag_char is None:\n            non_diag_char = current_char\n        else:\n            if current_char != non_diag_char:\n                condition fails.\n\nAlso, we need to ensure that non_diag_char is not equal to d1_char (since d1 and d2 are same).\n\nIf any of these fail, output NO.\n\nElse, output YES.\n\nWait, but wait: what if n is 3? Let's see.\n\nFor n=3, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking the non-diagonal cells, that center is skipped.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=3.\n\nExample input like:\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\". The grid must meet specific conditions regarding its diagonals and non-diagonal cells.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the integer `n` and the grid of letters.\n2. **Check Diagonals**:\n   - Ensure all elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are the same.\n   - Ensure all elements on the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n   - Check if both diagonals have the same character.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**:\n   - Ensure all cells not on the diagonals contain the same character, which must be different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, determine if the grid forms an \"X\" and print \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndef check_x(grid, n):\n    # Check main diagonal\n    d1 = grid[0][0]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    d2 = grid[0][n-1]\n    for i in range(n):\n        j = n - 1 - i\n        if grid[i][j] != d2:\n            return False\n\n    # Both diagonals must have the same character\n    if d1 != d2:\n        return False\n\n    # Check non-diagonal cells\n    non_diag_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            current_char = grid[i][j]\n            if non_diag_char is None:\n                non_diag_char = current_char\n            else:\n                if current_char != non_diag_char:\n                    return False\n\n    # All non-diagonal must be same and different from d1/d2\n    if non_diag_char == d1:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\nif check_x(grid, n):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution reads the input and checks each condition step-by-step:\n1. **Main Diagonal Check**: Iterates through each cell on the main diagonal to ensure all characters are the same.\n2. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly checks the anti-diagonal for uniformity.\n3. **Diagonal Uniformity Check**: Ensures both diagonals have the same character.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Cells Check**: Verifies that all non-diagonal cells have the same character, different from the diagonals.\n5. **Result Output**: Based on the checks, returns whether the grid forms an \"X\" or not.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures all conditions are met with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
