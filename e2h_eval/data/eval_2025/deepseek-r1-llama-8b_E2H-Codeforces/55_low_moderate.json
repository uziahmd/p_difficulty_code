Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. The string is ternary, consisting of '0's, '1's, and '2's. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1's, or between adjacent '1's and '2's. So, I can't directly swap a '0' with a '2', for example.\n\nHmm, the goal is to rearrange the string as much as possible using these swaps to get the smallest possible lex order. Let me think about what that implies.\n\nFirst, let's understand the allowed swaps. If I can swap '0' and '1's, then those two can be reordered among themselves. Similarly, '1's and '2's can be swapped. But '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped. So, how does this affect their positions?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of groups. Like, '0's can only be moved past '1's, but not '2's. Similarly, '1's can be moved past both '0's and '2's, but '2's can't be moved past '0's. Or wait, no— because swapping '1's with '2's allows '2's to move left past '1's, but not '0's. Because '0's can't swap with '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the movement of each character. For instance, the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed because you can't swap them. Because you can't swap '0' and '2', their order remains as in the original string. However, within the '0's and '1's, you can arrange them in any order, and similarly for '1's and '2's.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's clarify:\n\nSuppose the string is \"012\". Can I swap any characters here? Well, '0' and '1' can be swapped, and '1' and '2' can be swapped. So, \"012\" can become \"102\", because I can swap 0 and 1 (positions 1 and 2), then swap 1 and 2 (positions 2 and 3). So, after those two swaps, the string becomes \"102\". But can I make it even smaller? Like \"012\" is already the smallest possible since 0 is first, but if the string was \"021\", could I do something? Oh, in \"021\", the '2' is after '1'. But since I can't swap '2' and '0', the '2' can't move before the '1'. So in \"021\", the '2' is stuck after the '1'.\n\nSo, more accurately, the relative order between '0's and '2's cannot change because they can't be directly swapped. So all '0's must appear before any '2's in the final string. Wait, no. Because '0's can only be swapped with '1's, which allows '0's to move through '1's but not through '2's. So, the '0's can't cross any '2's, because there's no way to swap a '0' past a '2' without being able to swap them directly.\n\nWait, suppose the string is '201'. Can I rearrange it? Since '2' and '0' are adjacent, but I can't swap them. So the '2' is stuck before the '0'. So in this case, the '2' can't move past the '0'. So the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\n\nWait, no, because maybe through other swaps, like moving '1's around, perhaps a '0' can be shifted through '2's via '1's. But I don't think that's possible because you can't swap '0' and '2' directly. So the '0's and '2's can't pass each other. So the initial order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\nSo, the key insight is that the '0's can only be reordered among themselves and with '1's, but cannot cross '2's. Similarly, '2's can only be reordered among themselves and with '1's, but cannot cross '0's.\n\nWait, that might not be entirely correct. Let me think again.\n\nIf a '0' is followed by a '2' in the original string, can they ever switch places? No, because you can't swap '0' and '2'. So their relative order must remain the same.\n\nSo the '0's can't be moved past '2's, and vice versa. So in the final string, all '0's must appear before any '2's, but their relative order among themselves can be arranged. Similarly, all '2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing allowed swaps on a given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1' characters or between adjacent '1' and '2' characters.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot be changed because they cannot be directly swapped. Therefore, any '0' must appear before any '2' in the final string. However, within their own groups, '0's can be reordered among themselves, and '2's can be reordered among themselves. Similarly, '1's can be reordered among themselves and can also move past '0's and '2's as they can swap with both.\n\nGiven this, the approach involves:\n1. Reordering all '0's among themselves to their leftmost positions.\n2. Reordering all '1's among themselves and moving them to the left of '2's.\n3. Reordering all '2's among themselves to their rightmost positions.\n\nThis ensures that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Collect the positions of each character\nzeros = []\nones = []\ntwos = []\n\nfor c in s:\n    if c == '0':\n        zeros.append(c)\n    elif c == '1':\n        ones.append(c)\n    else:\n        twos.append(c)\n\n# Now, construct the result\nresult = []\ni = j = k = 0\n\nwhile i < len(zeros) and j < len(ones):\n    if zeros[i] <= ones[j]:\n        result.append(zeros[i])\n        i += 1\n    else:\n        result.append(ones[j])\n        j += 1\n\nwhile j < len(ones) and k < len(twos):\n    if ones[j] <= twos[k]:\n        result.append(ones[j])\n        j += 1\n    else:\n        result.append(twos[k])\n        k += 1\n\n# Add remaining ones and twos\nwhile j < len(ones):\n    result.append(ones[j])\n    j += 1\n\nwhile k < len(twos):\n    result.append(twos[k])\n    k += 1\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution works by first separating the characters into three lists: `zeros`, `ones`, and `twos`. Then, it constructs the result string by iterating through these lists and appending the smallest possible character at each step, ensuring that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest. The algorithm efficiently combines these lists by comparing the current characters from each list and appending the smaller one, ensuring the smallest possible order while respecting the constraints of allowed swaps. This approach ensures optimal performance even for the maximum input size.",
