    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing certain swap operations. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', or '1' and '2'. So, for example, you can swap '01' to get '10', but you can't swap '02' or '20'.\n\nHmm, right. So the key here is understanding which characters can be moved relative to each other. Because of the allowed swaps, certain positions can be rearranged.\n\nLet me think about what this implies for the order of the characters. Since only 0 and 1 can be swapped, and 1 and 2 can be swapped, but 0 and 2 cannot be directly swapped. So, how do they interact?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph where edges represent whether two characters can be swapped. So, 0 and 1 are connected, and 1 and 2 are connected. But 0 and 2 are not directly connected. However, since 0 and 2 can only be moved via 1, maybe their relative order depends on the presence of 1s.\n\nSo, considering that:\n\n- 0 can move past 1, because they can be swapped.\n- 1 can move past 0 and 2, because both '01' and '12' can be swapped.\n- 2 can move past 1, but not 0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 2 can't be directly swapped with 0, but through 1? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, think of the allowed swaps:\n\n- Any '01' can be swapped to '10'.\n- Any '12' can be swapped to '21'.\n\nSo, 0 and 1 can be reordered, but 0 and 2 can't be reordered except through 1. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a string like \"021\". Can the 0 and 2 be swapped? Well, initially, they're adjacent. If they are '02', can't be swapped. But if there's a 1 in between, perhaps 0 can move past 1, and then 1 can move past 2, allowing 0 to eventually come before 2.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"201\". Can I make it \"021\"?\n\nNo, because 2 and 0 are adjacent. They can't be swapped. So in that case, their order is fixed unless there's a 1 in between.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's see: In the string \"210\", can 2 and 1 be swapped to become \"120\"? Yes, because '12' can be swapped to '21'—wait, no, wait, the allowed swap is between 1 and 2. So, '12' becomes '21' when swapped. So, in \"210\", the '1' and '0' can be swapped, resulting in '201', but that doesn't help with moving 2 and 0.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: group the characters into three categories: zeros, ones, and twos.\n\nThe allowed swaps mean that:\n\n- Zeros can be reordered among themselves via 1s.\n- Ones can be reordered among themselves via 0s and 2s.\n- Twos can be reordered among themselves via 1s.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider that within the string, any 0 can be moved to the left past any number of 1s, but can't move past 2s. Similarly, any 2 can be moved to the left past any 1s, but can't move past 0s. So, the relative order between 0s and 2s is fixed, but 0s can be reordered among themselves as long as they don't have to cross 2s.\n\nWait, no. Because 0s can't be directly moved past 2s. So if a 0 comes before a 2, can it ever be moved after the 2? Only if there's a 1 that can help bridge them.\n\nFor example, suppose we have \"02\". Since 0 and 2 can't be swapped, their order remains. So the string can't be changed.\n\nBut what if the string is \"021\"? Then, perhaps we can swap 2 and 1, but that would require them being adjacent. So in this case, the '12' can be swapped, turning it into '012'. Now, the 0 and 2 are still in the same order, but perhaps that allows more movement.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what the allowed swaps imply for the ordering.\n\nEach allowed swap is between 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. So, any sequence of these swaps can allow a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', or '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that while '0's can be reordered among themselves using '1's, and '2's can be reordered among themselves using '1's, '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped. This means that the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed unless there is a '1' acting as an intermediary. However, due to the nature of the allowed swaps, any '0' can move past '1's and any '2' can move past '1's, but '0's and '2's cannot change their relative order without involving '1's.\n\nGiven this, the approach is to:\n1. Separate the characters into three groups: zeros, ones, and twos.\n2. Reorder each group individually to form the smallest possible string.\n3. Merge these reordered groups back into the final string, ensuring that the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Separate the characters into zeros, ones, and twos\nzeros = []\nones = []\ntwos = []\n\nfor c in s:\n    if c == '0':\n        zeros.append(c)\n    elif c == '1':\n        ones.append(c)\n    else:\n        twos.append(c)\n\n# Now, process each group to create the minimal string\nmin_string = []\n# Process ones first because they can act as a bridge for 0s and 2s\nmin_string.extend(ones)\n# Place all 0s before 2s, since 0s can't cross 2s\nmin_string.extend(zeros)\nmin_string.extend(twos)\n\n# Convert the list back to a string\nresult = ''.join(min_string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Separation of Characters**: We first separate the characters into three lists: zeros, ones, and twos. This helps in processing each group individually.\n2. **Reordering Each Group**: The ones are processed first because they can act as intermediaries for moving zeros and twos. Zeros are placed next since they cannot be reordered relative to twos without a '1' in between. Finally, the twos are appended.\n3. **Constructing the Result**: By merging the processed lists back together, we ensure the smallest lexicographical order while respecting the constraints of allowed swaps.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs the smallest possible string by leveraging the allowed swaps and the constraints on character movement.",
