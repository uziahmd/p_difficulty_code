    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k) is minimized. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, I choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that the LCM of two numbers x and y is equal to (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k), because a larger GCD would reduce the LCM.\n\nWait, but since both a +k and b +k are being added by the same k, their difference is fixed. Let me see: (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So the difference between them is always |a - b|.\n\nLet me denote d as the absolute difference between a and b. So d = |a - b|. Then, for any k, the two numbers are x = a +k and y = b +k. Their difference is d, so x - y = d (assuming a > b, else it's negative).\n\nSo, the GCD of x and y must divide their difference, which is d. Therefore, the GCD can be any divisor of d. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the key here is to find a value of k that makes the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) as large as possible. Because that will minimize the LCM.\n\nSo, the plan is: find all possible divisors of d, and for each divisor g, compute the possible k that would make (a +k) divisible by g, and then check if (b +k) is also divisible by g. Because if that's true, then the GCD would be at least g.\n\nBut wait, maybe more precisely: For a given g that divides d, we want to find k such that g divides (a +k) and (b +k). Since (a +k) - (b +k) = d, and g divides d, this condition is equivalent to g dividing (a +k) and (g divides (b +k)) because their difference is d, which is divisible by g.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, we can try to find the smallest k that satisfies:\n\n(a +k) mod g == 0\n(b +k) mod g == 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nk ≡ (-a) mod g\nand\nk ≡ (-b) mod g\n\nBut since (a +k) - (b +k) = d, which is divisible by g, these two congruences are compatible. So for each g, we can solve for k.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|\n2. Find all divisors of d.\n3. For each divisor g (including 1 and d), in decreasing order:\n   a. Check if g is a common divisor of both (a +k) and (b +k). Wait, no, actually, since g divides d, the difference, the conditions are as above.\n   b. Find the smallest k >=0 such that (a +k) is divisible by g. Then check if (b +k) is also divisible by g. Because (b +k) = (a +k) - (a - b) = (a +k) - d. So if (a +k) is divisible by g, then (b +k) is (a +k) -d. Since d is divisible by g, then (b +k) is also divisible by g. So, once (a +k) is divisible by g, (b +k) will automatically be as well.\n\nSo for each g (divisor of d), the minimal k is (g - a % g) % g. Because a +k ≡ 0 mod g → k ≡ (-a) mod g → so the smallest non-negative k is (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\nWait, but wait: For example, if a mod g is zero, then k is zero. Otherwise, k is g - (a mod g). So yes, the formula is correct.\n\nSo for each g, compute k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g. Then, calculate the LCM of (a + k_candidate) and (b + k_candidate). But since g is a divisor of d, the LCM would be ((a +k)*(b +k)) / g. Wait, no. The LCM is (x * y) / gcd(x, y). And since x and y are both multiples of g, their GCD is at least g. But it might be higher. So",

If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The LCM of two numbers can be minimized by maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD). Given two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), let \\( d \\) be the absolute difference between them, i.e., \\( d = |a - b| \\). The GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of \\( d \\).\n\n2. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), we can determine the smallest \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are multiples of \\( g \\). This ensures that the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is at least \\( g \\), thus minimizing the LCM.\n\n3. **Finding \\( k \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) using the formula \\( k = (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\). This \\( k \\) ensures that \\( a + k \\) is divisible by \\( g \\).\n\n4. **Optimal \\( k \\)**: Among all possible values of \\( k \\) derived from different divisors, select the one that yields the smallest LCM. If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same LCM, choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_min_k(a, b):\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Find all divisors of d\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    \n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    \n    for g in sorted(divisors, reverse=True):\n        a_mod = a % g\n        k_candidate = (g - a_mod) % g\n        x = a + k_candidate\n        y = b + k_candidate\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x // current_gcd) * y\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate\n    \n    return best_k\n\n# Read input\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_min_k(a, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Compute \\( d \\)**: The absolute difference \\( d \\) is calculated.\n3. **Find Divisors**: All divisors of \\( d \\) are found to determine potential GCD values.\n4. **Iterate Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the smallest \\( k \\) that makes both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) multiples of \\( g \\).\n5. **Calculate LCM**: For each candidate \\( k \\), compute the resulting LCM and track the minimum LCM and corresponding \\( k \\).\n6. **Output Result**: The smallest \\( k \\) that yields the minimum LCM is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
