    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the plate is w by h in size, and we add k rings of gilding. Each ring is like a border around the inner rectangle. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, and so on. Each ring is 1 cell thick.\n\nHmm, the key is to figure out for each ring how many cells are added and sum them up until we reach k rings.\n\nLet's think about what each ring contributes. For the i-th ring (starting from 1), the dimensions of the rectangle it's bordering are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). Because each ring reduces both width and height by 2 on each side—so total reduction per ring is 4.\n\nWait, no. Wait: each ring is one cell thick. So for each ring, the outermost is the first, which has a perimeter of w*h minus the corners counted twice. Or wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the perimeter.\n\nWait, for a rectangle of size W x H, the number of cells in the perimeter (the ring) is 2*W + 2*H -4. Because for each row, you have W cells, but the top and bottom rows are all included. But the four corners are counted twice if you just do 2*(W+H). So subtract 4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each ring i, the current width is w_i = w - 2*(i-1)*2? Wait, no, because each ring reduces the possible maximum by 2 on each side. So after i rings, the width is w - 2*i*2? Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think of it as each ring being one cell inward. So the first ring is the outermost, which is the original rectangle. The second ring is two cells inward on each side. So the width for the i-th ring would be w - 2*(i-1)*2? No, wait: for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). So for each ring, both dimensions decrease by 4 each step.\n\nWait, for i=1, the rectangle is w x h. For i=2, it's w-4*1= w-4, h-4*1= h-4. For i=3, w-8, h-8, etc.\n\nBut wait, each ring is built on the inner rectangle. So the i-th ring is the perimeter of a rectangle of size (w -4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). So for each ring i, the number of cells is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, where current_w = w -4*(i-1), current_h = h -4*(i-1).\n\nBut wait, only if current_w and current_h are greater than or equal to 3, right? Because if they become less than 3, the ring can't exist. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's within the floor of (min(w, h)+1)/4. So for k rings, the current_w and current_h will always be at least 1 each, but for the last ring, they might be smaller.\n\nWait, no. Let me see: the maximum possible rings is floor( (min(w, h) +1 ) /4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 7, then (7+1)/4 is 2, so max 2 rings. So each ring i can go up to when current_w and current_h are >= 3? Or does it matter?\n\nWait, for a rectangle of width and height 3, the perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8 cells. So that's correct.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of (w -4*(i-1))*(h-4*(i-1)) as 2*( (w -4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) ) -4, and sum all these perimeters.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\n    current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n    if current_w < 3 or current_h <3:\n        break? Or not, since the problem says k is valid.\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) -4\n    total += perimeter\n\nReturn total\n\nWait, but what if during the loop, current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Then the perimeter would be invalid. But the problem states that k is given in such a way that it's a valid number of rings. So we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    cw = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n    sum += perimeter\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, let's test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1\n\ncw =3, ch=3. perimeter =2*(3+3)-4= 12-4=8. Output 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1.\n\ncw=7, ch=9.\n\nperimeter= 2*(16) -4=32-4=28. Output is 28. Correct.\n\nThird example:7 9 2.\n\nFirst ring:7x9: 2*(16)=32-4=28.\n\nSecond ring:7-4=3, 9-4=5. 3x5: perimeter is 2*(8) -4=16-4=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code will read three integers from input, split into w, h, k.\n\nThen loop i from 1 to k inclusive.\n\nCompute cw and ch for each i.\n\nCompute perimeter, add to sum.\n\nFinally, print the sum.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into parts.\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nTesting with the examples:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n7 9 1 →28.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n7 9 2→28+12=40.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when k is larger than possible?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, k is given such that it's valid, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16. So output is 16.\n\nIf k=2: 5x5 →16, next ring is (5-4)=1x(5-4)=1. Perimeter is 2*(1+1)-4=4-4=0. So total 16.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says that for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w-4(i-1)) × (h-4(i-1)). So for i=2, it's 1x1. So the perimeter is zero.\n\nSo the code will correctly compute that.\n\nAnother test case: w=7, h=7, k=2.\n\ni=1: 7x7 → 2*14-4=24.\n\ni=2:3x3 → 2*(6)-4=8.\n\nTotal 32.\n\nSo output is 32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's all. Now, write the code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around a rectangle, and each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells on each side). The number of cells in each ring can be calculated using the perimeter formula for a rectangle.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For a rectangle of dimensions `W x H`, the perimeter (number of cells in the border) is given by `2 * (W + H) - 4`. This accounts for the fact that the four corners are counted twice if we simply add the width and height.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height by subtracting 4 cells for each previous ring. Calculate the perimeter for each ring and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width, height, and number of rings.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height by reducing the original dimensions by 4 cells for each preceding ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each current width and height, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4` and add this to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
