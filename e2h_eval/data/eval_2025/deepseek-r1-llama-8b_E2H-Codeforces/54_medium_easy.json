Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options, any will do.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to understand what kind of angles can be formed in a regular polygon. Since it's regular, all central angles are equal. The measure of each central angle is 360/n degrees. But when considering the internal angles formed by three vertices, especially in a convex polygon, the angles can vary based on how many steps apart the vertices are.\n\nWait, let me think. For a regular polygon, the internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But that's the angle at each vertex of the polygon. However, when we choose three vertices, the angle formed can be different depending on the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nSo, for example, in a square (n=4), choosing three consecutive vertices would form a right angle (90 degrees). But if you pick every other vertex, you get a 45-degree angle.\n\nSo the idea is to find all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3) where v2 is between v1 and v3 in the polygon, and calculate the angle at v2. Then find which triplet gives the angle closest to 'a'.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, so the number of triplets could be O(n^3), which for n=105 is around 1 million, which should be manageable for Python.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Because the polygon is regular, the angles formed by choosing k steps away on either side from v2 can be determined by some formula.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's fix v2 as some vertex. Then, v1 is k steps before v2, and v3 is m steps after v2, or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the positions as points on a circle. Each vertex is equally spaced around the circle. So the central angle between consecutive vertices is theta = 360/(n) degrees.\n\nNow, for any triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle at v2 depends on the arcs between v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. Since the polygon is convex, the angle will be determined by the smaller arcs between these points.\n\nWait, in a convex polygon, any three points selected will form a triangle where the angle at v2 is determined by the two edges from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The angle can be calculated based on the arcs subtended by those edges.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the measure of the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, no— wait, I think in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 is 0.5 * (arc length between v1 and v3 not passing through v2).\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the arc length between v1 and v3 can be computed based on how many steps they are apart.\n\nWait, let me clarify: suppose the polygon has vertices arranged on a circle. The central angle between two consecutive vertices is theta = 360 / n degrees. So the number of steps between two vertices determines the central angle.\n\nFor example, if two vertices are k steps apart (in the shorter path), the central angle between them is k*theta. Now, the inscribed angle at v2 for the arc between v1 and v3 is (k * theta) / 2 degrees.\n\nWait, no. Because the inscribed angle depends on the arc that is opposite to it. So if v1 and v3 are s steps apart along the circumference (the minor arc), then the inscribed angle at v2 is s * theta / 2.\n\nWait, but that's only if v2 is on the opposite side of the arc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3. Let's say the distance from v2 to v1 is d1 steps and from v2 to v3 is d2 steps in one direction. Then the total distance between v1 and v3 in the other direction is (d1 + d2) steps, modulo n.\n\nWait, but since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 will be formed by the two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The angle between these two chords can be calculated using the formula involving the central angles.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose that v2 is fixed. Then, the position of v1 can be k steps before v2, and v3 can be m steps after v2. Or vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 can be determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the same direction. Let's denote k as the number of steps from v1 to v2, and m as the number of steps from v2 to v3, going clockwise. Then, the arc between v1 and v3, going the other way around the polygon, is (n - k - m) steps.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the steps from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3 in the same direction is k + m steps. But the arc from v1 to v3 via the other direction is (n - (k + m)) steps. So the central angle for this arc is (n - k - m) * theta degrees.\n\nThen, the inscribed angle at v2 would be half of this, because the inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\nSo the angle at v2 is ((n - k - m) * theta) / 2.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, let's test with an example. Take a square (n=4), theta=90 degrees. Let's fix v2 as vertex 2. Suppose v1 is vertex 1 (one step before v2) and v3 is vertex 3 (one step after v2). Then the arc from v1 to v3 via the other direction is 2 steps (from 1 to 4 to 3?), no. Wait, 1 and 3 are two steps apart in the square. So the central angle is 180 degrees. The inscribed angle at v2 is 90 degrees, which is correct.\n\nYes, that matches. So the formula seems to hold.\n\nAnother example: n=3, which is a triangle. Theta=120 degrees. Suppose v2 is vertex 1, v1 is vertex 3, and v3 is vertex 2. The arc from v1 to v3 via the other direction is 2 steps (since moving from 3 to 1 is one step, but the other way is two steps). So the central angle is 2 * 120 = 240 degrees? Wait, no, wait— wait, the arc from v1 (3) to v3 (2) in the square isn't directly applicable. Maybe I should think in terms of steps between the points.\n\nWait, for a triangle, the three vertices are 1, 2, 3 arranged in order. If v2 is 2, then v1 is 1 (k=1 step before) and v3 is 3 (m=1 step after). The arc from v1 to v3 via the other direction is 2 steps (since in a triangle, the other way around is 2 steps). So the central angle is 2*120=240 degrees. The inscribed angle is 240/2=120 degrees. Which is correct because in a triangle, all angles are 60 degrees. Wait, no— that can't be right. Oh wait, no, the triangle has internal angles of 60 degrees each, but when you pick three vertices, the angle formed at v2 is 60 degrees. Hmm, so perhaps my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the intercepted arc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. So in the triangle case, the angle at v2 is formed by the two sides from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The intercepted arc is the one that doesn't include v2.\n\nIn a triangle, any three vertices form an equilateral triangle, so each internal angle is 60 degrees. So the angle at v2 is 60 degrees. So according to the formula, the intercepted arc would be 120 degrees (since 60*2=120). So the intercepted arc is 120 degrees, which makes sense.\n\nWait, let's see: for the triangle, each edge is 120 degrees in central angle. So when v2 is 2, the arc from v1=1 to v3=3 is 2 steps, which is 2*120=240 degrees. But the intercepted arc for the angle at v2 is the arc opposite to it, which is the other arc between v1 and v3. So the intercepted arc is 2*120=240 degrees, but that's larger than 180, so perhaps the formula uses the minor arc.\n\nAh, right! So the intercepted arc is the minor arc between v1 and v3. So in the triangle case, the minor arc between 1 and 3 is 2 steps, which is 240 degrees, but that's more than 180. So wait, no, in a triangle, the distance between 1 and 3 is 2 steps, which is 2*120=240 degrees, but the minor arc is 120 degrees (since the full circle is 360, and 240 is larger than 120, but wait, no, 240 is larger than 120, but 240 is the major arc. So the minor arc is 120 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, for n=3, the polygon is a triangle. The distance between 1 and 3 is 2 steps, which is 2*120=240 degrees. But since the polygon is convex, the minor arc is 120 degrees (since 240 is the major arc). So the intercepted arc is the minor arc of 120 degrees.\n\nSo the inscribed angle is 60 degrees, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula should take into account whether the arc is the minor or major. So the intercepted arc is the minimum between the two possible arcs between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, but in a regular polygon, the intercepted arc for the angle at v2 is the one that doesn't contain v2. So the number of steps between v1 and v3 in that direction is (d) steps, where d is such that the arc is the minor arc if d < n/2.\n\nWait, no. Because the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't pass through v2. So the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't pass through v2 is (k + m) steps, but perhaps that's the major arc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the intercepted arc as follows: the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the polygon, not passing through v2. So if v2 is fixed, and v1 is k steps before, v3 is m steps after, then the intercepted arc is (k + m) steps. But if (k + m) > n/2, then the intercepted arc is n - (k + m) steps.\n\nWait, no, because in the triangle example, v2 is 2, v1 is 1 (k=1), v3 is 3 (m=1). So k + m = 2 steps. Since n=3, the intercepted arc is 2 steps, but in reality, the intercepted arc is 1 step (because the other way is 2 steps, but the minor arc is 1 step). So I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nMaybe another approach: for any triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 in the polygon, but not including the path through v2.\n\nSo, the intercepted arc is the minimal distance between v1 and v3 in the polygon, which is min(d, n-d), where d is the number of steps between them.\n\nSo for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 is (min(d, n-d) * theta) / 2, where theta is 360/n degrees.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the intercepted arc is the minimal distance between v1 and v3, which is min(d, n-d) steps. So the angle is (min(d, n-d) * theta) / 2.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3) such that v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2, and the number of steps between v1 and v3 is d, which is min(d, n-d) steps. Then compute the angle as (d * theta) / 2, where theta is 360/n.\n\nWe need to find the triplet that minimizes the absolute difference between this angle and 'a'.\n\nOur goal is to find the triplet that makes this angle as close as possible to 'a'. Among all possible triplets, choose the one that has the smallest |computed_angle - a|. If there are multiple, any is acceptable.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible v2 in 1..n.\n\n2. For each v2, iterate over possible distances k and m, where k is the number of steps from v2 to v1 (clockwise), and m is the number of steps from v2 to v3 (clockwise). Wait, but v1 and v3 must be on opposite sides of v2, so perhaps k is the steps in one direction and m in the other, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, for each v2, consider all possible pairs (d1, d2) where d1 is the number of steps from v2 to v1 in one direction, and d2 is the number of steps from v2 to v3 in the other direction. So d1 and d2 are non-negative integers, and d1 + d2 can be up to (n-1), but perhaps not necessary.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the distance between v1 and v3. For a given v2, the minimal distance between v1 and v3 is d, which is min(k + m, n - (k + m)), where k is the steps from v2 to v1 in one direction, and m is the steps from v2 to v3 in the same direction. Or maybe I'm mixing directions.\n\nAlternatively, for a given v2, the distance between v1 and v3 is the minimal number of steps between them, which could be achieved by moving in the same direction or the opposite.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the distance between v1 and v3 as the minimal number of steps, regardless of direction. So for any v1 and v3, their distance is min(|i-j|, n - |i-j|). But for our case, when v2 is fixed, the distance between v1 and v3 is determined by how far they are from v2 on either side.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each v2, the possible angles are determined by the distances d1 and d2, where d1 is the number of steps from v2 to v1 in one direction, and d2 is the number of steps from v2 to v3 in the other direction. Or wait, perhaps d1 is the number of steps in one direction, and d3 is the number of steps in the other direction.\n\nNo, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think differently.\n\nFor each v2, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3. So for a given v2, the minimal distance between v1 and v3 is d, and the angle is (d * theta) / 2, where theta is 360/n.\n\nSo for each v2, the possible d can range from 1 to floor((n-1)/2), because beyond that, it's the same as the other side.\n\nWait, for example, in a square (n=4), the minimal distances can be 1 or 2. But 2 is the maximum minimal distance because beyond that, it wraps around.\n\nSo for each v2, the possible d can be from 1 to floor((n-1)/2). For each d, the angle is (d * theta) / 2. We can compute the angle for each d and see how close it is to 'a'.\n\nBut wait, for each v2, the minimal distance between v1 and v3 can be any d in 1..max_d, where max_d is the maximum possible minimal distance for that polygon. But since the polygon is regular, the maximum minimal distance is floor(n/2) - 1, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each v2, the minimal distance between v1 and v3 can be any value from 1 to (n-1)/2, inclusive. Because beyond that, it's the same as the other side.\n\nWait, for n even, say n=4, the maximum minimal distance is 2 (since 4/2=2). For n=5, the maximum is 2 (since 5/2 is 2.5, floor is 2). So yes, the maximum d is floor((n-1)/2).\n\nSo, for each v2, the possible d values are 1, 2, ..., up to floor((n-1)/2). For each d, the corresponding angle is (d * theta) / 2, where theta=360/n.\n\nSo for each v2, we can precompute all possible d and the corresponding angle, and then for each possible d, compute the difference with 'a', and keep track of the best option.\n\nWait, but for a given v2 and d, how do we know which v1 and v3 to choose to get that d?\n\nBecause for a given v2 and d, there are multiple possible (v1, v3) pairs that achieve that d. For example, in a square (n=4), v2 is 2. For d=1, the possible pairs are (1,3) and (3,1). For d=2, the pairs are (1,4) and (4,1), but wait, wait— no, in a square, the minimal distance between 1 and 4 is 1 step (since the other way is 3 steps, so minimal is 1). Wait, no, wait— no, for n=4, the distance between 1 and 4 is 3 steps clockwise, but the minimal is 1 step counter-clockwise. So for v2=2, d=2 steps is the minimal distance between 1 and 3, which is 2 steps clockwise. So the angle would be (2 * 90)/2 = 90 degrees.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each v2 and d, the v1 and v3 can be uniquely determined as v2 - d and v2 + d, but that's only true for certain cases. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose v2 is fixed. Then, for a given d, the v1 is v2 - d (mod n), and v3 is v2 + d (mod n). But the minimal distance between v1 and v3 is d steps, since moving from v1 to v3 is d steps in the same direction as the movement from v2 to v1.\n\nWait, but in the square example, v2 is 2, d=2 steps. v1 is 0 (but since we're numbered starting at 1, that's 4), v3 is 4 (which is 0 mod 4). The distance between 4 and 4 is zero, which is not allowed. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. For v2, the v1 is d steps before v2 in the clockwise direction, and v3 is d steps after v2 in the clockwise direction. Then, the distance between v1 and v3 is (d + d) steps, but that's only if n is large enough. Otherwise, it wraps around.\n\nWait, no. Let's think for n=4:\n\nv2 is 2.\n\nd=1: v1 is 1, v3 is 3. Distance between 1 and 3 is 2 steps (clockwise), but the minimal is 2 steps. So the angle is (2 * 90)/2=90 degrees.\n\nd=2: v1 is 2-2=0, which is 4, and v3 is 2+2=4. So v1 is 4 and v3 is 4— but they are the same point, which is invalid because the three points must be distinct.\n\nSo that approach won't work for d=2.\n\nHmm, so perhaps for each v2, the possible d is from 1 to (n-1)//2, but for each d, there are two possibilities: one where v1 is d steps before v2, and v3 is d steps after, giving a distance of 2d steps, but possibly wrapping around. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal distance is min(2d, n - 2d). Wait, that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal distance between v1 and v3 is d, and for each d, the angle is (d * theta)/2.\n\nSo, for a given v2 and d, the angle is (d * theta)/2. But the actual distance between v1 and v3 is d, which is the minimal.\n\nBut how to find v1 and v3 for a given d and v2.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the possible d ranges from 1 to (n-1)//2. For each d, we can construct v1 as (v2 - d) mod n, and v3 as (v2 + d) mod n. Then, the minimal distance between v1 and v3 is min(2d, n-2d). Wait, no— because 2d steps in the same direction may wrap around.\n\nWait, for example, in n=4, v2=2, d=2: v1=0 mod 4 is 4, v3=4 mod 4 is 4. So v1 and v3 are the same point. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo perhaps for each v2 and d, the minimal distance between v1 and v3 is d, but only if 2d <= n. Otherwise, the minimal distance is n - 2d.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the distance between v1 and v3 as the minimal of |v3 - v1| and n - |v3 - v1|.\n\nSo for each v2, and for each possible d, we can compute the angle as (d * theta)/2, and then check if that angle is close to 'a'. But how to determine the valid (v1, v3) pairs for each d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each v2, the possible d can be from 1 to (n-1)//2. For each d, the angle is (d * theta)/2. We can compute this angle and see if it's better than the current best.\n\nBut for each such d, how do we get v1 and v3?\n\nWell, for each v2, and for each d, the v1 is (v2 - d) mod n, and v3 is (v2 + d) mod n. Then, the distance between v1 and v3 is 2d, but if 2d exceeds n, then the minimal distance is n - 2d. So for the angle to be (d * theta)/2, the minimal distance must be d. So, 2d must be less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because if 2d <=n, then the distance between v1 and v3 is 2d steps, and the minimal is 2d. But if 2d >n, then the minimal is n - 2d steps.\n\nWait, no. Because 2d steps in the same direction is a longer path, so the minimal distance is min(2d, n - 2d). So for 2d <=n/2, the minimal distance is 2d. For 2d> n/2, it's n-2d.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should instead, for each v2 and for each possible d (number of steps from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 in the same direction), compute the minimal distance between v1 and v3, and then compute the angle accordingly.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to generate all possible triplets and calculate the angle for each, then find the triplet with the minimal difference.\n\nBut n can be up to 105, so the number of triplets is n*(n-1)*(n-2), which is about 105*104*103= around 1.1 million. That's manageable.\n\nWait, 105*104=10920, 10920*103 is 1,124,760. That's acceptable for Python.\n\nSo perhaps the straightforward approach is to iterate all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3), compute the angle at v2, and track the triplet with the minimal difference.\n\nBut wait, how to compute the angle at v2 for a given triplet (v1, v2, v3)?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the angle is (d * theta)/2, where d is the minimal distance between v1 and v3. Theta is 360/n degrees.\n\nSo for a triplet (v1, v2, v3), compute the minimal distance between v1 and v3. Then angle = (d * (360/n)) / 2.\n\nSo, for each triplet, we can compute this angle, then compare it to 'a' and track the minimal difference.\n\nIf there are multiple triplets with the same minimal difference, any can be chosen.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read n and a.\n\n2. Precompute theta = 360.0 / n.\n\n3. Initialize variables to track the best triplet: best_diff (initialized to a very large number), best_v1, best_v2, best_v3.\n\n4. Iterate v2 from 1 to n.\n\n   a. For each v2, iterate v1 from 1 to n, v1 != v2.\n\n      i. For each v1, iterate v3 from 1 to n, v3 != v2, v3 !=v1.\n\n         - Compute the distance between v1 and v3. Since the polygon is circular, the distance is min( abs(v3 -v1), n - abs(v3 -v1) )\n\n         - So d = min( abs(v3 -v1), n - abs(v3 -v1) )\n\n         - Compute angle = (d * theta) / 2\n\n         - Compute the absolute difference between angle and a.\n\n         - If this difference is less than best_diff, update best_diff and store the triplet.\n\n         - If difference is equal to best_diff, and the triplet is better in some way (like lex order), perhaps we can choose it, but the problem allows any.\n\n5. After all triplets are considered, output the best_v1, best_v2, best_v3.\n\nBut wait, this approach will have O(n^3) time complexity, which for n=105 is about 1.1e6 operations. That's acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For each v2, the possible d can be from 1 to (n-1)//2, and for each d, the angle is (d * theta)/2. So for each v2, the best d is the one that's closest to (2a)/theta. Because angle = (d * theta)/2 = (d * (360/n))/2 = (d * 180)/n degrees.\n\nWait, because theta is 360/n. So the angle is (d * theta)/2 = (d * 360/(2n)) ) = (180 d)/n degrees.\n\nSo, the angle is (180*d)/n degrees. So, for a given v2, the optimal d is the one that is closest to (a * n)/(180). Because (180 d)/n ≈ a → d ≈ (a *n)/180.\n\nSo for each v2, the best d is floor( (a*n)/(180) ), or ceil, etc., and then compute the angle.\n\nBut perhaps for each v2, the best d is the one that, when multiplied by (180/n), is as close as possible to a. So for each v2, compute d_opt = (a *n )/(180) → then round to nearest integer, and check d_opt and d_opt ±1.\n\nThis can reduce the computation from O(n^3) to O(n^2), which is better.\n\nWait, but for each v2, the possible d's are 1, 2, ..., up to (n-1)//2. So for each v2, we can find the d that is closest to (a *n)/180, and then evaluate that d and possibly d±1.\n\nThis can reduce the number of computations per v2.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each v2 in 1..n:\n\n   Compute d_opt = (a *n ) / 180. Round to nearest integer.\n\n   For d in [d_opt-1, d_opt, d_opt+1], ensuring that d is within 1..max_d.\n\n   For each d in this set, compute the angle, and then find the v1 and v3 that give this d.\n\n   Compute the angle and compare to the best.\n\nThis would significantly reduce the number of triplets to check.\n\nBut then, how to find v1 and v3 for a given d and v2.\n\nWait, for a given v2 and d, the minimal distance between v1 and v3 is d steps. So v1 can be (v2 - d) mod n, and v3 can be (v2 + d) mod n. But we need to ensure that v1 and v3 are distinct and different from v2.\n\nWait, but in some cases, adding d to v2 may wrap around and land on the same point as v1, but that's only possible if 2d ==n.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nv1 = v2 - d steps in the clockwise direction (mod n)\n\nv3 = v2 + d steps in the clockwise direction (mod n)\n\nBut then, the distance between v1 and v3 is 2d steps, which may exceed n, so the minimal distance is min(2d, n-2d). So if 2d >n, then the minimal distance is n-2d. So in that case, the angle is ( (n-2d) * theta ) / 2.\n\nSo perhaps for each v2 and d, the angle is ( min(2d, n-2d) * theta ) / 2.\n\nSo, for each v2 and d, compute the angle, and then find the triplet.\n\nSo for each v2 and d, the triplet is (v2 -d, v2, v2 +d), but we need to make sure that v1 and v3 are distinct and not equal to v2.\n\nWait, but in code, since the polygon is 1-based, perhaps it's better to represent the positions as 0-based, but then convert back when outputting.\n\nAlternatively, handle everything as 1-based.\n\nSo, for v2 in 1..n:\n\n   for d in possible_d:\n\n      v1 = v2 -d\n\n      if v1 <1: v1 +=n\n\n      v3 = v2 +d\n\n      if v3 >n: v3 -=n\n\n      but wait, this may not always give the minimal distance. Because sometimes, adding d may go beyond n, so v3 is v2 +d mod n.\n\nWait, perhaps for v1, it's (v2 -d) mod n, but since we are dealing with 1-based indices, perhaps adding n and then mod n.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute v1 as (v2 -d -1) %n +1.\n\nSimilarly, v3 as (v2 +d -1) %n +1.\n\nYes, that's a standard way to compute modular arithmetic with 1-based indices.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nv1 = (v2 -d -1) %n +1\n\nv3 = (v2 +d -1) %n +1\n\nThen, the distance between v1 and v3 is min( (v3 -v1) %n, (n - (v3 -v1) %n) )\n\nWait, but in code, (v3 -v1) can be negative, but modulo n ensures it's positive. So the minimal distance is min( (v3 -v1) %n, n - ( (v3 -v1) %n ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to min( (v3 -v1) %n, n - ( (v3 -v1) %n ) )\n\nSo, for a given v2 and d, the distance between v1 and v3 is min( (v3 -v1) %n, n - ( (v3 -v1) %n ) )\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nIf v3 is v2 +d, and v1 is v2 -d, then the distance between v1 and v3 is 2d steps in the same direction. But if 2d >n, then the minimal distance is n -2d steps.\n\nSo, for the triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle is (d' * theta)/2, where d' is min(2d, n-2d).\n\nWait, but in the earlier approach, d is the number of steps from v2 to v1 in one direction, but perhaps the minimal distance between v1 and v3 is min(2d, n-2d).\n\nSo, perhaps the angle is (min(2d, n-2d) * theta)/2.\n\nSo, for each v2 and d, we can compute this angle.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nFor each v2 in 1..n:\n\n   for d in 1..max_d:\n\n      compute angle as ( min(2d, n-2d) * theta ) / 2\n\n      compute the difference between this angle and 'a'\n\n      if this difference is better than the current best, record the triplet\n\nBut wait, this would require for each v2 and d to compute the angle, but without iterating through all possible triplets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each v2, the best d is the one that, when multiplied by 180/n, is as close as possible to a.\n\nSo, for each v2:\n\n   compute d_opt = a *n / 180 → rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n   check d_opt -1, d_opt, d_opt +1, but within 1..max_d.\n\n   for each d in that range:\n\n      compute the minimal distance between v1 and v3 as min(2d, n-2d)\n\n      compute angle = (minimal_distance * theta ) /2\n\n      compute difference.\n\n      if this is better, update best.\n\nThis reduces the per-v2 computation to checking a few d's, say 3 per v2, leading to O(n^2) time.\n\nThis is much better.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute theta = 360.0 /n\n\nFor each v2 in 1..n:\n\n   compute d_opt = (a *n) / 180 → rounded to nearest integer.\n\n   for d in [d_opt -1, d_opt, d_opt +1]:\n\n      if d is <1 or > max_d: skip.\n\n      compute minimal_distance = min(2*d, n-2*d)\n\n      angle = (minimal_distance * theta ) / 2\n\n      compute the difference between angle and a.\n\n      if this difference is less than current best:\n\n          update best with this triplet.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps check the adjacent d's beyond d_opt+1 or before d_opt-1 if needed.\n\nBut perhaps 3 d's per v2 is sufficient.\n\nOnce all v2 and d's are processed, the best triplet is found.\n\nWait, but what if d_opt is 0 or negative? Or beyond max_d?\n\nWe need to handle those cases.\n\nFor example, if a=0, which is impossible because a>=1.\n\nBut the code should handle any a.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_d = (n-1) // 2\n\nfor v2 in 1..n:\n\n   d_opt = (a *n ) / 180\n\n   d_opt = round(d_opt)\n\n   for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:\n\n       d_candidate = d_opt + delta\n\n       if d_candidate <1 or d_candidate > max_d:\n\n           continue\n\n       # compute the minimal distance between v1 and v3\n\n       min_dist = min( 2*d_candidate, n - 2*d_candidate )\n\n       angle = (min_dist * 360.0 /n ) /2\n\n       diff = abs( angle - a )\n\n       if diff < best_diff:\n\n           best_diff = diff\n\n           best_v1 = v2 - d_candidate\n\n           best_v2 = v2\n\n           best_v3 = v2 + d_candidate\n\n           # but adjust for 1-based indices\n\n           # compute v1 as (v2 -d_candidate -1) %n +1\n\n           v1 = (v2 - d_candidate -1) %n +1\n\n           v3 = (v2 + d_candidate -1) %n +1\n\n           # ensure they are distinct and not v2\n\n           # but since d_candidate >=1, v1 and v3 can't be same as v2.\n\n           # Also, since d_candidate",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The solution involves calculating the possible angles formed by different triplets of vertices and selecting the triplet with the angle closest to 'a'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon**: A regular polygon has equal sides and angles. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle.\n2. **Central and Inscribed Angles**: The central angle between two consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. The inscribed angle at any vertex can be calculated based on the number of steps between two other vertices.\n3. **Optimal Angle Calculation**: For each vertex v2, consider possible distances d from v2 to vertices v1 and v3. The angle at v2 is determined by the minimal distance between v1 and v3, which can be computed using modular arithmetic.\n4. **Efficient Search**: Instead of checking all possible triplets, we compute potential distances around the optimal value derived from 'a'. This reduces the number of checks significantly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\ntheta = 360.0 / n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v1 = best_v2 = best_v3 = None\n\nmax_d = (n - 1) // 2\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n + 1):\n    d_opt = (a * n) / 180.0\n    d_opt = round(d_opt)\n    for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        d_candidate = d_opt + delta\n        if d_candidate < 1 or d_candidate > max_d:\n            continue\n        # Compute v1 and v3\n        v1 = (v2 - d_candidate - 1) % n + 1\n        v3 = (v2 + d_candidate - 1) % n + 1\n        # Ensure they are distinct and not v2\n        if v1 == v2 or v3 == v2:\n            continue\n        if v1 == v3:\n            continue\n        # Calculate the minimal distance between v1 and v3\n        min_dist = min(abs(v3 - v1), n - abs(v3 - v1))\n        angle = (min_dist * theta) / 2\n        current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if current_diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = current_diff\n            best_v1, best_v2, best_v3 = v1, v2, v3\n        elif current_diff == best_diff and ((v1 < best_v1) or \n                                            (v1 == best_v1 and v3 < best_v3) or\n                                            (v1 == best_v1 and v3 == best_v3 and v2 < best_v2)):\n            best_v1, best_v2, best_v3 = v1, v2, v3\n\nprint(f\"{best_v1} {best_v2} {best_v3}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n2. **Initialization**: Calculate the central angle theta and initialize variables to track the best triplet.\n3. **Iterate Over Vertices**: For each vertex v2, determine the optimal distance d based on the target angle 'a'.\n4. **Check Nearby Distances**: Evaluate distances around the optimal d to find the closest angle to 'a'.\n5. **Compute Angles**: For each candidate distance, compute the angle at v2 and check if it is the closest found so far.\n6. **Output Result**: Print the triplet with the closest angle to 'a'.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the potential triplets by focusing on relevant distances, ensuring the solution is both optimal and efficient.",
