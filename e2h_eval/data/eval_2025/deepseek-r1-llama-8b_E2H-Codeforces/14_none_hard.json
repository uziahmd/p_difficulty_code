He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

It then iterates over numbers from `n` to `n + 100` and checks if the factorial of each number ends with `m` zeroes. If it does, it adds the number to the result list. Finally, it prints the length of the result list and the elements of the result list.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that there are at most 100 numbers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with `m` zeroes. If there are more than 100 such numbers, you may need to increase the range in the script.\n\nAlso, please note that this script has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the number of numbers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with `m` zeroes. This is because we are iterating over numbers from `n` to `n + 100` and checking if the factorial of each number ends with `m` zeroes.",
