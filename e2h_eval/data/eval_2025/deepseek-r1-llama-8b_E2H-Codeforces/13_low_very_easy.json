For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given triad (a set of three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The definition of major and minor chords is based on the distances between the notes in a certain order.\n\nHmm, the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, that can't be right. Because in music, after H comes C again, right? So the sequence is cyclic. So there are 12 notes in total. But wait, in the list, it's written as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh wait, that's 12 notes: let me count. C is first, then C# (2), D (3), D# (4), E (5), F (6), F# (7), G (8), G# (9), A (10), B (11), H (12). Yes, 12 notes.\n\nThe distance between consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. So for example, the distance from C to D is 2 semitones, because they are two steps apart.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each step is a semitone. So between C and C# is 1 semitone, C to D is 2, etc.\n\nNow, the chord is an unordered set of three notes. We need to check if it can form a major or minor triad.\n\nWhat defines a major triad? It needs to be possible to arrange the three notes X, Y, Z such that:\n\n- Distance from X to Y is 4 semitones.\n- Distance from Y to Z is 3 semitones.\n\nAnd for minor triad:\n\n- Distance from X to Y is 3 semitones.\n- Distance from Y to Z is 4 semitones.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the chord is considered as a set, so the order doesn't matter. So we have to consider all possible orderings of the three notes and see if any of them satisfy either the major or minor condition.\n\nAlso, the output should be 'major', 'minor', or 'strange' based on which condition is met.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Take the three notes.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n3. For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes in the order of the permutation.\n4. Check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut wait, how do we represent the notes numerically to compute the distances?\n\nI think the best approach is to assign each note a number corresponding to its position in the 12-note scale. Then, the distance between two notes is (y - x) mod 12, but since the distance is measured from lower to higher, perhaps we just take (y - x) in terms of semitones, considering the circular nature.\n\nWait, but when calculating the distance, it's the minimal way? Or is it fixed based on the order.\n\nNo, according to the problem statement, the distance is from the lower note to the higher one. So for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones, but E to C is 8 semitones. So the direction matters.\n\nWait, no. Wait the problem says: the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppermost. So when calculating the distance between two notes, we first determine which is lower and which is higher, then compute the difference accordingly.\n\nSo for any pair of notes, the distance is (higher - lower) mod 12, but since the order is from lower to higher, the distance is always positive and less than or equal to 11 semitones.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance is calculated as the number of semitones you have to go up from the lower note to reach the higher note. So for example, C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, C# to D is another, etc., up to E, which is four steps away). E to C would be 8 semitones because going the other way around: E to F is 1, ..., up to C which is eight steps.\n\nBut for our purposes, when checking the triad, we have to arrange the three notes in some order X, Y, Z such that X < Y and Y < Z (in terms of their positions on the scale), and then compute the distances between X and Y, and Y and Z.\n\nWait no. Because the notes are arranged in a circle, so the ordering isn't straightforward. So, for a given permutation of the three notes, say [A, B, C], we need to find their positions on the scale",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The classification is based on the distances between the notes when arranged in a specific order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Notes and Distances**: The notes are cyclically ordered, with each consecutive note being a semitone apart. We need to convert each note into its corresponding position on a 12-note scale to facilitate distance calculations.\n2. **Major and Minor Triads**: A major triad is defined by distances of 4 semitones between the first and second notes, and 3 semitones between the second and third notes. A minor triad is defined by distances of 3 semitones between the first and second notes, and 4 semitones between the second and third notes.\n3. **Permutations of Notes**: Since the order of notes matters for determining the type of triad, we generate all permutations of the given three notes and check each permutation against the criteria for major and minor triads.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes and check if they match the criteria for either a major or minor triad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_pos = {'C': 0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\ndef get_pos(note):\n    return note_to_pos[note]\n\ndef calculate_distance(a, b):\n    pos_a = get_pos(a)\n    pos_b = get_pos(b)\n    # Distance from a to b (a lower, b higher)\n    distance = (pos_b - pos_a) % 12\n    return distance\n\ndef is_major(triad):\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(triad):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = calculate_distance(x, y)\n        d2 = calculate_distance(y, z)\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_minor(triad):\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(triad):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = calculate_distance(x, y)\n        d2 = calculate_distance(y, z)\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Read input\ninput_notes = input().split()\ntriad = input_notes\n\nif len(triad) !=3:\n    print(\"strange\")\nelse:\n    if is_major(triad):\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor(triad):\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Conversion**: Each note is converted to its corresponding position on the 12-note scale using a dictionary.\n2. **Distance Function**: Computes the semitone distance between two notes, considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Permutation Check**: Generates all permutations of the three notes and checks each permutation against the criteria for major and minor triads.\n4. **Classification**: Determines the type of triad based on the computed distances and prints the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are considered, providing an accurate classification of the triad.",
