Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Petya selling souvenirs. He has n souvenirs, each with a weight and a cost. He wants to choose a subset where the total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is as large as possible.\n\nHmm, right. So it's a classic knapsack problem. But wait, the constraints might make standard approaches too slow.\n\nLet me look at the input constraints. Oh, n can be up to 1e5, which is 100,000, and m up to 3e5. That's 300,000. So a standard DP approach that's O(nm) is definitely not feasible here because 1e5 * 3e5 is way too big—30 billion operations. That's way beyond what can be handled in Python in reasonable time.\n\nI need a smarter approach. Let's think about the weights. Each souvenir has a weight of 1, 2, or 3. That's a key point. So maybe we can group the souvenirs by their weight and handle them separately.\n\nYes! Because the weight is limited to 1, 2, or 3, perhaps we can find a way to compute the maximum cost efficiently by considering the counts of each weight category.\n\nLet's think: for each weight (1, 2, 3), we can sort the souvenirs in descending order of cost. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each weight, we can calculate the maximum cost without exceeding the total weight limit.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weight: group1 (weight 1), group2 (weight 2), group3 (weight 3).\n2. For each group, sort the souvenirs in descending order of cost.\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group. This will allow us to quickly calculate the total cost for taking the top k items in each group.\n4. Then, iterate over all possible combinations of taking a certain number of items from each group, such that the total weight (number of items taken from group1 *1 + group2*2 + group3*3) is <= m. For each valid combination, compute the total cost using the prefix sums and track the maximum.\n\nBut how do we efficiently iterate through all possible combinations without exceeding time limits?\n\nWell, considering that the number of items in each group could be up to 1e5, but since the weights are 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can use a three-pointer approach. Or, better yet, try all possible numbers of group3 items first, then for each possible group3 count, determine the best possible group2 and group1 counts that fit within the remaining weight.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, for each group, after sorting and computing prefix sums, the maximum number of items we can take from group i is min(k, len(group_i)), where k is the maximum possible given the weight.\n\nFor example, group1 can contribute up to min(m, len(group1)) items, but more precisely, since each item takes 1 weight, the maximum possible is m items if group1 has enough.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to precompute the prefix sums for each group, then for each possible number of group3 items (say t3), subtract 3*t3 from m, and then process group2 and group1 in the remaining weight.\n\nYes, that sounds manageable.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Pre-sort and compute prefix sums for each group.\n- Iterate t3 from 0 to max_possible (which is min(len(group3), m//3)). For each t3:\n   - Remaining weight is m_remaining = m - 3*t3. If m_remaining <0, skip.\n   - Now, process group2 and group1 for the remaining weight.\n   - The remaining weight can be used for group2 (each taking 2) and group1 (each taking 1). So for group2, the maximum items we can take is min( len(group2), m_remaining // 2 ). Similarly, group1 can contribute up to min( len(group1), m_remaining // 1 ) items, but subject to the total weight.\n\nWait, but even within group2 and group1, the way to combine them is important. Because group2's items take 2 each, and group1's take 1 each. So for a given t3, the remaining weight is m_remaining. We need to find the best way to take some a items from group2 and b items from group1 such that 2a + b <= m_remaining.\n\nThis seems like another nested loop, but with m_remaining up to 3e5, it's still not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: for each t3, the remaining weight is m_remaining. We can try",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit. This is a classic knapsack problem with specific constraints on the weights of the items.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Souvenirs by Weight**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, or 3). Each group will be processed separately.\n2. **Sort and Compute Prefix Sums**: For each group, sort the souvenirs in descending order of their cost. Compute prefix sums for each group to quickly calculate the total cost of taking the top k items from each group.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Combinations**: Use a three-pointer approach to iterate over all possible combinations of taking items from the groups. For each possible number of items taken from the third group (weight 3), compute the remaining weight and then determine the best combination of items from the first (weight 1) and second (weight 2) groups within the remaining weight limit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    \n    group1 = []\n    group2 = []\n    group3 = []\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        w = int(input[idx])\n        c = int(input[idx+1])\n        idx +=2\n        if w ==1:\n            group1.append(c)\n        elif w ==2:\n            group2.append(c)\n        else:\n            group3.append(c)\n    \n    # Sort each group in descending order\n    group1.sort(reverse=True)\n    group2.sort(reverse=True)\n    group3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums for each group\n    prefix1 = [0]\n    for c in group1:\n        prefix1.append(prefix1[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix2 = [0]\n    for c in group2:\n        prefix2.append(prefix2[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix3 = [0]\n    for c in group3:\n        prefix3.append(prefix3[-1] + c)\n    \n    max_cost = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible t3\n    max_t3 = min(len(group3), m //3)\n    for t3 in range(max_t3 +1):\n        remaining = m - 3*t3\n        if remaining <0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Now process group2 and group1 with remaining weight\n        max_w = remaining\n        # For group2: each takes 2\n        max_t2 = min(len(group2), max_w //2)\n        for t2 in range(max_t2 +1):\n            weight_used = 2*t2\n            if weight_used > max_w:\n                continue\n            available_weight = max_w - weight_used\n            max_t1 = min(len(group1), available_weight)\n            total_cost = prefix3[t3] + prefix2[t2] + prefix1[max_t1]\n            if total_cost > max_cost:\n                max_cost = total_cost\n    \n    print(max_cost)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Categorization**: The souvenirs are categorized into three groups based on their weights. This helps in efficiently processing each group separately.\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Sorting each group by cost in descending order allows us to use prefix sums to quickly compute the total cost of the top k items. This optimization reduces the complexity of calculating costs for different subsets.\n3. **Three-pointer Approach**: By iterating over the possible number of items taken from the third group, we reduce the problem to finding the best combination of items from the remaining two groups within the weight limit. This approach ensures that we efficiently explore all feasible combinations without exceeding the time limits.\n\nThis method effectively leverages the constraints on item weights to find an optimal solution within feasible computational limits.",
