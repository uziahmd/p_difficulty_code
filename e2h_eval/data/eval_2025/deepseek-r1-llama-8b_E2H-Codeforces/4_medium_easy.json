The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the loser gets a red spot. I need to calculate how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm, the key here is to figure out for each round whether Nikephoros loses or Polycarpus does. Because each loss adds a spot.\n\nSo, let me think about how each player chooses their moves. Both have their own sequences A and B. They cycle through these sequences for each round. So, for the first round, Nikephoros shows A[0], Polycarpus shows B[0]. For the second, A[1] and B[1], and so on. When they reach the end of their sequence, it wraps around.\n\nWait, right. So for the ith round (0-based), the move for Nikephoros is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, B[i % k].\n\nIn each round, we determine who wins and add a red spot accordingly.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input: n, A, B.\n2. For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Get Nikephoros' move as A[i mod m]\n   b. Get Polycarpus' move as B[i mod k]\n   c. Determine who wins this round.\n   d. Increment the respective counter if they lose.\n3. After processing all rounds, output the two counters.\n\nSo the main challenge is to compute for each round what happens.\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\n- Rock beats scissors.\n- Scissors beat paper.\n- Paper beats rock.\n- If both choose same, it's a draw.\n\nSo, for each pair of moves (a, b), decide who wins.\n\nI can represent each move as a character: 'R', 'S', 'P'.\n\nI need a helper function or a way to determine the outcome.\n\nLet me think: For a given a and b, determine if a beats b, or vice versa, or it's a draw.\n\nFor example:\n- R vs S: R wins.\n- S vs P: S wins.\n- P vs R: P wins.\nIf a == b: draw.\n\nSo, for each round, after getting a and b, compare them.\n\nSo, in code terms, perhaps something like:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return None  # draw\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return a  # a wins\n    else:\n        return b  # b wins\n\nWait, that might work. Or maybe better to use a lookup table or some other method.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the beats relationships as a dictionary.\n\nLike, beats = {\n    'R': 'S',\n    'S': 'P',\n    'P': 'R'\n}\n\nThen, if a beats b, then a wins. Else, if b is in the beats of a, no. Wait, no.\n\nWait, if a is 'R' and b is 'S', then R beats S. So, in that case, a wins.\n\nBut if a is 'R' and b is 'P', then P beats R, so b wins.\n\nSo, the logic is: if b is beaten by a, then a wins. Otherwise, if a is beaten by b, then b wins. Else, draw.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif a == b:\n    pass\nelse:\n    if b in beats[a]:\n        a wins\n    else:\n        b wins\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, beats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nSo, for each a and b:\n\nif a == b: nothing.\nelse:\n   if beats[a] == b: a wins.\n   else: b wins.\n\nSo, now, for each round, I can compute who is the winner, increment their count.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nInitialize two counters, nike = 0, poly = 0.\n\nFor i in 0 to n-1:\n   a = A[i % len(A)]\n   b = B[i % len(B)]\n   determine winner.\n   if winner is a: poly +=1\n   elif winner is b: nike +=1\n   else: pass.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the winner is the one who causes the other to lose. So if a beats b, then b loses, so a gets the point. So, in the code, if a wins, then poly gets a point. Because the winner is a, the loser is b, so b gets a spot.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch.\" So, the loser gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each round, the loser is the one who doesn't win. So, if a beats b, then b loses, so poly gets a spot. So, in code:\n\nif a wins: poly +=1\nelif b wins: nike +=1\nelse: nothing.\n\nSo, in the helper function, when we find that a is the winner, then poly increases by 1. Else, if b is the winner, then nike increases by 1.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        # a wins, so poly loses\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        # b wins, so nike loses\n        nike +=1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n7\nRPS\nRSPP\n\nA is 'RPS', which is length 3. So for i from 0 to 6:\n\ni=0: a = A[0%3] = 'R', b = B[0%5] = 'R'. So same, nothing.\n\ni=1: a=A[1]='P', b=B[1]='S'. So P vs S: S beats P? Wait, no. Wait, beats['P'] is 'R'. So if a is P and b is S, beats[a] is R, which is not equal to b, so check if b is in beats[a]. So, since beats[a] is R, and b is S, which is not R. So, then, does b beat a?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the condition is: if a beats b, then a wins. So, if a is P, and b is S, does P beat S? No. Because S beats P. Because S is scissors, P is paper. Wait, no: scissors cut paper, so S beats P. So, in this case, b (S) beats a (P). So, the winner is b, so the loser is a, so a gets a spot. So, in code, since a is P, b is S, and beats[a] is R != S, so else clause: b wins, so a loses, so a's count increases.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, if a == b: nothing. Else, check if a beats b. If yes, then poly +=1 (since a wins, so b loses). Else, b wins, so a loses, so a's count is increased.\n\nWait, no. Because when a wins, the loser is b, so poly (b) gets a spot. When b wins, the loser is a, so a's count increases.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nif a wins: poly +=1\nelse: (b wins) → a +=1.\n\nSo, in the sample input, let's see the 7 rounds.\n\nRound 0: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 1: P vs S → P is paper, S is scissors. S beats P → b wins. So a is P, so a's count increases. So nike +=1.\n\nRound 2: S vs R → S is scissors, R is rock. Rock beats scissors. So a is S, b is R. Does a beat b? Beats[S] is P. So no. So check if b beats a. R beats S, so yes. So b wins, so a (S) loses. So a's count increases. So now, nike is 2.\n\nWait, but wait. The sample explanation says that in the first sample, the output is 3 2.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe sample input is:\n\n7 rounds.\n\nA is RPS.\n\nB is RSPP.\n\nSo for each round:\n\ni | a (A[i%3]) | b (B[i%5])\n0 | R | R → draw.\n1 | P | S → S beats P → b wins. So a (P) loses. So a's count is 1.\n2 | S | R → R beats S → b wins. So a (S) loses. Count becomes 2.\n3 | R | P → P beats R. So a (R) loses. Count 3.\n4 | P | R → R beats P. a (P) loses. Count 4.\n5 | S | S → draw.\n6 | R | P → P beats R. a (R) loses. Count 5.\n\nWait, but according to the sample explanation, the total is 3 for Nikephoros and 2 for Poly. Hmm, maybe my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, wait. Let's re-examine the sample note:\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. N loses.\n\nRound 3: S - P. P loses.\n\nRound 4: R - P. N loses.\n\nRound 5: P - R. P loses.\n\nRound 6: S - S. Draw.\n\nRound 7: R - P. N loses.\n\nWait, that's 7 rounds, but the indexes in the note seem to start at 1. So let's list each round:\n\nRound 1 (i=0): R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2 (i=1): P vs S → S beats P → Poly loses. So N gets a spot.\n\nRound 3 (i=2): S vs P → S beats P? Wait, no. S is scissors, P is paper. Scissors cut paper, so S beats P. So N's move is S, Poly's is P. So S beats P → N wins. So Poly gets a spot.\n\nRound 4 (i=3): R vs P → P beats R. So Poly's move is P, N's is R → P wins. So N gets a spot.\n\nRound 5 (i=4): P vs R → R beats P → N's move is P, Poly's is R. R beats P → Poly wins. So N gets a spot.\n\nRound 6 (i=5): S vs S → draw.\n\nRound 7 (i=6): R vs P → P beats R → Poly wins. So N gets a spot.\n\nSo the counts:\n\nN lost in rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 7? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, in round 2: N's move is P, Poly's is S. S beats P. So Poly's move wins. So N lost → N's count increases.\n\nRound 3: N's move is S, Poly's is P. S beats P → N's move wins. So Poly loses → Poly's count increases.\n\nRound4: N's R vs P. P beats R → Poly's move wins. So N loses → count increases.\n\nRound5: N's P vs R. R beats P → Poly's move wins → N loses → count increases.\n\nRound6: N's S vs S → draw.\n\nRound7: N's R vs P → P beats R → Poly's move wins → N loses → count increases.\n\nSo for N, he lost in rounds 2,4,5,7 → 4 times. But in the sample, the output is 3 2.\n\nHmm, I must be making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is different. Let me recheck the sample note.\n\nSample note says:\n\nRound 2: P - S → N loses → so N's count is 1.\n\nRound 3: S - P → P loses → Poly's count is 1.\n\nRound4: R - P → N loses → count 2.\n\nRound5: P - R → P loses → Poly's count 2.\n\nRound6: S - S → draw.\n\nRound7: R - P → N loses → count 3.\n\nSo N has 3, Poly has 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo why did I think Round3 was N winning? Oh, because I thought S beats P. But wait, in Round3, N's move is S, Poly's is P. So S beats P → N's move wins, so Poly gets a spot. So in Round3, Poly's count increases.\n\nSo, in the code, for each round, after determining who wins, the loser gets a spot.\n\nSo, in the code, for each round:\n\nif a wins → poly +=1.\n\nelse → if b wins → nike +=1.\n\nSo, in Round3, a is S, b is P.\n\na beats b → a wins. So poly +=1.\n\nWhich is correct as per the sample.\n\nSo, in the code, during Round3, a (S) beats b (P), so poly's count increases by 1.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: when all rounds are draws, output is 0 0.\n\nWhat about when one player's sequence is shorter than the other.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='R', B='S'.\n\nRound1: R vs S. R wins. So Poly gets a spot. So output is 0 1.\n\nAnother test: n=2, A='RR', B='SS'.\n\nRound1: R vs S → R wins. Poly spot → 0 1.\n\nRound2: R vs S → same. Poly spot → 0 2.\n\nOutput: 0 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, considering the constraints: n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable.\n\nThe code will loop n times, each time computing i mod m and i mod k. Since m and k can be up to 1000, the modulo operations are O(1), so the total time is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute len(A) as m, len(B) as k.\n\nInitialize counters.\n\nLoop over i in 0..n-1:\n\na = A[i%m]\n\nb = B[i%k]\n\nif a == b: continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if a beats b.\n\nIf yes: poly +=1.\n\nElse: nike +=1.\n\nFinally, print the counts.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors games. The game is played over `n` rounds, and in each round, the loser gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Each player has their own sequence of moves which they cycle through.\n   - The rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors are applied in each round to determine the winner.\n   - The winner of each round gives the loser a red spot.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - Each player's moves are cycled through their respective sequences.\n   - We need to determine the winner of each round and count the red spots accordingly.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values for the number of rounds and the sequences of moves for both players.\n   - Use a dictionary to represent the beats relationship: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock.\n   - For each round, determine the moves of both players using their sequences.\n   - Check if one move beats the other to decide the winner and increment the respective red spot counter.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where `n` is the number of rounds, making it efficient even for the upper constraint.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B` are read from the input.\n- **Beats Dictionary**: This dictionary helps determine the outcome of each round based on the moves.\n- **Loop Through Rounds**: For each round, the current move of each player is determined by cycling through their respective sequences.\n- **Determine Winner**: Using the beats dictionary, we check if one move beats the other. If so, the corresponding player gets a red spot.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all rounds, the counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures that we correctly count the red spots for each player based on the game outcomes.",
