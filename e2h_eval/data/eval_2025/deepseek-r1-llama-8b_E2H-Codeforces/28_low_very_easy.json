String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Vasily the Bear wants to count the number of beautiful strings. Let's read the problem carefully and figure out what needs to be done.\n\nSo, a beautiful string is one that consists only of 0s and 1s. It must have exactly n zeros and m ones. But wait, no, the problem says it's beautiful if it meets certain criteria. Oh right, the string s is beautiful if:\n\n- It only contains 0s and 1s.\n- The count of 0s is exactly n.\n- The count of 1s is exactly m.\n\nBut wait, the initial description says that s can be obtained by modifying another string. So perhaps the modifications are allowed as long as the final string meets the criteria. Or maybe the beautiful string is any string that can be formed through some number of modifications starting from some original string.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" Hmm, that part is a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, no, perhaps the way it's written is that the modifications can change the string until it becomes a string that meets the beautiful criteria. Or maybe the modifications are operations that can be applied to any string, but the beautiful string is any string that can be reached via these operations, provided that it has exactly n zeros and m ones.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe string s is beautiful if it satisfies certain conditions: only 0s and 1s, with exactly n 0s and m 1s. We can obtain g from s with some modifications. Oh, perhaps g is the result of applying some modifications on s, which could change the number of 0s and 1s. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the counts are fixed for s.\n\nWait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me read again:\n\n\"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\"\n\nWait, maybe the modifications are about transforming the string into a form that ends with a single character, either 0 or 1, based on the last two characters. Because each modification reduces the length by 1. For example, when you modify, you take the last two characters and replace them with one character. So each modification step reduces the length by 1.\n\nSo the process is: starting from some initial string, you can perform zero or more modifications, each time replacing the last two characters with one (0 if both are 0, 1 otherwise). The end result after some steps must be a string that meets the beautiful string criteria.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the beautiful string is the result after all the modifications. So the beautiful string must consist only of 0s and 1s, and after all modifications, it has exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n\nWait, but the modifications are operations that change the string. Each modification replaces two characters with one, so the length decreases by 1 each time. So the total number of modifications possible depends on the initial length. But the beautiful string must have a certain number of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find all possible strings that can be transformed into a beautiful string after any number of modifications, including zero.\n\nBut how do the modifications affect the count of 0s and 1s? Each modification takes two last characters and replaces them with one. So for example, if the last two were '00', they become '0'—so the count of 0s decreases by one. If the last two were '01' or '10', they become '1'—so the count of 0s decreases by one, and the count of 1s remains the same, but actually, let's see:\n\nSuppose we have a string ending with '00'. After modification, it becomes '0', so the total 0s decrease by 1 (from 2 to 1). Similarly, if it ends with '01', the modified string will be '1', which is a 1. So the 0 count goes down by 1 (from 1 to 0), and the 1 count remains the same (since two 1s would become a single 1, but in this case, 0 and 1).\n\nWait, let me think: each modification operation affects the last two characters. So the number of 0s and 1s can change based on what those last two were.\n\nLet me model the effect of a modification on the counts:\n\nCase 1: Last two are '00' → replaced by '0'. So the number of 0s decreases by 1 (from 2 to 1). So 0_count -=1, 1_count remains same.\n\nCase 2: Last two are '01' → replaced by '",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be formed by performing a series of modifications. A beautiful string consists only of 0s and 1s, with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones. The modifications allowed are replacing two consecutive characters at the end of the string with one character, which can either be 0 or 1 based on the original pair.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each modification reduces the length of the string by 1. Therefore, the final string must have a length that is compatible with the initial counts of 0s and 1s after a certain number of modifications. Specifically, the length of the string after `k` modifications will be `length - k`, where `length` is the initial length.\n\nWe need to determine if it's possible to reach a string with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones through any number of modifications. This involves checking if the initial counts of 0s and 1s can be transformed into the required counts through a series of valid modifications.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\n# We need to find all possible (a, b) such that a + b = total_length, and a = n', b = m' after some modifications.\n# But what's the relation between the initial counts and the modified counts?\n\n# Let's think about the effect of each modification:\n# Each modification takes the last two characters and replaces them with one.\n# So, each modification reduces the count of 0s and/or 1s depending on the last two characters.\n\n# However, since the order of modifications matters, it's tricky to model directly.\n\n# Instead, let's consider the parity of the difference between (n + m) and the target.\n\n# Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since each modification reduces the length by 1, the total length after k modifications is (original_length - k).\n\n# But the original length is not given. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\n# Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that any beautiful string must satisfy certain conditions based on the allowed operations.\n\n# Another approach: For the final string to have exactly n zeros and m ones, the sum n + m must equal the length of the string after some modifications.\n\n# But the initial string's length isn't provided, so maybe we can model the problem differently.\n\n# Wait, perhaps the problem is more about whether the required counts (n, m) can be achieved through a series of modifications starting from some initial string.\n\n# But without knowing the initial string, this seems difficult.\n\n# Maybe the key is to realize that the final string's length must be such that n + m is less than or equal to the initial length minus the number of modifications.\n\n# Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about whether the counts n and m can be arranged in a string that can be reduced to those counts through modifications.\n\n# Given the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the following:\n\n# The final string must have exactly n zeros and m ones. Additionally, the length of this string must be such that it can be obtained by reducing the initial string's length by some number of modifications.\n\n# Each modification reduces the length by 1, so the final length is (initial_length - k), where k is the number of modifications.\n\n# Since the initial string's length is not given, perhaps the problem is to find all possible ways to arrange n zeros and m ones such that they can be reduced to the required counts through a series of modifications.\n\n# Another angle: The problem can be transformed into determining if the required counts (n, m) can be achieved through a series of operations that affect the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\n# Each modification affects the last two characters. So, the count changes depend on the last two characters before the modification.\n\n# However, since the order of operations is not known, it's challenging to model the exact effect on counts.\n\n# Perhaps a dynamic programming approach can be used, considering the possible states as pairs of counts of 0s and 1s after each modification.\n\n# Given the constraints (n, m up to 105), a DP solution with states (current_zeros, current_ones) might be feasible.\n\n# The state transitions would represent the effect of each possible modification on the counts.\n\n# Each state transition corresponds to applying a modification to the last two characters, which could be '00', '01', '10', or '11'.\n\n# For each state (a, b), we can compute the next possible states based on these transitions.\n\n# The base case is the initial string, which has a certain number of zeros and ones. However, since the initial string is not provided, we need to consider all possible initial configurations that can lead to the desired (n, m) after some modifications.\n\n# Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as counting the number of binary strings of length k (where k = n + m) that can be reduced to exactly n zeros and m ones through a series of valid modifications.\n\n# The key insight is that the order of modifications doesn't matter for the counts, but the parity of certain differences does.\n\n# Specifically, the number of modifications that change the count of zeros and ones must satisfy certain conditions.\n\n# After analyzing the problem, we can conclude that the solution depends on whether the required counts (n, m) can be achieved through a series of operations that modify the string in a way consistent with the rules.\n\n# The final step is to compute the number of valid strings modulo 1e9+7.\n\n# Given the complexity, here's an outline of the approach:\n\n1. **Check Feasibility**: Determine if it's possible to reach the counts (n, m) through the allowed modifications. This involves checking if the sum of n and m is compatible with the initial string's length and the number of modifications allowed.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP approach to count the number of valid sequences of modifications that transform the initial string into the desired counts.\n\n3. **State Representation**: Represent the state as a tuple (current_zeros, current_ones), tracking the number of ways to reach each state after a certain number of modifications.\n\n4. **Transitions**: For each state, consider all possible modifications (based on the last two characters) and update the state accordingly.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, apply modulo 1e9+7 at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nif (n + m) == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nmax_len = n + m\n\ndp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n# Initialize DP with the base case of the entire string being already modified to n, m\n# However, since the initial string can be any combination, perhaps the DP should be built from the end.\n# Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem in reverse: start from the desired state and see if it's reachable.\n\n# Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as building the string from the end, considering each modification step.\n\n# Let's think differently: the process of modifications can be seen as building the string by adding characters to the beginning, while keeping track of the current state.\n\n# So, we can model the DP as follows:\n# dp[i][a][b] represents the number of ways to build the first i characters, ending with a 0s and b 1s.\n\n# But since modifications can be applied anywhere in the string, this approach may not capture all possibilities.\n\n# Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the final string must have n + m characters, and each modification reduces the length by 1. Therefore, the number of modifications is (initial_length - (n + m)).\n\n# However, since the initial string's length is not provided, this line of reasoning may not be directly applicable.\n\n# Another approach: Consider that each modification can be thought of as merging two characters into one, which affects the count of 0s and 1s. The key is to determine how the counts change with each modification.\n\n# Each modification can reduce the count of 0s or 1s based on the last two characters:\n- '00' → '0' → 0s decrease by 1.\n- '01' → '1' → 0s decrease by 1, 1s remain same.\n- '10' → '1' → 1s decrease by 1, 0s remain same.\n- '11' → '1' → 1s decrease by 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again:\n\nWhen you have two 0s ('00'), modifying them results in a single '0'. So, the count of 0s decreases by 1 (from 2 to 1). Similarly, if you have '01', the result is '1', so the count of 0s decreases by 1 (from 1 to 0), and the count of 1s remains the same (since one 1 becomes one 1). If you have '10', the result is '1', so the count of 1s decreases by 1 (from 1 to 0), and the count of 0s remains the same. If you have '11', the result is '1', so the count of 1s decreases by 1 (from 2 to 1).\n\nSo, each modification reduces the count of either 0s or 1s by 1, depending on the pair of characters being modified.\n\nGiven this, the total number of modifications possible is determined by the initial string's length and the final string's length. However, since the initial string's length is not provided, we need another approach.\n\nThe key realization is that the difference between the initial count of 0s and 1s and the desired counts must allow for a certain number of modifications. Specifically, the difference in counts must be reducible through the allowed operations.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to checking if the required counts (n, m) can be achieved through a series of operations that each reduce either 0s or 1s by 1. This means that the sum of the reductions in 0s and 1s must equal the number of modifications, which in turn depends on the initial string's length.\n\nHowever, since the initial string's length is not provided, we can infer that the initial string must have a length of `n + m + k`, where `k` is the number of modifications. Each modification reduces the length by 1, so the initial length must be at least `n + m`.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to checking if the sum of the absolute differences between the initial counts and the desired counts can be achieved through the allowed operations.\n\nFinally, the number of beautiful strings is determined by the number of valid sequences of modifications that transform the initial string into the desired counts, considering the constraints on the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nif (n + m) == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# We need to find the number of ways to arrange the string such that after some modifications,\n# the counts are exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n\n# The key is that each modification can reduce either 0s or 1s by 1.\n\n# So, the total number of modifications needed is (initial_0 + initial_1) - (n + m).\n\n# But since the initial_0 and initial_1 are not given, perhaps we can model the problem by considering that the initial string can be any string of length L = (n + m) + k, where k is the number of modifications.\n\n# The problem then becomes finding the number of strings of length L that can be reduced to n 0s and m 1s through exactly k modifications, each of which reduces either 0s or 1s by 1.\n\n# The number of such strings is determined by the number of ways to choose where to perform the modifications.\n\n# However, without knowing L, this approach is not directly applicable.\n\n# An alternative approach is to note that the difference between the initial counts and the desired counts must be achievable through the allowed operations.\n\n# Specifically, the number of modifications that reduce 0s plus the number that reduce 1s must equal the total number of modifications.\n\n# Let’s denote:\ndelta0 = n_initial - n\ndelta1 = m_initial - m\n\nEach modification can reduce either delta0 or delta1 by 1.\n\nBut since the initial counts are not provided, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that the initial string must have enough 0s and 1s to allow the required number of reductions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking if the sum of the required reductions is possible, considering the constraints on the counts.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the solution involves checking whether the required counts (n, m) can be achieved through a series of allowed modifications, and then computing the number of valid ways to achieve this.\n\nThe final answer is computed using dynamic programming, considering the possible ways to reach the desired counts through the allowed modifications.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of beautiful strings is determined by the feasibility of achieving the required counts through the allowed modifications, and the result is computed using dynamic programming with appropriate state transitions and modulo operations.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing the solution:\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nif (n + m) == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nmax_mods = n + m\n\n# We need to find the number of ways to reach (n, m) from some initial state through mods.\n# Each mod reduces either 0s or 1s by 1.\n\n# Let's model the problem as follows:\n# Let the initial counts be (a, b). After some mods, we reach (n, m).\n# Each mod can decrease a by 1 (if last two were 00 or 01) or decrease b by 1 (if last two were 10 or 11).\n\n# But since the initial a and b are unknown, perhaps the problem is to consider that the initial a and b can be any values such that a >= n and b >= m (since each mod reduces either a or b by 1).\n\n# Wait, no. Because each mod can only reduce a or b, not increase. So the initial a must be >= n, and initial b must be >= m.\n\n# But since the initial string can be any string, perhaps the problem is to count all possible ways to arrange the string such that after some mods, the counts are (n, m).\n\n# However, without knowing the initial string, this approach is not directly applicable.\n\n# Another angle: The problem is equivalent to counting the number of binary strings of length (n + m + k) that can be reduced to exactly n 0s and m 1s through k modifications.\n\n# Each modification reduces the string length by 1, so the initial length is (n + m + k).\n\n# For each possible k, we can compute the number of valid strings and sum over all possible k.\n\n# The maximum possible k is when we perform as many mods as possible, which is limited by the initial length.\n\n# However, this approach is computationally expensive for large k.\n\n# Given the constraints (n, m up to 105), perhaps a dynamic programming approach is feasible.\n\n# The idea is to model the problem by considering the number of ways to reach each state (a, b) after a certain number of modifications.\n\n# The state is (current_zeros, current_ones), and the transitions represent the effect of each modification.\n\n# Each modification can decrease either current_zeros or current_ones by 1, depending on the last two characters.\n\n# However, since we don't know the initial state, we can model the problem as starting from the desired state and working backwards to see if it's reachable.\n\n# The initial state is (n, m), and we need to find all possible ways to reach it by increasing zeros and ones through modifications.\n\n# This is similar to the BFS approach, but since the counts can be large, a dynamic programming approach is more efficient.\n\n# Here's the plan:\n\n# 1. Initialize a DP table where dp[a][b] represents the number of ways to reach a 0s and b 1s.\n\n# 2. Start from dp[n][m] = 1, representing the desired state.\n\n# 3. For each possible previous state, determine how it could have been reached by considering all possible modifications that could have led to it.\n\n# 4. Update the DP table accordingly, ensuring that each transition is valid.\n\n# 5. Sum all valid ways to reach the desired state, considering all possible paths.\n\n# The key is to model the transitions correctly, considering that each modification can only decrease the count of 0s or 1s.\n\n# Now, let's implement this.\n\n# Initialize DP with the desired state.\ndp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\ndp[n][m] = 1\n\n# Iterate over possible previous states.\nfor a in range(n, -1, -1):\n    for b in range(m, -1, -1):\n        if dp[a][b] == 0:\n            continue\n        # For each possible modification that could lead to (a, b) from (a+1, b) or (a, b+1)\n        # Each modification can come from either a+1, b or a, b+1, depending on which was reduced.\n        # So, for each possible way to get here, add the ways from the previous states.\n        # The previous states are (a+1, b) and (a, b+1), because each modification reduces either a or b by 1.\n        if a + 1 <= n:\n            dp[a][b] = (dp[a][b] + dp[a + 1][b]) % MOD\n        if b + 1 <= m:\n            dp[a][b] = (dp[a][b] + dp[a][b + 1]) % MOD\n\nprint(dp[0][0] % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to reach the desired counts of 0s and 1s through a series of allowed modifications. The DP table tracks the number of ways to reach each state (count of 0s, count of 1s), considering all possible previous states that could lead to the current state via a valid modification.
