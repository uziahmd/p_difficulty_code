There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in.\n\nHmm, let me think about how the tournament structure affects this. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So for n players, there are n-1 games in total. But the order of these games matters because the winner's path depends on the matchups.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of games the winner can play isn't necessarily n-1. Because the structure of the bracket could limit that. For example, in a 3-player tournament, the winner plays two games: first against someone, then against the next. But wait, no—because with 3 players, there are two rounds. So the winner must play two games.\n\nBut in the sample input, when n=4, the output is 2. So the maximum is 2 games, not 3. Oh right, because after the initial two wins, the final would be the third game. Wait, no—wait, n=4 has 3 games total, but the winner can only play 2? Or am I misunderstanding the sample?\n\nWait the sample says n=10 gives output 4. So what's happening here.\n\nLet me try to model this. The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by how many layers of matches they can go through while respecting the rule that each new opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less than the winner.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the longest possible sequence of games where each step adds an opponent who has either played the same number of games as the winner or one less.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as building a Fibonacci-like sequence. Because each time the winner plays a new game, their number of games increases by one, and their next opponent must have played either k-1 or k games.\n\nSo, the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the sum of the Fibonacci-like series up to k is <= n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum number of games is the largest m where the (m+2)th Fibonacci number is <=n.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's think recursively. To maximize the number of games, the winner should play as many as possible early on, which allows them to have more opponents later.\n\nLet's denote dp[m] as the minimal number of players required for the winner to play m games.\n\nFor example:\n\nm=1: The winner plays 1 game. So they need at least 2 players. So dp[1]=2.\n\nm=2: They play two games. Each game requires another opponent. The first opponent has played 0 games before facing the winner (so he's available). The second opponent must have played either 0 or 1 game. But if the first opponent was defeated by the winner, he's out, so the second can't have played 0. So the second opponent must have played 1 game, meaning he came from a subtree where he had to play once. So the minimal number of players is 3: two in the first round, and the winner.\n\nWait, no. Maybe dp[2] is 3. Because the winner plays two games: first against someone (who requires one game), then against someone else (who could have played one game as well). So total players needed is 3.\n\nWait, but for n=3, the output is 2. Which fits this. So dp[2]=3.\n\nWhat about m=3? How many players do you need?\n\nTo get to m=3 games, the winner must have played three games. Let's see:\n\nEach new game can bring in a player who has either played the same number or one less than the current number of games of the winner.\n\nSo for the third game, the opponent must have played either 2 or 3 games.\n\nBut wait, since the winner is playing their third game, their opponent must have played either 2 or 3 games. However, the opponent couldn't have played 3 games because that would require the opponent to have beaten the winner, which is impossible.\n\nSo the opponent must have played exactly 2 games.\n\nBut how did that happen? The opponent must have come from a subtree where he won two games. So that subtree requires at least dp[2] + 1 players? Or perhaps more.\n\nWait, let's model this. For the third game, the opponent has played two games. That means, in their own path, they've won two matches. So the number of players required for that subtree is dp[2] = 3.\n\nSo the total players needed for the winner to play 3 games would be dp[2] (for the first two opponents) plus 1 (the third opponent) plus ... Wait, maybe it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps dp[m] represents the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have m games. Then:\n\ndp[1] = 2.\n\ndp[2] = 3.\n\ndp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] + 1? Or maybe dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] + 1 ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think:\n\nTo reach m=3, the winner needs to have played three games.\n\nEach new game must bring in an opponent who has played either m-1 or m-2 games.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required for m games is the sum of the first m terms in a certain sequence.\n\nWait, looking for a pattern.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor m=1: 2 players.\n\nm=2: 3 players (since the first game is against one, the second against another).\n\nm=3: let's say the third game is against someone who played 2 games. That someone must have been in a subtree of their own.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players for m games is the (m+2)th Fibonacci number minus something.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is dp[m] = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2].\n\nBecause to have m games, the winner's last opponent must have played m-1 games, which requires dp[m-1] players. Then, the previous opponent(s) must have played m-2 games, requiring dp[m-2] players.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So dp[m] = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2].\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\ndp[1] = 2.\n\ndp[2] = dp[1] + 1? No, wait earlier thought was dp[2] =3.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players needed for m games is the (m+2)th term in the Fibonacci sequence, starting from dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3, dp[3]=5, etc.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3, then dp[3] = dp[2]+dp[1] =5.\n\nIs that correct? Let's see.\n\nFor m=3, the winner must have played 3 games.\n\nThe first two games: the winner plays against someone (game 1), then against someone else (game 2). The third game is against someone who has played two games.\n\nThat someone (player B) must have played two games. So player B's path is two wins, each requiring their own games.\n\nSo to have player B, we need at least dp[2] =3 players in their subtree.\n\nThus, the total players needed for m=3 is 3 (winner's first two opponents) + 3 (player B's subtree) -1 (because the winner is counted in both subtrees). Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the total players are dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1]. Because the third game brings in a player who has played two games, which requires dp[2] players. The other two games (games 1 and 2) bring in players who have played 0 and 1 games, respectively. So the total is dp[2] (for game 3) + dp[1] (for game 2) + ... Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence is dp[m] = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2], with dp[1]=2 and dp[2]=3.\n\nLet me compute dp for small m:\n\nm=1:2\n\nm=2:3\n\nm=3: 3+2=5.\n\nm=4:5+3=8.\n\nm=5:8+5=13.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when n=10, the maximum m is 4. Because dp[4] is 8, which is larger than 10? Wait, no, 8 is less than 10. So 8 players are needed for m=4.\n\nBut the sample output for n=10 is 4, which suggests that when n=10, the maximum m is 4.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because dp[4] is 8. So for n=10, which is larger than 8, it can support m=4. What about m=5? dp[5] is 13, which is larger than 10, so it's not possible. So the maximum is 4.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=4. dp[2] is 3, which is <=4. dp[3] is 5>4. So maximum m is 2.\n\nSample input 4 gives output 2, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: dp[2] is 3 <=3. So maximum is 2.\n\nSample input 3 gives output 2.\n\nn=2: dp[1]=2<=2. So maximum is 1.\n\nSample input 2 gives output 1.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the minimal number of players required for m games using the Fibonacci-like sequence, where dp[m] = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2], starting with dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3.\n\n- For each n, find the largest m such that dp[m] <=n.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the dp array up to m where dp[m] exceeds 1018 (since n can be up to 1018).\n\n2. For a given n, find the maximum m where dp[m] <=n.\n\nNow, how to compute dp.\n\nWe can precompute dp up until dp[m] exceeds 1018.\n\nLet's compute the sequence:\n\ndp[1] = 2\n\ndp[2] = 3\n\ndp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] =5\n\ndp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] =8\n\ndp[5] =13\n\ndp[6]=21\n\ndp[7]=34\n\ndp[8]=55\n\ndp[9]=89\n\ndp[10]=144\n\nWait, dp[10] is 144. So for n=10, the maximum m is 4, since dp[4]=8 <=10, but dp[5]=13>10.\n\nSo the process is correct.\n\nSo, for each n, find the largest m where dp[m] <=n.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this.\n\nSo, steps for code:\n\n- Read n from input.\n\n- Precompute the dp list.\n\n- Iterate from m=1 upwards until dp[m] >n, keeping track of the maximum m where dp[m] <=n.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nCompute dp as follows:\n\ndp = [0]*(some_max_m)\n\ndp[1] =2, dp[2]=3.\n\nThen for i from 3 to some_max:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n\nFind the largest m where dp[m] <=n.\n\nOutput m.\n\nWait, but for n=4, dp[3]=5>4, so m=2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, for n=8, dp[4]=8, so m=4.\n\nBut what about n=7? dp[4]=8>7. So m is 3, since dp[3]=5<=7.\n\nBut wait, can the maximum be higher than that? Let me see.\n\nWait, for n=7, is it possible for the winner to play 4 games?\n\nBecause dp[4] is 8>7, so no. So maximum is 3.\n\nSo the code correctly finds 3.\n\nSo now, the code structure is clear.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, create the dp list.\n\nInitialize dp[1] =2, dp[2]=3.\n\nThen, for each i >=3, compute dp[i] = dp[i-1]+dp[i-2].\n\nWe can stop when dp[i] exceeds n, and then find the maximum m where dp[m] <=n.\n\nWait, but for n=2, dp[1]=2 is equal to n, so m=1.\n\nBut wait, for n=3, dp[2]=3 is equal to n, so m=2.\n\nSo the code will correctly handle all cases.\n\nNow, in Python:\n\nWe'll precompute the dp until it's beyond n.\n\nWe can loop and build dp until the value exceeds n.\n\nWait, but for n=1018, the dp sequence grows exponentially (like Fibonacci), so it won't take too long.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    dp = []\n    dp.append(0) # index 0 unused\n    dp.append(2) # m=1\n    if n <2:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        dp.append(3) # m=2\n        if n <3:\n            print(1)\n        else:\n            m =3\n            while True:\n                next_dp = dp[m] + dp[m-1]\n                if next_dp >n:\n                    break\n                dp.append(next_dp)\n                m +=1\n            # Now find the largest m where dp[m]<=n\n            # But wait, dp starts from m=1, dp[1]=2, etc.\n            # Wait, no. The way we built dp is that dp[1] is 2, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is 5, etc.\n            # So the maximum m is the highest index in dp where dp[index] <=n.\n            max_games =0\n            for i in range(len(dp)):\n                if dp[i] >n:\n                    break\n                max_games =i-1\n            print(max_games)\n\nWait, no. Because in the code above, for each m, we add to dp the next value, and when it exceeds n, we break. So the dp list contains all values up to the first that exceeds n.\n\nWait, for example, n=10.\n\nWe start with dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3.\n\nThen m=3: next_dp=5. 5<=10, so add to dp.\n\nm=4: next_dp=8. 8<=10, add.\n\nm=5: next_dp=13>10. Break.\n\nSo dp is [0,2,3,5,8].\n\nNow, the len(dp) is 5. So for i in 0..4.\n\nCheck each dp[i] <=10.\n\ni=0: dp[0]=0 <=10: yes.\n\ni=1: 2<=10: yes.\n\ni=2:3<=10: yes.\n\ni=3:5<=10: yes.\n\ni=4:8<=10: yes.\n\ni=5: next, but len(dp) is 5, so the loop ends.\n\nSo the max_games is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each i, if dp[i] >n, break.\n\nSo for i starting from 0 to len(dp)-1.\n\nWait, no. Because the loop is 'for i in range(len(dp))' and inside, if dp[i]>n, break.\n\nSo for i=0: dp[0]=0 <=10: continue.\n\ni=1: dp[1]=2 <=10: continue.\n\ni=2:3<=10: continue.\n\ni=3:5<=10: continue.\n\ni=4:8<=10: continue.\n\ni=5: but len(dp) is 5, so the loop doesn't run i=5.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the loop is for i in range(len(dp)), which for dp having 5 elements (indices 0-4), the loop runs i=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo for each i, check if dp[i] >n.\n\nIn the case where n=10, all dp[i] are <=10 except none. So the loop will proceed all the way.\n\nAfter that, max_games is set to i-1. So for i=0: 0-1 =-1. But that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the code logic is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: collect all m where dp[m] <=n.\n\nWait, perhaps the better way is to keep track of the current m and update the maximum.\n\nLike, after building dp up to m_max where dp[m_max] <=n and dp[m_max+1] >n.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be:\n\nCompute dp as the Fibonacci-like sequence, each time adding the next term.\n\nOnce the next term exceeds n, stop.\n\nThen, the maximum m is the last m where dp[m] <=n.\n\nSo, for example, for n=10:\n\ndp is [0,2,3,5,8,13,... ].\n\nWe stop when next_dp=13>10.\n\nSo the dp list has up to m=4, with dp[4]=8.\n\nThus, the maximum m is 4.\n\nSo, during the computation, we can keep track of the maximum m.\n\nSo perhaps, the code can be written as:\n\nmax_games =0\n\nfor m in 1,2,...:\n\n   if dp[m] >n: break\n\n   max_games =m\n\nThus, the code can be adjusted.\n\nLet me rewrite the code.\n\nRead n.\n\nIf n<2: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Initialize dp as a list, dp[0]=0, dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3.\n\n   if n<2:\n\n       print(0)\n\n   else:\n\n       if n==2:\n\n           print(1)\n\n       else:\n\n           dp = [2,3]\n\n           m=3\n\n           while True:\n\n               next_val = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2]\n\n               if next_val >n:\n\n                   break\n\n               dp.append(next_val)\n\n               m +=1\n\n           # Now, find the largest m where dp[m] <=n.\n\n           # Wait, no. Because dp has dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3, etc.\n\n           # So for each m, we can see if dp[m] <=n.\n\n           # So, the initial dp is [2,3], m=3.\n\n           # Wait, perhaps it's better to represent dp as a list where dp[i] corresponds to m=i.\n\n           # So, for m=1, dp[1]=2, m=2 dp[2]=3, m=3 dp[3]=5, etc.\n\n           # So, in code, perhaps it's better to have a list where index is m, and value is dp[m].\n\n           # So, reorganize:\n\n           dp = {1:2, 2:3}\n\n           m =3\n\n           while True:\n\n               next_val = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2]\n\n               if next_val >n:\n\n                   break\n\n               dp[m] = next_val\n\n               m +=1\n\n           # Now, iterate from m down to 1 to find the largest m where dp[m] <=n.\n\n           # Alternatively, since the dp is built in increasing order, we can track the maximum m.\n\n           max_m =0\n\n           for current_m in range(1, m+1):\n\n               if dp[current_m] <=n:\n\n                   max_m = current_m\n\n               else:\n\n                   break\n\n           print(max_m)\n\nBut wait, for n=10, the dp for m=4 is 8 <=10, and m=5 is 13>10.\n\nSo in this approach, the loop would iterate current_m from 1 to 5.\n\nAt current_m=1: 2<=10: yes, max_m=1.\n\ncurrent_m=2:3<=10: yes, max_m=2.\n\ncurrent_m=3:5<=10: yes, max_m=3.\n\ncurrent_m=4:8<=10: yes, max_m=4.\n\ncurrent_m=5:13>10: break.\n\nSo, max_m is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the loop may run for all current_m up to m, but in practice, m is the point where dp[m] >n.\n\nWait, in the code, when the while loop breaks, it's because next_val>n.\n\nSo for the current m, dp[m] is the first value that exceeds n.\n\nThus, the maximum m where dp[m] <=n is m-1.\n\nWait, no. Because when m is being built, the condition is that next_val is <=n.\n\nSo for example, when m=5, the next_val is 13>10, so the while loop breaks. So the last added m is 4, with dp[4]=8<=10.\n\nSo the maximum m is 4.\n\nSo in code, perhaps the maximum m is the last m for which dp[m] <=n.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nafter building dp up to m where dp[m] is the first exceeding n, the maximum m is m-1.\n\nSo perhaps, the code can be:\n\nmax_m =0\n\nfor m in range(1, current_max_m):\n\n   if dp[m] <=n:\n\n       max_m =m\n\n   else:\n\n       break\n\nprint(max_m)\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to keep track during the building phase.\n\nWait, perhaps during the while loop, whenever we add a new m, we can check if it's <=n, and track the maximum.\n\nBut no, the while loop adds next_val as long as it's <=n.\n\nWait, no. Let me see.\n\nThe while loop is:\n\nnext_val = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2]\n\nif next_val >n: break\n\nelse: append to dp, m +=1.\n\nSo for each step, the next_val is checked against n.\n\nThus, for the dp list, each element is <=n.\n\nSo, the last m is the largest m where dp[m] <=n.\n\nThus, the maximum m is the length of dp minus 1.\n\nWait, no. Because dp starts with m=1,2, etc.\n\nWait, let's think about dp as a list where index 1 is m=1, index 2 is m=2, etc.\n\nSo, for dp = [0,2,3,5,8], the indexes are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo m=4 is at index 4.\n\nSo the length of dp is 5 (indices 0-4), so the last m is 4.\n\nThus, the maximum m is the length of dp minus 1.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the last m added is the one that's <=n.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, next_val is computed, and if it's >n, the loop breaks. So the last added m is the one that is <=n.\n\nSo, the maximum m is the last m added.\n\nBut dp is a list where dp[1] is m=1, etc.\n\nSo, for example, when n=10, the dp list is [0,2,3,5,8,13], but wait, no. Because in the while loop, the condition is to add next_val only if it's <=n.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nInitially, dp is [0,2,3], m=3.\n\nCompute next_val=5. 5<=10: yes, add to dp. Now dp is [0,2,3,5], m=4.\n\nCompute next_val=3+5=8. 8<=10: add. dp becomes [0,2,3,5,8], m=5.\n\nCompute next_val=5+8=13>10: break.\n\nSo, the last m is 5.\n\nWait, but dp[5] would be 13, which is >10. So that's not part of the dp.\n\nWait, no. Because the while loop appends next_val only if it's <=n.\n\nWait, in the code, during the loop:\n\nnext_val = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2]\n\nif next_val >n: break\n\nelse: append next_val, m +=1.\n\nWait, no, no. Because initially, m is 3.\n\ndp has m=1,2.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect in initializing m.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nInitialize dp as [0,2,3], m=3.\n\nLoop:\n\nnext_val = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2] → dp[2] + dp[1] →3+2=5.\n\n5<=10: yes, append to dp → dp becomes [0,2,3,5]. m becomes 4.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nnext_val = dp[3] + dp[2] →5+3=8. 8<=10: yes, append → dp is [0,2,3,5,8]. m=5.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nnext_val= dp[4]+dp[3] →8+5=13>10: break.\n\nSo, the dp list is [0,2,3,5,8], and m is 5.\n\nSo, the maximum m is 4.\n\nBut in the code, the maximum m is the last m for which dp[m] <=n.\n\nThus, the code can just return the last m in the loop.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause during the loop, for each step, we add m as long as next_val <=n.\n\nSo, after the loop, the maximum m is the current m-1.\n\nBecause the last added m is the one where next_val is <=n.\n\nWait, no. Because m is incremented after appending.\n\nIn the case where next_val is <=n, we append it and increment m.\n\nSo for each step, the appended value is for m.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum m is the last m added.\n\nSo, for the dp list, the maximum m is the last index.\n\nBut in the dp list, index 4 is m=4, which is 8<=10.\n\nThus, the maximum m is 4.\n\nSo, the code can simply return the last m added.\n\nThus, perhaps during the loop, we can track the maximum m.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n <2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    dp = [0, 2, 3]\n    if n ==2:\n        print(1)\n    elif n ==3:\n        print(2)\n    else:\n        m =3\n        while True:\n            next_val = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2]\n            if next_val >n:\n                break\n            dp.append(next_val)\n            m +=1\n        print(m-1)\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nFor n=10:\n\nThe loop runs as follows.\n\nInitial dp = [0,2,3], m=3.\n\nnext_val =3+2=5<=10: append, m=4.\n\nnext_val=5+3=8<=10: append, m=5.\n\nnext_val=8+5=13>10: break.\n\nSo, m is 5.\n\nprint(m-1=4).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\nloop:\n\nnext_val=5>4: break.\n\nSo m=3.\n\nprint(m-1=2).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=5:\n\nnext_val=5<=5: append, m=4.\n\nnext_val=8>5: break.\n\nprint(3).\n\nWait, but dp[4] is 8>5, so the maximum m is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=7.\n\nLoop:\n\ndp starts as [0,2,3].\n\nm=3: next_val=5<=7: append, m=4.\n\nnext_val=3+5=8>7: break.\n\nSo m=4.\n\nprint 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut wait, for n=7, dp[3] is 5<=7, dp[4]=8>7.\n\nSo maximum m is 3.\n\nWhich the code correctly outputs.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead n.\n\nIf n <2: print 0.\n\nElse, handle n=2 and 3 separately.\n\nElse, initialize dp as [0,2,3].\n\nThen, loop, compute next_val as dp[m-1] + dp[m-2], check if <=n.\n\nAppend to dp and increment m.\n\nBreak when next_val >n.\n\nFinally, print m-1.\n\nWait, but wait for n=3.\n\nIn code:\n\nn=3.\n\nif n==3: print 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4, the code correctly returns 2.\n\nBut wait, in the code, after handling n=2 and 3, it's possible that for other n, the code proceeds into the loop.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\nif n <2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    if n ==2:\n        print(1)\n    elif n ==3:\n        print(2)\n    else:\n        dp = [0, 2, 3]\n        m =3\n        while True:\n            next_val = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2]\n            if next_val >n:\n                break\n            dp.append(next_val)\n            m +=1\n        print(m-1)\n\nWait, but wait: for n=5, the code will have m=4, and print 3.\n\nWhich is correct because dp[4] is 8>5.\n\nSo the maximum m is 3.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nTesting n=1: output 0.\n\nn=2: output 1.\n\nn=3: output 2.\n\nn=4: output 2.\n\nn=5: output 3.\n\nn=6: let's see.\n\ndp[3]=5, dp[4]=8.\n\nnext_val=5+3=8.\n\nn=6: 8>6.\n\nSo m=4, print 3.\n\nWhich is correct because the maximum m is 3.\n\nBecause for m=4, dp[4]=8>6.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test: n=8.\n\nLoop:\n\nm=3: next_val=5<=8: append, m=4.\n\nnext_val=3+5=8<=8: append, m=5.\n\nnext_val=5+8=13>8: break.\n\nprint m-1=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nn=13.\n\nLoop:\n\nm=3:5<=13: append, m=4.\n\nm=4:8<=13: append, m=5.\n\nm=5:13<=13: append, m=6.\n\nnext_val=8+13=21>13: break.\n\nprint m-1=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, edge case: n=1.\n\nOutput is 0.\n\nn=1018.\n\nWe need to compute the maximum m where dp[m] <=1018.\n\nSince dp grows like Fibonacci, it's manageable.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in. The tournament follows a specific rule where two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the number of games the winner can play follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires them to face opponents who have either played the same number of games or one fewer game than the winner.\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Each game eliminates one player.\n   - The winner can only play against another player if their number of games played differs by at most one.\n   - We need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play given `n` players.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - The number of games the winner can play grows in a manner similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, to play `m` games, the winner needs at least `F(m+2)` players, where `F` is the Fibonacci function.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Use a dynamic programming approach to precompute the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `m` games.\n   - Compute the Fibonacci-like sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play that many games.\n   - For a given `n`, find the largest `m` such that the minimum number of players required for `m` games is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - The solution efficiently computes the Fibonacci-like sequence up to the point where the value exceeds the given `n`. This ensures the solution runs in logarithmic time relative to the size of `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelif n == 2:\n    print(1)\nelif n == 3:\n    print(2)\nelse:\n    dp = [0, 2, 3]\n    m = 3\n    while True:\n        next_val = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2]\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        dp.append(next_val)\n        m += 1\n    print(m - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start with the base cases where the minimum number of players for 1 and 2 games are known.\n- **Dynamic Programming Loop**: Compute each subsequent term in the Fibonacci-like sequence, stopping when the next term exceeds `n`.\n- **Result Extraction**: The last valid term in the sequence gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `n`.",
