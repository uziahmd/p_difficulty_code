Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. But since we're trying to minimize the number, we want each new card to contribute as much as possible towards balancing the sum.\n\nLet me think: the initial sum is S = sum of the found cards. The target is 0, so the required sum from the additional cards is -S.\n\nBut each additional card can contribute at most x in absolute value. So, the minimal number of cards needed would be determined by how much each card can contribute towards the required sum.\n\nSo, let's calculate the required sum: required = -S.\n\nIf required is zero, then he doesn't need any more cards. That's the first case.\n\nOtherwise, the number of cards needed is the ceiling of |required| / x. Wait, no. Because each card can add up to x towards the required sum. So, for example, if the required is 5 and x is 2, then two cards are needed (2+3, but wait, no—each card can be up to x, which is 2. So 2+2=4, which is not enough. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no: each additional card can contribute any amount, as long as its absolute value is <=x. So to reach the required sum, each card can contribute as much as possible towards it.\n\nSo, for example, if required is 5 and x is 3. Then, one card of 3 contributes 3, leaving 2. Then another card of 2 contributes 2. So two cards. Alternatively, could it be done with two cards: 3 and 2. So the minimal number is 2.\n\nWait, but the way to compute it is the minimal k such that |required| ≤ k * x. So k is the ceiling of |required| / x.\n\nWait, no. Because when |required| is exactly divisible by x, then k is |required| /x. Otherwise, it's |required|/x rounded up.\n\nYes. So, the minimal number of cards is |required| divided by x, rounded up.\n\nBut wait, what if required is negative? Oh, because the sign doesn't matter—each card can be positive or negative. So, the absolute value is sufficient.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute required = -S.\n3. If required is zero, return 0.\n4. Else, compute k = ceil( |required| / x )\n   But wait, what if required is zero? Then no cards are needed.\n5. Return k.\n\nWait, but looking at the examples:\n\nFirst example input:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So required is -2.\n\nSo |required| is 2. x is 2. So 2/2 = 1, so k=1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4. Required is 4. x is 3. 4 /3 is 1.333..., so ceiling is 2. So k=2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=1, x=5, and the found card is 3. Sum S=3, required is -3. So |required|=3, x=5. So 3/5 is 0.6, ceiling is 1. So one card of -3 is needed.\n\nAnother case: n=2, x=5, found cards [5,5]. Sum S=10. Required is -10. x=5. 10/5=2, so k=2. So two cards of -5 each.\n\nWhat if required is 11 and x=5? 11/5 is 2.2, so ceiling is 3. So three cards: 5,5,1.\n\nWait, but each card can only contribute up to 5. So yes, 3 cards.\n\nSo the formula seems correct.\n\nBut",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and new) equals zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The target is to have the total sum be zero. Therefore, the sum of the additional cards needed is the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Compute Minimum Additional Cards**: Each additional card can contribute at most `x` in absolute value. To find the minimum number of such cards, we use the ceiling of the division of the required sum's absolute value by `x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nrequired = -s\nif required == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = abs(required) // x\n    if abs(required) % x != 0:\n        k += 1\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x` from the input. It then reads the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Required Adjustment**: The required adjustment to make the sum zero is determined by taking the negative of the found sum.\n4. **Determine Minimum Cards**: If the required adjustment is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, the minimum number of cards is calculated by dividing the absolute value of the required adjustment by `x` and rounding up to the nearest integer, ensuring each card contributes as much as possible towards balancing the sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal number of additional cards needed using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
