Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns.

The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street.

At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm. So, the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d where every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The street is a line from 0 to l. Each lantern i is at position ai. The area it covers is [ai - d, ai + d], but we have to make sure that this doesn't go beyond 0 or l. Wait, no—actually, since the street is from 0 to l, any part of the coverage beyond those points is irrelevant. So for each lantern, its effective coverage is the maximum between (ai -d) and 0, and the minimum between (ai + d) and l. But wait, no, because if the lantern is at ai=15 and l=15, then d=0 would only cover 15, but maybe not needed. Wait, no, the lanterns can have d as small as needed, but the street must be fully covered.\n\nWait, no: for a lantern at position a, its coverage is [max(0, a-d), min(l, a+d)]. But when considering multiple lanterns, the union of their coverage areas must include the entire [0, l].\n\nSo, the approach is to find the minimal d such that the union of all [a_i -d, a_i +d] intervals covers [0, l].\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the critical points where the coverage starts and ends. For each lantern, the leftmost point it covers is a_i -d, the rightmost is a_i +d. The entire street must be covered, so 0 must be >= the leftmost point of some lantern, and l must be <= the rightmost point of some lantern.\n\nWait, no: for the entire street to be covered, the union of all intervals must cover from 0 to l. So, the first interval must start before or at 0, but perhaps that's not necessary because other intervals might cover earlier points. Wait, no—no, the earliest point covered is the minimum of (a_i -d). So to cover 0, the minimum a_i -d must be <=0. Similarly, the maximum a_i +d must be >=l.\n\nWait, no. Because the union of the intervals must include every point from 0 to l. So, the leftmost point covered is the minimal a_i -d across all i. That minimal value must be <=0. Similarly, the rightmost point is the maximal a_i +d, which must be >=l.\n\nBut wait, no: for example, suppose there's a lantern at a=5, with d=3. Then a-d=2, which is greater than 0. So the minimal a_i -d is 2, but the street starts at 0, which is not covered by this lantern. However, another lantern could cover 0. So, the minimal a_i -d is not necessarily the point that covers 0, but the minimal across all a_i -d could be less than 0. Or wait, no—each lantern's a_i -d is the left end of its coverage. The union of all these intervals must include 0. So, the earliest point in the union is the minimal (a_i -d), but that minimal could be less than 0. Alternatively, the earliest point is 0, which must be covered by at least one interval. So, for 0 to be covered, there must exist at least one lantern i where a_i -d <= 0 and a_i +d >=0. Wait, no: because a_i is at or above 0. So a_i -d could be negative, but the coverage starts at 0. So, for 0 to be covered by some lantern, there must be at least one lantern i where a_i -d <=0, but the coverage interval starts at 0 for that lantern. So, for 0 to be covered, the minimal a_i -d across all i must be <=0, but wait, that's not sufficient. Because even if the minimal a_i -d is <=0, perhaps the other a_i -d are larger than 0, but that's okay because the minimal is <=0, so the coverage includes 0.\n\nWait, maybe not. For example, suppose the minimal a_i -d is 0, meaning one lantern's left end is exactly 0. Then 0 is covered. But if the minimal is less than 0, say -1, that means the coverage starts at 0 (since you can't have negative positions). So, the point 0 is covered by that lantern's left end being 0. So, regardless of whether the minimal a_i -d is <=0 or not, as long as the union of all intervals covers 0 and l.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the coverage as the union of [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)] for each i. So, the union of these intervals must include [0, l].\n\nTo find the minimal d, perhaps we can model this as a binary search problem.\n\nYes, binary search makes sense here. Because as d increases, the coverage becomes more comprehensive. So, for a given d, we can check whether the union of all intervals covers the entire street. If it does, we can try a smaller d; otherwise, we need to increase d.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions. This will help in efficiently checking for coverage.\n- Binary search over possible d values. The minimal d is somewhere between 0 and l/2, perhaps. Or maybe even higher, but it's better to set the initial range correctly.\n- For each candidate d in the binary search:\n   - Compute for each lantern the interval [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)]\n   - Check if the union of all these intervals covers [0, l]. That is, the first interval's start is <=0, the last interval's end is >=l, and the intervals overlap sufficiently in the middle.\n   - Wait, no. It's not just about the first and last intervals; the entire [0, l] must be covered by the union. So, perhaps the best way is to merge all the intervals and see if the merged interval starts at 0 and ends at l.\n\nWait, but merging intervals for each d would be computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 1000. So for each d, we can't afford to sort and merge intervals each time.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we need a smarter way to check coverage.\n\nAlternative approach: For a given d, the leftmost point covered is the minimum of (a_i -d) across all i. But wait, no. Because the leftmost point in the union is the minimum of (a_i -d), but only if that a_i -d is <= the others. So, for 0 to be covered, the minimal a_i -d must be <=0. Similarly, the maximum a_i +d must be >= l.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient. Because even if the minimal a_i -d is <=0 and the maximum a_i +d is >= l, there could be a gap in the middle.\n\nFor example, imagine two lanterns: one at 0 with d=2, covering [-2,2], but since the street is from 0 to l=10, it's actually [0,2]. Another lantern at 9 with d=2: covers [7,11], which on the street is [7,9]. So the union is [0,2] U [7,9], leaving a gap from 2 to 7. Thus, the entire street isn't covered.\n\nSo, the minimal a_i -d could be <=0, and the maximal a_i +d >= l, but there's a gap in the middle. Hence, just checking those two conditions isn't sufficient.\n\nHmm, so how else can we check if the entire street is covered? Perhaps, the intervals must form a single continuous block that starts at 0 and ends at l. So, for the given d, after computing all the intervals, we can track the furthest to the right we've covered so far. Starting from 0, we move as far right as possible by taking the earliest starting point and the latest ending point.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the entire street is covered if the leftmost point of the first interval is <=0, the rightmost point of the last interval is >= l, and the rightmost point of each interval is >= the leftmost point of the next. Or perhaps not, because the intervals could be non-overlapping and still cover the entire street. No, that's not possible because if they're non-overlapping, there's a gap.\n\nWait, no. For example, if all intervals are [0, d], [d, 2d], etc., then together they cover the entire street. But if any interval starts after the previous ends, then there's a gap.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute all the intervals, then check if the union is [0, l].\n\nBut how to do this efficiently without merging all intervals each time?\n\nAnother idea: For a given d, what is the farthest point to the right that can be covered by any lantern that starts before 0, and the farthest point to the left that can cover l.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not helpful. Maybe it's better to model the coverage as follows:\n\nThe coverage starts at the minimal (a_i -d) and ends at the maximal (a_i +d). But to cover the entire street, the minimal (a_i -d) must be <=0 and the maximal (a_i +d) must be >= l. But also, the intervals must overlap sufficiently so that every point in [0, l] is covered.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient. As the earlier example shows.\n\nSo, perhaps an alternative approach is to find the maximum of (a_i -d) for all i, and the minimum of (a_i +d) for all i. Then, if max(a_i -d) <= min(a_i +d), which is always true, but not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal required d is determined by the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, that's an interesting thought. Let's sort the lanterns' positions. Suppose they are sorted in increasing order a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.\n\nThen, for each consecutive pair, a_{i+1} - a_i, the required d must be at least half of the maximum gap between any two consecutive points. Because, for each gap of length g between a_i and a_{i+1}, the minimal d needed for them to cover that gap is (g)/2. Because if d is large enough that the right end of a_i's coverage (a_i +d) is >= a_{i+1}'s left end (a_{i+1} -d), then the gap is covered.\n\nWait, let's see. The coverage of a_i is [a_i -d, a_i +d], and the coverage of a_{i+1} is [a_{i+1} -d, a_{i+1} +d]. To cover the gap between a_i and a_{i+1}, the a_i's coverage must reach at least a_{i+1} -d, and a_{i+1}'s coverage must reach at least a_i +d. So, the condition is a_i +d >= a_{i+1} -d, which simplifies to a_{i+1} - a_i <= 2d. So, d must be at least (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for each i.\n\nAdditionally, we also have to consider the edges of the street. The first lantern must cover 0, so a_1 -d <=0. So, d >= a_1.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern must cover l, so a_n +d >= l. So, d >= l - a_n.\n\nWait, no. Because the coverage of a_1 is [a_1 -d, a_1 +d]. To cover 0, the a_1 -d <=0 → d >= a_1.\n\nSimilarly, for the last lantern a_n: a_n +d >= l → d >= l - a_n.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n1. (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\n2. a_1\n\n3. l - a_n\n\nBecause d must satisfy all these conditions simultaneously.\n\nAh! That's a key insight. So, the minimal d is the maximum of three values: the largest required d from the consecutive gaps, the required d from the first lantern to cover 0, and the required d from the last lantern to cover l.\n\nSo, the steps to compute d are:\n\n- Sort the array of a_i.\n\n- Compute the differences between consecutive a_i, and for each difference, compute d_i = diff / 2.\n\n- Also compute d_needed = a_1 (since a_1 -d <=0 → d >= a_1).\n\n- Also compute d_needed = (l - a_n) (since a_n +d >= l → d >= l - a_n).\n\n- The minimal d is the maximum of all d_i, d_needed, and d_needed.\n\nWait, let me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=2, l=5\n\npositions: 2 and 5.\n\nAfter sorting: 2,5.\n\nConsecutive difference is 3. So d_i = 1.5.\n\nAlso, d_needed from first lantern is 2.\n\nd_needed from last lantern is 5-5=0.\n\nSo, the maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: the first one.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=7, l=15\n\npositions: 15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nSorting gives: 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCompute the consecutive differences:\n\n0→3: 3 → d_i=1.5\n\n3→5: 2 → d_i=1\n\n5→7: 2 → d_i=1\n\n7→9: 2 → d_i=1\n\n9→14:5 → d_i=2.5\n\n14→15:1 → d_i=0.5\n\nSo, the maximum d_i is 2.5.\n\nThen, d_needed for first lantern: 0 (since a_1=0, d>=0).\n\nd_needed for last lantern: 15-15=0.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5, which is the sample output.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if the lanterns are at 0 and l.\n\nn=2, l=10.\n\npositions: 0,10.\n\ndifferences: 10 → d_i=5.\n\nd_needed for first: 0.\n\nd_needed for last: 0.\n\nSo d=5.\n\nWhich makes sense: each covers 0+5=5 and 10-5=5, but wait, no: the first covers from -5 to 5, but the street is 0-10. So the first covers 0-5, the second covers 5-15, so the union is 0-10.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5.\n\nOnly one lantern at, say, 3.\n\nThen, the required d must cover 0 and 5.\n\nSo, a_1=3. So d must be >=3 (to cover 0) and >=5-3=2. So d is 3.\n\nIndeed, the coverage is [0,6], but the street is 0-5, so it's covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute the maximum of:\n\n   a. The maximum of (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 for all i.\n\n   b. a[0]\n\n   c. l - a[-1]\n\nSo, this is O(n log n) due to the sorting, which is acceptable for n up to 1000.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nWait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is two integers n and l. The second line has n integers.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, no, looking back, the problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\nWait, so the second line is the list of ai's, separated by spaces.\n\nSo, for the first sample, the second line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nIn code, we can read the first line, split into n and l, then read the second line, split into a list of integers.\n\nThen, sort this list.\n\nCompute the differences between consecutive elements, find the maximum of (differences / 2).\n\nCompute a[0], compute (l - a[-1]).\n\nTake the maximum of all these.\n\nThat's the minimal d.\n\nWait, but what if n=1?\n\nLike n=1, l=5, a=[3].\n\nThen, a[0]=3, l -a[0]=2. Differences are none, so the max of (differences / 2) is 0.\n\nThus, the maximum is max(3, 2, 0) =3, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, a = [0, 0, 10], l=10.\n\nCompute differences: 0-0=0, 10-0=10. Max of (0/2, 10/2) =5.\n\nThen a[0]=0, l - a[-1]=0.\n\nSo max is 5.\n\nWhich makes sense: the first two lanterns are at 0. Their coverage is up to 5 each. The third is at 10, needs to have d=0, but also the coverage from the third must reach l=10, which it does with d=0. But the first two's coverage is up to 5, so to cover 5 to 10, the third's coverage must start at 5 (10-d=5 → d=5). So yes, d=5 is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and l.\n\n2. Read the list of a_i.\n\n3. Sort the list.\n\n4. Compute the differences between consecutive a_i.\n\n5. For each difference, compute d_i = difference / 2. Take the maximum of these.\n\n6. Compute d1 = a[0].\n\n7. Compute d2 = l - a[-1].\n\n8. The minimal d is the maximum of d_i, d1, d2.\n\nSo, now, coding this.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first sample's a_i after sorting is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The differences are 3,2,2,2,5,1. The d_i's are 1.5,1,1,1,2.5,0.5. The maximum is 2.5.\n\nd1 is 0, d2 is 0. So d=2.5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=2, l=5, a=[2,5].\n\nSorted a is [2,5]. Difference is 3 → d_i=1.5.\n\nd1 is 2, d2 is 0. So maximum is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nRead the input.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines, the second being a string of numbers. So, in code, we can read the second line, split into a list of strings, convert to integers.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nif n ==0:\n    # but according to constraints, n>=1\n    pass\n\nmax_gap = 0\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    max_gap = max(max_gap, diff / 2)\n\nd1 = a[0]\nd2 = l - a[-1]\n\nd = max(max_gap, d1, d2)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but what about the case where n=1? Like n=1, a=[0], l=5.\n\nThen, a[0] is 0. d1=0, d2=5-0=5.\n\nmax_gap is 0.\n\nSo d=5.\n\nWhich is correct, since the lantern at 0 with d=5 covers 0-5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a = [0,0,10], l=10.\n\ndifferences: 0 and 10 → d_i is 0 and 5. Max is 5.\n\nd1=0, d2=0. So d=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: a = [5,5,5], l=10.\n\ndifferences: 0,0 → d_i=0.\n\nd1=5.\n\nd2=5.\n\nSo d=5.\n\nEach lantern covers 0 to 10, since 5-5=0, 5+5=10.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling floating points accurately is important. Since the problem requires up to 1e-9 precision.\n\nBut in Python, using floats should be sufficient.\n\nSo, the code is as written.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 7 15\n\na = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]\n\nsorted a: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\ndifferences: 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1.\n\nd_i: 1.5, 1,1,1,2.5,0.5.\n\nmax_gap=2.5.\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=0.\n\nd=2.5.\n\nSample Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na = [2,5].\n\ndifferences=3 → d_i=1.5.\n\nd1=2.\n\nd2=0.\n\nso d=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nI think this should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street light up the entire street. The street is represented as a line segment from 0 to \\( l \\), and each lantern lights up a segment of the street within a distance \\( d \\) from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps in efficiently computing the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Compute Gaps**: Calculate the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns after sorting. For each gap, the required radius \\( d \\) must be at least half of the gap to ensure coverage.\n3. **Edge Coverage**: Ensure that the first lantern covers the start of the street (0) and the last lantern covers the end of the street (l). This gives us two additional constraints: \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern and the difference between the street length \\( l \\) and the position of the last lantern.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum value derived from the largest gap, the position of the first lantern, and the difference between the street length and the position of the last lantern.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\nfor i in range(n - 1):\n    diff = a[i + 1] - a[i]\n    current_gap = diff / 2.0\n    if current_gap > max_gap:\n        max_gap = current_gap\n\nd1 = a[0]\nd2 = l - a[-1]\n\nd = max(max_gap, d1, d2)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to efficiently compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Gaps Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, we calculate the required radius to cover the gap between them. The largest of these values is a candidate for the minimum radius.\n- **Edge Coverage**: The first lantern must cover from 0, so \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern. Similarly, the last lantern must cover up to \\( l \\), so \\( d \\) must be at least \\( l \\) minus the position of the last lantern.\n- **Final Radius**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum of the largest gap and the edge coverage requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius needed to cover the entire street, considering both the gaps between lanterns and the edges of the street.",
