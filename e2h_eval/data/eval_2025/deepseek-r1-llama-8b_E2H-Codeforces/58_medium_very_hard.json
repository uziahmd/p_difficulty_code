You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vitaly and a graph theory problem. The task is to find the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length, more than one vertex, and each vertex occurs at most once in the cycle. Also, we need to find the number of ways to do this.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to figure out is what's required for a graph to have such a cycle. And how to compute t and w.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. We need to find cycles that are odd-length. For example, triangles (length 3), pentagons (5), etc. Since the graph is undirected, each edge is counted once.\n\nThe approach might involve analyzing the connected components of the graph. Because if a component already has an odd cycle, then we don't need to add any edges. So the problem reduces to checking each connected component and seeing what's needed.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem allows adding edges between any vertices, not just within a component. So even if a component doesn't have an odd cycle, perhaps adding edges from other components can help form one.\n\nBut wait, no. Because to form a cycle, all vertices in the cycle must be connected. So if two components are connected by an edge, their union could form a larger component. But in terms of finding an odd cycle, maybe the minimal way is to look for each connected component and see if it has certain properties.\n\nWait, but the added edges can connect different components. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider each connected component and analyze its bipartition status because bipartite graphs cannot have odd-length cycles.\n\nWait, yes! Because a bipartite graph (a graph that doesn't contain any odd-length cycles) can only have even-length cycles. So if a component is bipartite, then any cycle it forms must be even-length. Hence, to get an odd-length cycle, we need to break the bipartition or somehow connect it with another component that allows forming an odd cycle.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each connected component in the graph, check whether it's bipartite. If it's not bipartite (i.e., it contains an odd cycle), then any subset of it can contribute to forming an odd cycle without adding any edges.\n\nIf it's bipartite, then we might need to add edges to make it non-bipartite, which would allow an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but how? Because adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition will create an odd cycle. For example, in a bipartite graph, if you add an edge between two nodes in the same partition, it creates an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo, for a bipartite component, the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd cycle is 1: add an edge within the same partition.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the minimal t for that component would be 1. But perhaps there's a better way when considering multiple components.\n\nWait, no. Because adding edges can also connect different components. So perhaps, combining two bipartite components in a certain way could lead to a situation where a single edge addition creates an odd cycle that spans both.\n\nHmm, that complicates things.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's process each connected component.\n\nCase 1: The component is not bipartite (contains an odd cycle). Then, any node in this component can be part of a cycle. So for such a component, the minimal t is 0, as we don't need to add any edges. But wait, the cycle needs to consist of more than one vertex. Oh right, but the component itself has such a cycle.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the problem requires that the cycle is simple and has an odd length. So if the component has an odd cycle, then the minimal t is zero because the cycle is already present.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the problem says to form a cycle consisting of more than one vertex. Well, any odd cycle has at least three vertices, so that condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, for any connected component that is non-bipartite, the minimal t is zero. But wait, no, because the entire graph may not have any such component. So, for example, if the graph is bipartite, then we have to find a way to create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, no. The graph may have multiple connected components. Some may be non-bipartite, others bipartite.\n\nSo the overall minimal t is determined by the minimal steps across all possible ways to combine components.\n\nSo let's formalize:\n\nWe can have several cases based on the connected components.\n\nCase 1: There exists a connected component that is non-bipartite. Then, the minimal t is 0, because that component can form an odd cycle on its own. So in this case, t=0 and the number of ways is equal to the number of such components, each contributing 1 way (since they can form the cycle as is).\n\nWait, no. Because each such component can form a cycle of odd length, but the problem requires a single cycle. So if there is more than one component that is non-bipartite, then the total number of ways is the sum of their individual ways, but since we can choose any of them to form the cycle.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the minimal t. So if any component is non-bipartite, then t is 0, and w is the number of such components.\n\nBecause for each such component, adding 0 edges can form a cycle. So the total ways are the count of such components.\n\nWait, but the problem is to form a single cycle. So if there are multiple non-bipartite components, each of them can form a cycle, and thus the number of ways is the sum of 1 for each such component.\n\nYes, because each such component contributes exactly one way.\n\nSo in this case, t=0 and w is the number of non-bipartite components.\n\nCase 2: All components are bipartite. Then, we need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle.\n\nIn this case, adding edges can be done in two ways:\n\na) Add one edge within a single bipartite component, turning it into a non-bipartite component. This will create an odd cycle. So the minimal t is 1.\n\nb) Alternatively, connect two bipartite components with an edge, but in such a way that the combined component forms an odd cycle. How?\n\nWait, if two bipartite components are connected by an edge, can that create an odd cycle?\n\nLet me think: suppose component A is bipartite, with partitions X and Y. Component B is bipartite, with partitions P and Q. Suppose I add an edge between a node u in X and a node v in P.\n\nWhat's the parity of the path lengths? Well, the cycle formed by going from u to v through some paths in A and B.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to model this as a bipartite graph and see how adding edges affects the bipartition.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the minimal t.\n\nIf all components are bipartite, then the minimal way is to either:\n\n- Add one edge inside a component, making it non-bipartite (t=1). Or,\n\n- Find two components, and connect them with an edge in a way that creates an odd cycle. But what's the minimal t for that?\n\nWait, connecting two bipartite components with one edge would create a new component. Is that component bipartite?\n\nNot necessarily. For example, if component A is bipartitioned into X and Y, and component B is bipartitioned into P and Q, then adding an edge between X and P would merge the two components. But is the merged component bipartite?\n\nNo. Because, for instance, if I have a bipartite graph, and connect two bipartitions with an edge, the resulting graph is no longer bipartite.\n\nWait, let me see: suppose in component A, u is in X, v is in Y. In component B, a is in P, b is in Q. Now, adding an edge between u and a. So in the new component, the path from u to a is length 1 (odd). But the rest of the component could have even or odd paths.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as a bipartite graph and see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal way to create an odd cycle when all components are bipartite is to add one edge within a component, leading to t=1.\n\nBut wait, can adding one edge between two components also create an odd cycle?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Because if you have two bipartite components, adding an edge between them may not immediately create an odd cycle. Because the path from the added edge could be even.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose component A is bipartitioned into {1}, {2}. Component B is bipartitioned into {3}, {4}.\n\nIf I add an edge between 1 and 3. Now, the path from 1-3 is length 1 (odd). But to form a cycle, we need a path that starts and ends at the same node with an odd length.\n\nIn this case, the cycle would require another connection back to 1, but that's not present. So adding a single edge between two components may not form a cycle, but just a bridge.\n\nWait, but for a cycle to exist, there must be a path from the starting node back to itself of odd length.\n\nSo perhaps adding a single edge between two components isn't enough.\n\nTherefore, the minimal way to form an odd cycle when all components are bipartite is to add one edge within a component.\n\nThus, in this case, t=1. And the number of ways is equal to the sum of the ways to add an edge within each component plus the number of ways to connect two components such that the combined graph has an odd cycle.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when all components are bipartite, adding one edge within a component can create an odd cycle. That's one possibility.\n\nAlternatively, can we add edges between two components to create an odd cycle with less than one edge?\n\nNo, because adding one edge is the minimal.\n\nSo the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the number of ways to add an edge within any of the bipartite components, plus the number of ways to connect two components in a way that creates an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but how many ways can connecting two components create an odd cycle? Because adding a single edge between two components may not create a cycle unless there's a path that loops around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding one edge between two components can create a cycle of length 3, but only if the two components have certain structures.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nSo, in the case where all components are bipartite, the minimal t is 1. Because adding one edge within a component makes it non-bipartite and thus forms an odd cycle.\n\nAdditionally, there may be another option: connect two bipartite components in a way that creates an odd cycle. For example, if two bipartite components are connected via an edge, and the sum of their bipartitions allows for a cycle of odd length.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is 1 regardless of whether we add an edge within a component or between two components.\n\nWait, let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose I have two bipartite components, each being a single edge. So each is a bipartition of two nodes. Adding an edge between them creates a triangle, which is an odd cycle of length 3.\n\nSo, in this case, adding one edge between two components creates an odd cycle. So in this case, t=1.\n\nBut wait, another scenario: component A is bipartitioned into {1,2} and {3}, component B is bipartitioned into {4,5} and {6}.\n\nAdding an edge between 2 and 4 would create a cycle: 1-3-2-4-6-5-4-2? No, that seems even.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that adding an edge between two bipartite components can sometimes create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nComponent A is a single edge: 1-2. Bipartitioned into {1}, {2}.\n\nComponent B is a single edge: 3-4. Bipartitioned into {3}, {4}.\n\nAdd an edge between 2 and 3. Now, the path 1-2-3-4-3-2-1 is a cycle of length 5 (odd). So yes, adding one edge can create an odd cycle spanning both components.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal t is 1, achieved by adding an edge between two components.\n\nSo, for the case where all components are bipartite, the minimal t is 1. But the number of ways depends on both the possibilities of adding an edge within a component and between components.\n\nWait, but how to calculate that.\n\nSo, the ways are:\n\n1. For each bipartite component, add an edge within its own bipartition. The number of such ways is the sum over each component of the product of the sizes of the two partitions.\n\nFor example, a component with partitions of size a and b can have a*b possible edges to add.\n\n2. For each pair of bipartite components (A, B), add an edge between a node in A's first partition and a node in B's first partition, or between A's first and B's second, etc. Wait, no. Because the way the partitions are connected affects the cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps for any two bipartite components, adding an edge between a node in A's left partition and a node in B's left partition could create a cycle of odd length.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any two bipartite components, adding an edge between any node in A and any node in B can create an odd cycle, but only if the sum of the parities is correct.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of ways is the sum over all pairs of bipartite components of the product of the sizes of their two partitions.\n\nWait, that sounds plausible.\n\nSo, for each component, we have a and b as the sizes of the two partitions. So the number of ways to add an edge within this component is a*b.\n\nThen, for each pair of components (A, B), the number of ways to connect them is (a_A * a_B) + (a_A * b_B) + (b_A * a_B) + (b_A * b_B)? Or maybe a_A * a_B + a_A * b_B + b_A * a_B + b_A * b_B?\n\nWait, no. Because when you connect two components, the way the partitions are connected matters.\n\nWait, perhaps adding an edge between a node in A's left partition and a node in B's left partition would create a cycle of even length, but adding an edge between a node in A's left and B's right could create an odd cycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any pair of components, the number of possible edges that can be added between them to form an odd cycle is (a_A * a_B) + (a_A * b_B) + (b_A * a_B) + (b_A * b_B)?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for two bipartite components A and B, adding an edge between a node u in A's left and v in B's left would result in a cycle of even length if u and v are in the same partition, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think differently.\n\nEach bipartite component can be represented as a bipartition (X, Y). Adding an edge between X and X would create an odd cycle, because the path from u to v within X would have even length, plus the added edge, making the total cycle length odd.\n\nSimilarly, adding an edge between Y and Y would do the same.\n\nBut adding an edge between X and Y doesn't create a cycle, it's just a bridge.\n\nWait, no. Because to form a cycle, you need a closed path.\n\nSo, adding an edge between X and Y won't create a cycle on its own. It would require that there's a path from Y back to X.\n\nSo, for example, if I have component A: X = {x1, x2}, Y = {y1}. Component B: X' = {x3}, Y' = {y2}.\n\nIf I add an edge between x2 and x3, that's X to X', which is within the same partition of each component. So the cycle would be x2 - x3 - x1 - y1 - y2 - x3 - x2. Wait, no, that's a cycle of length 6, which is even.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the only way to form a cycle is by adding an edge within a component. Because adding an edge between two components doesn't immediately form a cycle.\n\nSo perhaps, when all components are bipartite, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum of a_i * b_i for each component i, plus the sum over all pairs (i < j) of (a_i * a_j + a_i * b_j + b_i * a_j + b_i * b_j) ?\n\nNo, that seems too big.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of ways is the sum of (a_i * b_i) for all bipartite components, plus the number of possible edges between any two bipartite components.\n\nWait, but adding an edge between two components may not form a cycle. So perhaps it's not counted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the case where all components are bipartite, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum of (a_i * b_i) for each component, plus the number of possible edges that can be added between any two components in a way that forms a cycle.\n\nBut calculating that is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way to form a cycle is by adding an edge within a component. Because adding an edge between components doesn't immediately create a cycle. So in that case, the number of ways is the sum of a_i * b_i for each component.\n\nBut wait, the earlier example contradicts that. Because adding an edge between two components can create a cycle of odd length.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nI think I need to model the problem differently.\n\nLet me try to outline the solution steps:\n\n1. For each connected component, determine if it's bipartite. If it's not, then it contributes to the answer with t=0 and w increased by 1.\n\n2. If there are any non-bipartite components, then t=0 and w is the number of such components.\n\n3. Else (all components are bipartite):\n\n   a. Compute the minimal t, which is 1.\n\n   b. Compute the number of ways w, which is the sum of (a_i * b_i) for each component i, plus the number of pairs of components that can be connected by an edge to form an odd cycle.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps in this case, any edge added within a component can form an odd cycle. So for each component, the number of ways to add an edge within it is a_i * b_i.\n\nAlso, for any pair of components, adding an edge between a node in the left partition of the first and a node in the right partition of the second can create a cycle of odd length.\n\nWait, let me think about that.\n\nSuppose component A has bipartition (X, Y), component B has bipartition (P, Q).\n\nAdding an edge between x in X and q in Q: does that create a cycle of odd length?\n\nWait, let's see: the path from x to q is the new edge (length 1, odd). But to form a cycle, we need a path from q back to x. So, the existing edges in A and B must allow for that.\n\nBut perhaps, if the two components are completely disconnected except for the new edge, then adding that edge alone doesn't form a cycle.\n\nSo perhaps, connecting two bipartite components with an edge doesn't form a cycle, but just a bridge.\n\nSo, in that case, the only way to form a cycle is to add an edge within a component.\n\nThus, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum of a_i * b_i across all components.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, adding an edge between two components created a cycle of length 3. So that's a contradiction.\n\nIn that example:\n\nComponent A: 1-2 (bipartitioned as {1}, {2}).\n\nComponent B: 3-4 (bipartitioned as {3}, {4}).\n\nAdding an edge between 2 and 3 creates a cycle 1-2-3-4-3-2-1? No, that's a cycle of length 5, which is odd.\n\nWait, but the path is 2-3, 3-4, 4-3, 3-2, 2-1, 1-2. Wait, no, that's not a simple cycle.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in that example.\n\nLet me re-express it.\n\nAfter adding edge 2-3, what cycles are possible?\n\nOne possible cycle is 2-3-4-3-2, which is a triangle (length 3). Oh right, because in component B, 3 is connected to 4, and now connected to 2. So 3 is connected to both 4 and 2, forming a triangle.\n\nAh, I see. So in that case, adding an edge between two components can create an odd cycle, even though each component was bipartite.\n\nSo this means that for the case where all components are bipartite, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum of a_i * b_i plus the number of pairs of components that can be connected by an edge in a way that forms an odd cycle.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, perhaps for any two bipartite components, adding an edge between a node in X of the first component and a node in Y of the second component will form a cycle of length 2, which is even. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, adding an edge between a node in X of the first and a node in X of the second component would form a cycle of even length.\n\nWait, no. Let's say component A has X={x1, x2}, Y={y1}.\n\nComponent B has X'={x3}, Y'={y2}.\n\nAdding an edge between x2 and x3. Then, the path x2-x3-x1-y1-x2 would form a cycle of length 4, which is even.\n\nHmm, not useful.\n\nWait, perhaps the only way to create an odd cycle when all components are bipartite is to add an edge within a single component.\n\nSo, the number of ways is the sum of a_i * b_i for each component.\n\nBut then, in the earlier example, adding an edge between two components did create a cycle, but that's a special case.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to compute the number of ways is:\n\nw = sum_{each bipartite component} (a_i * b_i) + sum_{all pairs of bipartite components} (number of edges that can be added between them to create an odd cycle).\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that when all components are bipartite, the minimal t is 1. The number of ways is the sum of a_i * b_i for each component, plus the number of edges between two components that, when added, create an odd cycle.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is equal to the sum of a_i * b_i for all components, plus the number of possible edges that can be added between any two components in a way that creates an odd cycle.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nThis seems quite complex.\n\nPerhaps I should look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, perhaps this problem is related to the concept of \"cycle rank\" or \"non-bipartite components\". But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model each bipartite component as needing to have an edge added within it or between it and another component in a way that forms an odd cycle.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about all the possible ways to form an odd cycle.\n\nAn odd cycle must have at least three nodes. So for each possible triplet of nodes, if they form a cycle, but that's computationally expensive.\n\nBut the problem is to find the minimal t and the number of ways.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the connected components and their bipartition.\n\nSo, the steps I'll follow are:\n\n1. For each connected component, check if it's bipartite. If it's not, then it contributes to the answer with t=0 and w += 1.\n\n2. If any component is non-bipartite, then the answer is t=0 and w is the number of such components.\n\n3. Else, all components are bipartite.\n\n   a. Compute the minimal t, which is 1.\n\n   b. Compute w as follows:\n\n      i. For each component, the number of ways to add an edge within it is a_i * b_i.\n\n      ii. Additionally, for each pair of components (A, B), the number of ways to add an edge between them in a way that creates an odd cycle.\n\nBut I'm stuck on part iii.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the all-bipartite case, the number of ways is the sum of a_i * b_i for each component, plus the number of edges that can be added between two components in such a way that the new edge creates an odd cycle.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, in the example given in the problem statement:\n\nSample Input:\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n\nSample Output: 0 1.\n\nBecause the component is a triangle, which is a non-bipartite graph. So t=0, w=1.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n4 4\n1 2\n1 3\n4 2\n4 3\n\nWhich is two connected components? Or is it connected?\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nEdges: 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3.\n\nSo nodes 1,2,3,4 are connected as 1-2-4-3-1. So it's a single component.\n\nIs this component bipartite?\n\nLet's check:\n\nAssuming 1 is in partition X.\n\n2 is connected to 1 → partition Y.\n\n4 is connected to 2 → partition X.\n\n3 is connected to 4 → partition Y.\n\nNow, 3 is connected to 1, which is in X. So 3 is in Y, connected to X. That's fine.\n\nWait, but 3 is in Y, connected to 1 in X. So no conflict.\n\nWait, but 3 is connected to 4 (Y to X), and 4 is connected to 2 (X to Y), which is connected to 1 (Y to X). So the component is bipartite.\n\nWait, but in this case, the component is a square, which is bipartite. So adding an edge within the component can create an odd cycle.\n\nLike adding 1-3. Then 1-2-4-3-1 is a cycle of length 4 (even), but 1-3 is a chord. Then, 1-3-2-1 is a cycle of length 3, which is odd.\n\nSo in this case, adding an edge within the component (1-3) is a way to create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal t is 1.\n\nThe number of ways is the number of possible edges that can be added within the component.\n\nThe component has partitions X = {1,4}, Y = {2,3}. So a = 2, b=2. So the number of possible edges is 2*2=4.\n\nSo the output is t=1, w=4.\n\nBut according to the sample output, it's '1 2'.\n\nWait, wait the sample input in the problem is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\n4 3\n\nSample Output 1:\n\n1 2.\n\nWait, why?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, in the first sample input, the graph is:\n\n1 connected to 2 and 3.\n\n4 connected to 2 and 3.\n\nSo the component is 1-2-4-3-1, which is a cycle of length 4, which is even. So the component is bipartite.\n\nSo, the number of ways to add an edge within this component is 2 * 2 =4.\n\nBut the sample output is 1 2.\n\nHmm, that suggests that I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\nWait, no, perhaps the actual sample input is three test cases, but the output is three lines.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nFirst line: 4 4\n\nThen four edges: 1-2, 1-3, 4-2,4-3.\n\nSo the graph is connected and bipartite.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is 4.\n\nBut the sample output is '1 2'.\n\nWait, that suggests that I'm missing something.\n\nAh, wait, perhaps the sample input includes three test cases, each with their own output.\n\nWait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\nSo, there are three separate test cases.\n\nSo the first case is n=4, m=4, the second is n=3, m=3, the third is n=3, m=0.\n\nSo the first case:\n\nThe component is a square, which is bipartite. So t=1. Number of ways is 4.\n\nBut sample output is '1 2'. So why?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the components are processed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component has a certain number of ways, but also, adding edges between components can form an odd cycle.\n\nWait, in the first test case, all nodes are in one component, which is bipartite. So adding an edge within it gives 4 ways.\n\nBut perhaps adding an edge between this component and any other component can also form an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but in the first test case, there are no other components. So the sample output is '1 2'—why?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the ways.\n\nWait, perhaps the component is bipartitioned as {1,4} and {2,3}.\n\nSo the number of edges within the component is 2*2=4.\n\nBut why is the sample output 2?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the bipartition.\n\nWait, perhaps the component has a different bipartition.\n\nLet me perform a BFS to find the bipartition.\n\nStart with node 1: color 0.\n\nNeighbors 2 and 3: color 1.\n\nFrom 2: neighbors 1 and 4. 4 is uncolored: color 0.\n\nFrom 3: neighbor 4: already colored 0.\n\nSo the bipartition is X = {1,4}, Y = {2,3}.\n\nSo a = 2, b=2. So the number of edges is 2*2=4.\n\nBut sample output is 2.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the component is not bipartite. How?\n\nWait, in the component, is there a cycle of odd length?\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n1-2, 2-4, 4-3, 3-1.\n\nSo the path 1-2-4-3-1 is a cycle of length 4, which is even.\n\nNo odd cycles. So the component is bipartite.\n\nSo why is the sample output 1 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way the problem counts the ways is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers that adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition can create an odd cycle.\n\nSo for the component, the number of ways is the number of edges that can be added within the same partition.\n\nWhich for a bipartition X and Y is |X| * |X| + |Y| * |Y|?\n\nNo, that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a bipartition X and Y, the number of edges that can be added within X is C(|X|, 2), and similarly for Y.\n\nBut that would be for a complete graph within X.\n\nBut in our case, the component is a tree, so adding any edge within X or Y would create an odd cycle.\n\nSo the number of ways is |X| * (|X| - 1)/2 + |Y| * (|Y| - 1)/2.\n\nBut for X size 2, it's 1, Y size 2, it's 1. So total 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAh, that's probably it.\n\nSo, for each bipartition, the number of edges within the same partition is (s choose 2), where s is the size of the partition.\n\nSo for the component, the number of ways is (|X| choose 2) + (|Y| choose 2).\n\nIn the first test case, |X|=2, |Y|=2. So (1)+(1)=2.\n\nHence, the number of ways is 2.\n\nSo, for the case where all components are bipartite:\n\nt=1.\n\nw is the sum over all components of (|X| choose 2 + |Y| choose 2).\n\nAdditionally, for any pair of bipartite components, the number of ways to connect them by adding an edge between a node in X of the first and a node in Y of the second is (|X| * |Y|) for each pair.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of ways to add an edge between two bipartite components to form an odd cycle is |X| * |Y| for each pair.\n\nBut in the first case, there are no other components, so only the first part applies.\n\nIn the second test case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nEdges: 1-2, 2-3, 3-1.\n\nThis is a triangle, which is a cycle of length 3, which is non-bipartite.\n\nSo t=0, w=1.\n\nThird test case: n=3, m=0.\n\nAll nodes are isolated. So each node is a component of size 1.\n\nEach is bipartite, as a single node is trivially bipartitioned.\n\nSo, for each component, the number of ways to add an edge within the same partition is zero, because each component has only one node.\n\nSo, for each component, (1 choose 2) is 0.\n\nSo the total w is zero.\n\nBut wait, the minimal t is 1, because we need to add one edge.\n\nSo, in this case, all components are bipartite, so t=1.\n\nBut the number of ways is the sum of (|X| choose 2 + |Y| choose 2) for each component, which is 0 for each, so sum is zero.\n\nPlus the number of edges between any two components that can create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nEach component is a single node. So adding an edge between any two nodes creates a K2, which is bipartite. So no, it doesn't form an odd cycle.\n\nWait, no. Because a K2 is bipartitioned into two single-node sets. Adding an edge between two single-node components would create a single edge, which is bipartite. So it doesn't form an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but the third test case is n=3, m=0.\n\nSo each node is a component. So the total number of bipartite components is 3.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1.\n\nThe number of ways is:\n\nsum over each component of (choose 2 for X and Y) → 0 for each.\n\nplus the number of ways to connect any two components in a way that creates an odd cycle.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause each component is a single node, adding an edge between two nodes would create a single edge, which is even cycle (but not a cycle at all). So no, that wouldn't create a cycle.\n\nWait, but a single edge is not a cycle. So in this case, adding one edge between two components can't form a cycle.\n\nSo, the only way is to add an edge within a component, but each component has only one node, so no edges can be added within a component.\n\nThus, in this case, it's impossible to form an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but the problem says that we must form a simple cycle of odd length, consisting of more than one vertex.\n\nSo, if all components are bipartite and all have size 1, then adding edges between them won't create a cycle. Adding an edge within a component is impossible. So it's impossible to form such a cycle.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer for the third test case is '3 1'.\n\nWait, the sample output",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and count the number of ways to achieve this. The graph is undirected and may not be connected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Bipartiteness**: For each connected component in the graph, determine if it is bipartite. A bipartite graph cannot have any odd-length cycles.\n2. **Non-Bipartite Components**: If any component is non-bipartite, it already contains an odd-length cycle.
