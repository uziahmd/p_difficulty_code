Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. The string is ternary, consisting of '0's, '1's, and '2's. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1's, or between adjacent '1's and '2's. So, I can't directly swap a '0' with a '2', for example.\n\nHmm, the goal is to rearrange the string as much as possible using these swaps to get the smallest lex order. Let me think about what this means for each character.\n\nI think each character type can be grouped based on their allowed positions relative to others. For instance, '0's can only be swapped with '1's, but not directly with '2's. So, the relative ordering of '0's and '2's in the original string might influence the outcome.\n\nWait, let's consider that any '0's can move past '1's, but '2's can't be moved past '0's unless they're adjacent to '1's. Or maybe it's more complicated than that. Maybe '0's can only be moved relative to '1's, but '1's can also be moved relative to '2's. So overall, '0's can be moved past '1's, and '1's can be moved past '2's, which implies that '0's can be moved past '2's via a chain of swaps through '1's. But wait, no—because to move a '0' past a '2', you'd need to have a path of '1's between them. Otherwise, you can't swap '0' and '2' directly.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is that the '0's can only be reordered among themselves and with '1's, but '2's can only be reordered with '1's. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the string is \"210\". Can I swap the '2' and '1' to get \"120\"? Well, yes: because '1' and '2' can be swapped directly. Then, can I then swap the '1' and '0'? Yes, because '0' and '1' can be swapped. So after two swaps, \"210\" becomes \"120\", and then \"012\". Wait, but wait: \"210\" -> swap 2 and 1 (positions 1 and 2) gives \"120\". Then, from \"120\", can I swap 1 and 0 (positions 1 and 2 again), giving \"021\"? Oh right, because '0' can move left past '1's, but in this case, the '0' is moving right past the '1'. So yes, that's allowed.\n\nBut wait, in \"120\", the '0' is at position 3. To move it to the front, we can swap it with the '1' at position 2, making it \"102\". Then, swap '1' and '0' again to make it \"012\". So yes, the '0' can end up before the '1's.\n\nWait, but in the initial string, \"210\", the '0' is at the end. After all possible swaps, it can reach the front. So does that mean that '0's can be placed anywhere relative to '1's, regardless of other characters? Or is there a constraint?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's depends on whether they can be connected via '1's. So, if a '0' and a '2' are separated by a '1', the '0' can be moved past the '2' by swapping with the '1'. So, in that case, the '0' can end up before the '2'.\n\nBut if a '0' and a '2' are not separated by a '1', like in \"20\", then they can't be swapped directly, and since there's no way to move the '0' past the '2' via other swaps, their order is fixed.\n\nWait, let's test that. Take \"20\". Since '0' and '2' are adjacent and can't be swapped, the only thing I can do is swap the '2' and the next '0' if it's a '1', but in this case, it's a '0', so no. So in \"20\", I can't change anything. So the output remains \"20\".\n\nBut if I have \"201\", can I rearrange the '0' and '2'? Let's see. The string is \"2 0 1\". The '0' can swap with '1' to become \"2 1 0\". Then, the '1' can swap with '2' to become \"1 2 0\". So now,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing allowed swaps on a given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1' characters or between adjacent '1' and '2' characters.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each character type ('0', '1', '2') can be reordered among themselves but with certain constraints:\n1. '0's can only be swapped with '1's.\n2. '1's can be swapped with both '0's and '2's.\n3. '2's can only be swapped with '1's.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can derive the following strategy:\n1. **Separate '0's and '2's**: Since '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped, their relative order remains fixed unless there's an intervening '1'. However, if a '0' and '2' are separated by a '1', they can be rearranged through swaps involving the '1'.\n2. **Reorder '0's and '1's**: All '0's can be moved to the left past any number of '1's, and all '1's can be moved to the right past any number of '0's.\n3. **Reorder '1's and '2's**: Similarly, all '1's can be moved to the left past any number of '2's, and all '2's can be moved to the right past any number of '1's.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can determine the minimal arrangement of the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimal_ternary_string(s):\n    # Convert string into a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    n = len(s_list)\n    \n    # We can process 0s and 1s together, and separately process 1s and 2s\n    # So first, let's collect all 0s, then 1s, then 2s, and see how they can be interleaved\n    \n    # Count the positions where 0s, 1s, and 2s can be placed\n    zero_positions = []\n    one_positions = []\n    two_positions = []\n    \n    for i, c in enumerate(s_list):\n        if c == '0':\n            zero_positions.append(i)\n        elif c == '1':\n            one_positions.append(i)\n        else:\n            two_positions.append(i)\n    \n    # Now, the idea is to place all 0s as far left as possible,\n    # then 1s as far left as possible, then 2s.\n    \n    # Initialize pointers for each group\n    z_ptr = 0\n    o_ptr = 0\n    t_ptr = 0\n    \n    result = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        # Determine which group should fill the current position\n        if z_ptr < len(zero_positions) and zero_positions[z_ptr] <= i:\n            result.append('0')\n            z_ptr += 1\n        elif o_ptr < len(one_positions) and one_positions[o_ptr] <= i:\n            result.append('1')\n            o_ptr += 1\n        elif t_ptr < len(two_positions) and two_positions[t_ptr] <= i:\n            result.append('2')\n            t_ptr += 1\n        else:\n            # This case shouldn't happen as we have all positions accounted for\n            # But just in case, take the earliest remaining\n            result.append('0' if z_ptr < len(zero_positions) else '1' if o_ptr < len(one_positions) else '2')\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input\ns = input().strip()\nprint(minimal_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves the following steps:\n1. **Convert the string into a list** to facilitate easy manipulation.\n2. **Count positions** of '0's, '1's, and '2's separately.\n3. **Determine the order** of each character type based on their positions. '0's are processed first, followed by '1's, and then '2's.\n4. **Construct the result** by iterating through the string and placing each character type in the earliest possible position based on their counts and allowed swaps.\n\nThis approach ensures that we achieve the lexicographically smallest string by optimally reordering the characters according to the allowed swap operations.",
