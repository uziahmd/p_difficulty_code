She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has n tabs open in her browser. The tabs are numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right within the currently open tabs, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to model what actions she can take and figure out the optimal sequence to minimize time.\n\nLet me think about the steps she needs to take. There are a few possibilities here.\n\nFirst, she might need to move the cursor to certain positions to close the necessary tabs. For example, if some tabs to the left of l are open, she needs to get to the left end of the segment she wants to keep (l), then close those tabs. Similarly for the right.\n\nWait, but after closing some tabs, the available tabs change, which affects the possible cursor movements. So the order of operations matters.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Determine which tabs to the left of l need to be closed. That's all tabs before l, i.e., 1 to l-1.\n2. Determine which tabs to the right of r need to be closed. That's r+1 to n.\n3. The initial position is pos. So she might need to move to certain points to perform the close operations.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Move to the left end of the desired segment (l) to close all left tabs.\n- Close all left tabs.\n- Move to the right end (r) to close all right tabs.\n- Close all right tabs.\n\nOr another order: move to r, close right, then move to l and close left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can close right first if that's more efficient.\n\nWait, but sometimes it's better to close one side first and then the other.\n\nBut also, maybe there's no need to move at all. Like in the third example where l=1 and r=5, and pos is 2. Then she doesn't need to do anything because all the tabs from l to r are already open, and the rest are outside, which she doesn't need to close. Wait, wait—no. Wait, the initial state is all tabs open. She needs to leave only l to r. So she must close any tabs outside l to r.\n\nIn the third sample input: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5. So all tabs are kept except none. So she doesn't need to do anything. Output is 0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n=5, l=1, r=5: she needs to close all tabs outside 1-5, which is none. So yes, output is 0.\n\nSo the first thing is to check whether she already has the desired set of tabs. If l is 1 and r is n, then she doesn't need to do anything. But that's not the case in general.\n\nSo, let's outline the possible steps.\n\nCase 1: No tabs to close on either side.\n\nIf l is 1 and r is n, then she doesn't need to do anything.\n\nOtherwise, she has to close some tabs.\n\nSo, the main cases are when she needs to close tabs on the left, right, both, or neither.\n\nWait, but even if l is 1, she might need to close tabs to the right, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- If there are tabs to the left of l that need to be closed, she needs to go to l and close them.\n- If there are tabs to the right of r that need to be closed, she needs to go to r and close them.\n\nEach of these actions requires moving the cursor and taking time.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCalculate the minimal steps needed to:\n\n1. Reach the left boundary (l) and close the left tabs.\n2. Reach the right boundary (r) and close the right tabs.\n\nEach of these steps contributes to the total time.\n\nBut the order of these two steps matters because moving from l to r or vice versa may have different step counts depending on their positions.\n\nWait, but after closing one side, the available tabs change. For example, after closing the left, the new a (minimum index) becomes l, so the cursor can't go beyond that. Similarly for closing the right.\n\nSo, the steps should be considered in a way that accounts for the current state after each action.\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe the best approach is to model the problem by considering all possible orders of closing the left and right, compute the time for each, and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, the possible scenarios are:\n\nA. Close left first, then right.\n\nB. Close right first, then left.\n\nC. Only close left.\n\nD. Only close right.\n\nE. Both left and right are already closed.\n\nSo, for each scenario, calculate the time and select the minimum.\n\nWait, but E is when l=1 and r=n, which is a separate case.\n\nSo, for each of A and B, compute the time, then compare.\n\nNow, how to compute the time for each scenario.\n\nLet's model each scenario.\n\nScenario A: Close left first, then right.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Move from pos to l, then close left. Time taken: distance between pos and l.\n\n2. Now, after closing left, the available tabs are l to current r (which was the original r). But wait, no, closing left would mean all tabs to the left of current cursor are closed. So after closing left, the a becomes l.\n\nWait, no. When you're at position i, and you close all to the left, then the new a is i.\n\nWait, when you close all tabs to the left of i, then the remaining tabs start from i.\n\nSimilarly, closing to the right of i leaves the tabs up to i.\n\nSo, after closing left, the available tabs are from l to current b, which was the original r.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the initial state is a=1, b=n.\n\nAfter closing left, the a becomes the current position, which is l.\n\nSimilarly, after closing right, the b becomes current position, which is r.\n\nSo, when we decide to close left first, we have to consider that after that, the available tabs are l to current b (which was r).\n\nSo, for the next step, moving to r may require moving from l to r, but in the available tabs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the movement after each step.\n\nSo, let's think of each scenario.\n\nScenario A: Close left, then right.\n\nTime to close left:\n\n- Need to move from pos to l. Time is |pos - l|.\n\n- After moving, close left. Takes 1 second.\n\nTotal so far: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nThen, after closing left, the available tabs are l to r.\n\nNow, to close the right, we need to move from l to r, and close right.\n\nBut the movement is within the current available tabs, which are l to r.\n\nSo, movement is from l to r: time is r - l.\n\nClose right: 1 second.\n\nTotal time for scenario A: (|pos - l| + 1) + (r - l + 1) = |pos-l| + r - l + 2.\n\nWait, no: |pos - l| is the steps to get to l, then 1 step to close left. Then, from l, moving to r: (r - l) steps, then 1 step to close right. So total steps: (|pos - l| + 1) + (r - l + 1) = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, but wait: when you close the left, the a becomes l. So when moving from l to r, you can move directly without any restrictions.\n\nYes, because the available tabs are l to r.\n\nSo, movement from l to r is (r - l) steps, then close right: 1 step.\n\nSo, scenario A's total time is (distance from pos to l) + 1 (close left) + (distance from l to r) + 1 (close right) = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, but in the initial state, after closing left, the available tabs are l to r. So, from l, moving to r is r - l steps.\n\nYes.\n\nScenario B: Close right first, then left.\n\nTime to close right:\n\n- Move from pos to r: |pos - r| steps.\n\n- Close right: 1 second.\n\nTotal so far: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nThen, to close left, move from r to l: |r - l| steps.\n\nClose left: 1 second.\n\nTotal time: (|pos - r| + 1) + (|r - l| + 1) = |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut wait, after closing right, the available tabs are l to r, same as scenario A.\n\nSo, moving from r to l is r - l steps (since r > l? Or depends on the direction. Oh, but if r < l, but in our problem, l <= r, so r >= l.)\n\nSo, moving from r to l is (r - l) steps.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nNow, what about the cases where we don't need to close both sides?\n\nFor example, if l=1 and r is somewhere in the middle.\n\nIn that case, we need to close the right side, but perhaps the left is already okay.\n\nWait, no: if l=1, then all the tabs to the left of 1 are none, so no need to close left. So the scenario is only to close the right.\n\nSimilarly, if r =n, then no need to close right.\n\nSo, in such cases, the time is just the steps to reach the end (r or l) and close.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal time is the minimum of:\n\n- Scenario A: close left then right.\n\n- Scenario B: close right then left.\n\n- Scenario C: only close left (if needed).\n\n- Scenario D: only close right (if needed).\n\nWe can compute all possible options and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nCompute four variables:\n\n1. time_close_left_first: scenario A's time.\n\n2. time_close_right_first: scenario B's time.\n\n3. time_close_left_only: the time if we only need to close left.\n\n4. time_close_right_only: the time if we only need to close right.\n\nWait, but what's the condition for each?\n\nFor time_close_left_only: we need to have tabs to the left of l (i.e., l>1), and we need to close them. So, if l>1, then we must do this.\n\nSimilarly for right_only: if r <n, we must close right.\n\nSo, let's formalize:\n\nIf l > 1: need to close left.\n\nIf r <n: need to close right.\n\nSo, for each of these, compute the time.\n\nBut when both are needed, we can choose between A and B.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCheck if l > 1 or r <n.\n\nIf both are true: compute A and B, and choose the minimal.\n\nIf only left is needed: compute left_only.\n\nIf only right is needed: compute right_only.\n\nElse: zero.\n\nSo, for each scenario:\n\nLeft_only:\n\nIf l>1:\n\ntime = distance from pos to l + 1 (move and close).\n\nRight_only:\n\nIf r <n:\n\ntime = distance from pos to r + 1.\n\nIf both are needed:\n\ncompute A and B.\n\nSo, now, the minimal time is the minimum between all possible options.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the four possibilities (A, B, C, D), but only include those that are applicable.\n\nTake the minimal among them.\n\nWait, but let's make it precise.\n\nLet me outline all possible cases.\n\nCase 1: l == 1 and r ==n.\n\nNo need to do anything. Time is 0.\n\nCase 2: l ==1 and r <n.\n\nNeed to close right.\n\nTime is steps to move from pos to r, plus 1.\n\nCase 3: r ==n and l>1.\n\nNeed to close left.\n\nTime is steps to move from pos to l, plus 1.\n\nCase 4: l>1 and r <n.\n\nSo, need to close both left and right.\n\nCompute scenario A and B, then take the minimal.\n\nSo, the code will have to handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's see how to compute each scenario.\n\nScenario A: close left first, then right.\n\nCompute the steps:\n\n1. Move from pos to l: steps = |pos - l|.\n\n2. Close left: 1 step.\n\n3. Move from l to r: steps = r - l.\n\n4. Close right: 1 step.\n\nTotal: steps1 + 2 + steps3.\n\nWait, no: steps1 is |pos - l|, then 1 step for close, then steps3 is r - l, then 1 step for close.\n\nSo, total is |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nScenario B: close right first, then left.\n\nCompute steps:\n\n1. Move from pos to r: steps = |pos - r|.\n\n2. Close right: 1 step.\n\n3. Move from r to l: steps = r - l.\n\n4. Close left: 1 step.\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo, for case 4, the minimal time is min(A, B).\n\nSo, now the plan is:\n\nCheck if l>1 and r <n.\n\nIf so, compute A and B, and choose the smaller.\n\nElse, if l>1: compute left_only.\n\nElse if r <n: compute right_only.\n\nElse: 0.\n\nWait, but what about the case where after closing left, moving to r is easier than moving through other steps?\n\nNo, because in scenario A, the steps are calculated correctly.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as:\n\nCompute:\n\nhas_left = (l > 1)\n\nhas_right = (r <n)\n\nif has_left and has_right:\n\n    option1 = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2\n\n    option2 = |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2\n\n    minimal = min(option1, option2)\n\nelif has_left:\n\n    # only close left\n\n    option = |pos - l| + 1\n\nelif has_right:\n\n    # only close right\n\n    option = |pos - r| + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    # nothing to do\n\n    option = 0\n\nreturn minimal option.\n\nWait, but wait: in scenario A, the movement after closing left is from l to r, which takes (r-l) steps. Similarly for scenario B.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code will need to compute these values.\n\nBut let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4.\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nSo, l>1, r <6.\n\nSo, compute option1 and option2.\n\nOption1: close left first.\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 step.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nThen move from 2 to4: 2 steps.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nOption2: close right first.\n\nMove from 3 to4: 1 step.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nMove from4 to2: 2 steps (since from 4 to 2 is 2 steps back? Or wait, from 4 to 2 is 2 steps (4→3→2)).\n\nWait, the movement is allowed to move left or right, but within the current a and b. So after closing right, the available tabs are l=2 to r=4.\n\nSo, from 4, moving to 2: the distance is 4-2=2 steps.\n\nSo, option2: 1 (move) +1 (close) +2 (move) +1 (close) = 5.\n\nSo, both options give 5. So minimal is 5.\n\nWhich matches the first sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput:6 3 1 3.\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\nSo, l=1, r=3<6.\n\nSo, has_right is true.\n\nCompute option: move from pos=3 to r=3 (no steps), close right: 1 step.\n\nSo total time is 0 +1 =1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5.\n\nSo l=1, r=5=n.\n\nSo, no need to do anything. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=4.\n\nSo, l>1, r<5.\n\nCompute option1 and option2.\n\nOption1:\n\nmove from 2 to 2: 0 steps.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nmove from 2 to4:2 steps.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nTotal: 0+1+2+1=4.\n\nOption2:\n\nmove from 2 to4:2 steps.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nmove from4 to2:2 steps.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nTotal:2+1+2+1=6.\n\nSo option1 is better, 4 steps.\n\nSo the minimal is 4.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nSo, has_left and has_right.\n\nCompute option1: move from4→3:1 step. Close left:1. Move 3→5:2 steps. Close right:1. Total: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nOption2: move from4→5:1 step. Close right:1. Move from5→3:2 steps. Close left:1. Total:1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSo minimal is 5.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when l=1, but r is not n?\n\nLike n=10, l=1, r=5.\n\nSo, has_right is true.\n\nSo, compute right_only: move from pos to5, close right.\n\nSo, for pos=8: 8→5:3 steps. Close:1. Total 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: pos is exactly at l.\n\nFor example, pos = l.\n\nSo, moving to l is 0 steps. Then close left:1.\n\nIf both have to be closed, then after that, move to r is r-l steps, close right:1.\n\nTotal: 0+1 + (r-l)+1 = r-l+2.\n\nAnother edge case: pos is at r.\n\nSo, moving to r is 0 steps. Close right:1.\n\nThen, move to l: r-l steps. Close left:1.\n\nTotal: r-l +2.\n\nAnother edge case: l=1, r=1.\n\nSo, only l=1, r=1. So, we need to close everything except 1.\n\nSo, has_left? No, since l=1.\n\nHas_right: r=1 <n (assuming n>1).\n\nSo, compute right_only.\n\nTime is steps from pos to 1, then close right.\n\nSo, for example, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=1.\n\nTime: 3→1:2 steps, close right:1. Total 3.\n\nBut wait, after closing right, all tabs to the right of 1 are closed. So, the tabs 2,3,4,5 are closed.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: pos is outside the [l, r] range.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the cursor starts at pos, which is between 1 and n. But after closing some tabs, the available tabs may restrict movement.\n\nBut in the initial state, all tabs are open, so pos can be anywhere.\n\nBut for the initial movement, she can move freely within 1 and n.\n\nSo, for example, if pos is 6, n=6, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5,6).\n\nSo, scenario A: close left then right.\n\nMove from 6 to 2: 4 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nMove from 2 to4:2 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal:4+1+2+1=8.\n\nScenario B: close right then left.\n\nMove from6 to4:2 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nThen move from4 to2:2 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal:2+1+2+1=6.\n\nSo, scenario B is better.\n\nSo, the code correctly computes the minimal.\n\nAnother edge case: pos is at l.\n\nSo, no steps to move to l.\n\nSo, close left:1.\n\nThen, move to r: r-l steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal: (r-l)+2.\n\nSame as scenario A.\n\nSo, seems correct.\n\nThus, the code can be structured as follows.\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute has_left = l>1.\n\nCompute has_right = r <n.\n\nIf has_left and has_right:\n\n   option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n   option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n   minimal = min(option1, option2)\n\nelif has_left:\n\n   minimal = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif has_right:\n\n   minimal = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n   minimal = 0\n\nOutput minimal.\n\nWait, but wait: what about when l=1 and r <n?\n\nIn that case, has_left is false, has_right is true.\n\nSo, minimal is steps to move from pos to r, plus 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, when r=n and l>1: has_left is true, has_right is false.\n\nSo, steps to l, plus 1.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3 2 4 → output 5.\n\nAs discussed, the code computes option1 and option2 as 5 each, so min is 5.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n6 3 1 3 → has_right=true, steps to r=3 is 0, so 0+1=1.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 2 1 5 → has_left=false, has_right=false. So output 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, pos=2, l=3, r=5.\n\nSo, has_left (3>1) and has_right (5<5 is false). So has_right is false.\n\nSo, only has_left.\n\nTime: move from 2 to3 (1 step) + close left (1) → total 2.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the available tabs are 3-5. So, she has to close tabs 1 and 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code correctly returns 2.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=7, pos=5, l=3, r=5.\n\nSo, has_left and has_right.\n\nCompute option1: move from5 to3:2 steps. Close left:1. Move 3→5:2. Close right:1. Total 2+1+2+1=6.\n\nOption2: move to5 (0 steps), close right:1. Move to3:2 steps. Close left:1. Total 0+1+2+1=4.\n\nSo, minimal is 4.\n\nSo code would compute option1 as 2 + (5-3) +2= 2+2+2=6.\n\nOption2 as 0 + (5-3) +2=0+2+2=4.\n\nSo, min(6,4)=4.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nAnother edge case: when l == r.\n\nFor example, n=10, pos=5, l=5, r=5.\n\nSo, has_left (5>1) and has_right (5<10).\n\nSo, compute option1 and option2.\n\nOption1: move to5 (0), close left (1), move to5 again (0), close right (1). Total 0+1+0+1=2.\n\nOption2: move to5 (0), close right (1), move to5 (0), close left (1). Total 0+1+0+1=2.\n\nSo, minimal is 2.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the available tabs are 5-10. So, she can close right from 5 in one step.\n\nWait, but in this case, she only needs to close the left (tabs 1-4) and the right (tabs6-10).\n\nSo, the code correctly computes it.\n\nSo, seems correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=2, r=3, n=5, pos=2.\n\nSo, has_left (2>1) and has_right (3<5).\n\nOption1: move from2 to2 (0), close left (1), move to3 (1 step), close right (1). Total 0+1+1+1=3.\n\nOption2: move from2 to3 (1 step), close right (1), move to2 (1 step), close left (1). Total 1+1+1+1=4.\n\nSo, minimal is 3.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nSo, I think the code logic is solid.\n\nNow, to write the Python code.\n\nThe code needs to read a line of input, split into four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute the has_left and has_right.\n\nThen, based on that, compute the minimal steps.\n\nHandle all cases.\n\nNow, implement that.\n\nTest cases:\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1: 6 3 2 4 → output 5.\n\nSample 2:6 3 1 3 → output 1.\n\nSample3:5 2 1 5 → 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=3, r=5.\n\nhas_left=True, has_right=False.\n\nSo, minimal is 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=5, l=3, r=5.\n\nhas_left and has_right.\n\noption1: 5-3=2, 2+1+2+1=6.\n\noption2: 5-5=0, 0+1+2+1=4.\n\nSo, minimal is4.\n\nThus, code should return 4.\n\nSo, code is as follows.\n\nRead the input.\n\nCompute:\n\nhas_left = (l > 1)\n\nhas_right = (r < n)\n\nif has_left and has_right:\n\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    minimal = min(option1, option2)\n\nelif has_left:\n\n    minimal = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif has_right:\n\n    minimal = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    minimal = 0\n\nprint(minimal)\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where l=1 and r=5, n=5.\n\nSo, has_left is False, has_right is False.\n\nSo, minimal is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nhas_left: 2>1 → True.\n\nhas_right:4<5 → True.\n\noption1: |3-2| =1. r-l=2. So 1+2+2=5.\n\noption2: |3-4|=1. 1+2+2=5.\n\nminimal is5.\n\nSo code returns 5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=10, pos=8, l=3, r=7.\n\nhas_left:3>1 → True.\n\nhas_right:7<10 → True.\n\noption1: |8-3|=5. 7-3=4. 5+4+2=11.\n\noption2: |8-7|=1. 1+4+2=7.\n\nSo, minimal is7.\n\nThus, code returns7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nThus, I'll write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while keeping the tabs within this segment open. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and actions to minimize the time taken.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need to Close Tabs**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` or to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Calculate Movement Time**: Compute the time required to move the cursor from its initial position to the necessary positions (either `l` or `r`) and the time to close the respective tabs.\n3. **Consider Both Sides**: If both sides (left and right) need closing, compute the time for two scenarios: closing the left side first then the right, and vice versa. Choose the scenario with the shorter time.\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where no tabs need closing (when `l=1` and `r=n`), only left tabs need closing, or only right tabs need closing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nhas_left = l > 1\nhas_right = r < n\n\nif has_left and has_right:\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n    minimal = min(option1, option2)\nelif has_left:\n    minimal = abs(pos - l) + 1\nelif has_right:\n    minimal = abs(pos - r) + 1\nelse:\n    minimal = 0\n\nprint(minimal)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Check if there are tabs to the left of `l` (`has_left`) and/or right of `r` (`has_right`).\n2. **Calculate Time for Both Sides**: If both sides need closing, compute the time for both possible orders (closing left first or right first) and choose the minimum.\n3. **Handle Single Side Closing**: If only one side needs closing, compute the time directly based on the distance from the current position to the target position and the action (closing tabs).\n4. **Edge Case Handling**: Directly return 0 if no tabs need closing, as no actions are required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by considering all necessary movements and actions, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
