They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine all the winning integers x for a given tournament setup. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the tournament is a knockout style with 2^n teams. Each game eliminates one team, and the process continues until one champion remains. The way the games are structured is important. In each phase, the teams are paired as (1,2), (3,4), etc., and the winners proceed to the next phase.\n\nThe string s consists of n characters, each being 0 or 1. For each phase i (from 1 to n?), the character s_i determines how the games are won. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the description says that during the i-th phase, which has 2^{n-i} games, the matches are such that in each match, if s_i is 0, the lower-skilled team wins; if 1, the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nWait, but wait: the phases are ordered from first to last. So the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, then the second phase has 2^(n-2) games, and so on until the nth phase has 1 game. So for each phase i (starting from 1 to n), s[i] determines the outcome of that phase's matches.\n\nBut how do these phases affect the possible winners? We need to model the tournament structure and see which positions can end up as the champion based on the given s.\n\nHmm. The key is that the permutation p must be such that the champion's skill is determined by the tournament results based on the s string.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is given, and the question is whether x is a winning integer, meaning there exists some permutation p where x becomes the champion.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the permutation is fixed, but we're to find all x such that x can be the champion for some permutation p that satisfies the given s string. So for a given s, what x's are possible?\n\nSo, the approach is: for each possible x, can we arrange the permutation p in such a way that when the tournament is run according to the rules dictated by s, x ends up as the winner?\n\nSo, the task is to model the tournament structure, considering each phase's outcome based on s, and determine for each x whether it can be the overall winner under some permutation.\n\nThis seems like a problem that could be approached with dynamic programming or memoization, tracking possible candidates at each stage.\n\nLet me think about how the tournament proceeds:\n\nEach phase reduces the number of teams by half. The first phase has 2^(n-1) games, each determining a winner. The second phase has 2^(n-2) games, and so on.\n\nEach phase is determined by the corresponding s[i]. For each game in phase i, the outcome depends on s[i]: whether the lower or higher-skilled team wins.\n\nSo, for each phase, the set of possible participants is split into pairs, and each pair produces a winner based on s[i].\n\nThe challenge is to model the possible winners through each phase, ensuring that the chosen permutation allows x to emerge as the final winner.\n\nI think the way to model this is to represent the possible sets of teams that can reach each phase and track their possible winners.\n\nWait, perhaps using a bitmask approach. Since n can be up to 18, 2^18 is 262144, which is manageable for some operations, but maybe not all. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, for each phase, we can model the possible winners and their necessary properties.\n\nWait, another idea: the tournament can be viewed as a series of binary trees. Each game is a node in a binary tree, and the leaves are the initial matches. The root is the final game determining the champion.\n\nEach internal node represents a game whose outcome depends on s and the structure of the tournament.\n\nBut how does the permutation p interact with this structure? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each round (phase) imposes certain constraints on the relative strengths of the teams that can make it through to the next round.\n\nFor example, in the first phase, each pair plays, and depending on s[0], the winner is either the higher or lower skilled.\n\nIf s[0] is 1, then in each pair, the higher-skilled team wins. So the winner of each pair is the maximum of the two.\n\nIf s[0] is 0, then the lower-skilled team wins. So the winner is the minimum of the two.\n\nSo, after phase 1, the set of possible winners is a subset of the original teams, determined by applying the s[0] rule to each pair.\n\nThen, in phase 2, these winners are paired again, and the same rule applies based on s[1], and so on.\n\nThe problem is to model this selection process for each phase, keeping track of which",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the winning integers for a given tournament setup. The tournament is structured as a knockout style with 2^n teams, and each phase of the tournament has a specific rule that determines the winner of each match based on a given string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of phases where each phase halves the number of teams until only one champion remains. Each phase's outcome is determined by the corresponding character in the string `s`.\n\n2. **Phase Analysis**: For each phase, teams are paired, and the winner of each pair proceeds to the next phase. The rule for determining the winner of each pair is based on the current phase's character:\n   - If `s[i]` is '0', the lower-skilled team wins.\n   - If `s[i]` is '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use a bitmask to represent the set of possible winners at each phase. For each phase, we track which teams can win based on the current rules and the remaining teams from the previous phase.\n\n4. **Recursive Check**: For each possible starting team, we recursively check if it can be the champion by simulating the tournament according to the given rules and the current set of possible winners.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # We need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n    # So, for each x, we need to check if it's possible to arrange the permutation such that x wins.\n    # Let's precompute all possible candidates.\n    \n    # To do this, we'll model the tournament step by step, keeping track of possible winners.\n    # We can represent the possible winners as a list of candidate indices.\n    \n    # Initialize the possible winners after each phase.\n    dp = [set() for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0] = list(range(1 << n))  # Initially, all teams are possible winners\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_round = i + 1\n        next_round = i + 2\n        phase_size = 1 << (n - i)\n        if phase_size == 1:\n            break\n        new_winners = []\n        for group in range(phase_size // 2):\n            # Pair the current possible winners into groups of two\n            for a in dp[i]:\n                for b in dp[i]:\n                    if a != b:\n                        if s[i] == '0':\n                            winner = min(a, b) if a != b else a\n                        else:\n                            winner = max(a, b) if a != b else a\n                        new_winners.append(winner)\n        dp[i+1] = new_winners\n        # Ensure we have unique winners\n        dp[i+1] = list(set(dp[i+1]))\n        if not dp[i+1]:\n            break\n    \n    # Now, after all phases, the possible winners are in dp[n]\n    # But wait, the initial approach might not capture all possibilities correctly.\n    # Alternatively, perhaps we should model it differently.\n    \n    # Another approach: for each possible starting point, simulate the tournament.\n    # But this would be too slow for n=18.\n    \n    # Since the above method might not be correct, let's think differently.\n    \n    # Let's model the tournament as a binary tree, and for each node, determine the possible winner based on the path taken.\n    \n    # Another idea: for each position x, check if it can be the champion by ensuring that in each phase, x can win against its necessary opponents.\n    \n    # This seems more manageable.\n    \n    # We can represent the required constraints for x to be the champion.\n    # For each phase, we need to ensure that in the grouping of 2^i teams, x can win against the required opponents.\n    \n    # Let's try to model this step by step.\n    \n    # Let's represent the tournament as a series of rounds, each halving the number of teams.\n    \n    # We'll process each round from the first to the last.\n    # For each round, we'll determine the necessary conditions for x to progress.\n    \n    # The key is that in each round, x must be able to win against certain other teams, depending on the phase's rule and the groupings.\n    \n    # Let's try to model this with a recursive function.\n    \n    # We can memoize the possible winners at each round.\n    \n    # But for n=18, this might be computationally intensive.
