    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible substring, I need to check if it occurs more than once, and find the maximum length among those.\n\nBut wait, how do I approach this efficiently? Because the string can be up to 100 characters long, maybe a brute-force approach is manageable here.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible substring lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1. That way, as soon as I find a length where there's a repeated substring, I can return it as the answer.\n\n2. For each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible), generate all possible substrings of length L.\n\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears more than once in the string.\n\n4. If yes, return L as the answer. Since we're checking from largest to smallest, the first such L is the maximum possible.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nFirst, determine the maximum possible substring length. It's the length of the string minus 1. For example, a string of length n has substrings of length 1, 2, ..., n-1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the maximum possible substring is of length n-1, because any longer would be the entire string, which can't appear again.\n\nSo, for example, if the string is 'abcde', the maximum possible substring is 'abcd' or 'bcde', etc., but they can't appear more than once unless the string is periodic.\n\nWait, but the problem allows overlapping occurrences. So, for example, in 'aaaaa', the substring 'aaa' appears multiple times.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop L from len(s) - 1 down to 1.\n\nFor each L, collect all substrings of length L.\n\nCheck if any of these substrings appears at least twice.\n\nIf yes, return L.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to L-1.\n\nNow, the key part is: for a given L, how to efficiently check if any substring of length L appears more than once.\n\nHow can I do that?\n\nOne straightforward way is to store all substrings of length L in a set. As I extract each substring, I check if it's already in the set. If it is, then return True for this L. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nWait, but wait: for a substring to appear at least twice, it needs to be present in two different positions. So, for each substring s_i of length L starting at i, I can check if it appears again at some j > i, j <= len(s) - L.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, I can create a dictionary mapping each substring to a list of starting indices. Then, if any substring has a list with at least two elements, then that L is valid.\n\nBut creating a dictionary for each L could be a bit time-consuming, but given the constraints (string up to 100), it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, I can iterate through all possible substrings, and for each substring, check if it occurs again later in the string.\n\nSo, for a given L, for each i from 0 to len(s) - L, extract the substring s[i:i+L], and check if this substring appears again at any j >= i+1, j <= len(s)-L.\n\nWait, but that's O(n^3), which for n=100 is 1e6 operations—manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, I can build a set, and for each substring, see if it exists in the set before adding it. If I find a duplicate, return true.\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   create an empty set.\n\n   for i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substring is in the set:\n\n           return L\n\n       else:\n\n           add substring to the set\n\nSo, for each L, we process all possible substrings. As soon as a duplicate is found, we return L.\n\nIf no duplicates are found for this L, proceed to L-1.\n\nThis approach should work.\n\nLet's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd'\n\nLength is 4.\n\nCheck L=3:\n\nSubstrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates.\n\nThen L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'—all unique.\n\nL=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'—all unique.\n\nSo output is 0? Wait, no. Wait the sample input shows ['abcd",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking each possible substring length starting from the largest possible down to 1. For each length, we generate all possible substrings and check if any of them appear more than once. This ensures that we find the longest valid substring efficiently.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Substring Lengths**: Start from the largest possible substring length (which is the length of the string minus 1) and go down to 1.\n2. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: Use a set to keep track of the substrings. If a substring is found in the set, it means it has appeared before, so we return the current length as the result.\n4. **Early Termination**: As soon as a duplicate substring is found for a given length, we can terminate early and return that length as the result.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring without unnecessary computations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the largest possible substring length down to 1.\n3. **Set for Tracking Substrings**: For each length, we use a set to track the substrings we have seen.\n4. **Check Each Substring**: For each starting index, we generate the substring of the current length and check if it has been seen before.\n5. **Return Result**: If a duplicate substring is found, we immediately print the length and exit. If no duplicates are found for any length, we print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick look-up and insertion, making the solution both effective and efficient.",
