He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, which must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C added them. The count can be equal to both, but that's also allowed.\n\nThe string I'm given must satisfy these conditions. So, I need to verify:\n\n1. The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order is strictly a's first, then b's, then c's.\n\n2. The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\n3. Also, the string must have at least one of each character, because after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nSo, the steps to check are:\n\nFirst, check the structure of the string. It should have a's, then b's, then c's without any mixing.\n\nHow to do that? Well, we can scan the string and make sure that once a character changes from 'a' to 'b', it can't go back to 'a' again. Similarly, once it changes to 'c', it can't go back to anything else.\n\nSo, for example, the string 'aaabccc' is okay. But 'aabc' would not be, because after the 'a's, it goes to 'b's, then 'c's, but wait, no, 'aabc' is 'a','a','b','c'â€”that's correct. Wait no, let me see: the third example in the sample input is 'aabc', which is allowed because it's a's followed by b's, then c's. Wait, but the sample input says the third example is 'aabc' and the output is YES. Oh right, because the count of c's (which is 1) equals the count of b's (also 1).\n\nWait, so perhaps the structure is that the string starts with one or more a's, followed by one or more b's, followed by one or more c's. So, the string can't have any other characters in between.\n\nSo, the first thing to do is to split the string into these three parts. So, we can find the positions where the characters change from 'a' to 'b', then 'b' to 'c'. There should be exactly two transitions: a->b and b->c. And all the a's come first, then b's, then c's.\n\nIf the string doesn't follow this structure, we can immediately return NO.\n\nOnce we confirm the structure, we need to count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n\nThen, check if the count of c's is equal to the count of a's or the count of b's.\n\nAlso, since after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the counts of a and b in the final string (after B appends) must be >=1. But after C appends, the counts of a and b remain the same, as C only adds c's. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and at least one c (since C appends some).\n\nSo, overall steps:\n\n1. Check that the string is non-empty and consists of only a, b, c.\n\n2. Split the string into a's, then b's, then c's. So, the string must have a transition from a to b, then from b to c, and no other transitions.\n\n   How to do this:\n   - Find the index where the first non-a character occurs. If it's not a 'b', invalid.\n   - Then, find the index where the next non-b character occurs. If it's not a 'c', invalid.\n   - Also, ensure that after the last c, there are no more characters.\n\n   Alternatively, iterate through the string and track the current allowed characters.\n\n3. Once the structure is correct, count the number of a's (count_a), b's (count_b), and c's (count_c).\n\n4. Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\n5. Also, ensure that count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 (since after B appends, they exist).\n\nWait, because after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. So the initial string given to C must have count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific process involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order with certain constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's and then 'c's without any mixing. This means there should be exactly two transitions: from 'a' to 'b' and from 'b' to 'c'.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the structure, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's. Additionally, ensure there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is non-empty\nif not s:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check the order of characters\nprev_char = None\nfor c in s:\n    if prev_char is None:\n        prev_char = c\n    else:\n        if c != prev_char:\n            # Check if it's a valid transition\n            if (prev_char == 'a' and c != 'b') or (prev_char == 'b' and c != 'c'):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n    prev_char = c\n\n# Now check if all 'c's are at the end\nif any(c != 'c' for c in s):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now, count the a's, b's, and c's\ncount_a = 0\ncount_b = 0\ncount_c = 0\nfor c in s:\n    if c == 'a':\n        count_a += 1\n    elif c == 'b':\n        count_b += 1\n    else:\n        count_c += 1\n\n# Check if counts are valid\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif count_c != count_a and count_c != count_b:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **String Structure Check**: The code first ensures that the string transitions from 'a' to 'b' and then from 'b' to 'c'. Any other transitions result in an immediate \"NO\".\n2. **Character Counting**: It then counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n3. **Validation**: Finally, it checks if the count of 'c' matches either the count of 'a' or 'b' and ensures there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions specified in the problem, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
