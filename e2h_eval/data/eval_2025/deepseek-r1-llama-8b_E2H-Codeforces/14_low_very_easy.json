He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I need to output how many such numbers there are and the list of those numbers in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n, because there are always enough 2s to pair with the 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division result is zero.\n\nSo the task is to find all n where this sum equals m. But how do I find the possible n's?\n\nWait, for a given m, the count of n's can be either 0, 1, or multiple. For example, in the sample input, m=5, the output is 5,6,7,8,9—so five numbers. That makes sense because 5! is 120, which has one zero, but wait no, wait the sample says the first input is '1' and '5', and the output is 5 followed by the numbers 5 through 9. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the examples.\n\nWait the sample input shows two test cases? Or is it that the input is a list containing '1' and '5'? Oh, right, the problem statement says the input is an integer m, so perhaps the sample is just showing two different inputs, but in the note, the first sample is m=5, giving output 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, the note says in the first sample, 5! is 120 (one zero?), but the sample output lists 5 as the starting point. Wait, let me think: 5! = 120 → one zero. 6! is 720 → one zero. Wait, no, 5! is 120 → one zero. Wait, 5! has 1 zero, 10! has 2, etc. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, the sample input is ['1', '5'], and the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']. So when m=1, the output is 5, which probably refers to 5 being the only number with exactly 1 trailing zero? No, because 5! has one zero, 6! has one, 7! has one, 8! has one, 9! has one. Oh right, because 10! will have two zeros. So for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Hence the output is 5 numbers, printed as 5 6 7 8 9. But then why does the second part of the sample output say '0'? Oh, perhaps it's for m=0, but the constraints say m is at least 1. Hmm, maybe that's a typo in the sample description.\n\nBut regardless, the main issue is to find all n where the number of trailing zeros in n! is equal to m. Now, how do I compute these n's efficiently?\n\nI think the approach is to find the minimal n where the trailing zeros are exactly m, and then see if there are consecutive n's that also give the same m. Because the function of trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases. So once you find the smallest n where the count is m, you can check how far you can go before the count increases beyond m.\n\nWait, but sometimes there might be multiple n's that have the same count. For example, when moving from 24 to 25: 24! has 4+0=4 zeros (since 24//5=4, 24//25=0), 25! adds another 5, so 25//5=5, 25//25=1, total 6. Wait, wait, no: 24//5 is 4, 24//25 is 0 → 4 zeros. 25//5 is 5, 25//25 is 1 → 6 zeros. So 24 and 25 don't have the same count. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong.\n\nWait, let me take another example. Let's say m=5.\n\nCompute the number of trailing zeros for n=5: 5/5=1, 25 is larger than 5 → total 1.\n\nn=6: same, 6/5=1, 6/25=0 → 1.\n\nn=7: same.\n\nn=8: same.\n\nn=9: same.\n\nn=10: 10/5=2, 10/25=0 → total 2.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the count of factors of 10 in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Finding the Range of \\( n \\)**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = m \\). Once this smallest \\( n \\) is found, we check consecutive values of \\( n \\) to see how many of them yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros before the count increases beyond \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: We use a binary search approach to efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) where the trailing zeros equal \\( m \\). After finding this \\( n \\), we then check the next few values to determine the complete range of \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(m):\n    def trailing_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        power = 5\n        while n >= power:\n            count += n // power\n            power *= 5\n        return count\n\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m  # Initial upper bound, adjusted if necessary\n\n    # Binary search to find the minimal n with trailing_zeros(n) == m\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        tz = trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if tz < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n\n    # Now, left is the minimal n with tz == m\n    # Check if left actually gives m zeros\n    if trailing_zeros(left) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # Find the maximum n where tz remains m\n    max_n = left\n    current = left\n    while True:\n        next_n = current * 5\n        tz_next = trailing_zeros(next_n)\n        if tz_next > m:\n            break\n        max_n = next_n\n        current = next_n\n\n    # Now, collect all numbers from left to max_n inclusive\n    result = list(range(left, max_n + 1))\n    return result\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\nm = int(input_line)\n\n# Get the list of n's\nn_list = count_trailing_zeros(m)\n\n# Output the result\nif not n_list:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print(len(n_list))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, n_list)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string and converted to an integer \\( m \\).\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: The helper function `trailing_zeros` calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) using the formula mentioned.\n3. **Binary Search**: We perform a binary search to efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros equals \\( m \\).\n4. **Range Expansion**: After finding the smallest \\( n \\), we expand the range to include all consecutive values of \\( n \\) that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n5. **Output**: The results are formatted and printed, showing the count of such \\( n \\) values and the values themselves.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find all valid \\( n \\) values without unnecessary computations, making it suitable for large values of \\( m \\) up to 100,000.",
