Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The definition they give is specific. So, Valera's paper is a square with n x n letters, where n is odd. The letters form an 'X' if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, for each test case, I need to process the grid.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n2. Read the next n lines as the grid. Each line is a string of length n.\n3. For the grid, extract the two main diagonals.\n4. Check if all the diagonal elements are the same character.\n5. Then, check that all non-diagonal elements are the same character, and this character is different from the diagonal one.\n\nWait, but wait: the non-diagonal elements must be the same and not equal to the diagonal ones.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- Extract the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right). For a 0-based index, it's grid[i][i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n- Extract the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). It's grid[i][n-1-i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n- Check if all elements in both diagonals are the same. Let's call this char 'd_char'.\n   - If they are not all the same, then it's not an 'X'.\n- Then, check all the other cells (those not on either diagonal). They must all be the same character, let's call it 'o_char', and 'o_char' must not be equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut wait, what if the diagonals have different characters? Like some are 'x' and others are 'y'? Then condition 1 fails, so the answer is NO.\n\nSo first, collect the diagonals:\n\nLet me think about how to get them.\n\nFor a grid stored as a list of strings, each string is a row.\n\nMain diagonal: for row i, column i. So for each i, take grid[i][i].\n\nAnti-diagonal: for row i, column (n-1 -i). So grid[i][n-1 -i].\n\nOnce I have these two lists, I can check their contents.\n\nSo, for the diagonals:\n\ndiag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\ndiag2 = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)]\n\nThen, check if all elements in diag1 are the same. Similarly for diag2.\n\nIf diag1 and diag2 are both the same character, proceed. Else, output NO.\n\nWait, no. Because for the X shape, both diagonals must consist of the same character. So the first condition is that every element in diag1 is the same as every other in diag1, and same for diag2. But also, the two diagonals' characters must be the same. Because the X's diagonals are both the same.\n\nWait, no. Wait the X has two diagonals that cross each other. The problem statement says, \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same.\" So both diagonals must be the same character.\n\nSo, for example, if diag1 is 'x' and diag2 is 'x', that's okay. If diag1 is 'x' and diag2 is 'y', that's not allowed.\n\nSo first, after extracting diag1 and diag2, check that all elements in diag1 are same as each other, all in diag2 are same as each other, and diag1[0] == diag2[0].\n\nIf any of these conditions fail, output NO.\n\nOnce that's satisfied, we need to check the rest of the grid.\n\nThe rest of the grid is all cells that are not on either diagonal. For each such cell, they must be same as each other, and different from d_char.\n\nHow to find all the non-diagonal cells?\n\nLoop through each row i, each column j. If (i == j) or (i + j == n-1), skip. Else, add to the list.\n\nCollect all these characters, check if they are all the same, and not equal to d_char.\n\nIf all conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nRead the grid.\n\nCompute the two diagonals.\n\nCheck if both diagonals are made up of the same character.\n\nThen check the rest.\n\nNow, considering the code structure.\n\nIn Python, reading the input can be a bit tricky because sometimes the input is given as a single",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the shape of an 'X'. The grid must meet specific conditions for this to be true.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the integer `n` and the subsequent `n` lines representing the grid.\n2. **Extract Diagonals**: Identify the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n3. **Check Diagonal Uniformity**: Ensure both diagonals consist of the same character.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Uniformity**: Ensure all non-diagonal cells contain the same character, which must be different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Extract main and anti diagonals\ndiag1 = []\ndiag2 = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    diag1.append(grid[i][i])\n    diag2.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\n# Check if all elements in both diagonals are the same and equal across both\nd_char = None\nif len(diag1) == 0:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d1_ok = all(c == diag1[0] for c in diag1)\n    d2_ok = all(c == diag2[0] for c in diag2)\n    if not (d1_ok and d2_ok):\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if diag1[0] != diag2[0]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            d_char = diag1[0]\n            # Now check all non-diagonal elements\n            o_char = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                        continue\n                    current = grid[i][j]\n                    if o_char is None:\n                        o_char = current\n                    elif current != o_char:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit()\n            # Also ensure that o_char is different from d_char\n            if o_char == d_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid dimensions and content are read from standard input.\n2. **Diagonals Extraction**: The main and anti-diagonals are extracted by iterating through the grid.\n3. **Diagonal Check**: Both diagonals must be checked to ensure they consist of the same character.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Check**: All non-diagonal cells must be checked to ensure they contain the same character, which must be different from the diagonal character.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each condition step-by-step, ensuring correctness and handling edge cases where the grid might not form an 'X'.",
