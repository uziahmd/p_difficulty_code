Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options, any will do.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to understand what kind of angles can be formed in a regular polygon. Since it's regular, all central angles are equal. The measure of each central angle is 360/n degrees. But when considering the internal angles formed by three vertices, especially in a convex polygon, the angles can vary based on how many steps apart the vertices are.\n\nWait, let me think. For a regular polygon, the internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But that's the angle at each vertex of the polygon. However, when we choose three vertices, the angle formed can be different depending on the positions.\n\nI remember that in a regular polygon, the angle between two chords (like from v1 to v2 and v3 to v2) depends on the number of sides between v1 and v3 around v2.\n\nFor example, in a square (n=4), if I pick three consecutive vertices, the angle could be 90 degrees. If they are spaced differently, like v1, v2, v3 where v1 is two steps away from v3, maybe the angle is smaller.\n\nSo, perhaps the possible angles are determined by the number of edges between the chosen points. Let's say for a given v2, the number of steps to v1 and v3 determines the angle.\n\nWait, another approach: For a regular polygon, the possible angles formed by three vertices can be calculated based on the arcs they form. The angle at v2 will be half the difference between the two arcs created by v1 and v3 with respect to v2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the central angles.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So, the arc length from v1 to v2 is k*(360/n), where k is the number of steps between them. Similarly for v2 to v3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the central angle is 360/n degrees. So, the arc length between two vertices can be represented as multiples of that.\n\nWhen choosing three points, the angle at v2 is determined by the arcs from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2. Because in circle geometry, the inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n\nWait, right! So, if we have points A, B, C on a circle, then angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't contain B.\n\nSo, in our case, for the regular polygon which is inscribed in a circle, the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, not passing through v2.\n\nSo, the key is to find v1, v2, v3 such that the arc between v1 and v3 is as close as possible to 2*a degrees. Because angle at v2 is half of that.\n\nBut wait, since the polygon is regular and convex, the arc can only consist of certain numbers of steps. Each step is 360/n degrees.\n\nSo, for each possible pair of points (v1, v3), the arc between them can be represented as k*(360/n), where k is the minimal number of steps between them. Then, the angle at v2 is (k * 360/n ) / 2.\n\nWait, but k can be up to n-1 steps. But since the polygon is regular, the minimal arc is the smallest number of steps between the two points, so k ranges from 1 to floor(n/2).\n\nWait, no. Because for any two points, the arc can be measured in two directions, clockwise and counter-clockwise. But the minimal one is the one with fewer steps. So, for any two points, the minimal arc is min(k, n - k) steps, each step being 360/n degrees.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is (min(k, n -k) * 180 /n ), because each step is 360/n degrees, so the arc is (min(k, n-k) * 360/n) degrees. Half of that is the inscribed angle.\n\nWait, but the inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So yes, angle = (arc measure)/2.\n\nSo, for a regular polygon, the possible angles at v2 can be various values, each corresponding to a certain number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon.\n\nTherefore,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and calculating the possible angles efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular polygon, each vertex lies on a circle. The angle at any vertex formed by three points (v1, v2, v3) can be determined using the arcs between these points. The angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3.\n2. **Central Angle Calculation**: Each central angle in a regular n-gon is 360/n degrees. The arc between two vertices can be expressed as a multiple of this central angle.\n3. **Possible Angles**: For each vertex v2, consider all possible pairs of other vertices (v1, v3). Calculate the angle at v2 for each pair and keep track of the closest angle to 'a'.\n4. **Efficient Search**: Since the polygon is regular, the minimal arc between any two vertices can be found by checking up to n/2 steps. This reduces the number of pairs to check significantly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v2 = -1\nbest_v1 = -1\nbest_v3 = -1\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n + 1):\n    for k in range(1, n // 2 + 1):\n        arc = k * 360 // n\n        angle = arc // 2\n        current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if current_diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = current_diff\n            best_v2 = v2\n            # Find v1 and v3\n            step = (v2 - 1) % n\n            v1 = (step - k) % n + 1\n            v3 = (step + k) % n + 1\n            if v1 == v2 or v3 == v2:\n                continue  # Ensure they are distinct\n            if v1 > v3:\n                v1, v3 = v3, v1\n            best_v1 = v1\n            best_v3 = v3\n\nprint(f\"{best_v1} {best_v2} {best_v3}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n- **Loop Through Each Vertex**: For each vertex v2, consider it as the vertex where the angle will be formed.\n- **Check All Possible Pairs**: For each v2, check all possible pairs (v1, v3) by considering steps from 1 to n//2 around the polygon.\n- **Calculate Angle**: Compute the angle at v2 for each pair and determine how close it is to 'a'.\n- **Track Best Solution**: Keep track of the closest angle found and update the best vertices v1, v2, and v3 accordingly.\n- **Output Result**: Print the vertices forming the closest angle to 'a'.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal vertices by leveraging the geometric properties of regular polygons and minimizing the number of checks needed.",
