After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best in that particular subject. Being the best means no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, the input is n students and m subjects. Each student's marks are given as a string of m characters. For each subject, we need to find which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in any subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to process each subject across all students. For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark. Then, for each student, determine if in any subject j, their mark equals the maximum of that subject.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Read the input: n and m, followed by n strings each of length m.\n2. For each subject j:\n   a. Collect all the marks from each student in that subject.\n   b. Find the maximum mark among them.\n3. For each student, check if in any subject j, their mark is equal to the max for j.\n4. Count how many students satisfy this condition.\n\nWait, but for each subject, we can record the maximum value. Then, for each student, compare each of their marks against these maxima. If any match, the student is successful.\n\nThat sounds manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about data structures. Maybe a list of lists, where each sublist represents the marks of a student, and another list or dictionary storing the max for each subject.\n\nFor example:\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor each subject j:\n    for each student i:\n        if student[i][j] > current_max:\n            current_max = student[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = current_max\n\nThen, for each student i, check if any of their j marks is equal to max_marks[j]. If yes, count them.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the input. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow, each being a string of m digits. So for each student, their marks are stored as a string, like \"223\" for 3 subjects.\n\nI'll need to convert each string into a list or just keep it as a string, accessing individual characters.\n\nIn Python, each character is accessed via index, so perhaps each student's marks can be stored as a string, and for each subject j, we take the j-th character.\n\nSo, for processing:\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    students.append(s)\n\nThen, for each subject j in 0..m-1:\n    max_mark = -infinity\n    for each student in students:\n        current_mark = int(student[j])\n        if current_mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = current_mark\n    max_marks[j] = max_mark\n\nOnce we have max_marks for all subjects, then for each student, check if any of their j marks is equal to max_marks[j].\n\nSo, count = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == str(max_marks[j]):\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nReturn count.\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, when checking, should we compare as integers or as strings? Because the max_marks are integers, and the student's marks are strings. So, for example, if the max is 5, and the student has '5', that's fine. But if the max is 10, but the student has 'A' (but in our case, it's only 1-9, so no such cases).\n\nSo in the code, after computing max_marks as integers, each student's marks are a string. So for j in 0..m-1:\n\nif int(student[j]) == max_marks[j], then yes.\n\nAlternatively, since max_marks is built as the maximum of all student[j] converted to integers, perhaps it's better to precompute for each student their marks as a list of integers.\n\nYes, that might be more efficient.\n\nSo, let's adjust the plan:\n\nRead each student's string and convert it into a list of integers, e.g., '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nSo, students = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nThen, compute max_marks:\n\nmax_marks = [0]*m\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = -1  # since marks are 1-9, -1 is lower than any possible\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > current_max:\n            current_max = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = current_max\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in any j equals max_marks[j].\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nPrint count.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nSo, n=3, m=3.\n\nStudents' marks:\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nCompute max for each subject:\n\nSubject 0: max(2,2,1) is 2\nSubject 1: max(2,3,1) is 3\nSubject 2: max(3,2,2) is 3\n\nSo max_marks = [2,3,3].\n\nCheck each student:\n\nStudent 0:\nj=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count increases.\n\nStudent 1:\nj=0: 2 < 2? No. j=1: 3 ==3 → yes.\n\nStudent 2:\nj=0:1 <2, j=1:1<3, j=2:2 <3 → none. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n3 5\n91728\n11828\n11111\n\nSo, n=3, m=5.\n\nStudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\nStudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\nStudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nCompute max_marks:\n\nSubject 0: max(9,1,1) →9\nSubject1: max(1,1,1) →1\nSubject2: max(7,8,1) →8\nSubject3: max(2,2,1) →2\nSubject4: max(8,8,1) →8\n\nmax_marks = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nCheck each student:\n\nStudent0: \nj=0:9 ==9 → yes.\n\nStudent1:\nj=0:1 <9. j=1:1 ==1 → yes.\n\nStudent2: none, since all his marks are 1 except subject0 which is 1<9.\n\nSo total count is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all students are same. Like n=2, m=1, both have 5.\n\nmax_mark is5.\n\nEach student has 5 in subject 0, so both are successful.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Student has 5. So count is 1.\n\nWhat if a student has all marks lower than others in every subject? Like, n=2, m=2.\n\nStudent0: 1 1\n\nStudent1: 2 2\n\nmax_marks: [2,2]\n\nStudent0: no subjects where he is the best. Student1: both are max → counted once.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for student1, in both subjects, he is the best. So he is counted once, but the code counts him as having at least one subject.\n\nWait, in code, for each student, if any j satisfies, count +=1.\n\nSo in this case, student1 will be counted once.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0? Wait, according to constraints, m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo, code-wise, in Python:\n\nWe need to read n and m from the first line. Then read n lines, each as a string.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single string, like ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', ...], but perhaps in practice, the input comes as separate lines. So, in the code, perhaps read all lines at once.\n\nWait, the way the input is presented in the problem statement is a bit unclear. Let me recheck.\n\nProblem says: The first line contains two integers n and m. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook.\n\nSo, the first line is a single line, then n lines follow.\n\nIn the sample input, it's shown as two strings, but perhaps that's for illustrative purposes. In reality, the first line is '3 3', then three lines of 3 characters each.\n\nSo, in the code, we can read the first line as n and m, then read next n lines, each line being a string of m characters.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    # Ensure that len(s) == m?\n    # Probably, but in competition problems, inputs are correct.\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nThen compute the max_marks.\n\nThen count.\n\nYes.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWhat if the student's string has leading or trailing spaces? But the problem says each line contains m characters, so probably not.\n\nWhat about when m is 0? But the constraints say m >=1.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother consideration: efficiency. Since n and m are up to 100, the approach is O(n*m) which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should look something like this:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n students, each as a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_marks per subject.\n\nFor each student, check if any of their marks is equal to the corresponding max_marks[j].\n\nCount and print.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nstudents = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    s = input().strip()\n\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n\n    students.append(marks)\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    current_max = -1\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if students[i][j] > current_max:\n\n            current_max = students[i][j]\n\n    max_marks[j] = current_max\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the expected output is a list of two strings, '2' and '3'. But the problem says to print a single number. Oh wait, no, the problem says to print the desired outputs, but looking back, the sample input is a single test case, and the output is two numbers. Wait, no, wait the sample input is a list of two test cases, but the actual input would be two separate test cases. Or maybe the problem is that the sample shows two test cases, but the problem expects to process all students in one go.\n\nWait, the problem says: 'Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.' So for each test case, output one number.\n\nIn the sample, the input has two test cases, and the output is two lines, each with a number.\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is written as:\n\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nBut that's probably an example showing two test cases. So the program should process each test case as a separate run.\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, the sample input shows two test cases, but the output is two numbers, each in a list. But in the problem description, the input is a single group of students, so the code must process all n students at once.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is incorrect, but in the actual problem, the input will consist of a single test case.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the problem statement again: the input is first line with n and m, then n lines. So the code must process all n students in a single run.\n\nBut in the sample, the input is given as two test cases, but the output is two numbers, each in a list.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is wrong. Or perhaps the problem expects to process all students in the input as a single group.\n\nBecause in the problem statement, the input is described as follows: the first line contains n and m, then n lines each describing a student.\n\nSo, the code must process all n students in a single run.\n\nBut the sample shows two test cases, each with their own output. So perhaps the initial problem was mistyped.\n\nBut regardless, the code as written will process the entire group correctly.\n\nThus, the code should be fine.\n\nTesting the code with the sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nProcessing as:\n\nstudents[0] = [2,2,3]\n\nstudents[1] = [2,3,2]\n\nstudents[2] = [1,1,2]\n\nmax_marks: [2,3,3]\n\nCheck each student:\n\nstudent0: 2 in subject0, so yes.\n\nstudent1: 3 in subject1, yes.\n\nstudent2: no.\n\nSo count is 2. Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nstudents[0] = [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudents[1] = [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudents[2] = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks: [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nCheck each student:\n\nstudent0: 9 in subject0 → yes.\n\nstudent1: 1 in subject1 → yes.\n\nstudent2: nothing. So count is 3.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1, input is '5'.\n\nmax_marks = [5]. So student is counted.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudent1: 11\n\nStudent2: 22\n\nmax_marks: [2,2]\n\nOnly student2 is counted.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects.

If they do, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > current_max:\n            current_max = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = current_max\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The first line of input contains `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line represents a student's marks across all subjects.\n2. **Storing Marks:** Each student's marks are converted into a list of integers for easier comparison.\n3. **Computing Max Marks:** For each subject, iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This helps identify the top performer in each subject.\n4. **Counting Success:** For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, increment the count of successful students.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the number of successful students by leveraging nested loops and simple comparisons, making it both clear and efficient.",
