Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. So, the minimal number of cards depends on how much the current sum is away from zero and the maximum possible contribution per card.\n\nLet me think: the sum of the found cards is S. We need to find K cards such that the sum of these K cards is equal to -S. But each of these K cards can be at most x in absolute value. So, what's the minimal K?\n\nSo, the key here is to find the minimal K where K * x >= |S|.\n\nBecause each card can add up to x towards the required sum. So, for example, if S is 5, and x is 3, then each card can contribute up to 3. So, we need at least 2 cards because 1*3=3 <5, 2*3=6>=5.\n\nBut wait, what if the required sum is negative? Like S is -7, x is 3. Then we need 3 cards, since 3*3=9 >=7. Because the sum needed is 7, and each card can contribute up to 3.\n\nSo, the formula is K = ceiling( |S| / x ). Because that's the minimal number of steps needed to reach or exceed the required sum.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the sum can be achieved with K cards, each contributing as much as possible towards the sum. For example, if S is 4, x is 3, then one card of 3 and one of 1 would give sum 4. But since we can choose any numbers, the minimal K is 2 because 3 +1 =4, but also, 2*3=6 >=4. So, K is 2.\n\nBut what if S is 0? Then no cards are needed, right? Or maybe the sum is zero, so no need to add anything.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the sum S of the given cards.\n2. If S is zero, output 0.\n3. Else, compute the absolute value of S.\n4. Compute the minimal K such that K * x >= |S|.\n   - So K is the ceiling of (|S| / x).\n5. Return K.\n\nWait, but let me test with examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\nSum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So |S|=2. x=2. So K=1, because 2/2=1. So the output is 1.\n\nSample Output 1: 1.\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 3\n-2 -2\nSum is -4. |S|=4. x=3. So 4/3 is 1.333..., so ceiling is 2. So output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: suppose S is 5, x is 3. Then K is 2, because 3+2=5 is possible with two cards (3 and 2).\n\nAnother case: S is 3, x is 3. K is 1.\n\nWhat if S is 6, x is 3. Then K is 2, because 3+3=6.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about S is 0? Then K is 0.\n\nWhat about when S is positive but not a multiple of x? Like S=7, x=3. So 7/3 is ~2.333, so K is 3.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nWe need to read n and x from input, then the list of n integers.\n\nCompute sum S.\n\nIf S is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the absolute value of S, call it target.\n\nCompute K as (target + x -1 ) // x. Because integer division in Python can be used here.\n\nFor example, 7 /3 is 2.333, so (7+3-1)//3 = (9)//3=3.\n\nSimilarly, 4/2=2, (4+2-1)//2=5//2=2.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of integers.\n\nsum_s = sum(list)\n\nif sum_s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    target = abs(sum_s)\n    k = (target + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait. What if the sum is non-zero, but x is zero? Oh, but the constraints say x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nTesting the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, x=2.\n\nList: [-1,1,2]. Sum is 2.\n\nabs(S)=2. K=(2+2-1)//2=3//2=1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3.\n\nList: [-2,-2]. Sum is -4.\n\nabs(S)=4. (4+3-1)//3=6//3=2.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test: sum is 5, x=3 → 5/3=1.666 → ceil is 2.\n\nSo code should handle all cases.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead lines from stdin.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines: first line is n and x, second line is the list.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards.\n\nSo, the code should read two lines: the first line is split into n and x, the second line is the list.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead the first line as n, x.\n\nRead the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCalculate sum_s = sum of that list.\n\nProceed as before.\n\nImplementing that.\n\nBut in Python, reading from stdin may have issues with leading/trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_s = sum(cards)\n\nif sum_s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    target = abs(sum_s)\n    k = (target + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nThat's it.\n\nTesting:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is '3 2\\n-1 1 2' → sum is 2 → 2+2-1=3 → 3//2=1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is '2 3\\n-2 -2' → sum is -4 → target=4 → (4+3-1)=6 → 6//3=2.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card=[5]. Sum is 5. Target is 5. (5+5-1)/5=9//5=1. So output is 1.\n\nAnother test: n=1, x=5, card=[6] → but wait, the problem says that the numbers do not exceed x in absolute value, so this case can't happen. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=10, cards [5, 5]. Sum is 10 → target 10. (10+10-1)/10=19//10=1. So output is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
