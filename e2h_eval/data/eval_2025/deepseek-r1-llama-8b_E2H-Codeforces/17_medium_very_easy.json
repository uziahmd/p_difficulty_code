He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the 2n-2 strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of a certain string s of length n. The input gives all possible improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths from 1 to n-1), and I need to output a string where each character is 'P' or 'S', indicating whether the corresponding input string is a prefix or suffix.\n\nHmm, the key is that exactly two of each length are given, but one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Wait, no, the problem says that for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings provided, but one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So for each length l, the two strings of length l: one must be a prefix of s, the other a suffix.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is figure out, for each of these strings, whether it's a prefix, a suffix, or both? No, because each string is either a prefix or a suffix, but not both, since otherwise, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then s would have to start and end with the same substring, which could complicate things.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem states that for each l in 1..n-1, there are exactly two strings. One is a prefix, the other is a suffix. So for each l, the two strings of that length are candidates: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo for each string in the input, I need to determine whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nI think the approach is to find the correct s by considering possible candidates and checking against all constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as building the possible s step by step.\n\nLet me think: For each possible length l, the two strings of length l are a prefix candidate and a suffix candidate. But which is which?\n\nWait, for a given l, the two strings are s[0..l-1] and s[l..n-1], but we don't know which is which.\n\nWait, no. For each l, one is a prefix (so s starts with it) and the other is a suffix (so s ends with it).\n\nSo for each l, the two strings of length l are s's prefix of length l and its suffix of length l.\n\nSo the idea is to find a string s such that for every l in 1..n-1:\n\nEither:\n\nprefix_l = s[0..l-1]\n\nsuffix_l = s[n-l..n-1]\n\nwhere the two strings of length l are prefix_l and suffix_l, but we don't know which is which.\n\nSo the approach is to find s such that for each l, one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, maybe the way to approach this is to consider that for each l, the two strings of that length must be compatible as either prefix and suffix or vice versa.\n\nWait, but how do I find s? Because s is unknown, but the input gives us all possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAn alternative approach is to note that the correct s must be such that for each position i in 0..n-2, the prefix of length i+1 is the same as the suffix of length i+1. Or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be built by starting with the smallest possible lengths and working up.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the structure of s.\n\nFor example, for l=1, we have two strings: one is the first character of s, the other is the last character of s.\n\nSimilarly, for l=2, the two strings must be the first two characters and the last two characters of s.\n\nWait, but for l=2, the two strings could be s[0:2] and s[-2:], but depending on s's structure.\n\nWait, but how can we find s?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that for any l, the two strings of length l must be such that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So for each l, the two strings must match in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps we can build a graph where each node is a possible string of a certain length, and edges represent possible transitions.\n\nAlternatively, for each l, let's say that the two strings of length l are A and B. Then, either A is the prefix and B is the suffix, or B is the prefix and A is the suffix.\n\nSo for each l, the two possibilities must hold.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct s can be determined by looking at the overlaps between the possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nFor example, the prefix of length l must be equal to the first l characters of s. The suffix of length l must be equal to the last l characters of s.\n\nNow, for l = k, the suffix of length k must also be a prefix of length k of some longer string. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be built by considering that the prefix of length l must be a substring that appears as a suffix in some other string.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think about the entire collection of strings and try to find a string s that satisfies all the necessary conditions.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\n1. For each possible l, collect all possible strings of that length. Since for each l, there are two strings, but one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\n2. We can model the problem as trying to find a string s such that for each l, one of the two strings is the prefix of s of length l, and the other is the suffix of s of length l.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nAnother angle: The correct s will be such that for each l, the suffix of length l must appear in the list of suffixes for that l, and the prefix must appear in the list of prefixes for that l.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a list of 2n-2 strings, each of varying lengths. So perhaps we can group them by their lengths.\n\nOnce grouped, for each group of length l, the two strings must be the prefix and suffix for that l.\n\nSo for each l, we have two strings, say A and B.\n\nWe need to decide which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the correct s can be constructed by considering the maximum possible l where the two strings can form a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s is the one where for each l, the prefix of l is the same as the suffix of l-1, except for the last character.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can reconstruct s step by step.\n\nLet's see.\n\nStart with l=1. There are two strings, say c1 and c2. One is s[0], the other is s[-1].\n\nSuppose c1 is s[0], then c2 is s[-1]. But without knowing which is which, how can we proceed?\n\nWait, but for l=2, the two strings must be s[0:2] and s[-2:]. So the second character of the prefix is s[1], and the second character of the suffix is s[n-1].\n\nSo perhaps, for each l, the two strings can be used to determine the next character in s.\n\nWait, let's think of s as being built step by step.\n\nAt each step l, we have two possible options for the current position.\n\nWait, maybe the way to approach this is to model the possible candidates for s's initial part and the ending part.\n\nSo, for each l, we can have a set of possible prefixes and suffixes, and for each possible combination, we can check if the next step holds.\n\nWait, perhaps dynamic programming can help here.\n\nLet me think: We can model the state as the current possible prefix and suffix.\n\nAt each step, for l, we have two possible prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each possible pair (prefix_prev, suffix_prev), we can see what the new prefix and suffix must be.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible l, the prefix of length l must be a suffix of the prefix of length l+1, minus the last character.\n\nWait, that might make sense.\n\nBecause the prefix of l+1 is the prefix of l followed by another character. So the prefix of l must be equal to the suffix of l in s, which is the same as the last l characters of the prefix of l+1.\n\nWait, yes! So for each l, the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nIn s, the prefix of length l is s[0..l-1], and the prefix of length l+1 is s[0..l]. So the prefix of l must be equal to the prefix of l+1 minus the last character, which is s[l].\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of length l is s[n-l..n-1], and the suffix of l+1 is s[n-(l+1)..n-1], which is s[n-l-1..n-1]. So the suffix of l is s[n-l..n-1], which is the same as the suffix of l+1 plus the character before that.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Wait, when you have a suffix of l+1, it's the last l+1 characters. So the suffix of l is the last l characters of s, which is the same as the suffix of l+1, but shifted left by one character.\n\nSo, for example, if the suffix of l+1 is \"abc\", then the suffix of l is \"bc\".\n\nSo, for the suffixes, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the suffix of l+1 is a continuation of the suffix of l.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that for the correct s, the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, the prefix of l is s[0..l-1], and the prefix of l+1 is s[0..l]. So the prefix of l must be equal to the prefix of l+1 without the last character. Therefore, the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l is s[n-l..n-1], and the suffix of l+1 is s[n-l-1..n-1]. So the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 with the first character added to the front. So the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each l, the two strings of length l must satisfy that one is the prefix of l, and the other is the suffix of l.\n\nMoreover, for l, the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nWait, but for l=1, we don't have l+1, since n is at least 2.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Group the input strings by their lengths.\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1, get the two strings of that length.\n\n- Now, for each l, one is the prefix (p_l) and the other is the suffix (s_l). Also, p_l must be a suffix of p_{l+1}, and s_l must be a prefix of s_{l+1}.\n\nWait, no, because for l=1, we don't have l+1.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find for each l, the two strings, and then see which pair (A, B) can form a chain where A is the prefix of l, and B is the suffix of l, such that for l+1, the prefix is A + some char, and the suffix is some char + B.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to find the correct s by building it step by step.\n\nHere's an outline of the steps:\n\n1. Group all input strings by their lengths.\n\n2. For each length l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings of that length.\n\n3. For each l, decide which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n4. Once we have for each l, the prefix and suffix, we can build s step by step.\n\nBut the problem is that the decision for l depends on higher l's.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to process the lengths in increasing order.\n\nWait, for l=1, the two strings are p1 and s1.\n\np1 is the first character of s.\n\ns1 is the last character of s.\n\nBut how can we determine which is which.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the two strings must satisfy that p_l is a suffix of p_{l+1}, and s_l is a prefix of s_{l+1}.\n\nBut since we don't know p_{l+1} and s_{l+1}, perhaps this is difficult.\n\nWait, but for l=1, the two strings are p1 and s1.\n\nFor l=2, the two strings are p2 and s2.\n\np2 must be p1 + c, where c is the second character.\n\ns2 must be d + s1, where d is the second last character.\n\nBut again, without knowing s, it's unclear.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible s_candidate, check whether all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes.\n\nBut for n up to 100, and 26 letters, the number of possible s_candidates is 26^100, which is impossible.\n\nSo brute-force is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each l, the two strings of that length must be compatible as prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, for l, the two strings must satisfy that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nMoreover, for the correct s, the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a graph where nodes represent possible current state (current prefix and suffix), and edges represent adding a new character.\n\nWait, but for each l, the current prefix is the prefix of l, and the current suffix is the suffix of l.\n\nFor l+1, the new prefix is the old prefix plus a new character, and the new suffix is a character plus the old suffix.\n\nWait, but how do I model the transition.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible l, the two strings of that length can be considered as candidates for the prefix and suffix, and for each possible assignment (A is prefix, B is suffix; or B is prefix, A is suffix), check whether the next level l+1 has compatible strings.\n\nWait, but for l+1, we don't have any information yet.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: The correct s must be such that for each l, the two strings of that length must be the prefix and suffix for that l.\n\nThus, for each l, the two strings must satisfy that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nMoreover, for l=1, the two strings are the first and last character of s.\n\nFor l=2, the two strings must be the first two and last two characters of s.\n\nSo, for l=1, suppose the two strings are a and b.\n\nThen, s starts with a, ends with b, or starts with b and ends with a.\n\nBut how to determine which.\n\nWait, but for l=2, the two strings must be the first two and last two characters of s.\n\nSo, for each possibility of l=1, we can see which leads to a consistent l=2.\n\nLet's take an example.\n\nSuppose for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'b'.\n\nCase 1: s starts with 'a', ends with 'b'.\n\nThen, for l=2, the two strings must be 'aa' and 'ab' (assuming s is 'aabba...'), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think of s as 'ababa' for n=5.\n\nThen for l=1: prefix is 'a', suffix is 'a'.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a'? Or wait, in the sample input, the first group is:\n\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba']\n\nWait, perhaps the groupings are by length.\n\nWait, the first input line after n=5 is 'ba' (length 2), then 'a' (length 1), then 'abab' (length 4), etc. Hmm, perhaps the grouping is done by the user.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is a list of 2n-2 lines, each being a string. So the first thing to do is to read all the strings, group them by their lengths.\n\nSo for each l in 1..n-1, there are exactly two strings, each of length l.\n\nSo for l=1, there are two strings; for l=2, two strings, etc., up to l=n-1.\n\nSo, for each l, we can get the two strings.\n\nSo, for each l, we have two options: assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\nOnce assigned, we can check for the consistency with higher l's.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the two strings must be such that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Additionally, the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, perhaps for each l, we can find the two possible assignments (swap or not swap the two strings) and then see which assignment leads to a consistent s.\n\nBut even this seems tricky.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nAssume that for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix, but the order is unknown. So for each l, we can consider the two possibilities.\n\nThen, for each l, we can check whether the choice for l is compatible with the choices for l-1 and l+1.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nPerhaps it's better to model the problem as follows:\n\nWe can construct s step by step, starting from l=1 to l=n-1.\n\nAt each step, for l, the two possible strings are the candidates for prefix and suffix.\n\nBut for each step, we also need to consider the previous step's state.\n\nWait, but without knowing s, this is hard.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe correct s must satisfy that for each l, the prefix of l is a suffix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l is a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for l, the prefix_p and suffix_p (the two strings of length l) must satisfy that either:\n\n- prefix_p is a suffix of prefix_{l+1}, and suffix_p is a prefix of suffix_{l+1}.\n\nOR\n\n- suffix_p is a suffix of prefix_{l+1}, and prefix_p is a prefix of suffix_{l+1}.\n\nWait, but this is for each l.\n\nBut since we don't know the l+1's strings, perhaps it's difficult.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node represents a possible state of the current prefix and suffix, and transitions to the next state.\n\nBut this might get complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that for the correct s, the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of length l must be such that one is the prefix and the other is the suffix, and also, the chosen prefix must be a suffix of the next prefix, and the chosen suffix must be a prefix of the next suffix.\n\nBut how can we find this.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nFor each possible l, the two strings must be such that one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So for each l, the two strings must have the property that one is a suffix of the other, or vice versa.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the sample input, for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a'. So they are the same. So both are prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, but in that case, the s starts and ends with 'a'.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find s as a string such that for each l, the two strings of that length are either the prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read all the input strings, group them by their lengths.\n\n2. For each l, collect the two strings.\n\n3. For each l, determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n4. Once all l's are determined, build the string s based on the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how to determine which is which for each l.\n\nAnother Idea: For each l, the two strings must be such that one is a prefix of the other or vice versa.\n\nWait, no. For example, if l=2, the two strings could be 'ab' and 'ba'. Neither is a prefix of the other.\n\nSo that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but for s, the prefix of l+1 must start with the prefix of l.\n\nSo, the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of length l must be compatible in this way.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings must satisfy that one is a suffix of the other's possible next step.\n\nBut without knowing the next step, perhaps this is challenging.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each l, the two strings must satisfy that one is a suffix of the other.\n\nBecause, for example, the prefix of l+1 is the prefix of l followed by a character. So the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of length l must have the property that one is a suffix of the other.\n\nBecause, for example, if for l, the two strings are A and B, then one must be the prefix and the other the suffix, and thus, A must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1, which is longer than l.\n\nWait, but the prefix of l+1 is longer than l, so A must be a suffix of it.\n\nSo, for the two strings of length l, A and B, one must be a suffix of the other.\n\nBecause the prefix of l+1 is A + c, so A is a suffix of the prefix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l+1 is d + B, so B is a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nThus, for each l, the two strings must have one being a suffix of the other.\n\nWait, but what if the two strings are the same, like in the sample input where l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a'?\n\nIn that case, both are the same, so one is a suffix of the other.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the conclusion is: for each l, the two strings of length l must be such that one is a suffix of the other.\n\nSo, for each l, among the two strings, one must be a suffix of the other.\n\nThus, for each l, the two strings can be ordered such that one is a suffix of the other.\n\nTherefore, for each l, we can check which of the two strings is a suffix of the other.\n\nIf neither is a suffix of the other, then it's impossible, but the problem statement says that the input is valid.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings A and B must satisfy A is a suffix of B or B is a suffix of A.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each l, find which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nWe can do this by checking for each l, which string is a suffix of the other.\n\nOnce we have that, we can build s.\n\nWait, but how to arrange this.\n\nWait, for each l, the two strings are A and B.\n\nWe can check if A is a suffix of B, or vice versa.\n\nIf A is a suffix of B, then perhaps A is the prefix, and B is the suffix.\n\nWait, but why.\n\nBecause in s, the prefix of l is A, and the suffix is B.\n\nThen, the prefix of l+1 is A followed by some character, so A is a suffix of the prefix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l is B, so the suffix of l+1 must start with B.\n\nThus, for l+1, the two strings must be the prefix (A + c) and suffix (d + B), where c is the next character in s, and d is the previous character.\n\nBut without knowing s, it's hard to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a directed acyclic graph, where each node is a possible string of length l, and edges represent the possible transitions.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince for each l, the two strings must be such that one is a suffix of the other, perhaps the correct s can be built by choosing, for each l, the longer string as the suffix, and the shorter as the prefix.\n\nBut that's just a guess.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input:\n\nn=5.\n\nLooking at the first group, which is for l=1: the two strings are 'a' and 'a'. So both are same, so s starts and ends with 'a'.\n\nFor l=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'. So 'ab' is a suffix of 'ba' (since 'ab' is the last two characters of 'ba')? No, 'ab' is not a suffix of 'ba'. 'ba' is 'b' followed by 'a'; 'ab' is 'a' followed by 'b'.\n\nWait, no, 'ab' is not a suffix of 'ba'. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the two strings must be such that one is a suffix of the other.\n\nWait, in the sample input, for l=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'. 'ab' is not a suffix of 'ba', nor is 'ba' a suffix of 'ab'.\n\nWait, but that contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my earlier reasoning was incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the condition is not that for each l, the two strings are suffixes of each other.\n\nSo, what's wrong with my earlier reasoning.\n\nAh, perhaps the condition is not that the two strings are suffixes of each other, but that the prefix of l is a suffix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l is a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of l.\n\nThen, for l+1, the prefix is the prefix of l plus a new character, and the suffix is a new character plus the suffix of l.\n\nThus, the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1.\n\nAnd the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of length l must be such that:\n\nEither:\n\nprefix_l is a suffix of prefix_{l+1}, and suffix_l is a prefix of suffix_{l+1}.\n\nOr:\n\nsuffix_l is a suffix of prefix_{l+1}, and prefix_l is a prefix of suffix_{l+1}.\n\nBut without knowing prefix_{l+1} and suffix_{l+1}, this is difficult.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to process the strings in reverse order.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find the s that is consistent with all the given strings.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the problem as a system of constraints.\n\nEach constraint is that for some l, the string is either a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be built by considering the following:\n\ns must be such that for each l, the two strings of length l are the prefix and suffix of s.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings must fit into this role.\n\nThus, for each l, the two strings must be compatible as the prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings must satisfy that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nMoreover, for each l, the prefix of l must be a suffix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a s such that for all l from 1 to n-1:\n\n- The two strings of length l are s's prefix and suffix.\n\n- The prefix of l is a suffix of the prefix of l+1.\n\n- The suffix of l is a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to build s incrementally, checking for each l.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother Idea: Start with the smallest l (l=1) and see possible options, then for each option, check for l=2, etc.\n\nBut for n=100, this may be manageable.\n\nSo, here's a possible algorithm:\n\n1. For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings of that length.\n\n2. For each l, decide which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n3. Once this decision is made, use the prefix and suffix to build s.\n\nBut how to make the decision.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the two strings must be such that one is a suffix of the other.\n\nSo, for l=1, the two strings are A and B.\n\nWe can check if A is a suffix of B or vice versa.\n\nIf A is a suffix of B, then perhaps A is the prefix and B is the suffix.\n\nOtherwise, B is the prefix and A is the suffix.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for l=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'.\n\nNeither is a suffix of the other.\n\nSo, this approach would fail.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the correct s can be found by considering that the entire collection of strings must form a chain where each step adds a character to the prefix and a character to the suffix.\n\nBut again, without knowing the correct s, it's hard to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be found by taking the minimal possible prefix and maximal possible suffix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be built by combining the possible prefixes and suffixes in a way that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's imagine that for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of s.\n\nThus, for each l, the two strings must form a pair (p, s), such that p is a prefix of s of length l, and s is a suffix of s of length l.\n\nWait, no, that's redundant.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the two strings must be such that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are either (prefix, suffix) or (suffix, prefix).\n\nThus, the problem reduces to assigning for each l whether the two strings are prefix and suffix in that order.\n\nOnce all assignments are made, s can be built by combining the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find for each l, the two strings must be such that the prefix of l is a suffix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l is a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nThus, the algorithm could be:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings.\n\n- For each l, choose which string is the prefix and which is the suffix, ensuring that the prefix of l is a suffix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l is a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nBut since l+1 is processed after l, this is a chicken and egg problem.\n\nThus, perhaps a dynamic programming approach is needed.\n\nLet me think: For each l, we can keep track of possible pairs of (prefix, suffix), which can lead to a valid s.\n\nAt each step l, for each possible pair (p, s), we check whether for l+1, the two strings can be extended to form a new pair (p + c, d + s), where c and d are new characters.\n\nWait, but for l+1, the two strings must be the new prefix (p + c) and new suffix (d + s), but we don't know c and d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each l, the possible (prefix, suffix) pairs must be such that for the next l+1, the new prefix is a suffix of one of the two strings of l+1, and the new suffix is a prefix of the other.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps, for each l, the possible (prefix, suffix) pairs can be determined based on the previous l's possibilities.\n\nWait, but again, without knowing the next step, it's unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the correct s must have the property that the prefix of l is a suffix of the prefix of l+1, perhaps the entire s can be built by starting from the first character and adding each possible character that fits the constraints.\n\nBut this is similar to building a trie.\n\nBut for n=100, this would be manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as a graph where each node represents the current possible prefix and suffix, and edges represent possible extensions.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps this is not feasible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the correct s can be uniquely determined by the overlap between the possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nFor example, the prefix of l must be equal to the suffix of l+1, minus the first character.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s is the one that is the intersection of all possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother Idea: The correct s is such that for each l, the prefix of l is the same as the suffix of l, except for the last character.\n\nNo, that's not necessarily true.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be built by considering that for each l, the two strings must be compatible, meaning that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nThus, for each l, the two strings must satisfy that one is a suffix of the other.\n\nBut in the sample input, for l=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba', which are not suffixes of each other.\n\nSo, this approach would not work.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the correct s is such that for each l, the two strings of length l are the prefix and suffix, and for l=1, the two strings are the first and last character of s.\n\nThus, for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix, and s can be built by combining the prefix and suffix.\n\nBut without knowing which is which, it's unclear.\n\nWait, but for l=1, the two strings are s[0] and s[-1]. So, if the two strings are 'a' and 'b', then s starts with 'a' and ends with 'b', or starts with 'b' and ends with 'a'.\n\nThus, for each possible assignment of the two strings for l=1, we can try to build s and see if it satisfies all constraints.\n\nBut for n=100, this approach may be feasible.\n\nSo, here's a possible algorithm:\n\n1. Read all the input strings, group them by their lengths.\n\n2. For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings.\n\n3. For l=1, collect the two strings A and B.\n\n   a. Try assigning A as the prefix and B as the suffix.\n\n      i. Build s as A followed by some characters, ending with B.\n\n   b. Try assigning B as the prefix and A as the suffix.\n\n      i. Build s as B followed by some characters, ending with A.\n\n4. For each possible initial assignment, try to build s step by step.\n\n   a. For l=2, the two strings must be the prefix and suffix.\n\n   b. Check which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n   c. Ensure that the prefix of l=2 is a continuation of the prefix of l=1.\n\n   d. Similarly, ensure that the suffix of l=2 is a continuation of the suffix of l=1.\n\n5. Continue this process until all l's are processed.\n\n6. If a valid s is found, output the corresponding P/S string.\n\nBut this is a lot of code.\n\nBut given that n is up to 100, and for each l, the two options are manageable.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the possible states as the current possible prefix and suffix.\n\nAt each step l, for each possible pair (p, s), where p is a possible prefix of l and s is a possible suffix of l, we can try to extend to l+1.\n\nFor l+1, the two strings must be the prefix (p + c) and the suffix (d + s), where c and d are new characters.\n\nBut since we don't know c and d, perhaps we can look at the two strings for l+1 and see if one is a prefix and the other is a suffix, and whether p is a suffix of the prefix of l+1 and s is a prefix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use dynamic programming to track possible (prefix, suffix) pairs for each l.\n\n- For l=1, possible pairs are (A, B) and (B,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or suffix of the unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all possible improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to classify each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S').\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading and Grouping**: Read the input strings and group them by their lengths. Each length from 1 to `n-1` will have exactly two strings.\n2. **Initial Assignment for Length 1**: For the smallest length (1), assign one string as the prefix and the other as the suffix. This gives us two initial possibilities for the unknown string `s`.\n3. **Iterative Construction of `s`**: For each subsequent length, check both initial assignments of `s` (from length 1) to see if they can be extended to form valid prefixes and suffixes for the current length. This involves ensuring that the current prefix is a suffix of the next possible prefix and the current suffix is a prefix of the next possible suffix.\n4. **Validation**: For each possible extension, validate if it fits with the given strings for the current length. If a valid extension is found, continue to the next length; otherwise, backtrack and try the other initial assignment.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    total = 2 * n - 2\n    strings = []\n    for _ in range(total):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        strings.append(s)\n    \n    # Group by lengths\n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in groups:\n            groups[l] = []\n        groups[l].append(s)\n    \n    # Function to check if a is a suffix of b\n    def is_suffix(a, b):\n        return a == b[-len(a):] if len(a) <= len(b) else False\n    \n    # For each possible initial assignment of l=1\n    possible_prefixes = []\n    possible_suffixes = []\n    for s1, s2 in groups[1]:\n        # Try both orders\n        possible_prefixes.append(s1)\n        possible_suffixes.append(s2)\n        possible_prefixes.append(s2)\n        possible_suffixes.append(s1)\n    \n    # Now, process each possible initial state\n    for p0, s0 in zip(possible_prefixes, possible_suffixes):\n        # We'll try building s step by step\n        current_p = p0\n        current_s = s0\n        valid = True\n        result = [''] * total\n        for l in range(2, n):\n            # Get the two strings for this length\n            candidates = groups[l]\n            # Check each candidate as prefix and suffix\n            for i in range(2):\n                # Assign current_p as prefix and current_s as suffix\n                # Then, new prefix should be current_p + c, new suffix should start with current_s\n                # So, for each candidate pair, see if it matches\n                for j in range(2):\n                    candidate_p = candidates[j]\n                    if len(candidate_p) != l:\n                        continue\n                    # Check if current_p is a suffix of candidate_p\n                    if not is_suffix(current_p, candidate_p):\n                        continue\n                    # Also, current_s must be a prefix of the suffix part\n                    # The suffix part is the last l characters of the suffix string\n                    # Wait, the suffix string is of length l, which is the same as current_s's length.\n                    # So, if the candidate is the suffix, it must start with current_s.\n                    # Or wait, no.
