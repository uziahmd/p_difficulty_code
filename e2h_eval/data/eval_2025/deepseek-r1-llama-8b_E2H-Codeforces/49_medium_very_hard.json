They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about restoring the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the information from some roads. Each road gives two numbers: the GCD and LCM of the two lawns it connects. My task is to determine if there's a possible arrangement of mushrooms that satisfies all these constraints and output it, or say it's impossible.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to model this. It seems like a graph problem where each node (lawn) has a value, and edges impose constraints between pairs of nodes. So, for each edge, the GCD of the two nodes' values must equal the given GCD, and the LCM must equal the given LCM.\n\nWait, but wait. The GCD and LCM are related in a specific way. For any two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So for each edge, the product of the given GCD and LCM must equal the product of the two nodes' values.\n\nSo for each edge, the equation is:\nGCD(e) * LCM(e) = x_u * x_v\n\nWhere x_u and x_v are the values at the two ends of the edge.\n\nThis is a crucial point. So, for each edge, x_u * x_v must equal GCD * LCM.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to assigning values to each node such that for every edge, their product equals the product of the edge's GCD and LCM.\n\nHow can I model this? It feels like a system of equations with multiplicative constraints. Maybe I can represent the values in terms of their prime factors, but that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node's value is a variable, and each edge represents a multiplicative constraint. This sounds similar to a system of equations that can be solved using Union-Find data structures or something like that.\n\nWait, but Union-Find is typically used for additive constraints. How do we handle multiplicative ones?\n\nLet me think differently. Since each edge imposes x_u * x_v = K (where K is GCD * LCM), perhaps I can assign each node a value relative to a base node. For example, choose one node as a root and express all other nodes' values in terms of the root's value.\n\nBut since multiplication is involved, this might be tricky. Because if node A is connected to B, then x_A = K / x_B, but then when connecting node B to C, x_B = M / x_C, which would give x_A = K/(M/x_C) = (K*M)/x_C. So, each new connection could impose more constraints on the possible values.\n\nWait, but how do I ensure that all these constraints are consistent?\n\nI think this can be modeled as a system where each node's value is a multiple of some base value. But perhaps the variables are multiplicative, so we can model them using exponents in logarithmic space. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each node's value can be represented as a product of primes raised to certain exponents, but that could quickly become unwieldy, especially since the input constraints don't limit the size of the numbers.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the initial map's numbers were no larger than 106. So, the possible values for x_i (the mushrooms on a lawn) could be up to some multiple of that. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: for each node, its value must be a divisor of some product of the GCD*LCM of the edges connected to it. Wait, perhaps not directly applicable.\n\nLet me think about the problem as a graph where each edge represents an equation x_u * x_v = C, where C is GCD * LCM for that edge. So, each edge adds a constraint on the product of the two nodes.\n\nIf I can model this system of multiplicative equations, then solving it would give me the possible values for x_i.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached with a BFS or DFS, assigning values as we go and checking for consistency.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\n1. Choose a starting node (say, node 1) and assign it an initial value, say 1.\n\n2. Then, traverse the graph, processing each edge. For each edge, if both ends are known, check if their product equals the required C. If one end is known and the other is unknown, compute the unknown based on the known value and the C.\n\n3. However, if during this process a contradiction is found (like trying to assign a value that's inconsistent with previous assignments), then the system is unsolvable, and we should output \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, the initial assignment is arbitrary. Choosing node 1 as 1 may not always work. What if node 1 is part of an edge where C is not 1? Then, the initial assignment would have to satisfy x_1 * x_other = C. So, choosing x_1 as 1 would fix x_other as C, but if node 1 is part of another edge, it may impose different constraints.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial assignment needs to be handled more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the problem using a Union-Find data structure that tracks the possible products. Each node's value is determined relative to its parent in the Union-Find structure. When merging two sets, we check if the product of the current path's product and the new edge's C is compatible.\n\nWait, but how to represent the product of all variables along the path from a node to the root.\n\nMaybe each node in the Union-Find structure can keep track of a value that represents the product of the variables from the node to its parent. Then, when finding the root, the total product can be computed by multiplying all these along the path.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how to implement this.\n\nLet me think through an example.\n\nSuppose we have three nodes: 1, 2, 3.\n\nEdge 1-2: GCD=2, LCM=3 → C=6. So x1 * x2 =6.\n\nEdge 2-3: GCD=1, LCM=4 → C=4. So x2 * x3=4.\n\nThen, from x1*x2=6 and x2*x3=4, we can find x3 = 4/(x2) =4/(6/x1) )= (4 x1)/6 = (2x1)/3. So x1 must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, but if x1 is 3, then x2 is 2, x3 is 4/(2)=2. That works.\n\nIf x1 is 6, x2 is 1, x3 is 4/1=4. Also works.\n\nSo the solution is not unique.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's allowed to output any valid arrangement.\n\nSo, back to the approach.\n\nWe need to assign values to each node such that for every edge, x_u * x_v = C.\n\nOne approach is to model this as a system of equations and find a solution. But the system can be large, so we need an efficient way.\n\nAnother idea is to represent the variables as products and use a BFS-like approach, assigning values as we process edges, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's think about building a graph where each node has a value, and for each edge, the product must equal C.\n\nWe can start by assigning a value to a root node, say node 1, and then proceed to assign other nodes based on the edges.\n\nWait, but what if node 1 is part of an edge where C is not 1? Then the value of node 1 can't be arbitrary; it's constrained by other edges.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to:\n\n1. Assign a value to node 1, then propagate this value through the edges.\n\nBut node 1's value can't be anything; it's determined by the edges connected to it. So if node 1 has more than one edge, all those edges must agree on the value of node 1.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if all edges connected to node 1 have the same C value divided by their other end's value. Hmm, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, for each edge connected to node 1, the product of node 1's value and its neighbor's value must equal C.\n\nSo, suppose node 1 has two edges:\n\n- Edge e1: connects 1 and 2, C = c1.\n\n- Edge e2: connects 1 and 3, C = c2.\n\nThen:\n\nx1 * x2 = c1 → x2 = c1 / x1.\n\nx1 * x3 = c2 → x3 = c2 / x1.\n\nBut x2 and x3 can have any values as long as x1 is a common divisor of c1 and c2.\n\nWait, but x1 must be a divisor of both c1 and c2.\n\nBecause x2 must be an integer, so c1 must be divisible by x1. Similarly for x3.\n\nSo, x1 must be a common divisor of c1 and c2.\n\nTherefore, when processing edges connected to node 1, we can collect all the possible divisors of c's, and see if there exists a common value for x1 that satisfies all edges.\n\nFor example, if c1 is 6 and c2 is 4, then x1 must be a common divisor of 6 and 4. The common divisors are 1, 2.\n\nSo x1 could be 1, which makes x2=6, x3=4.\n\nOr x1 could be 2, making x2=3, x3=2.\n\nIf there's no such x1, then it's impossible.\n\nSo, for the general case, the approach would be:\n\n- Select a starting node (like node 1) and compute the possible values for it based on its edges.\n\n- For each possible value of the starting node, attempt to assign values to the rest of the graph.\n\nBut wait, this could be computationally expensive because the number of possible x1's could be large. But given that the constraints are that C is up to 1e6 (since GCD and LCM are each up to 1e6, their product is up to 1e12), the number of divisors per node is manageable.\n\nBut how do we handle this in code?\n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to model this as a system of equations and represent it as a graph with variables and constraints, then perform a BFS or DFS to assign values, checking for consistency.\n\nEach time we process an edge, we can compute the required value of the next node based on the current node's value and the edge's C.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Build a graph where each edge has the constraint x_u * x_v = C.\n\n2. Choose a starting node (e.g., node 0) and assign it an initial value. But wait, the initial value can't be arbitrary. For any edges connected to the starting node, the starting node's value must be a divisor of the edge's C, and the other end's value is C divided by the starting node's value.\n\n3. So, for the starting node, collect all the edge constraints and find possible values for it that are common across all edges.\n\nWait, but that's only for the starting node's edges. Once the starting node's value is set, the rest can be determined via BFS or DFS.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- For the starting node (say, node 1), look at all its edges. For each edge (1, u, c), compute the possible values of u as c / x_1. So, x_u must be c / x_1.\n\nBut x_1 must be a divisor of c for each such edge. So, the possible x_1 must be a common divisor of all c's in the edges connected to it.\n\nSo, for the starting node, the possible x_1's are the common divisors of all c's from its edges.\n\nIf there are no edges for the starting node, then x_1 can be any positive integer. But in practice, since other nodes must also have positive integers, perhaps the starting node's value can be 1, but that depends on other constraints.\n\nWait, but if the starting node is not connected to any edges, then its value can be any positive integer. However, since other nodes may be connected through edges, their values will depend on the starting node's value.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the initial map had numbers >=1. So, our solution must assign positive integers.\n\nSo, for the starting node, the initial value must be a common divisor of all the c's from its edges. If the starting node has no edges, then it can be any positive integer.\n\nOnce the starting node's value is determined, we can proceed to assign the values of its neighbors, and then their neighbors, and so on.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n1. Check if the graph is connected. Because if it's disconnected, each component can be processed independently.\n\nWait, no, because the graph is undirected and the constraints apply across edges. So, each connected component can be handled separately.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each connected component in the graph:\n\n   a. Find all edges in the component.\n\n   b. Choose a starting node in the component.\n\n   c. For the starting node, collect all edges connected to it. For each edge, the C must be divisible by the starting node's value.\n\n   d. Compute the greatest common divisor (g) of all Cs from the edges of the starting node. The possible x_start must be a divisor of g.\n\n   Wait, no. Because each edge (start, u, c) requires x_start * x_u = c. So, x_start must be a divisor of each c. So, the maximum possible x_start is the greatest common divisor of all the c's.\n\n   Or, wait, no. For example, if the starting node has edges with c1=6 and c2=4, then x_start must divide both 6 and 4, so x_start can be 1 or 2.\n\n   So, the possible x_start is the greatest common divisor (g) of all the c's from its edges.\n\n   Wait, no. Because the gcd of 6 and 4 is 2. So x_start can be 1 or 2, which are the divisors of the gcd.\n\n   So, the maximum possible x_start is the gcd of all c's. And all possible x_start are the divisors of this gcd.\n\n   So, for the starting node, the possible x_start is any divisor of the gcd of all c's in its edges. If the starting node has no edges, then the gcd is undefined, and x_start can be any positive integer.\n\n   So, the algorithm for a connected component is:\n\n   - Collect all edges of the component.\n\n   - For the starting node, compute the list of c's from its edges.\n\n   - Compute the gcd of these c's. Let's call it g.\n\n   - If g is zero, then no solution (but since c's are at least 1, g can't be zero).\n\n   - So, x_start can be any divisor of g. For each possible x_start, check whether the entire component can be assigned consistent values.\n\n   - For each possible x_start, assign it and then proceed to assign other nodes in the component.\n\n   - If any assignment leads to a valid configuration, output \"YES\" and the values.\n\n   - Else, proceed to the next possible x_start.\n\n   - If none of the possible x_start's work, output \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, this seems computationally intensive because for each component, we have to try all possible divisors of the starting node's g, and for each, perform a BFS/DFS to assign values.\n\nBut given the constraints, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Iterate over each connected component in the graph.\n\n   For each component:\n\n      a. Collect all edges in the component.\n\n      b. For each edge, store the c (gcd * lcm) value.\n\n      c. Choose a starting node in the component (say, the first node encountered).\n\n      d. Collect all edges connected to the starting node, get their c's.\n\n      e. Compute the gcd of these c's.\n\n      f. If there are no edges for the starting node, then x_start can be any positive integer. We can set it to 1 for simplicity.\n\n      g. Else, x_start must be a divisor of the computed g. For each possible x_start:\n\n         i. Assign x_start to the starting node.\n\n         ii. Use BFS/DFS to assign values to other nodes in the component.\n\n            For each edge in the component, if both ends are known, check if their product equals c.\n\n            If during BFS, a conflict is found (i.e., a node is assigned a value that doesn't satisfy an edge's constraint), mark this x_start as invalid.\n\n            Else, continue.\n\n         iii. If the BFS/DFS finds a valid assignment, return it.\n\n      h. If any of the x_start options leads to a valid assignment, proceed to output.\n\n      i. Else, the component is invalid; proceed to the next component.\n\nWait, but each component must be considered independently. Because the components are not connected, their assignments are independent.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\n- Split the graph into connected components.\n\n- For each component, try all possible x_start values (as per the above steps) and see if any assignment is possible.\n\n- If any component cannot be assigned, the entire problem is impossible.\n\n- Otherwise, collect all the assignments and output them.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, the graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each node points to a list of tuples (neighbor, c).\n\nBut for each edge, since the graph is undirected, each edge is stored in both directions.\n\nThen, for each connected component:\n\n- Collect all the edges in the component.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to collect all the edges for the component as part of the processing.\n\nWait, no. For each component, when processing the BFS, we'll process the edges as we visit them.\n\nSo, the main steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nBuild the adjacency list: for each node, a list of (neighbor, c), where c is gcd * lcm.\n\nThen, for each node from 0 to n-1:\n\n   if not visited:\n\n      create a new component.\n\n      process this component.\n\nSo, for each component:\n\n   collect all the edges that are part of this component.\n\nBut wait, the edges are already in the adjacency list, so as we process each node, we can collect the edges.\n\nNow, within the component:\n\n   Let's collect all edges connected to the starting node.\n\n   Compute the g = gcd of all c's in these edges.\n\n   If there are no edges, set x_start to 1.\n\n   Else, iterate over all divisors of g, in increasing order (or any order) to try possible x_start values.\n\nFor each x_start:\n\n   create a dictionary or array to hold the values of each node in the component.\n\n   initialize the starting node's value as x_start.\n\n   perform BFS:\n\n      queue = deque([starting node])\n\n      visited_nodes = {starting node}\n\n      while queue not empty:\n\n         u = queue.popleft()\n\n         for each edge (u, v, c) in adjacency[u]:\n\n             if v not in visited_nodes:\n\n                 # Compute x_v as c / x_u\n\n                 if c % x_u != 0:\n\n                     invalid, break\n\n                 x_v = c // x_u\n\n                 if x_v is integer:\n\n                     assign x_v to v.\n\n                     add to queue.\n\n                     add to visited_nodes.\n\n                 else:\n\n                     invalid, break.\n\n             else:\n\n                 # check if x_u * x_v == c\n\n                 if (x_u * x_v) != c:\n\n                     invalid, break.\n\n      if after BFS, all nodes in the component have been visited and all edges are satisfied:\n\n          collect the values, and proceed to next component.\n\n          output the solution.\n\nSo, this seems like a feasible approach.\n\nBut the problem is that for each component and each x_start, we have to perform a BFS, which could be time-consuming.\n\nBut considering the constraints:\n\nn is up to... well, the problem says it's a competitive programming problem, but I don't know the exact limits. However, for a code submission, it's manageable as long as the BFS is efficient.\n\nAnother issue is how to compute the divisors of g. For example, if g is 12, the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nSo, for each component, the number of possible x_start is the number of divisors of g. The number of divisors is at most around 1000 for numbers up to 1e6, but in practice, much less.\n\nSo, for each component, the number of x_start candidates is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about some corner cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1, m=0.\n\nIn this case, the component is just the single node. There are no edges, so x_1 can be any positive integer. So, output YES and 1.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the initial numbers were at least 1, so any assignment is acceptable. So, output 1.\n\nCase 2: n=2, m=1.\n\nEdge connects 0 and 1, c=6.\n\nSo, possible x0 * x1 =6.\n\nPossible solutions include (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). Any of these is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should try x0 as 1, then x1=6, and output that.\n\nCase 3: n=2, m=2.\n\nEdges:\n\n0-1 with c=6.\n\n0-1 with c=4.\n\nWait, but the problem says that no two lawns are connected by more than one road. So this case is impossible, but the problem says that the input ensures that no two roads connect the same pair. So, the input will not have duplicate edges.\n\nSo, the code doesn't have to handle that.\n\nAnother case: a cycle in the graph.\n\nFor example:\n\nNodes 0-1-2-0, each edge has c=6.\n\nSo, x0 * x1 =6.\n\nx1 * x2 =6.\n\nx2 * x0 =6.\n\nFrom x0*x1=6 and x1*x2=6, x2=6/x1 = x0.\n\nSubstituting into x2*x0=6: x0^2=6 → x0=sqrt(6), which is not integer. So no solution.\n\nThus, the code should detect this and output NO.\n\nSo, during BFS, when processing the third edge (0-2 with c=6), it will find x0= sqrt(6), which is not integer, leading to invalid.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother case: a chain.\n\n0-1-2-3.\n\nEach edge has c=6.\n\nSo, x0=1, x1=6, x2=6, x3=1.\n\nCheck:\n\n0-1: 1*6=6 → OK.\n\n1-2: 6*6=36 ≠6 → invalid.\n\nWait, no, wait: c is 6 for each edge.\n\nSo:\n\nx0 *x1=6 → x1=6.\n\nx1 *x2=6 → x2=1.\n\nx2 *x3=6 → x3=6.\n\nSo, yes, possible.\n\nSo, the code would assign x0=1, x1=6, x2=1, x3=6.\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nStarting with x0=1.\n\nProcess edge 0-1: x1=6.\n\nProcess edge 1-2: x2=1.\n\nProcess edge 2-3: x3=6.\n\nAll edges are satisfied.\n\nYes, that's a valid solution.\n\nSo, the code would find this.\n\nAnother case: cycles with conflicting constraints.\n\nLike a triangle where each edge has c=6.\n\nSo, x0 *x1=6 → x1=6/x0.\n\nx1 *x2=6 → x2=6/x1 = x0.\n\nx2 *x0=6 → x0^2=6 → no solution.\n\nSo, code correctly outputs NO.\n\nNow, thinking about the code structure.\n\nWe need to:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read m lines, each with four numbers: u, v, g, l. Compute c = g * l.\n\n- Build the adjacency list.\n\n- For each component:\n\n   a. Find all edges in the component.\n\n   b. For the starting node, collect all edges.\n\n   c. Compute g = gcd of all c's in the edges.\n\n   d. If no edges, x_start is 1.\n\n   e. Else, find all divisors of g.\n\n   f. For each divisor d:\n\n      i. Assign x_start = d.\n\n      ii. Perform BFS:\n\n          - Assign x_start to the starting node.\n\n          - For each edge in the component, process them in BFS order.\n\n          - For each edge, if the current node's value is known, and the next node is unassigned, compute it as c / current value.\n\n          - Else, check if the product equals c.\n\n      iii. If any assignment is valid, proceed to output.\n\n   g. If no divisor works, the component is invalid.\n\n- After processing all components, if any is invalid, output NO.\n\n- Else, output the values.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut some challenges:\n\n- Efficiently finding all divisors of a number.\n\nWe can write a function to generate all divisors of a number.\n\n- Handling the BFS correctly.\n\n- Managing the visited nodes and ensuring that all edges are checked.\n\nAnother thing: for the starting node's component, the edges may not all be connected. So, the component may consist of multiple disconnected parts. But in reality, since it's a graph, it's a single connected component. Wait, no. Because in a graph, each component is connected. So, all edges in the component are part of the same connected component.\n\nWait, no. For example, a graph can have multiple disconnected subgraphs, but each is a separate component. So, for each component, the edges are only within the component.\n\nSo, during the BFS, we can process all edges, but the component is connected.\n\nWait, no. Because the edges are part of the component. So, for a component, all edges are between nodes in the component.\n\nSo, when processing a component, all edges are part of it.\n\nSo, in the BFS, all edges are processed.\n\nWait, but how to collect all edges for the component.\n\nAn alternative approach is to, for each node in the component, process all its edges, but mark which edges are part of the component.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to collect all edges in the component as part of the BFS.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to collect all edges in the component before processing.\n\nSo, for a component, collect all edges, then during BFS, process all edges.\n\nWait, but in the adjacency list, each edge is stored in both directions.\n\nSo, during BFS, when processing a node u, for each (v, c) in adjacency[u], if v is in the component and not yet visited, process it.\n\nBut I think that for each component, the BFS will process all edges within the component.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\nFor each component:\n\n   collect all nodes in the component.\n\n   collect all edges that are between nodes in the component.\n\nBut that's a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, during BFS, for each edge, if both nodes are in the component, process it.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to, for each component, collect all edges that belong to it.\n\nBut in the adjacency list, each edge is stored twice (u→v and v→u), so during collection, each edge is added once.\n\nWait, perhaps for each component, the edges are those that connect nodes in the component.\n\nSo, the code can, for each component, collect all edges where both u and v are in the component.\n\nThus, during processing, for each component, we can collect all edges.\n\nBut in practice, this is done during the BFS.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to, for each component, collect all edges in a separate list.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to process edges on-the-fly during BFS.\n\nSo, during BFS, when visiting a node u, for each (v, c) in adjacency[u], if v is in the component and not yet visited, process it.\n\nElse, if v is already visited, check if the product is correct.\n\nSo, the code can manage this.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent the adjacency list as a list of lists. For each node u, adjacency[u] contains tuples (v, c).\n\nThe visited array can be a boolean array for each component.\n\nWe'll also have a values array to store the assigned values for each node.\n\nNow, for each component:\n\n   start_node = first unvisited node.\n\n   collect all edges connected to start_node: these are the c's that the start_node is involved in.\n\n   compute g = gcd of all these c's.\n\n   if no edges: x_start is 1.\n\n   else:\n\n      find all divisors of g.\n\n      for each divisor d in sorted order:\n\n         assign x_start = d.\n\n         create a values array, initializing to None.\n\n         values[start_node] = d.\n\n         queue = deque([start_node]).\n\n         while queue not empty:\n\n             u = queue.popleft()\n\n             for each (v, c) in adjacency[u]:\n\n                 if v not in the component:\n\n                     continue\n\n                 if values[v] is None:\n\n                     # compute x_v = c / x_u\n\n                     if c % x_u !=0:\n\n                         invalid, break.\n\n                     x_v = c // x_u\n\n                     if x_v is <=0:\n\n                         invalid, break.\n\n                     values[v] = x_v\n\n                     queue.append(v)\n\n                 else:\n\n                     # check if x_u * x_v == c\n\n                     if x_u * x_v != c:\n\n                         invalid, break.\n\n             else:\n\n                 continue\n\n             break\n\n         if no invalid found:\n\n             # record the values for this component.\n\n             # proceed.\n\nSo, the code will have nested loops, but it's manageable.\n\nAnother point: the order of processing edges may affect the outcome, but as long as all constraints are satisfied, it's okay.\n\nNow, the code needs to find all divisors of a number.\n\nImplementing a function to find all divisors of a number:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    if n ==0:\n\n        return []\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) +1):\n\n        if n%i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut for n=0, it's not possible, since the c's are at least 1.\n\nSo, in the code, we can safely use this function.\n\nAnother point: the starting node's value can be any divisor of g. But the order in which we try the divisors may affect the efficiency. For example, trying smaller divisors first may lead to earlier failures, but in practice, it's not important.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys, math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n        if n % i ==0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[ptr])-1\n        ptr +=1\n        v = int(input[ptr])-1\n        ptr +=1\n        g = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        c = g * l\n        adj[u].append( (v, c) )\n        adj[v].append( (u, c) )\n\n    visited = [False]*n\n    values = [-1]*n\n    possible = True\n    res = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            # new component\n            q = deque()\n            q.append(i)\n            visited[i] = True\n            component = []\n            component_edges = []\n            # collect all nodes in component\n            while q:\n                u = q.popleft()\n                component.append(u)\n                component_edges.extend(adj[u])\n                for (v, c) in adj[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        q.append(v)\n            # Now, collect all edges in the component.\n            # But since each edge is stored in both directions, we can filter them.\n            # Alternatively, during BFS, process only edges within the component.\n            # But for now, let's collect all edges where both u and v are in component.\n            comp_edges = []\n            for u in component:\n                for (v, c) in adj[u]:\n                    if v in component:\n                        comp_edges.append( (u, v, c) )\n            # Now, process the component.\n            # Find starting node's edges.\n            start_node = component[0]\n            edge_list = []\n            for (u, v, c) in comp_edges:\n                if u == start_node or v == start_node:\n                    edge_list.append(c)\n            if not edge_list:\n                # Starting node has no edges.

If any component is invalid, the entire problem is invalid.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\n- For each component:\n\n   try all possible x_start values.\n\n   if any leads to a valid assignment, record the values.\n\n   else, set possible=False and break.\n\nSo, in the code, 'res' should be a list of possible assignments for each component.\n\nIf any component is invalid, the entire solution is invalid.\n\nElse, the solution is the combination of all components' assignments.\n\nSo, the code needs to collect the assignments for each component and then combine them into the final output.\n\nThus, the code should have a list called 'components' which holds the values for each component.\n\nEach element in 'components' is a list of values in the order of the component's nodes.\n\nSo, the code should be adjusted as follows:\n\nInitialize components as an empty list.\n\nFor each component:\n\n   try to find a valid assignment.\n\n   if found, append the list of values to components.\n\n   else, set possible=False and break.\n\nAfter processing all components:\n\nif possible:\n\n   output the combined values.\n\nelse:\n\n   output NO.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\ndef solve():\n    # ... previous code ...\n\n    components = []\n    possible = True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            # new component\n            # ... collect component ...\n\n            # process component ...\n            if not possible:\n                break\n            # if valid, append to components\n            components.append(component_values",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to restore the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the given roads and their constraints. Each road provides the GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on the two lawns it connects. We need to ensure that these constraints are satisfied for all edges in the graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where nodes are lawns and edges represent the constraints (GCD and LCM) between them.\n2. **Connected Components**: Split the graph into connected components. Each component can be processed independently.\n3. **Component Processing**: For each component, determine if there exists a valid assignment of mushroom counts that satisfy all constraints.\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to propagate the constraints from a starting node. For each node, compute its value based on the edge constraints and check for consistency.\n5. **Divisors Check**: For the starting node, compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all edge constraints. Try all divisors of this GCD as potential values for the starting node.\n6. **Validation**: Ensure that the constraints are satisfied for all edges in the component during BFS. If any inconsistency is found, the component is invalid.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[ptr]) - 1\n        ptr += 1\n        v = int(input[ptr]) - 1\n        ptr += 1\n        g = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        c = g * l\n        adj[u].append((v, c))\n        adj[v].append((u, c))\n\n    visited = [False] * n\n    components = []\n    possible = True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append(i)\n            visited[i] = True\n            component = []\n            while q:\n                u = q.popleft()\n                component.append(u)\n                for (v, c) in adj[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        q.append(v)\n            comp_edges = []\n            for u in component:\n                for (v, c) in adj[u]:\n                    if v in component:\n                        comp_edges.append((u, v, c))\n            start_node = component[0]\n            edge_list = []\n            for (u, v, c) in comp_edges:\n                if u == start_node or v == start_node:\n                    edge_list.append(c)\n            if not edge_list:\n                x_start = 1\n            else:\n                g = edge_list[0]\n                for c in edge_list[1:]:\n                    g = math.gcd(g, c)\n                divisors = get_divisors(g)\n                x_start_found = False\n                for d in divisors:\n                    possible_x = True\n                    values = {}\n                    values[start_node] = d\n                    q_bfs = deque([start_node])\n                    while q_bfs and possible_x:\n                        u = q_bfs.popleft()\n                        for (v, c) in adj[u]:\n                            if v not in component:\n                                continue\n                            if values.get(v, None) is None:\n                                if c % values[u] != 0:\n                                    possible_x = False\n                                    break\n                                val = c // values[u]\n                                if val <= 0:\n                                    possible_x = False\n                                    break\n                                values[v] = val\n                                q_bfs.append(v)\n                            else:\n                                if values[u] * values[v] != c:\n                                    possible_x = False\n                                    break\n                        if not possible_x:\n                            break\n                    if possible_x:\n                        for u in component:\n                            if u not in values:\n                                possible_x = False\n                                break\n                        if possible_x:\n                            component_values = [values[u] for u in component]\n                            components.append(component_values)\n                            x_start_found = True\n                            break\n                if not x_start_found:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n            if not possible:\n                break\n\n    if not possible:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        output = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            output.append(str(components[i][i]))\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(' '.join(output))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a graph represented by an adjacency list.\n2. **Component Identification**: The graph is traversed to identify all connected components.\n3. **Component Processing**: For each component, the edges are collected, and the possible values for the starting node are determined based on the GCD of edge constraints.\n4. **BFS Propagation**: Using BFS, the values are propagated through the component, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n5. **Validation**: Each component is validated to ensure all edges meet the constraints. If any component fails validation, the solution is marked impossible.\n6. **Output**: If all components are valid, the restored values are printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.",
