    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Gluttony. The task is to construct an array b by permuting the elements of array a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S (with size 1 ≤ k < n), the sum of elements in a at those positions is different from the sum of elements in b at the same positions.\n\nWait, wait. So for every possible subset S (excluding the empty set and the full set), the sum of a's elements in S should differ from the sum of b's elements in S. Hmm.\n\nSo, the key is to find a permutation of a where all these subset sums are unique between a and b. Interesting.\n\nFirst, let's think about what this implies. For each possible non-empty subset S of size 1 to n-1, the sum of a's elements in S must not equal the sum of b's elements in S.\n\nBut how do we ensure that? Because for any such S, if their sums are the same, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the approach is to permute a into b such that this condition holds for all possible subsets S.\n\nHmm, but considering all subsets is computationally heavy, especially since n can be up to 22. Wait, 22 is manageable because the number of subsets is 2^22 - 2 (since we exclude empty and full set). But 2^22 is about 4 million, which is manageable, but perhaps not if we have to check every possible permutation.\n\nWait, but trying all permutations is impossible because for n=22, there are 22! permutations, which is way too big. So brute force is out of the question.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what makes two subsets S and S' have the same sum. If the sum is the same, then the corresponding subset sums in a and b would be equal, leading to failure.\n\nSo our goal is to arrange b such that for any subset S, the sum in a and the sum in b differ.\n\nWait, but for each subset S, the sum in a is fixed, and the sum in b is based on the permutation. So for each S, sum_b(S) must not equal sum_a(S).\n\nSo, how can we arrange b such that for all S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S)?\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's think about the properties of b.\n\nSuppose we arrange b in such a way that the order of elements is such that for any two subsets S and T, their sums in b are unique. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: For each element in a, when we swap it with another position, how does it affect the subset sums?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement of b should make the prefix sums as unique as possible. Because if the prefix sums are all unique, then certain subset sums might also be unique.\n\nWait, the prefix sum idea comes into mind. The prefix sum is the sum of the first k elements. If the prefix sums are all distinct, then any subset sum can be uniquely determined by the difference of two prefix sums. But that's for the case where the subsets are contiguous. However, in this problem, the subsets can be any arbitrary collection of indices.\n\nWait, no. The problem isn't about contiguous subsets but any subsets. So the prefix sum approach might not directly help here.\n\nHmm. So what else can we do?\n\nLet me think about the minimal requirements for b.\n\nFor each single element, say a_i, in b, the element must not be placed in a position where any other element a_j is placed such that a_i = a_j. But wait, the problem states that all elements in a are distinct, so that's not a concern.\n\nWait, the problem says that a has distinct integers, so no duplicates. So that's not an issue.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe we can assign each element of b such that it's in a specific order that ensures that no subset sum in b equals any subset sum in a except for the full set and the empty set.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that for every non-empty subset S (size 1 to n-1), the sum in a and the sum in b are different.\n\nSo for each S, sum_a(S) != sum_b(S).\n\nSo, the sum in b for any subset S must not be equal to the sum in a for that same subset.\n\nSo, for each subset S, sum_b(S) must differ from sum_a(S).\n\nBut how can we arrange b to achieve this?\n\nAn alternative approach: Consider that for any subset S, sum_b(S) = sum_{i in S} b_i.\n\nWe need sum_b(S) != sum_a(S) for all S where 1 <= |S| <=n-1.\n\nSo, the sum of any non-empty proper subset in b must differ from the same subset in a.\n\nWait, maybe if we can arrange b such that the sum of any non-empty proper subset is unique compared to a. Or perhaps even more, that the sum for any subset S in b is unique across all possible S.\n\nBut that's a lot to ask.\n\nWait, perhaps arranging b in a way that the sum for any subset S in b is different from all subset sums in a, including those in a.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because some subsets in a may have the same sum as some in b. So, perhaps the only way is to permute a such that for any subset S in b, its sum is different from the sum of S in a.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother thought: What if the permutation is such that for each element in b, it's placed in a position where it doesn't contribute to any subset sum that was present in a.\n\nBut that's vague.\n\nPerhaps, let's consider small examples.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nn=2, a = [1,2]\n\nPossible permutations of a are [1,2] and [2,1].\n\nCheck for each permutation:\n\nFor [1,2], the subset {0} (sum 1) in a vs in b is same. So this permutation is invalid.\n\nFor [2,1], subset {0} sum is 2 in a, which is different from 2 in b. Wait, wait no. Wait, wait. No, because in the subset {0}, a has 1, and in b, it has 2. So sum_a(S) is 1, sum_b(S) is 2, which are different. Similarly, for subset {1}, a has 2, b has 1, which are different. And for the subset {0,1}, a's sum is 3, b's sum is 3. Oh, but that's the full set, which is excluded. So for the sample, the output is [2,1], which is valid.\n\nSo, in this case, the permutation works because the individual elements are swapped. But the full subset's sum is the same, but it's allowed.\n\nAnother example: n=3, a = [1,2,3].\n\nWe need to permute a such that for all subsets S of size 1 and 2, the sum in a and b are different.\n\nSo let's try to arrange b as [3,1,2].\n\nCompute subset sums:\n\nSize 1:\n- 3: sum in a is 3, sum in b is 3 → same → invalid.\nSo that's no good.\n\nWhat if we arrange as [2,3,1].\n\nSubset sums:\n\nSize 1: 2 vs 2 → same → invalid.\n\nHmm, maybe another permutation. Let's try [3,2,1].\n\nSubsets S of size 1:\n\n3 → sum in a is 3, same as in b. Invalid.\n\nNot working.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each element, the position in b is such that no subset sum in a is equal to any subset sum in b.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the way to achieve this is to have each element in b be as different as possible from the corresponding elements in a.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by ensuring that for every element x in a, in b, x is placed in a position such that the prefix sums differ.\n\nWait, perhaps the prefix sums of b are all different from the prefix sums of a.\n\nBecause if two prefix sums are equal, then the difference would give a subset sum in a that equals a subset sum in b.\n\nWait, that's an interesting thought. Let me think.\n\nSuppose that in a, the prefix sums are s_0=0, s_1=a[0], s_2=a[0]+a[1], etc. Similarly for b. Then, if for any i and j, s_i = s'_j, then the subset from position i+1 to j in a and b would have the same sum. So, if the prefix sums are all unique, then this won't happen.\n\nBut in our problem, it's not just about contiguous subsets but any subsets. So, the prefix sum approach may not directly apply. However, it's worth considering because if the prefix sums are unique, then perhaps the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, suppose that the prefix sums of a and b are all different. Then, for any subset S of a, the sum of S is equal to s_j - s_i, where j is the last index in S plus one, and i is the first index in S. Similarly for b, sum_b(S) = s'_j - s'_i.\n\nIf all the s_j are unique, then for any i < j, s_j - s_i is unique for each pair (i,j). So, in a, all possible subset sums would be unique. Similarly for b.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that for any S, sum_a(S) != sum_b(S). So, if a and b have all their subset sums unique within themselves, but perhaps some subset sum in a could equal a subset sum in b.\n\nWait, but if the prefix sums of a and b are all distinct, then the subset sums for a and b are all unique within their own arrays. So, if the prefix sums of a and b are completely disjoint, then any subset sum from a cannot equal any subset sum from b.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because the subset sums in a and b could still collide. For example, a's subset sum could be equal to b's subset sum but via different prefix sums.\n\nBut if the prefix sums of a and b are all unique and completely disjoint, then this situation cannot happen.\n\nSo, perhaps if the prefix sums of a and b are completely disjoint sets, then the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, the plan is to find a permutation of a such that the prefix sums of the permutation are all distinct and do not overlap with the prefix sums of the original array.\n\nHow can we achieve that?\n\nWell, the prefix sums of the original array a are fixed. So, when we permute a into b, the prefix sums of b must be a rearrangement that doesn't share any value with the prefix sums of a, except for possibly the initial 0.\n\nWait, but the initial prefix sum is 0 for both, right? So, that's okay.\n\nBut for the other prefix sums, they must be unique and not present in the prefix sums of a.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Compute all prefix sums of a.\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of a.\n\n3. For each permutation, compute its prefix sums and check whether any of them (except 0) are present in the prefix sums of a.\n\n4. Also, check that the prefix sums of the permutation are all unique.\n\n5. If such a permutation exists, output it. Otherwise, output -1.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 22, which means 22! permutations. That's way too large to check directly.\n\nSo this approach is computationally infeasible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the prefix sums must be unique and disjoint from a's prefix sums, perhaps we can arrange the permutation such that the prefix sums of b are all larger than any prefix sum of a, or all smaller.\n\nWait, but the prefix sums can vary, so perhaps for each step, we choose the next element in the permutation such that adding it to the current prefix sum doesn't result in a sum that's already in a's prefix sums.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph problem, where each state is a current prefix sum, and each edge represents choosing an element that hasn't been used yet, leading to a new prefix sum.\n\nBut again, for n=22, this could be manageable because each state is a tuple of (current_sum, mask), where mask represents the elements used so far. The mask can be represented with a bitmask, which for 22 bits is manageable (2^22 is about 4 million, which is acceptable).\n\nWait, but the current_sum can be up to 109 * 22 = 2398, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the idea is to perform BFS or DP, trying to build the permutation step by step, ensuring that the new prefix sum doesn't appear in the prefix sums of a, and that all prefix sums in the permutation are unique.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, precompute all the prefix sums of a.\n\nThen, for each possible permutation, we need to build the prefix sums step by step, making sure that none of the new sums (except 0) appear in the a's prefix sums, and that all the new sums are unique.\n\nWe can model this with a dynamic programming approach.\n\nEach state is a bitmask representing the elements used so far and the current sum. We start with sum 0 and an empty set. Then, for each state, we try adding each unused element, checking if the new sum is not present in a's prefix sums, and also that the new sum hasn't been seen before in the permutation's prefix sums.\n\nWait, but the permutation's prefix sums must all be unique. So, as we build the permutation, each new prefix sum must be unique.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the prefix sums of a, including 0.\n\n2. For each possible permutation of a, compute the prefix sums and check if any of them (except 0) are in the a's prefix sums. Also, check that all prefix sums are unique.\n\nBut since n is up to 22, we can't do this exhaustively.\n\nSo, instead, we can model the problem as a state where we've used some elements (represented by a bitmask) and have a current sum. We want to transition to a state where we add an unused element, compute the new sum, and check if it's not in a's prefix sums and hasn't been used before.\n\nSo, the DP approach:\n\n- Initialize a dictionary or a memo table to keep track of visited states (mask, current sum). Each state represents that we've used the elements in 'mask' and have a current sum.\n\n- Start with mask 0 (no elements used) and sum 0.\n\n- For each state, try adding each unused element (i.e., not in mask). For each such element, compute the new sum as current sum + element value.\n\n- Check two conditions:\n\n   a) The new sum is not present in the prefix sums of a (excluding 0, since 0 is allowed once at the beginning).\n\n   b) The new sum hasn't been encountered before in the permutation's prefix sums. But wait, since the permutation's prefix sums are built step by step, each new sum is added to the set of used sums for the current path. So, for a given state, the sum is the total of the elements chosen so far, and as we build the permutation, each new prefix sum must not have been used before in the path.\n\nWait, but the permutation's prefix sums must all be unique. So, in the permutation, each new element added to the permutation must result in a prefix sum that hasn't been seen in the previous steps.\n\nThus, for each state (mask, sum), when we add an element, the new sum must not be present in the a's prefix sums and must not have been used in any previous step of the permutation.\n\nBut wait, the a's prefix sums include all the possible sums of a's subsets. So, any sum that's in a's prefix sums (other than 0) is forbidden.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Precompute the prefix sums of a, including 0. Let's call this list 'prefix_a'.\n\n- For each possible permutation of a, represented by a sequence of elements, compute the prefix sums step by step. For each step, the new sum must not be in prefix_a (except for 0), and all prefix sums must be unique.\n\n- If such a permutation exists, output it. Otherwise, output -1.\n\nBut again, for n=22, this is impossible to do directly.\n\nSo, the alternative is to model this as a graph where each node is a (mask, sum) pair, and edges represent adding a new element. We can use BFS to explore possible states, tracking the elements used and the sum so far.\n\nAdditionally, for each state, we need to track which sums have been used in the permutation's prefix sums.\n\nWait, but for the permutation's prefix sums, all sums must be unique. So, during the BFS, when we add a new element, the new sum must not only avoid being in a's prefix sums but also must not have been seen before in the current path.\n\nHmm, but tracking which sums have been used in the current path is essential. Since each path is a permutation, each step adds a new element and a new sum.\n\nSo, each state in the BFS needs to include:\n\n- mask: the set of elements used so far.\n\n- current_sum: the sum of elements used so far.\n\n- used_sums: a set of sums that have been added so far in the permutation's prefix sums.\n\nBut storing 'used_sums' as part of the state is impractical because it can be very large.\n\nAlternative idea: Since each permutation's prefix sums must be unique, the used_sums can be represented implicitly as the set of all prefix sums along the path. So, during BFS, for each state, we can track the sum and the elements used. When adding a new element, the new sum is computed, and we check:\n\n1. Is the new sum in a's prefix sums (excluding 0)? If yes, skip.\n\n2. Is the new sum already present in the permutation's prefix sums? Since the permutation's prefix sums are being built step by step, the new sum can't have been used before in this path. So, for each state, the current_sum is the sum of the elements used so far. The new sum is current_sum + new_element. We need to ensure that this new sum is not equal to any previous sum in the permutation's prefix sums.\n\nWait, but how do we track that? Because in the state, we have the current_sum, but not the entire history of sums.\n\nAh, right, that's the problem. So, without tracking all previous sums, we can't determine if the new sum is unique.\n\nThis suggests that the state needs to include the set of all previous sums. But that's not feasible because for each step, the number of possible sums can be large.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: Since the permutation's prefix sums must all be unique, perhaps the order in which elements are added to the permutation must be such that each new element's addition doesn't create a duplicate sum. So, for each step, when choosing the next element, we can compute the new sum and ensure it hasn't been seen before in the permutation.\n\nBut again, without knowing the history of sums, this is difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps the following: for the permutation's prefix sums, each sum is unique. So, the order in which elements are added must be such that each new sum is unique.\n\nSo, the process is similar to building a sequence where each new term (sum) is unique and not in a's prefix sums.\n\nSo, the BFS approach can be modified as follows:\n\n- Each state consists of the mask (elements used) and the current sum.\n\n- Additionally, each state keeps track of the set of sums that have been encountered so far in the permutation.\n\nBut again, the set of sums can be large, making the state representation unmanageable.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of tracking the entire set of sums, perhaps we can realize that for each new element added, the new sum must not only avoid a's prefix sums but also must not have been seen before in the permutation.\n\nWait, but the permutation's prefix sums are built step by step. So, for the permutation, the first element contributes to the first prefix sum, the second element contributes to the second, etc. Each new prefix sum must be unique.\n\nSo, for a permutation of length k, the first k prefix sums must be unique among themselves and not present in a's prefix sums (except for 0).\n\nThus, in the BFS approach, each state must track the current sum and the set of prefix sums used so far.\n\nBut for n=22, this is impractical because the number of possible sets of sums is 2^m, where m is the number of possible sums, which can be up to 2398 as mentioned earlier.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum number of possible sums is 2398, which is manageable. So, for each state, the used_sums can be represented as a bitmask of 2398 bits, but that's impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the used_sums as a hash set, but again, for each state, this increases the memory usage.\n\nGiven that n is up to 22, and the number of possible masks is 2^22 ≈4e6, and for each mask, the current sum can be up to 2398, perhaps we can manage with a DP table that for each mask and sum, tracks whether it's been visited.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient, because the used_sums for a mask and sum can vary depending on the order in which elements were added.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: since the permutation's prefix sums must all be unique, for each mask, the sum must be unique across all masks that have the same number of elements. So, for a mask with k elements, the sum must be unique among all masks with k elements.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that for the permutation's prefix sums to be unique, each new sum must not have been seen before in the permutation's history.\n\nThus, the BFS approach can proceed as follows:\n\n- Each state is (mask, current_sum).\n\n- For each state, when adding a new element, compute the new_sum = current_sum + new_element.\n\n- Check two conditions:\n\n   a) new_sum is not in the a's prefix sums (excluding 0).\n\n   b) new_sum is not in the set of sums encountered so far in the permutation's prefix sums.\n\nBut how to track the set of sums encountered so far in the permutation's prefix sums?\n\nSince the permutation's prefix sums are being built step by step, for each state, the current_sum is the sum of the elements in the permutation so far. So, for the state (mask, sum), the set of sums encountered is all the prefix sums up to that point. So, when adding a new element, the new_sum must not be in the current set of sums.\n\nWait, but the current set of sums for a state (mask, sum) is the set {s_1, s_2, ..., s_k}, where s_1, s_2, ..., s_k are the prefix sums so far.\n\nBut in the state, we don't track the individual s_i's, only the current sum s_k.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the used_sums as a set that includes all the prefix sums generated so far.\n\nBut then, for each state, the used_sums can vary, which complicates the state representation.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the permutation's prefix sums must all be unique, perhaps the order in which elements are added can be such that each new element's addition doesn't create a sum that's either present in a's prefix sums or has been used before in the permutation.\n\nBut without knowing the previous sums, this is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be simplified. Suppose that the permutation's prefix sums are all distinct and not present in a's prefix sums (except for 0). Then, the condition is satisfied because any subset sum in a will not match any subset sum in b.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nBecause, for any subset S in a, sum_a(S) is equal to s_j - s_i, where j > i. In b, sum_b(S) is equal to s'_j - s'_i. Since all s'_k are unique and not in a's prefix sums, sum_b(S) cannot be equal to sum_a(S).\n\nWait, not necessarily. Because sum_b(S) could be equal to sum_a(T) for some other subset T in a. So, the condition is that for every subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S). But if the permutation's prefix sums are all unique and not in a's prefix sums, then for any subset S in a, sum_a(S) is in a's prefix sums (since it's the difference of two prefix sums), and sum_b(S) is not in a's prefix sums. So, sum_b(S) can't be equal to sum_a(S). Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, yes, if the permutation's prefix sums are unique and not present in a's prefix sums (except for 0), then the condition is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, our problem reduces to finding a permutation of a such that the prefix sums of the permutation are unique and none of them (except 0) are present in the prefix sums of a.\n\nSo, now the task is to find such a permutation.\n\nNow, how can we find this permutation efficiently?\n\nWe can model this as a graph where each node is a state consisting of:\n\n- A mask representing the elements used so far.\n\n- The current prefix sum.\n\n- A set of used prefix sums so far.\n\nBut as discussed earlier, this is not feasible due to the size.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the used prefix sums must all be unique, perhaps for each step, we can choose an element that, when added, doesn't create a sum that's either in a's prefix sums or has been used before.\n\nBut again, without knowing the previous sums, this is difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps a backtracking approach with pruning can work. For each position in the permutation, try adding each unused element and check if the new sum meets the required conditions.\n\nBut for n=22, this is 22! possibilities, which is way too slow.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nPerhaps, we can sort the elements in a certain way to maximize the chances of finding a valid permutation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a greedy approach can work. For each step, choose the element that leads to the smallest possible new sum, thus reducing the chance of overlapping with a's prefix sums.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Since the prefix sums of a are fixed, perhaps we can represent them in a hash set. Then, for the permutation's prefix sums, each step must add a new sum that's not in this set and hasn't been used before.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Start with sum 0.\n\n- For each step, choose an unused element, add it to the sum, check if the new sum is not in the a's prefix sums and not in the used set. If yes, proceed.\n\nBut how to manage the used set efficiently.\n\nThis sounds like a backtracking problem with pruning.\n\nBut with n=22, even with pruning, it's not feasible unless the pruning is very efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a bitmask dynamic programming problem where each state is (mask, current_sum, used_sums), but again, the used_sums would be too large to track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the used_sums can be represented as a bitmask, but that's not feasible for large sums.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the permutation's prefix sums must be unique and not in a's prefix sums. So, for each step, the new sum must be unique in the permutation and not in a's prefix sums.\n\nThus, for each step, when choosing the next element, the new sum must satisfy:\n\n1. It is not present in a's prefix sums (except 0).\n\n2. It is not present in the permutation's prefix sums so far.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n- Keep track of the elements used so far (mask).\n\n- Keep track of the permutation's prefix sums so far (a set).\n\n- At each step, for each unused element, compute the new sum.\n\n- Check if the new sum is not in a's prefix sums and not in the current permutation's prefix sums.\n\n- If yes, proceed to the next step.\n\nThis is a standard backtracking approach, but for n=22, it's not feasible.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem requires a heuristic-based approach or a way to find a permutation quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is to arrange the permutation such that each new element added makes the prefix sum as unique as possible.\n\nBut without a concrete plan, perhaps we can try to implement a backtracking approach with pruning.\n\nBut considering the time constraints, perhaps n=22 is manageable with some optimizations.\n\nWait, another observation: The number of possible sums for the permutation's prefix sums is up to 2398 (as 109*22=2398). So, for each step, the number of possible sums is limited.\n\nThus, for the permutation's prefix sums, we can represent the used sums as a bitmask of size 2399 (including 0). But 2399 bits is about 300 bytes, which is manageable as a tuple or a frozenset.\n\nBut for each state, combining mask and used_sums, the number of possible states is (2^22) * (2^2399), which is astronomically large.\n\nThus, even with pruning, it's not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the permutation's prefix sums must be unique and not present in a's prefix sums, perhaps we can find a permutation by greedily choosing elements that lead to sums that are not in a's prefix sums.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nSort the elements in a certain order, perhaps in increasing or decreasing order, and then try to build the permutation step by step, ensuring that each new element's addition doesn't create a sum that's in a's prefix sums or has been used before.\n\nBut this is a heuristic and may not always work.\n\nAnother thought: The problem is similar to constructing a superincreasing sequence, where each new element is larger than the sum of all previous elements. This ensures that all subset sums are unique. But in our case, the sum of the elements in the permutation's prefix sums must be unique and not present in a's prefix sums.\n\nWait, perhaps if we arrange the permutation in such a way that each new element is larger than the current sum, then the new sum would be larger than any previous sum. Thus, ensuring that the permutation's prefix sums are strictly increasing, which would make them unique.\n\nBut this depends on the elements available.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, a is [1,2]. Arranged as [2,1], the prefix sums are 2 and 3. These are unique and not in a's prefix sums (which are 0,1,3).\n\nWait, a's prefix sums are 0,1,3. The permutation's prefix sums are 2,3. So, 2 is not in a's prefix sums, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1,2,3]. Suppose we arrange as [3,1,2]. Prefix sums are 3,4,6. Are these not in a's prefix sums? a's prefix sums are 0,1,3,6. So, 3 and 6 are present. Thus, this permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, this approach would fail.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to implement a backtracking solution that tries to build the permutation step by step, ensuring that each new element's addition doesn't create a sum that's in a's prefix sums or has been used before.\n\nBut for n=22, this would be very slow.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the problem requires that all non-empty proper subsets have different sums in a and b, perhaps the key is to find a permutation where the sum of any two elements is unique. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to ensuring that the multiset of subset sums in a and b are completely disjoint.\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's precompute all the subset sums of a. Then, for the permutation, the subset sums of b must be entirely outside of this set.\n\nBut the number of subset sums can be very large (for n=22, it's 2^22 - 2 = about 4 million), which makes this approach difficult.\n\nBut perhaps, for each permutation, we can check if any of the subset sums of a and b collide. But again, for n=22, this is impossible.\n\nThus, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by arranging the permutation such that the prefix sums are all unique and not in a's prefix sums.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sums of a, store them in a set called 'bad_sums', excluding 0.\n\n2. For each possible permutation of a, compute the prefix sums step by step, ensuring that each new sum is not in 'bad_sums' and is unique in the permutation's prefix sums.\n\n3. The first permutation found is the answer.\n\nBut again, for n=22, this is not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to find a permutation whose prefix sums form a sequence that is a subset of the complement of 'bad_sums' and is strictly increasing.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the permutation's prefix sums must form a strictly increasing sequence, which ensures uniqueness.\n\nBut this isn't necessarily true because the sum can increase in any way as long as each new sum is unique.\n\nBut perhaps, starting with the largest element and proceeding with the next largest element that can be added without causing a sum in 'bad_sums' or a duplicate.\n\nBut again, this is a heuristic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using memoization and backtracking with pruning.\n\nBut with n=22, this is challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: The condition requires that for any subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nWhich is equivalent to saying that the sum of any non-empty proper subset of b is not equal to the sum of any non-empty proper subset of a.\n\nThus, the sum of any non-empty proper subset in b must be unique and not present in a's subset sums.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a permutation where the subset sums of b are entirely disjoint from the subset sums of a.\n\nBut this is a much stronger condition than the prefix sum approach.\n\nSo, perhaps the prefix sum approach is insufficient, but the problem requires a stronger condition.\n\nThus, perhaps the approach is to find a permutation where the subset sums of b are entirely disjoint from the subset sums of a.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the prefix sum approach and implement a backtracking solution that tries to build the permutation step by step, checking the conditions.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nImplement a recursive backtracking function that builds the permutation step by step.\n\nAt each step, try adding each unused element, compute the new prefix sum, check if it's not in a's prefix sums (excluding 0) and hasn't been used before in the permutation's prefix sums.\n\nIf such an element is found, proceed to the next step.\n\nOnce the permutation is complete, return it as the solution.\n\nIf no such permutation is found after trying all possibilities, return -1.\n\nBut for n=22, this is impractical.\n\nThus, perhaps we need to find a heuristic to order the elements in a way that increases the likelihood of finding a valid permutation early.\n\nFor example, try to place elements in the order of largest to smallest, or sorted in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, we can memoize the states and avoid revisiting the same state multiple times.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with writing a backtracking solution with pruning and see if it's efficient enough for small n.\n\nIn code, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n and the array a.\n\n2. Compute the prefix sums of a, including 0. Store them in a set called 'prefix_a'.\n\n3. Sort the elements of a in a certain order (perhaps descending) to try and find a valid permutation quickly.\n\n4. Perform a backtracking search:\n\n   a. Try each possible permutation, building it step by step.\n\n   b. For each step, choose an unused element, compute the new sum.\n\n   c. Check if the new sum is not in 'prefix_a' (excluding 0).\n\n   d. Check if the new sum hasn't been used before in the permutation's prefix sums.\n\n   e. If all conditions are met, proceed to the next step.\n\n   f. If a complete permutation is found, output it.\n\n5. If no permutation is found, output -1.\n\nBut for n=22, this approach is not feasible.\n\nThus, perhaps we can find a way to represent the used sums more efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: Since the permutation's prefix sums must be unique, perhaps for each step, the new sum must be greater than any previous sum. This way, the new sum is automatically unique and not in 'prefix_a' if 'prefix_a' is sorted.\n\nBut this depends on the elements.\n\nWait, for example, if a is [1,2], the permutation [2,1] has prefix sums 2 and 3, which are both not in a's prefix sums [0,1,3].\n\nBut in this case, 3 is in a's prefix sums. So, the approach would fail.\n\nThus, this idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another observation: The problem requires that for every non-empty subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S). So, for the permutation, the sum of any subset S must not be equal to the sum of the same subset in a.\n\nThus, the sum of any subset in b must be different from the sum of any subset in a, except when the subset is the full set.\n\nThus, the sum of any non-empty proper subset in b must not be present in a's subset sums.\n\nThus, the",
