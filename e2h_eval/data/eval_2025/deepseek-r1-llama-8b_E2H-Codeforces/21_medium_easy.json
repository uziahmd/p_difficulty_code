The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a way that a_i + b_j is odd. So, for a key j and chest i, if one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd.\n\nHmm, wait, because adding two evens gives even, two odds give even too. Only even and odd sums are odd. So, the condition a_i + b_j ≡ 1 mod 2 means that one must be even and the other odd.\n\nSo, for each key, it can only unlock chests of the opposite parity. That is, a key with an even number can only unlock chests with odd numbers, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the first thing I think is that we need to count how many even and odd keys there are, and similarly for the chests.\n\nWait, no. Because the keys determine which chests they can open. So, for example, if a key is even (b_j is even), then it can only be used on chests where a_i is odd. Similarly, an odd key can only be used on even a_i.\n\nSo, the approach is to:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i (chest numbers).\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j (key numbers).\n3. Then, decide how to match them optimally.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once.\n\nLet me think: the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between the total possible based on the keys and the available chests.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i.\n- Similarly, separate the keys into even and odd.\n- Then, for the even a_i group, use as many even keys as possible. But wait, no: even a_i can be unlocked by odd keys, and odd a_i can be unlocked by even keys.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nFor a key j:\n- If b_j is even, then it can only unlock a_i that are odd.\n- If b_j is odd, it can only unlock a_i that are even.\n\nSo, the number of possible matches is the sum of:\n- min(number of even keys, number of odd a_i)\nplus\n- min(number of odd keys, number of even a_i)\n\nWait, is that correct? Because each even key can only be used on odd a_i, and each odd key can be used on even a_i.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of the two minima.\n\nYes! That makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i (let's call them even_chest and odd_chest).\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j (even_key and odd_key).\n3. The maximum chests we can open is min(even_key, odd_chest) + min(odd_key, even_chest).\n\nThat's the formula.\n\nWait, but why? Because each even key can be used to open an odd chest. So the number of such uses is the minimum of even keys and the number of odd chests. Similarly, each odd key can be used to open an even chest, so the min of odd keys and even chests. Summing these gives the total possible.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, now, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the list a and list b.\n- For a, count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- For b, count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- Compute the sum of min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a).\n- Output that sum.\n\nWait, but what about cases where after choosing some keys, others may not be used. Like, suppose you have more even keys than odd chests. Then, you can't use all even keys, since each key can only be used once.\n\nBut the min function takes care of that because min(even_b, odd_a) will take the smaller of the two, ensuring that no more keys are used than the chests they can unlock.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\nCount even chests: 14,6,2 → 3 even chests. Odd chests: 9,11 → 2.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20] → even keys: 8,4,20 → 3. Odd key:7 →1.\n\nSo, min(3, 2) is 2 → from even keys to odd chests.\nmin(1,3) is 1 → from odd keys to even chests.\nTotal: 3, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even. So even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\nb has 5 → odd. So even_key=0, odd_key=1.\n\nSo, min(even_key, odd_chest) is min(0,0)=0.\nmin(odd_key, even_chest)= min(1,5)=1.\nTotal 1. Which matches.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=1, m=4\na = [10] → even_chest=1, odd_chest=0.\nb = [20,30,40,50] → all even. So even_key=4, odd_key=0.\n\nSo, min(4,0)=0, min(0,1)=0. Total 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, this logic seems to work.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nSteps:\n\nRead n, m from input.\n\nRead a as a list of integers.\n\nRead b as a list of integers.\n\nCount even_chest = number of elements in a that are even.\n\nodd_chest = n - even_chest.\n\nSimilarly, even_key = number of elements in b even.\n\nodd_key = m - even_key.\n\nCompute total = min(even_key, odd_chest) + min(odd_key, even_chest).\n\nPrint total as a string.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that the keys are used on chests. So, each key can be used at most once, and each chest once.\n\nBut according to our approach, the min ensures that no more than the available keys or chests are used.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nIn Python, reading the inputs:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, count even in a:\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x %2 ==0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\ntotal = min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the examples should give the correct outputs.\n\nAnother test case: say n=3, m=3.\n\na: [1,3,5] → all odd → even_a=0, odd_a=3.\n\nb: [2,4,6] → even_b=3, odd_b=0.\n\nThen, min(even_b=3, odd_a=3) →3.\n\nmin(odd_b=0, even_a=0) →0.\n\nTotal 3. So all 3 chests can be opened.\n\nAnother test case: a has 1 even and 2 odds.\n\nb has 2 evens and 1 odd.\n\nSo, even_b=2, odd_b=1.\n\neven_a=1, odd_a=2.\n\nmin(2,2)=2.\n\nmin(1,1)=1.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can only unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: First, we count the number of even and odd numbers in both the chests and the keys.\n2. **Match Keys to Chests**: For each key, it can only unlock a chest of the opposite parity (even key unlocks an odd chest and vice versa). We use two minima to determine how many chests can be unlocked:\n   - The number of even keys that can unlock odd chests.\n   - The number of odd keys that can unlock even chests.\n3. **Sum the Results**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the two minima calculated above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\ntotal = min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of chests `n` and keys `m`, followed by the lists of numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: We count how many of the chest numbers are even and how many are odd. Similarly, we count the even and odd keys.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Chests**: Using the counts from the previous step, we compute the maximum number of chests that can be opened by considering the minimum of the number of even keys and odd chests, and the minimum of the number of odd keys and even chests.\n4. **Output Result**: Finally, we print the total number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests Neko can open by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.",
