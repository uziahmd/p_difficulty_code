The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the loser gets a red spot. I need to calculate how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm, the key here is to figure out for each round whether Nikephoros loses or wins, and similarly for Polycarpus. Then, count the losses for each.\n\nWait, but both players are following a cyclic strategy. So their moves aren't random; they follow their own sequences A and B, cycling through them repeatedly.\n\nLet me think: For each round i (from 1 to n), I need to determine what move each player makes. Then, based on that, decide who loses.\n\nSo for round i, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], since his sequence repeats every m moves. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k].\n\nOnce I know both their moves, I can determine the outcome. If they choose the same, it's a draw—no one gets a spot. Otherwise, the one whose move beats the other loses.\n\nWait, no. Wait: In the rules, the winner is determined by the items. So if A's move beats B's, then A is the winner, and B is the loser. So B gets a spot. If B's move beats A's, then B is the winner, A is the loser. So we need to compute for each round whether A's move beats B's, or vice versa.\n\nSo for each round, I'll do the following steps:\n\n1. Determine what each player chose: A's move is A[(i) % m], B's move is B[(i) % k]. Because the first round is i=0 or i=1? Wait, let's check the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input says that for 7 rounds, the sequence for A is 'RPS' which is 3 characters. So for i from 0 to 6, the moves would be A[0], A[1], A[2], A[0], A[1], A[2], A[0]. So yes, zero-based index for the sequence.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says \"cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one.\" So the first move is A[0], then A[1], up to A[m-1], then back to A[0], etc.\n\nSo for round 1, the index is 0. Round 2 is index 1, etc. So for each round i (starting from 0 to n-1), the index is i mod m for A and i mod k for B.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first round is R vs R, which is a draw. So the second line of the sample shows that the first round is a draw, so no red spots. But according to the problem statement, the first round is when they play, so it's the first move of each.\n\nSo for each round, the move for A is the (current step) mod the length of A, and similarly for B.\n\nSo, for each round, i starts at 0, then 1, ..., n-1. For each i, get a_move = A[i % len(A)], b_move = B[i % len(B)].\n\nThen, determine if a_move beats b_move. If yes, then B (Polycarpus) gets a point, else if b_move beats a_move, A (Nikephoros) gets a point.\n\nWait, no: because if a_move beats b_move, then the winner is A, so B (the loser) gets a spot. So for each round, if A's move wins, B gets +1. Else if B's move wins, A gets +1. Else, no change.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate for each round from 0 to n-1.\n- For each round, get a_move and b_move as above.\n- Compare the two moves to see who wins.\n- Update the counters accordingly.\n\nNow, the challenge is to efficiently compute this for large n (up to 2e5). Since n can be up to 2e5, and each iteration is O(1), this should be manageable.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the lengths of A and B. Each can be up to 1000, so for each round, the modulo operations are O(1).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read string A and string B.\n\n3. Initialize two counters: a_red and b_red, both starting at 0.\n\n4. For i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   a. a_char = A[i % len_A]\n\n  ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors rounds. Each player follows a cyclic strategy, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - The game is played between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who each follow a cyclic sequence of moves.\n   - In each round, the winner is determined by the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. If the same move is chosen by both, it results in a draw with no red spots.\n   - We need to count the number of times each player loses a round, as that will give us the number of red spots each accumulates.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - For each round, determine the move of both players based on their respective cyclic sequences.\n   - Check if one move beats the other according to the game rules.\n   - Update the red spot counters based on who loses each round.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values for the number of rounds, and the sequences of moves for both players.\n   - Initialize counters for the red spots of both players.\n   - For each round, determine the current move of both players using modulo operations to cycle through their sequences.\n   - Compare the moves to determine the winner and update the counters accordingly.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves iterating through each round exactly once, making the time complexity O(n), where n is the number of rounds. Given the constraints (n up to 200,000), this approach is efficient and feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nlen_A = len(A)\nlen_B = len(B)\n\na_red = 0\nb_red = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % len_A]\n    b_move = B[i % len_B]\n    \n    if a_move == b_move:\n        continue\n    \n    # Determine who loses\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n        # A wins, B loses\n        b_red += 1\n    else:\n        # B wins, A loses\n        a_red += 1\n\nprint(a_red, b_red)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds and the sequences of moves for both players.\n- **Initialization**: Counters for red spots are initialized to zero.\n- **Loop Through Rounds**: For each round, the current move of each player is determined using modulo operations to cycle through their sequences.\n- **Determine Winner**: The moves are compared to see who wins based on Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. The loser's counter is incremented accordingly.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all rounds, the counters for red spots are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
