The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and also clockwise. So, moving from house i can only go to i+1 (mod n, but since it's a ring, it wraps around after n). \n\nXenia starts at house 1. She has m tasks. For the i-th task, she needs to be at ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So, she must process each task in order, right? Because for each task i, she must have done all j < i already. So the tasks are processed in the order they are given.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that. Oh, perhaps it's that for each task, when she is doing task i, she must have already completed tasks 1 to i-1. So the processing order is sequential, and she can't skip any.\n\nSo, the main idea is to find the minimal time to do all tasks in the correct order, starting from 1. Each move between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nThe goal is to calculate the minimum time required.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nEach task is a point in the ring. But since she must process them in order, the position where she ends the i-th task will affect the next steps.\n\nHmm, maybe the approach is to keep track of the current position, and for each step, determine the earliest possible way to reach the next task.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a series of moves between the required positions.\n\nWait, let's consider an example:\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3\n\nTasks are 3,2,3.\n\nShe starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. So she needs to get to 3 from 1. Since the ring is 1→2→3→4→1, the shortest path is 1→2→3, which is 2 steps. So she arrives at 3 at time 2.\n\nBut then, the second task is 2. Now, she has to go from 3 to 2. But wait, the ring is one way, so she can't go back. So she has to go the other way around the ring. From 3, she can go to 4, then to 1, then to 2. That's 3 steps, taking time 2+3=5 so far.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total time is cumulative. So after the first task, she's at 3 at time 2. Then, she has to go to 2. But the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So from 3, she can only go to 4, then 1, then 2. So that's 3 steps, adding 3 to the time. So after the second task, time is 5.\n\nThen the third task is 3 again. She is currently at 2. She needs to go to 3. Again, from 2, she can only go to 3, which is one step. So total time is 5 +1=6.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is to process each task in order, and for each, calculate the minimal steps needed to reach the next task from the current position.\n\nSo the key idea is to model the movement from the current position to the next task's position, considering the ring structure.\n\nBut how do we compute the minimal steps between two points on the ring?\n\nWell, the ring has n houses. Moving clockwise, the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod n. But since movement is only allowed clockwise, sometimes it's shorter to go the other way if you wrap around.\n\nWait, no. Because movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So the only way to get from a to b is to go along the clockwise path, possibly wrapping around.\n\nWait, wait. If the ring is arranged as 1 → 2 → ... → n → 1, then the movement is strictly in the clockwise direction. So from a house a, the next is a+1, and so on, modulo n.\n\nSo, the distance from a to b in clockwise direction is (b - a) mod n. But if that's larger than n/2, it's better to go the other way around. Wait no, because movement is only allowed in one direction.\n\nWait, no. Because the traffic is one way and clockwise. So once you leave a house, you can't go back. So, for example, from 3, you can't go back to 2.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks while moving along a ring of houses in a strictly clockwise direction. Each movement between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement Constraints**: The ring is arranged such that each house points to the next house in a clockwise direction. Thus, Xenia can only move from house `i` to house `i+1` (modulo n) and cannot move back.\n2. **Task Completion Order**: Xenia must complete each task in the given order. For each task, she must be at the specified house and have already completed all previous tasks.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each task, calculate the shortest path from her current position to the target house considering the ring structure. Since she can only move clockwise, the distance from `a` to `b` is `(b - a) % n`.\n4. **Cumulative Time Calculation**: Track the cumulative time taken to reach each target house from the starting point, considering the movement constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    a = tasks[i]\n    # Calculate the steps needed to go from current_pos to a\n    # Since movement is only clockwise, the distance is (a - current_pos) % n\n    steps = (a - current_pos) % n\n    total_time += steps\n    current_pos = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with zero time accumulated.\n2. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, determine the shortest clockwise path from the current position to the target house.\n3. **Update Position and Time**: Move to the target house, update the current position, and add the number of steps taken to the total time.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia completes each task in the minimal possible time while adhering to the movement constraints of the ring road.",
