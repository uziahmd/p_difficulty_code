    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on their sides. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides x, y, z. The conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, it's required that x, y, z form a non-degenerate triangle, which means x + y > z must hold because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since z is the largest here (because C ≤ z ≤ D and C ≥ B), the condition simplifies to x + y > z.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Because x can be up to B, y can be up to C, but z starts at C and goes up to D. So in all cases, z is at least as big as y and x. So for the triangle inequality, the only necessary condition is x + y > z. Because if z is larger than or equal to y, then x + z will definitely be larger than y, and y + z is larger than x. So the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo, the approach is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) where x is between A and B, y is between B and C, z is between C and D, and x + y > z.\n\nBut considering the ranges, especially when B, C, D are large, like up to 5e5, iterating through each possible x, y, z would be too slow. So I need an efficient way to calculate this without brute-forcing all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's fix x and y. Then for each such pair (x, y), I need to find the number of z's that are >= C and <= min(D, x + y - 1). Because z must satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. So for a given x and y, the valid z's are from max(C, ...) to min(D, x+y-1).\n\nWait, but z can't be less than C. So the lower bound is C, upper bound is the minimum of D and x+y-1. But wait, x + y - 1 could be less than C. In that case, there are no valid z's for that (x, y) pair.\n\nSo the number of z's for a particular (x, y) is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nSo the total number of valid triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C.\n\nBut again, with x up to 5e5 and y up to 5e5, this is O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) operations, which can be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the variables. Maybe we can precompute some things or find mathematical expressions that can calculate the sum quickly.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem. We need to compute the sum for x in [A, B], y in [y_min, y_max], where y_min is B and y_max is C. For each x and y, if x + y > C, then the number of z's is the number of integers z between C and min(D, x+y-1), inclusive.\n\nWait, wait: z can be as high as D. So the upper limit is min(D, x + y - 1). But if x + y - 1 < C, then no z's are valid. Otherwise, it's the count from C to min(D, x+y-1).\n\nSo for a fixed x, what's the range of y that contributes to the sum?\n\nWe can express the condition for y as: y > C - x.\n\nBut y also must be ≥ B and ≤ C.\n\nSo for a given x, the valid y's are those where y > max(B, C - x). Because y has to be at least B, and also y needs to be larger than C - x to make x + y > C.\n\nWait, because if y > C - x, then x + y > C.\n\nSo, for each x, the minimal y is max(B, (C - x) + 1). Because y has to be at least B, and also y must be greater than C - x.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If x + y > C, then y > C - x. Since y is an integer, the minimal y is floor(C - x) + 1.\n\nSo for a given x, the minimal y is max(B, (C - x) + 1). But y can't exceed C either.\n\nSo if max(B, (C - x) + 1) > C, then for this x, there are no y's that satisfy the condition. Otherwise, the y's start from that minimal value up to C.\n\nSo, for each x, the number of valid y's is:\n\nif (max(B, C - x + 1)) > C: 0\nelse:\n   count_y = C - max(B, C - x + 1) + 1\n\nWait, but perhaps I should model it as:\n\nlower_y = max(B, C - x + 1)\nif lower_y > C:\n   count_y = 0\nelse:\n   count_y = C - lower_y + 1\n\nBut even this might not be efficient enough because for each x, calculating this would take O(1) time, but with x up to 5e5, it's manageable.\n\nBut then for each such y, I have to calculate the number of z's, which varies per (x, y).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find for each x the possible y's and then, for each x, find the sum over y of (number of z's for that y).\n\nBut even that could be expensive, but perhaps with some mathematical optimizations.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find a way to express the total sum in terms of x and y, and find a way to compute it with some mathematical formula instead of iterating through each (x, y) pair.\n\nLet me think about the variables.\n\nFor each x, the minimal y is Y_min(x) = max(B, C - x + 1). The maximal y is C.\n\nIf Y_min(x) > C, then no y's for this x contribute to the sum.\n\nOtherwise, for each y in [Y_min(x), C], the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nWait, because z must be ≥ C and ≤ min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nSo the count is:\n\nz_count = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C else 0.\n\nBut since we already have y ≥ Y_min(x) which ensures x + y > C, so the condition is always satisfied.\n\nSo for each y in [Y_min(x), C], z_count is min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1.\n\nSo for a fixed x, the total contribution is the sum over y from Y_min(x) to C of (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nHmm. Let's denote this sum as S(x). So our total answer is sum_{x=A}^B S(x).\n\nThe question now is: how to compute S(x) efficiently for each x.\n\nLet me consider that for each x, the function inside the sum is f(y) = min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nf(y) = min(D, x + y - 1) - (C - 1)\n\nSo, f(y) is the number of integers z that are >= C, <= x + y - 1, and <= D.\n\nNow, for each y, the value depends on whether x + y - 1 is <= D or not.\n\nSo, let's split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: x + y - 1 <= D.\n\nThen, f(y) = (x + y - 1) - C + 1 = x + y - C.\n\nCase 2: x + y - 1 > D.\n\nThen, f(y) = D - C + 1.\n\nBut when does this happen? It happens when x + y - 1 > D → y > D - x + 1.\n\nSo, for each y, we can determine which case it falls into.\n\nSo, for a fixed x, the sum S(x) can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. y's where y <= (D - x + 1): here, f(y) = x + y - C.\n\n2. y's where y > (D - x + 1): here, f(y) = D - C + 1.\n\nWait, but wait: when y > (D - x + 1), then x + y -1 > D. So f(y) is D - C + 1.\n\nBut the maximum y is C. So we need to see whether (D - x + 1) is less than C or not.\n\nLet me define k = D - x + 1.\n\nIf k >= C, then all y's from Y_min(x) to C fall into case 1 or case 2 depending on whether y <= k.\n\nWait, no. Let's think:\n\nFor a fixed x, and varying y:\n\nIf y <= k → x + y -1 <= D → f(y) = x + y - C.\n\nIf y > k → x + y -1 > D → f(y) = D - C + 1.\n\nBut since y can only go up to C, the threshold y =k may lie within or beyond the range of y.\n\nSo, for each x, the sum S(x) can be computed as follows:\n\nCompute the y_low = Y_min(x) = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nCompute the point where y crosses from case 1 to case 2: y = k = D - x + 1.\n\nBut y cannot exceed C, so:\n\nThe cutoff is min(k, C).\n\nSo, for y in [y_low, cutoff), case 1 applies.\n\nFor y in [cutoff, C], case 2 applies.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me clarify:\n\nIf k < y_low: then all y >= y_low are > k, so all fall into case 2.\n\nIf y_low <= k < C: then y ranges from y_low to k are case 1, and y from k+1 to C are case 2.\n\nIf k >= C: all y's are <= k, so all are case 1.\n\nSo, for each x, we need to find the range of y's and compute the sum accordingly.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each x in [A, B]:\n\n   Compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   if y_low > C: continue (no contribution from this x)\n\n   Compute k = D - x + 1\n\n   if k < y_low: \n\n      then all y in [y_low, C] are in case 2.\n\n      sum += (C - y_low + 1) * (D - C + 1)\n\n   elif k >= C:\n\n      then all y in [y_low, C] are in case 1.\n\n      sum += sum_{y=y_low}^{C} (x + y - C)\n\n   else:\n\n      split into two parts:\n\n      part1: y from y_low to k → case 1.\n\n      part2: y from k+1 to C → case 2.\n\n      compute sum for part1 and part2.\n\nSo, how do we compute each part?\n\nLet's handle each scenario:\n\nCase A: All y >= y_low are > k.\n\nIn this case, the number of y's is C - y_low + 1. Each contributes (D - C + 1) to the sum. So sum += (C - y_low +1) * (D - C +1).\n\nCase B: All y are <=k. So each y contributes (x + y - C). Sum from y = y_low to C of (x + y - C) = sum_{d= (x + y_low - C)}^{x + C - C} d → sum of consecutive integers.\n\nWait, x + y - C = (y) + (x - C). So for each y in [y_low, C], the term is (y) + (x - C). So the sum becomes:\n\nsum_{y = a}^{b} (y + c) = sum y + sum c.\n\nWhere a = y_low, b = C, c = x - C.\n\nSum of y is (a + b)(b - a + 1)/2.\n\nSum of c is (b - a + 1)*c.\n\nSo overall sum is (a + b)(b - a + 1)/2 + (b - a +1)*c.\n\nWhich can be written as (b - a + 1) * ( (a + b)/2 + c )\n\nIn code, that's manageable.\n\nCase C: Some y's are in case 1 and others in case 2.\n\nSo, part1 is from y_low to k, case 1.\n\npart2 is from k+1 to C, case 2.\n\nCompute both parts.\n\nSo, for part1:\n\nsum_part1 = sum_{y = y_low}^{k} (x + y - C) → same as case B, but up to k.\n\nSimilarly, sum_part2 = (C - k) * (D - C + 1), since for each y in k+1 to C, the term is (D - C + 1).\n\nSo, putting this together, for each x, we can compute the sum S(x) efficiently.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this correctly and efficiently, handling all edge cases.\n\nBut even with this approach, for each x, we have O(1) operations, so overall it's O(B - A + 1) operations, which for B up to 5e5 is acceptable.\n\nSo, the next step is to code this logic.\n\nBut before writing code, I need to handle all possible edge cases.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios:\n\n1. When x is very small, so C - x +1 is larger than C. Then y_low is C+1, which is larger than C, so no contribution.\n\nFor example, if x=1, C=3, then C-x+1=3, so y_low is max(B, 3). If B is 2, then y_low is 3, which is <= C=3. So that's okay.\n\nWait, no: if x is 1, C is 3, then y_low is max(B, 3-1+1) = max(B,3). Suppose B is 2: y_low is 3, which is <= C=3. So valid.\n\nBut if x is 4, C is 3, then C -x +1= 0 → y_low is max(B, 0). So for B=2, y_low is 2.\n\nWait, but in this case, x is 4, y starts at 2, which is within B to C.\n\nBut wait, in this case, x is 4, y is 2, but x + y =6> C=3, so it's valid.\n\nSo, for x > C, y can be as low as B.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C. So x can't be larger than B, because x is up to B.\n\nAh right! So x is in [A, B], and y is in [B, C]. So x can't exceed B.\n\nSo, for x in [A, B], which is up to 5e5, but B can be up to 5e5.\n\nSo, for x in [A, B], and y in [B, C].\n\nSo, when x is in [A, B], and C is >= B.\n\nSo, when x is in [A, B], C -x can be as low as C - B. Since C >= B, C - B >=0.\n\nSo, for x in [A, B], y_low is max(B, C -x +1).\n\nWait, for x in [A, B], C -x can be >=0.\n\nSo, for example, when x is 1, C is 3: C-x+1=3.\n\nWhen x is B, which is say 2, and C is 3: C-x+1=2.\n\nSo, in that case, y_low is max(2,2)=2.\n\nSo, in code, for each x in [A, B], we compute y_low.\n\nBut, in some cases, y_low can be larger than C, leading to no contribution.\n\nSo, the first step is to loop x from A to B.\n\nFor each x:\n\nCompute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\nif y_low > C → no contribution, continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute k = D -x +1\n\nif k < y_low → all y >= y_low are >k → case A.\n\nElse if k >= C → all y in [y_low, C] are <=k → case B.\n\nElse → case C.\n\nCompute the sum accordingly.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in all cases, the sums are computed correctly.\n\nNow, the other thing to consider is the computation of the sum for case B and case C.\n\nLet me formalize each part.\n\nCase A: all y in [y_low, C] are >k → each contributes (D - C +1) to S(x).\n\nNumber of y's is (C - y_low +1).\n\nSo, sum_part = (C - y_low +1) * (D - C +1).\n\nCase B: all y in [y_low, C] are <=k → each contributes (x + y - C).\n\nThe sum is sum_{y = y_low}^C (x + y - C).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as sum_{y=y_low}^C (y + (x - C)).\n\nWhich is sum(y) + (x - C) * (C - y_low +1).\n\nSum(y) is (y_low + C) * (C - y_low +1)/2.\n\nSo sum_part = (y_low + C) * (C - y_low +1)/2 + (x - C) * (C - y_low +1).\n\nCase C: y runs from y_low to k in case 1, and from k+1 to C in case 2.\n\nCompute sum_part1 = sum_{y=y_low}^k (x + y - C) → same as case B, but upper limit is k.\n\nsum_part1 = ((y_low + k) * (k - y_low +1) / 2) + (x - C) * (k - y_low +1).\n\nsum_part2 = (C - k) * (D - C + 1).\n\nSo, S(x) = sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when k > C, which would be case B.\n\nWait, no. Because k = D -x +1.\n\nIf D -x +1 >= C → then for y=C, x + y -1 = x + C -1. Since x <= B <= C, x + C -1 <= B + C -1. But D can be up to 5e5, so it's possible that k is larger than C.\n\nIn that case, all y's are in case 1.\n\nSo, in code, for each x:\n\nCompute y_low.\n\nif y_low > C: continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute k = D -x +1\n\nif k < y_low:\n\n   all y >= y_low are >k → case A.\n\nelif k >= C:\n\n   all y are <=k → case B.\n\nelse:\n\n   case C.\n\nSo, the code structure is clear.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet me compute S(x) for x=1, 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 -1 +1) = max(2,3) → 3.\n\nBut y can't exceed 3, so y_low=3.\n\nk =4 -1 +1=4.\n\nCheck if k >=C=3 → yes.\n\nSo, case B.\n\nsum_part = sum from y=3 to 3 of (1 + y -3) → y=3: 1+3-3=1.\n\nSo sum_part is 1.\n\nSo S(x=1) is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-2+1=2) → 2.\n\nk=4-2+1=3.\n\nIs k >=C=3? Yes.\n\nSo case B.\n\nsum from y=2 to 3 of (2 + y -3) → for y=2: 2+2-3=1; y=3: 2+3-3=2.\n\nSum is 1+2=3.\n\nS(x=2) is 3.\n\nx=1 and x=2 contribute 1+3=4, which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 2 2 5 → Output 3.\n\nLet me compute x=1, 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2-1+1=2) → 2.\n\nk=5-1+1=5.\n\nSince y can only be up to 2.\n\nk >=C=2 → case B.\n\nsum from y=2 to 2: 1 + 2 - 2 =1.\n\nSo S(x=1) is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2-2+1=1) → 2.\n\nk=5-2+1=4.\n\ny can be 2.\n\nsince k >=C=2.\n\nsum is (2 + 2 -2) → 2.\n\nSo S(x=2) is 2.\n\nTotal is 1+2=3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample:\n\n500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nSo x can only be 500000.\n\ny_low = max(500000, 500000 -500000 +1=1) → 500000.\n\nk=500000 -500000 +1=1.\n\nBut y has to be >=500000, so y_low=500000.\n\nk=1 < y_low=500000 → case A.\n\nSo, number of y's is 500000 -500000 +1=1.\n\nEach contributes (500000 -500000 +1)=1.\n\nSo sum is 1*1=1.\n\nThus, output is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic works for the samples.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1:\n\nA=B=C=D=1.\n\nThen x=1, y=1, z=1.\n\nx+y =2>1 → valid.\n\nSo the count is 1.\n\nAnother Edge Case:\n\nA=1, B=1, C=2, D=2.\n\nPossible x=1, y=2.\n\nx + y =3>2 → z can be 2.\n\nSo count is 1.\n\nAnother Edge Case:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=5.\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-1+1=3) → 3.\n\nBut y can't exceed 3. So y=3.\n\nk=5-1+1=5.\n\ncase B: sum is (3+3-3)=3.\n\nSo S(x=1) =3.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(2,3-2+1=2) → 2.\n\nk=5-2+1=4.\n\nsince C=3 <4.\n\nSo case C.\n\nsum_part1: y from 2 to3.\n\nfor y=2: 2+2-3=1.\n\ny=3: 2+3-3=2.\n\nsum_part1=1+2=3.\n\nsum_part2: y=4 to 3 → no, since C=3. So no part2.\n\nso sum_part2=0.\n\ntotal S(x=2)=3+0=3.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, k is 4, which is >= C=3.\n\nWait, no, wait: k=4 >= C=3 → so case B.\n\nWait, in x=2:\n\ny_low is 2.\n\nk=4.\n\nsince C=3 <4 → so all y in [2,3] are <=k=4.\n\nSo case B.\n\nSo sum is sum from y=2 to3 of (2 + y -3) → y=2: 1, y=3:2. Sum is 3.\n\nSo S(x=2)=3.\n\nTotal sum is 3+3=6.\n\nWait, but what are the actual triplets?\n\nx=1, y=3, z can be 3 or 4 or 5? Wait no.\n\nWait, z has to be >=3 and <= min(5, x+y-1=1+3-1=3).\n\nSo z can be 3 only.\n\nSo for x=1, y=3: z=3.\n\nSo one triplet.\n\nx=2, y can be 2 and 3.\n\nFor y=2: z can be 3,4,5? No, because x+y=4>3, so z can be 3,4,5.\n\nWait, wait: x=2, y=2 → x+y=4>3.\n\nSo z can be 3,4,5.\n\nSo three triplets.\n\nx=2, y=3: z can be 3,4,5.\n\nBecause x+y=5>3 → z can be up to 5.\n\nSo for y=3, z can be 3,4,5 → three options.\n\nWait, no: wait, x=2, y=3: x+y=5.\n\nz can be from 3 to min(5,5) → 3,4,5 → 3 options.\n\nSo for x=2, y=2: z can be 3,4,5 → 3 options.\n\ny=3: z can be 3,4,5 → 3 options.\n\nSo x=2 contributes 6 triplets.\n\nx=1 contributes 1.\n\nTotal 7.\n\nBut according to the calculation, the sum is 3+3=6. So discrepancy.\n\nWait, why? Where did I go wrong.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the logic.\n\nWait, in x=2, y=2: x + y =4>3.\n\nSo z can be from 3 to min(5,4-1=3) → min(5,3)=3.\n\nSo z can only be 3.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nSo for x=2, y=2: z can be 3 only.\n\nx=2, y=3: z can be 3,4,5.\n\nWait, no: x=2, y=3: x+y-1=4.\n\nSo z can be up to 4.\n\nSo z can be 3,4.\n\nWait, because z must be ≤ min(D, x+y-1) = min(5,4) =4.\n\nSo for x=2, y=3, z can be 3 or 4.\n\nSo for x=2, y=2: z=3 → 1 option.\n\ny=3: z can be 3 and 4 → 2 options.\n\nSo x=2 contributes 1+2=3.\n\nx=1, y=3: z can be 3 → 1.\n\nTotal 4.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier calculation, the code would compute:\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = 2.\n\nk=5-2+1=4.\n\nSince C=3 <4 → case B.\n\nsum is sum from y=2 to3 of (2 + y -3).\n\ny=2: 2+2-3=1.\n\ny=3: 2+3-3=2.\n\nSum is 3.\n\nSo S(x=2) is 3.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low=3.\n\nk=5.\n\ncase B: sum is 1.\n\nTotal 4.\n\nWhich matches the actual count.\n\nSo the initial mistake was in my manual calculation of x=2's contributions.\n\nSo, the code's logic is correct.\n\nTherefore, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut considering that A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, the code must be efficient.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   y_low = max(B, C -x +1)\n\n   if y_low > C: continue\n\n   k = D -x +1\n\n   if k < y_low:\n\n       # case A\n\n       num_y = C - y_low +1\n\n       z_count = D - C +1\n\n       sum_x = num_y * z_count\n\n   elif k >= C:\n\n       # case B\n\n       a = y_low\n\n       b = C\n\n       n = b - a +1\n\n       sum_y = (a + b) * n // 2\n\n       sum_x_part = sum_y + (x - C) * n\n\n   else:\n\n       # case C\n\n       a = y_low\n\n       b = k\n\n       n = b - a +1\n\n       sum_y = (a + b) * n //2\n\n       sum_x_part = sum_y + (x - C)*n\n\n       # part2: y from k+1 to C\n\n       a2 = k+1\n\n       b2 = C\n\n       n2 = b2 - a2 +1\n\n       sum_z = (D - C +1) * n2\n\n       sum_x = sum_x_part + sum_z\n\n   total += sum_x\n\nAt the end, print(total)\n\nWait, but in code, we have to ensure that all variables are handled correctly, especially when dealing with large numbers.\n\nBut since all variables are integers, and the arithmetic is straightforward, this should be manageable.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-1+1=3) →3.\n\nk=4-1+1=4.\n\nSince k >= C=3 → case B.\n\na=3, b=3.\n\nn=1.\n\nsum_y = (3+3)*1//2 =3.\n\nsum_x_part=3 + (1-3)*1=3-2=1.\n\nsum_x=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-2+1=2) →2.\n\nk=4-2+1=3.\n\nsince k >=C=3 → case B.\n\na=2, b=3.\n\nn=2.\n\nsum_y=(2+3)*2//2=5.\n\nsum_x_part=5 + (2-3)*2=5-2=3.\n\nsum_x=3.\n\ntotal=1+3=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when D is smaller than C.\n\nWait, no, because the problem states that C<=D.\n\nSo D is always >=C.\n\nSo no problem there.\n\nAnother test case: when k < y_low.\n\nE.g., x=5, D=10.\n\nk=10-5+1=6.\n\nSuppose y_low=7.\n\nSo k < y_low → case A.\n\nSo for each y in [7, C], the number of z's is D-C+1.\n\nWait, but if C is 8, then y can be 7 and 8.\n\nSo for each of these y's, z can be from C=8 to min(D, x+y-1).\n\nBut x+y-1=5+7-1=11, which is larger than D=10.\n\nSo z can be from 8 to 10 → 3 options.\n\nSo for each y in [7,8], sum +=3.\n\nSo for 2 y's, sum +=6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nAnother test case: when D is exactly x + y -1.\n\nFor x=2, y=3, D=4.\n\nx+y-1=4 → z can be 3,4.\n\nSo 2 options.\n\nWhich the code should capture.\n\nThus, I think the code is correct.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nBut wait, for cases where D -x +1 is negative?\n\nNo, because x is in [A, B], and D >=C >= B >=x.\n\nSo D -x +1 >= C -x +1 >= B -x +1.\n\nBut x can be up to B.\n\nBut C >= B, so C -x >= B -x >=0.\n\nSo, k can be as low as D - B +1.\n\nBut in any case, k can be less than y_low.\n\nBut the code handles that.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nRead four integers A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute the sum.\n\nPrint the sum as a string.\n\nBut note that for cases where the sum is zero, we still need to output '0'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n    y_low = max(B, C -x +1)\n\n    if y_low > C:\n\n        continue\n\n    k = D -
