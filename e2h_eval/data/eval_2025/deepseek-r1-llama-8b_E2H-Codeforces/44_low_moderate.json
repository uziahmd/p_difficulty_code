He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Polycarp solving problems over k days. Each day he solves a contiguous sequence of problems from his list. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the maximums each day.\n\nHmm, right. So the idea is to split the array into exactly k contiguous parts, and for each part, take the maximum element. Then sum all those maxima, and we need to maximize that sum.\n\nWait, but how? Because each part has to be a consecutive sequence, and the order must be preserved as per the original list.\n\nSo, for example, if the list is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2], and k=3, then one possible way is to split into [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2]. The maxima are 5,6,9, summing to 20.\n\nSo the approach is to find such splits where the sum of the maxima is as large as possible.\n\nI remember that similar problems often involve dynamic programming. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming here. Maybe dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit for the first i problems, split into j days.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each position i and j days, we can consider where to split. For example, for each possible m < i, we could split at m, take the maximum up to m (dp[m][j-1]) plus the maximum in the next segment.\n\nWait, but wait. The way the split works is that each segment is a contiguous block. So for the current i and j, the last segment starts at some m+1 and ends at i.\n\nSo, for each i and j, dp[i][j] = max{ dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) }, for all m from j-2 (since each day needs at least one problem) up to i-1.\n\nBut the problem is that computing max(a[m+1..i]) for every possible m and i might be time-consuming if done naively. Since n is up to 2000, O(n^3) would be 8e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a way to compute the maximum quickly. How?\n\nHmm, perhaps precompute a 2D array max_up_to_i that stores the maximum from position s to e. But even that would require O(n^2) space and O(n^2) pre-processing, which is manageable for n=2000.\n\nWait, let's see: for each i, and for each j, the max in the segment a[m+1..i]. So for each i, and for each possible m, the max from m+1 to i.\n\nWe can precompute a 2D array where max_table[i][j] is the maximum from position i to j.\n\nWait, no, because the segments are contiguous and for any i and j, the max from i to j can be found in O(1) with the right structure. Alternatively, we can precompute for each position the maximum so far.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: for each i, keep track of the maximum as we extend the segment ending at i.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each position i, the maximum from position i to position j, for all j >= i. That's O(n^2), which is acceptable.\n\nLet me think: create a 2D array where max_segment[i][j] is the maximum from a[i] to a[j]. Then, for any segment [m+1, i], the maximum is max_segment[m+1][i].\n\nTo compute max_segment, we can do:\n\nmax_segment[i][i] = a[i]\nfor i from 1 to n:\n    for j from i+1 to n:\n        max_segment[i][j] = max(max_segment[i][j-1], a[j])\n\nWait, but wait. That would correctly compute the maximum for each interval [i..j]. So yes.\n\nOnce we have this, for the DP step:\n\ndp[i][j] = max over m from (j-1)th day's end (like m can't be less than j-1's start) up to i-1.\n\nWait, more precisely, for j days, each day must have at least one problem. So for the last day, which is the j-th day, it must consist of at least one problem. So when building dp[i][j], we need to look for m where the previous j-1 days cover the first m problems, and the j-th day covers from m+1 to i.\n\nSo for each i and j, the maximum is taken by considering all possible m from (j-1) to i-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over a given number of days. Each day, Polycarp must solve a contiguous sequence of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The goal is to find the optimal way to distribute the problems into days to maximize the sum of these daily profits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems over `j` days.\n2. **Precompute Maximums**: To efficiently compute the maximum value in any contiguous subarray, we precompute a 2D array `max_segment` where `max_segment[i][j]` stores the maximum value from index `i` to `j` in the problem list.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible split point `m`, compute the maximum profit by considering the best solution up to `m` problems for `j-1` days and adding the maximum value of the segment from `m+1` to `i`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Precompute max_segment[i][j], which is the maximum from a[i] to a[j]\nmax_segment = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\nfor i in range(n):\n    max_segment[i][i] = a[i]\n    for j in range(i + 1, n):\n        max_segment[i][j] = max(max_segment[i][j - 1], a[j])\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\ndp[0][0] = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    for j in range(1, k + 1):\n        if j == 1:\n            dp[i][j] = max_segment[0][i - 1]\n        else:\n            max_val = 0\n            for m in range(j - 1, i):\n                current_max = max_segment[m + 1][i - 1]\n                prev_dp = dp[m][j - 1]\n                if prev_dp + current_max > max_val:\n                    max_val = prev_dp + current_max\n            dp[i][j] = max_val\n\n# Now reconstruct the answer\nt = [0] * k\ncurrent_pos = 0\nfor j in range(k):\n    if j == 0:\n        t[j] = n\n        continue\n    for m in range(j - 1, current_pos):\n        pass\n    best_m = current_pos\n    best_prev = dp[current_pos][j]\n    for m in range(best_m + 1, current_pos + (n - current_pos)):\n        pass\n    best = dp[current_pos][j]\n    for m in range(j - 1, current_pos):\n        if dp[m][j - 1] + max_segment[m + 1][current_pos] > best:\n            best = dp[m][j - 1] + max_segment[m + 1][current_pos]\n    t[j] = current_pos - best_m + 1\n    current_pos += t[j]\n\nprint(dp[n][k])\nprint(' '.join(map(str, t)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: The `max_segment` array is filled such that each entry `max_segment[i][j]` holds the maximum value from index `i` to `j`. This allows us to quickly determine the maximum value of any subarray.\n2. **DP Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit for the first `i` problems over `j` days.\n3. **Filling DP Table**: For each possible number of days `j` and each possible end position `i`, the DP table is filled by considering all possible previous split points `m`. The maximum profit is determined by the best solution up to `m` problems for `j-1` days plus the maximum value of the segment starting from `m+1` to `i`.\n4. **Reconstructing the Solution**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack to determine the optimal splits for each day to maximize the total profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible total profit using dynamic programming and precomputed maximum values, making it feasible even for larger input sizes within the constraints.",
