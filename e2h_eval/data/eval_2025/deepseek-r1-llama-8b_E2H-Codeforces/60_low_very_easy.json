Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code and counting certain sequences after each modification to a string S. Hmm. So each character added to S is either a '0' or '1', representing a dot or dash. After each addition, I need to find the number of non-empty substrings that correspond to a valid English letter's Morse code.\n\nWait, what's the Morse code structure here? Each English letter is represented by a string of 1 to 4 characters, made up of 0s and 1s. But some combinations aren't valid. The invalid ones are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring of S that translates to one of these invalid strings doesn't count towards the total.\n\nSo the task is, after each step, calculate how many valid Morse code letters are present as substrings in S. And since m can be up to 3000, the solution needs to be efficient enough for that.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's think about how to model this. For each position in S, we can consider all possible substrings ending at that position and check if they form a valid Morse code string. But since the length can be up to 4, for each new character, we only need to look back up to 3 positions, because adding a new character can create substrings of lengths 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo for each new character, I can generate all possible substrings ending at this character with lengths 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not exceeding the current string's length). For each such substring, I need to check whether it's a valid Morse code representation of an English letter. If it is, then it contributes to the total count.\n\nBut wait, checking each substring every time might be manageable because for each step, the maximum number of substrings to check is 4 (for each possible length). So for m=3000, that's 3000*4 = 12,000 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Maintain a list or a variable to keep track of the total count of valid substrings.\n- For each new character added to S:\n   - Generate all possible substrings ending at this character, with lengths 1, 2, 3, 4 (but don't go beyond the start of the string).\n   - For each generated substring, check if it's a valid Morse code letter (i.e., not one of the four invalid ones).\n   - For each valid substring, increment the total count.\n   - Output the total count modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but the way I'm thinking, for each new character, I can look back 0, 1, 2, 3 steps, creating substrings of length 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. Then, for each of those substrings, check validity and accumulate the count.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nNow, the key is to efficiently check if a given Morse code string is valid. So I'll need a set containing the four invalid strings: {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}. For any generated substring, if it's in this set, it's invalid and shouldn't be counted.\n\nSo steps for the solution:\n\n1. Read m and the sequence of m characters.\n2. Initialize S as an empty string.\n3. Initialize a set of invalid codes: invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}.\n4. Initialize a variable total = 0.\n5. For each character in the input:\n   a. Add the character to S.\n   b. For length l from 1 to 4:\n      i. Check if the current position minus l + 1 is >= 0. That is, the substring starts at (current index - l + 1) and ends at current index.\n      ii. Extract the substring s of length l.\n      iii. If s is not in invalid, add 1 to total.\n   c. Output total mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but for each new character, the index increases by 1. So when the current length is n, the indices are 0-based from 0 to n-1. When adding a new character at position n, we can look back 0 to 3 positions to get substrings of length 1 to 4.\n\nSo for each step, for l in 1..4:\n   if the length of S is >= l, then extract the last l characters and check.\n\nYes, that's better. So in code terms, after appending the new character, for l in 1 to 4:\n   if len(S) >= l:\n       substring = S[-l:]\n       if substring not",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code representations of English letters that can be formed from substrings of a string after each modification. Each modification appends either a '0' (dot) or '1' (dash) to the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each letter in the English alphabet is represented by a unique string of 1 to 4 characters composed of '0's and '1's. However, there are four invalid strings that do not correspond to any letter: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". After each modification to the string, we need to count how many valid substrings exist.\n\n2. **Efficient Checking**: For each new character added to the string, we consider all possible substrings ending at this character with lengths 1, 2, 3, or 4. We check each substring against the set of invalid strings to determine if it is valid.\n\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n4. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Read the input and initialize necessary variables.\n   - For each new character, update the string and check all possible substrings ending at this character.\n   - Count valid substrings and print the result after each modification.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\ninvalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\nm = int(input())\nchars = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    chars.append(input().strip())\n\ns = []\ntotal = 0\n\nfor c in chars:\n    s.append(c)\n    current_length = len(s)\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        if current_length >= l:\n            substring = ''.join(s[-l:])\n            if substring not in invalid:\n                total += 1\n    print(total % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list to process each character sequentially.\n- **String Construction**: Each character is appended to the string `s`.\n- **Substring Check**: For each new character, substrings of lengths 1 to 4 are checked. If a substring is valid (not in the set of invalid strings), it contributes to the total count.\n- **Output**: After each modification, the total count is printed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each possible substring after each modification, ensuring that we only consider valid Morse code representations and handle large numbers appropriately.",
