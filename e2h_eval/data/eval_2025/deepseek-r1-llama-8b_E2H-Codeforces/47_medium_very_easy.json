    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to understand what affects the LCM when we add k to both a and b. Wait, let's think about the expressions (a + k) and (b + k). Since they are being added by the same k, their difference remains the same as (b - a), but wait, no, because if a < b, then b +k - (a +k) = b -a. So the difference between them is fixed.\n\nWait, that's an important observation. The difference between a +k and b +k is the same as the original difference between a and b. Because (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So the two numbers are always d apart, where d is |a - b|. Or wait, actually, if a > b, then the difference would be negative, but since we take absolute value, it's the same as |a - b|.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y such that y = x + d, and we want to minimize the LCM of x and y, where x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\nWait, but since d is fixed (d = |a - b|), maybe the key is to find x and y that are as close as possible, perhaps multiples of each other or something like that.\n\nWait, but how does adding k affect this? Let's see. Let me denote x = a +k, y = b +k. Then, since y = x + d (assuming d is positive; otherwise, swap a and b). So the pair (x, y) must satisfy y = x + d. So the LCM of x and y is equal to the LCM of x and x + d.\n\nOur goal is to find x >= max(a, b) ? No, wait, no. Because k can be zero, so x can be as low as a or b. Wait, but in any case, x and y are both at least a and b respectively, depending on whether we're adding k.\n\nWait, no. For example, if a is 5 and b is 10, then when k is 0, x is 5, y is 10. But when k is 3, x is 8, y is 13. Oh, right. So x and y are a +k and b +k, which can vary based on k.\n\nBut the point is, for each k, we compute LCM(x, y) where y = x + d, d is fixed as |a - b|.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given d, find x such that x >= a' (where a' is the minimum of a and b?), but wait, no. Because a and b could be in any order. Hmm, perhaps it's better to set d as the absolute difference between a and b, then set x = a +k and y = b +k = x + d, assuming a <= b.\n\nWait, no. Because if a > b, then d is a - b, but then y would be x - d, which may complicate things. Maybe it's better to always have y = x + d, with d being |a - b|. So regardless of whether a is larger or not, y is x plus d.\n\nWait, but that depends on how you arrange it. Maybe to avoid confusion, let's compute d as |a - b|, then set x = a +k and y = b +k. But if a > b, then y = x - d, but that's okay because LCM(x, y) is the same as LCM(y, x).\n\nSo, the main idea is that for a given d, we can express x and y as x and x + d, and find x such that the LCM(x, x + d) is minimized.\n\nBut how do we find such x?\n\nLet's think about the properties of LCM. LCM(x, x+d) = (x*(x + d)) / GCD(x, x + d). So to minimize LCM(x, x+d), we need to maximize the GCD of x and x + d.\n\nWhat's GCD(x, x + d)? It's equal to GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x + d) = GCD(x, (x + d) - x) = GCD(x, d). So that simplifies things.\n\nSo, the LCM becomes x*(x + d)/GCD(x, d).\n\nNow, our aim is to find x such that this expression is minimized.\n\nLet me rephrase: for each x, the LCM is x*(x + d)/g, where g is GCD(x, d). So to minimize the LCM, we can look for x's where g is as large as possible, and x is as small as possible.\n\nBut since d is fixed, g can be any divisor of d.\n\nWait, yes. Because GCD(x, d) must divide d. So all possible values of g are the divisors of d.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal x is a multiple of a certain divisor of d, and then the LCM can be minimized.\n\nWait, here's an approach: for each possible divisor g of d, find the minimal x that is a multiple of g, and then compute the LCM for x and x + d. Then choose the x that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBut how do we proceed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is the smallest possible x such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find all possible divisors of d, and for each divisor g, compute the minimal x that is a multiple of g, and then compute the LCM. Then, among all these possibilities, choose the one with the smallest LCM, and if there's a tie, pick the smallest x.\n\nBut considering that d can be up to 1e9, enumerating all divisors of d might not be efficient, but it's manageable because the number of divisors of a number is up to around 1e5 for 1e9.\n\nWait, but 1e9 has only 100 divisors at most, right? Because the maximum number of divisors a number can have is when it's highly composite. For example, 735134400 has 1344 divisors, but 1e9 is 2^9 * 5^9, so the number of divisors is (9+1)*(9+1) = 100. So it's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d as |a - b|.\n2. If d is zero, then a == b, so any k will result in a +k and b +k being equal. So the LCM is a +k, which is minimized when k is zero. So output 0.\n3. Otherwise, find all divisors of d.\n4. For each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x that is a multiple of g, and x >= min(a, b).\n   Wait, no. Because x can be anything as long as x is a multiple of g. But since x = a +k, and a can be less than or greater than b, perhaps x can be as small as possible, but also x needs to be >= a and >= b -d? Or perhaps not. Wait, no, because x = a +k, so k is non-negative, so x >= a. Similarly, since y = x +d, y = (a +k) +d = (b +k) +d -d? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's clarify. When a <= b, then d = b -a. Then x = a +k, y = b +k = x +d.\n\nBut when a > b, d is a -b, so x = a +k, y = b +k = x -d. So in that case, y = x -d.\n\nBut in either case, the pair is (x, y), where y is x +/- d. But since LCM(x, y) is same as LCM(y, x), the sign doesn't matter. So perhaps it's easier to assume that d is positive, and y = x + d.\n\nSo, going back, for each divisor g of d, the minimal x is the smallest multiple of g such that x >= a and x >= (something else?), but wait, x can be as small as possible. Because adding k is allowed to make x as small as possible.\n\nWait, no. Because x is a +k, and k is non-negative. So x can't be smaller than a. Or wait, if a is 5 and b is 10, then d is 5. Suppose we choose x=5, which is a. Then y=10, which is b. That's a valid case.\n\nWait, but in another scenario, if a is 10 and b is 5, then d is 5. So x = a +k =10 +k, y =5 +k =x -5. So for x to be valid, 5 +k >=0, which is always true since k is non-negative. So x can be as small as a, but in this case, a is 10, so x starts at 10.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal x is the maximum of a and b. Wait, no. Because for example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst test case: a=6, b=10. So d=4.\n\nWe need to find x and y =x+4.\n\nThe sample solution was k=2, so x=8, y=12. LCM(8,12)=24.\n\nWait, but what if x=6 (a=6): y=10. LCM(6,10)=30, which is higher than 24.\n\nSimilarly, x=7: y=11. LCM(77)=77. Which is higher.\n\nx=8: LCM(24). So better.\n\nWait, so perhaps the minimal x is not necessarily the minimal possible, but rather the one that makes x and x+d have a high GCD.\n\nSo, for each possible g (divisor of d), compute x = g * m, where m is such that x >= a and x >= b -d? Or perhaps x needs to be at least the maximum of (a, b -d).\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nGiven that x must be >= a (since k is non-negative, x =a +k >=a), and y =x +d = b +k >= b. So x must be >=a, and x +d >=b.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as x >= max(a, b -d).\n\nBut wait, since d = |a -b|, if a > b, then d =a -b, so b -d = b - (a -b) = 2b -a. Which could be less than a.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to compute x >= max(a, b -d).\n\nWait, let's take the first sample. a=6, b=10, d=4.\n\nb -d is 6. So x must be >= max(6,6) =6.\n\nSo x can be 6,7,8, etc.\n\nIn this case, x=8 is chosen, which is a multiple of 4 (g=4).\n\nAnother sample: a=21, b=31, d=10.\n\nSo b -d is 21.\n\nSo x must be >=21.\n\nIn the sample, k=9 is chosen, so x=30, which is a multiple of 10 (g=10).\n\nSo x=30 is a multiple of 10.\n\nWait, so the approach is:\n\nFor each divisor g of d, compute x = g * m, where m is the smallest integer such that x >= max(a, b -d). Then compute the LCM of x and x +d. Keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding x.\n\nThen, among all such g's, choose the one that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple g's give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x.\n\nWait, but how do we determine m for each g?\n\nYes. So for each divisor g of d:\n\nCompute x_min = max(a, b -d)\n\nm is the smallest integer such that x = g * m >= x_min.\n\nSo m = ceil(x_min / g).\n\nWait, but x_min might not be exactly divisible by g. So m is the ceiling of x_min divided by g.\n\nOnce x is determined, compute the LCM(x, x+d). But since x is a multiple of g, and x +d is also a multiple of g, because d is a multiple of g (since g divides d). So x +d = x + (d) = g*m + g*k = g(m +k). So the GCD(x, x+d) is g, as before.\n\nThus, the LCM is (x*(x+d))/g.\n\nSo for each g (divisor of d), compute x = g * m, where m is the smallest integer such that x >=x_min, and compute the LCM as (x*(x+d))/g.\n\nThen, among all possible g's, select the one with minimal LCM. If there's a tie, select the smallest x.\n\nAdditionally, we should also consider the case where g is 1, which would mean x is as small as possible.\n\nWait, but in that case, x is the minimal possible, which is x_min. So for g=1, x = x_min, and the LCM would be x*(x +d). But if d is large, that could be a big LCM.\n\nBut perhaps for some cases, the minimal LCM occurs at g=1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d = |a -b|.\n\n2. If d is zero, output 0.\n\n3. Else, collect all the divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g, compute x_min = max(a, b -d). Wait, why b -d? Because when a >b, then y =x -d must be >=b. So x >= b +d. Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, when a >b, then d =a -b.\n\nSo y =x -d. We need y >=b.\n\nSo x -d >=b => x >= b +d.\n\nBut since x =a +k >=a, then x must be >= max(a, b +d).\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nIf a >b, then d =a -b.\n\nThen y = x -d.\n\nWe need y >=b.\n\nSo x -d >=b => x >= b +d.\n\nBut x =a +k >=a.\n\nSo x must be >= max(a, b +d).\n\nBecause if b +d >a, then x has to be at least b +d. Otherwise, x can be a.\n\nBut wait, if a is already larger than b +d, then x >=a is sufficient.\n\nSo in general, x_min is max(a, b +d) if a >b, and max(a, b -d) if a <b.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nCase 1: a <=b.\n\nThen d =b -a.\n\ny =x +d.\n\nWe need y >=b.\n\nx +d >=b.\n\nBut x =a +k >=a.\n\nSo x >= a.\n\nBut x +d >=b implies x >=b -d.\n\nBut since d is positive, b -d could be less than a.\n\nSo x_min is max(a, b -d).\n\nCase 2: a >b.\n\nd =a -b.\n\ny =x -d.\n\nWe need y >=b.\n\nx -d >=b => x >=b +d.\n\nAlso, x =a +k >=a.\n\nSo x_min is max(a, b +d).\n\nSo overall, x_min is max(a, b + (d if a >b else -d)).\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, x_min is max(a, b + s), where s is the sign of (a -b). Because when a >b, s is positive, so b +s =b + (a -b) =a.\n\nWait, that's interesting.\n\nWait, when a >b:\n\nd =a -b.\n\ny =x -d.\n\nWe need y >=b => x >=b +d.\n\nBut since d =a -b, b +d = a.\n\nSo x_min = max(a, a) =a.\n\nWait, that's a surprise.\n\nSo when a >b, x_min is a.\n\nWhen a <=b, x_min is max(a, b -d).\n\nBut d is b -a, so b -d =a.\n\nSo in that case, x_min is max(a, a) =a.\n\nWait, that's a game changer.\n\nSo regardless of whether a is less than or greater than b, x_min is a.\n\nWait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, when a <=b:\n\nd =b -a.\n\ny =x +d.\n\nWe need y >=b.\n\nSo x +d >=b => x >=b -d.\n\nBut since d =b -a, x >=b - (b -a) =a.\n\nSo x >=a.\n\nBut x is a +k, so x >=a.\n\nSo in this case, x_min is a.\n\nWhen a >b:\n\nd =a -b.\n\ny =x -d.\n\nWe need y >=b =>x >=b +d.\n\nBut d =a -b, so x >=b + (a -b) =a.\n\nSo x_min is a.\n\nSo in both cases, x_min is a.\n\nWait, that's a very important conclusion. So regardless of whether a is less than or greater than b, x must be at least a. Because x =a +k >=a, and in the case where a >b, x must be >=a (from the condition y >=b).\n\nSo for all cases, x >=a.\n\nThat's a big simplification.\n\nSo now, the problem is:\n\nFind x >=a, such that x is a multiple of g (g is a divisor of d), and x is such that y =x +d (if a <=b) or y =x -d (if a >b) is >=b.\n\nBut since x >=a, and in the case a <=b, y =x +d =x + (b -a) >=a + (b -a) =b. So y >=b automatically.\n\nIn the case a >b, y =x -d =x - (a -b) >=a - (a -b) =b. So y >=b automatically.\n\nThus, x >=a is sufficient.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute d =|a -b|\n\nIf d is zero, return 0.\n\nElse, find all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\nCompute x = the smallest multiple of g that is >=a.\n\nThen, compute the LCM(x, x +d if a <=b else x -d).\n\nBut since for a <=b, x +d >=b; for a> b, x -d >=b.\n\nSo for each g, compute x = g * m, where m is the smallest integer such that x >=a.\n\nSo m = ceil(a /g).\n\nThen, compute the current x, and then compute the LCM(x, y), where y is x +d or x -d, depending on whether a <=b or not.\n\nWait, but since y =x +/-d, and x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g, then y is also a multiple of g. So the GCD(x, y) is g.\n\nSo the LCM is (x * y)/g = (x (x +d))/g (if a <=b) or (x (x -d))/g (if a> b).\n\nBut since d is a multiple of g, (x +d) is x + kg for some k, so y is a multiple of g.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- Find all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute x = g * m, m = ceil(a/g).\n\n- Compute the LCM for x and y =x +d (if a <=b) or x -d (if a> b).\n\n- Among all possible g's, find the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple g's give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x.\n\nSo, the next step is to find all divisors of d, including 1 and d.\n\nWait, but how do I find all the divisors of d?\n\nWell, factorizing d into its prime factors and generating all possible products of those factors would give all the divisors.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a function to find all divisors of a given number.\n\nOnce I have all divisors, process each one as described.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b).\n\nIf d is 0, print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute all divisors of d.\n\nSort the divisors in increasing order? Not necessarily, because for each g, we'll process it, compute x, then the LCM, and keep track of the best.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nmin_lcm = infinity\n\nbest_k = 0\n\nThen, for each g in divisors:\n\nCompute x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g  # this is the smallest multiple of g >=a.\n\nCompute y = x + d if a <=b else x -d.\n\nCompute current_lcm = (x * y) // g.\n\nCompute current_k = x -a.\n\nCompare current_lcm to min_lcm.\n\nIf current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\nUpdate min_lcm and best_k.\n\nElse if current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\nCheck if current_k is smaller than best_k. If so, update best_k.\n\nSo, after processing all divisors, output the best_k.\n\nWait, but why do we have to process all divisors? Because for some divisors, the x might be larger, leading to a smaller LCM.\n\nBut according to our earlier analysis, for each divisor g, the x is the smallest multiple of g >=a. So for each g, we compute the minimal possible x, which is the smallest x that is a multiple of g and >=a.\n\nThus, for each g, we get the minimal x, and compute the LCM. Then, among all these, we choose the one with the smallest LCM, and if tied, the smallest x.\n\nSo the code should process all divisors.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: a=6, b=10. d=4.\n\nDivisors of 4: 1, 2,4.\n\nProcess each g:\n\ng=1:\n\nx=6 (smallest multiple of 1 >=6).\n\ny=6+4=10.\n\nlcm= (6*10)/1=60.\n\ncurrent_k=0.\n\ng=2:\n\nx=6 (since 6 is multiple of 2).\n\ny=6+4=10.\n\nlcm= (6*10)/2=30.\n\ncurrent_k=0.\n\ng=4:\n\nx=8 (smallest multiple of 4 >=6).\n\ny=8+4=12.\n\nlcm= (8*12)/4=24.\n\ncurrent_k=2.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 24, achieved at k=2.\n\nThus, output 2.\n\nSample 2: a=21, b=31. d=10.\n\nDivisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n\nProcess each g:\n\ng=1:\n\nx=21.\n\ny=21+10=31.\n\nlcm=21*31=651.\n\nk=0.\n\ng=2:\n\nx=22 (smallest multiple of 2 >=21).\n\ny=32.\n\nlcm=22*32/2=352.\n\nk=1.\n\ng=5:\n\nx=25 (smallest multiple of 5 >=21 is 25).\n\ny=35.\n\nlcm=25*35/5=175.\n\nk=4.\n\ng=10:\n\nx=30 (smallest multiple of 10 >=21).\n\ny=40.\n\nlcm=30*40/10=120.\n\nk=9.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the correct answer is 9, which gives lcm 120.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is 9, which is the k for x=30.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal LCM is 120, achieved when g=10.\n\nBut wait, is that the minimal? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the divisors, for g=5, x=25, lcm=175.\n\ng=10, lcm=120.\n\nIs there any other g that gives a lower LCM?\n\nNo, because 120 is smaller than 175.\n\nSo the best is g=10, k=9.\n\nSample 3: a=5, b=10. d=5.\n\nDivisors of 5: 1,5.\n\ng=1:\n\nx=5.\n\ny=5+5=10.\n\nlcm=5*10=50.\n\nk=0.\n\ng=5:\n\nx=5 (since 5 is a multiple of 5).\n\ny=5+5=10.\n\nlcm=5*10/5=10.\n\nk=0.\n\nSo for g=5, the LCM is 10, which is smaller than 50.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 10, achieved at k=0.\n\nThus, output 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=7.\n\nd=4.\n\ndivisors:1,2,4.\n\ng=1:\n\nx=3.\n\ny=7.\n\nlcm=21.\n\nk=0.\n\ng=2:\n\nx=4.\n\ny=8.\n\nlcm=16.\n\nk=1.\n\ng=4:\n\nx=4.\n\ny=8.\n\nlcm=16.\n\nk=1.\n\nSo both g=2 and g=4 give lcm 16, with x=4 and x=4.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 16, achieved at k=1.\n\nWait, but what's the actual situation?\n\nWait, when x=4, y=8.\n\nLCM is 16.\n\nIf I choose k=1, a=3+1=4, b=7+1=8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would correctly choose k=1.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=15. d=5.\n\ndivisors:1,5.\n\ng=1:\n\nx=10.\n\ny=15.\n\nlcm=150.\n\nk=0.\n\ng=5:\n\nx=10.\n\ny=15.\n\nlcm=150/5=30.\n\nk=0.\n\nSo the minimal is 30.\n\nThus, k=0.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nThe main parts are:\n\n1. Finding all divisors of d.\n\n2. For each divisor, compute x.\n\n3. Compute the current LCM.\n\n4. Track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nImplementing the divisor function is key.\n\nImplementing the divisor function:\n\nWe can write a function that returns all divisors of a number n.\n\nApproach:\n\n- Factorize n into its prime factors.\n\n- Generate all possible products of these factors.\n\nBut for n up to 1e9, factorization can be done via trial division, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps a faster way is needed, but for 1e9, trial division is manageable.\n\nOnce the factors are known, generate all divisors.\n\nLet me write a helper function to find all the divisors.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate up to sqrt(n) and collect the divisors.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo the code for collecting divisors can be as follows:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    i =1\n\n    while i*i <=n:\n\n        if n%i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n        i +=1\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but this would include 1 and n. Yes.\n\nTesting:\n\nn=4: 1,4,2.\n\nn=5:1,5.\n\nn=6: 1,6, 2,3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's a good function.\n\nOnce we have the list of divisors, we process each.\n\nNow, handling the cases when a >b:\n\nWait, in the code, y is x +d if a <=b, else x -d.\n\nBut in the code, d is |a -b|, so when a >b, d =a -b, so x -d =x - (a -b).\n\nWait, but x is a +k, so x =a +k.\n\nSo when a >b, y =x -d =a +k - (a -b) =b +k.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo in code, for each g in divisors:\n\nx = ((a + g -1) //g ) *g\n\nif a <=b:\n\n    y =x +d\n\nelse:\n\n    y =x -d\n\ncurrent_lcm = (x * y) //g\n\ncurrent_k =x -a\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif a <= b:\n\n    y = x +d\n\nelse:\n\n    y =x -d\n\nThus, the code can handle all cases.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nRead a and b.\n\nd =abs(a -b)\n\nif d ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = infinity\n\n    best_k =0\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        x = ((a +g -1) //g ) *g  # smallest multiple of g >=a\n\n        if a <=b:\n\n            y =x +d\n\n        else:\n\n            y =x -d\n\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n\n        current_k =x -a\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_k = current_k\n\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n            if current_k < best_k:\n\n                best_k = current_k\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but what about the case when a=5, b=10, d=5.\n\nDivisors are 1,5.\n\ng=1: x=5, y=10, lcm=5*10=50.\n\ng=5: x=5, y=10, lcm=10.\n\nThus, best_k is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=5.\n\nd=5.\n\ndivisors 1,5.\n\ng=1:\n\nx=10.\n\ny=10 -5=5.\n\nlcm=10*5=50.\n\ng=5:\n\nx=10.\n\ny=5.\n\nlcm=50.\n\nWait, but wait, 10 and 5 have LCM 10.\n\nWait, because 10 and 5: GCD is 5.\n\nSo (10 *5)/5 =10.\n\nAh, so for a=10, b=5, d=5.\n\nProcessing g=5:\n\nx=10.\n\ny=10 -5=5.\n\ncurrent_lcm= (10*5)/5=10.\n\nWhich is better than 50.\n\nThus, best_k is 0.\n\nSo the code would correctly output 0.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code accordingly.\n\nBut wait, what about when a=2, b=4. d=2.\n\ndivisors:1,2.\n\ng=1:\n\nx=2.\n\ny=4.\n\nlcm=8.\n\ng=2:\n\nx=2.\n\ny=4.\n\nlcm= (2*4)/2=4.\n\nSo best_k is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=2. d=2.\n\ndivisors:1,2.\n\ng=1:\n\nx=4.\n\ny=4-2=2.\n\nlcm=4*2=8.\n\ng=2:\n\nx=4.\n\ny=4-2=2.\n\nlcm= (4*2)/2=4.\n\nThus, best_k is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWait, but the function get_divisors needs to return all divisors in sorted order, but in the code, we can process them in any order because for each g, we compute x and compare.\n\nBut in the code, the divisors are processed in the order returned by get_divisors. But the code will process all of them, so the order doesn't matter.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nCase 1: a =1, b=1. Output is 0.\n\nCase 2: a=1, b=2. d=1.\n\ndivisors:1.\n\ng=1: x=1.\n\ny=2.\n\nlcm=2.\n\nThus, output is 0.\n\nCase 3: a=1, b=3. d=2.\n\ndivisors:1,2.\n\ng=1:\n\nx=1.\n\ny=3.\n\nlcm=3.\n\ng=2:\n\nx=2.\n\ny=4.\n\nlcm= (2*4)/2=4.\n\nThus, minimal LCM is 3, achieved at k=0.\n\nThus, output is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: a=5, b=1.\n\nd=4.\n\ndivisors:1,2,4.\n\ng=1: x=5, y=5-4=1. lcm=5.\n\ng=2: x=6, y=2. lcm=6*2/2=6.\n\ng=4: x=8, y=4. lcm= (8*4)/4=8.\n\nThus, the minimal LCM is 5, achieved at k=0.\n\nThus, output is 0.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the final code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key observation is that the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) remains constant as \\( |a - b| \\). Let's denote this difference as \\( d \\). Thus, the problem reduces to finding two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that \\( y = x + d \\) or \\( y = x - d \\) (depending on whether \\( a \\) is less than or greater than \\( b \\)).\n\n2. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: To minimize the LCM of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we need to maximize their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is the same as the GCD of \\( x \\) and \\( d \\). Therefore, we consider all divisors of \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Finding Optimal \\( x \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest \\( x \\) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and greater than or equal to \\( a \\). This \\( x \\) is found by computing the smallest multiple of \\( g \\) that is at least \\( a \\).\n\n4. **Compute LCM**: For each \\( x \\) derived from the divisors, compute the corresponding \\( y \\) and then the LCM of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Track the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n        i += 1\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nd = abs(a - b)\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    for g in divisors:\n        x = ((a + g - 1) // g) * g\n        if a <= b:\n            y = x + d\n        else:\n            y = x - d\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n        current_k = x - a\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = current_k\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if current_k < best_k:\n                best_k = current_k\n    print(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Divisor Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all divisors of \\( d \\) by iterating up to the square root of \\( d \\) and collecting both the divisor and its complement.\n\n2. **Main Logic**: After reading the input values \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), we compute \\( d \\). If \\( d \\) is zero, \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), and any \\( k \\) will result in the same value, so we output 0.\n\n3. **Processing Each Divisor**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), we compute the smallest \\( x \\) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and greater than or equal to \\( a \\). Depending on whether \\( a \\) is less than or greater than \\( b \\), we compute \\( y \\) accordingly.\n\n4. **LCM Calculation**: For each \\( x \\), we compute the corresponding \\( y \\) and then the LCM. We keep track of the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and the relationship between LCM and GCD.",
