He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, which must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C added them. The count can be equal to both, but that's also allowed.\n\nThe string I'm given must satisfy these conditions. So, I need to verify:\n\n1. The string must consist of only 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. Any deviation from this order is a 'NO'.\n\n2. The count of 'c's (let's call it c_count) must be equal to the count of 'a's or to the count of 'b's.\n\nAlso, since each step appends to the end, the string structure must be non-decreasing in terms of the character sequence. So 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nSo, the steps for checking are:\n\nFirst, split the string into three parts: the initial a's, then the b's, then the c's. If any other characters are present or the order is violated, it's invalid.\n\nWait, but what about cases where after some 'a's come 'b's, but then 'a's again? That would be invalid because the string should have only a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo, the string must be structured as follows: all a's first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nSo, how can I check that?\n\nI can loop through the string and ensure that once a 'b' is encountered, all subsequent characters are either 'b' or 'c', and once a 'c' is encountered, all subsequent are 'c's. Also, any 'a's after the first part would invalidate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can split the string into groups of consecutive same characters and check that the groups are in the order a, b, c. So the group list must be exactly ['a's, 'b's, 'c's], no more than that.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement that.\n\nNext, after verifying the structure, we need to check that the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\nBut wait, the counts are:\n\n- a_count is the number of 'a's.\n- b_count is the number of 'b's.\n- c_count is the number of 'c's.\n\nThen, c_count must be equal to a_count OR b_count.\n\nAdditionally, the string must have at least one of each character. Because in the process, B appends some 'b's, so after A gives it to B, the string has at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's, so the final string must have at least one 'c' as well.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check the structure of the string: a's followed by b's followed by c's. No mixing.\n\n2. Ensure that each of 'a', 'b', 'c' occurs at least once.\n\n3. Check that c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the input string S.\n\nLet me create a function to check the structure.\n\nApproach for structure check:\n\nLoop through each character in S:\n\n- Initially, allow a's.\n- Once a 'b' is found, switch to allowing b's or c's.\n- Once a 'c' is found, only allow c's.\n\nAny deviation makes the string invalid.\n\nAlso, if after the initial a's, we encounter a character that's not 'b', it's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, after the b's, any character that's not 'c' is invalid.\n\nMoreover, if after the c's, any other character is present, it's invalid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nstate can be 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n\nstart with state = 'a'\n\nfor each char in S:\n\n   if state is 'a':\n\n      if char is 'a': continue\n\n      elif char is 'b': state = 'b'\n\n      else: invalid.\n\n   elif state is 'b':\n\n      if char is 'b': continue\n\n      elif char is 'c': state = 'c'\n\n      else: invalid.\n\n   elif state is 'c':\n\n      if char is 'c': continue\n\n      else: invalid.\n\nIf the entire loop completes without issues, then the structure is correct.\n\nAdditionally, we need to check that all three states were active. Because during the process, B",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The string must follow a strict order where 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must be structured such that all 'a's appear first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. This can be verified by iterating through the string and ensuring each character follows the correct order.\n2. **Count Each Character**: After verifying the structure, count the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Additionally, ensure that each character ('a', 'b', 'c') appears at least once in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check the structure: a's followed by b's followed by c's\nstructure_valid = True\nstate = 'a'\nfor char in s:\n    if state == 'a':\n        if char == 'a':\n            continue\n        elif char == 'b':\n            state = 'b'\n        else:\n            structure_valid = False\n            break\n    elif state == 'b':\n        if char == 'b':\n            continue\n        elif char == 'c':\n            state = 'c'\n        else:\n            structure_valid = False\n            break\n    elif state == 'c':\n        if char != 'c':\n            structure_valid = False\n            break\n\nif not structure_valid:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Now check counts\n    a_count = s.count('a')\n    b_count = s.count('b')\n    c_count = s.count('c')\n    \n    # All counts must be at least 1\n    if a_count < 1 or b_count < 1 or c_count < 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The code iterates through each character of the string, maintaining a state that transitions from 'a' to 'b' to 'c'. If any character violates this order, the structure is deemed invalid.\n2. **Count Validation**: After confirming the structure, the code counts the occurrences of each character. It then checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If both the structure and count conditions are satisfied, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach ensures that the string adheres to the specified formation process and constraints efficiently.",
