There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house contributes a squared value of its height to the total profit. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to assign heights to each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a dynamic programming problem because for each spot, the choice of height depends on the previous choices, especially considering overlapping restrictions.\n\nWait, but n and m are up to 50, which isn't too bad. So maybe a DP approach where we track the possible maximums for each interval could work. Alternatively, since the constraints are on intervals, perhaps we can model it by considering the earliest and latest positions where a restriction applies.\n\nAnother thought: each restriction [l_i, r_i] requires that the maximum in that range is <= x_i. So, for each position j, the height assigned must be <= some value determined by all overlapping restrictions that include j.\n\nWait, but each restriction is a separate condition. So for a given j, all the restrictions that cover j (i.e., l_i <= j <= r_i) must have their x_i >= the maximum height in their respective ranges. That means, for each j, the height a_j must be <= min of all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i]. Also, a_j cannot exceed h.\n\nWait, no. Because each restriction [l_i, r_i] imposes that the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. So for any j in that interval, a_j can be at most x_i, but also, the maximum across that interval must not exceed x_i.\n\nSo, for each j, the maximum a_j can be is the minimum of x_i among all restrictions that include j, as well as h. So for each j, a_j can be up to min{ x_i for all i where l_i <= j <= r_i } and also up to h.\n\nWait, but that's only if the min is less than h. Otherwise, a_j can be up to h.\n\nSo first, for each position j, we can compute the maximum allowed height based on all restrictions that cover it. The maximum allowed height for j is the minimum between h and all x_i for restrictions covering j.\n\nWait, but the restrictions may overlap. For example, if j is covered by multiple restrictions, then a_j must be <= each x_i, so the maximum a_j can be is the minimum of those x_i's.\n\nBut wait, even if a_j is set to that minimum, we also need to ensure that for every restriction that includes j, the maximum in their interval doesn't exceed x_i. So it's not just about individual j's maximum, but also about the maximum within each restriction's interval.\n\nSo the initial idea of considering for each j the minimal x_i across all covering restrictions is necessary but not sufficient. Because even if each j's a_j is under its own min, the max in any restriction's interval might still exceed x_i if some a_j in that interval is larger than others.\n\nFor example, suppose two spots j and k are both covered by a restriction [j, k] with x=3. If j is set to 2 and k is set to 4 (but 4 is below h), then the max in the interval is 4, which exceeds x=3. So the initial approach would fail here.\n\nAh, right. So the problem is more complex because the restrictions are about the maximum in the interval. So it's not just about each spot's individual maximum but the maximum in each interval.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to interval constraints on the maximum, which makes it challenging. How can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the restrictions impose that for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum a_j in that interval is at most x_i. So, for each such interval, the maximum of a_l to a_r must be <= x_i.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, tracking for each position the maximum allowed up to that point.\n\nBut the exact way to model this is unclear.\n\nWait, another angle: the constraints can be seen as upper bounds on the maximum in certain ranges. To satisfy all constraints, for each j, the maximum allowed a_j is the minimum x_i across all constraints that include j. But this is a necessary condition, but not sufficient as shown earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for each position j the maximum possible a_j, which is the minimum of all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i], and also h. Then, the optimal solution would be to set each a_j to this maximum possible value, but ensuring that for every restriction [l_i, r_i], the maximum in that interval is <= x_i.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that? Because even if each a_j is set to the minimal required, some restriction's interval may have a higher maximum than allowed.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is to compute the maximum possible a_j for each j, considering all applicable restrictions, and then check whether the maximum in each restriction's interval is <= x_i. If that's already satisfied, then we can proceed. Otherwise, we need to adjust some a_j's.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm. Maybe we can model this as a graph of dependencies. Each a_j is constrained by the x_i's of the restrictions that include it. Additionally, the maximum within each restriction's interval must not exceed x_i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using dynamic programming where for each position, we track the current maximum and ensure that for each interval, the maximum doesn't exceed x_i.\n\nWait, but the DP state needs to capture enough information to enforce all the constraints. For instance, when moving through the spots, we need to know the maximum height in the current and previous intervals that could affect future decisions.\n\nThis seems complicated, but given the small constraints (n up to 50), maybe it's manageable.\n\nAnother idea: for each restriction, [l_i, r_i] must have max(a_l, ..., a_r) <= x_i. So, the maximum in that interval can't be more than x_i. So for each such interval, the maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i.\n\nWe can think of these as constraints that must be satisfied. So, the problem becomes finding a_j's that satisfy all these constraints, and maximize the sum of squares.\n\nThis feels like an optimization problem with inequality constraints.\n\nHow can we model this? One approach is to model it as a graph where each node represents a possible state, and edges represent transitions that satisfy the constraints. However, the state space would likely be too large for n=50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use memoization with dynamic programming, tracking the maximum in certain intervals as we build up the solution.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position j, we can track the maximum height up to j, considering all possible constraints that end before or at j. But I'm not sure how to structure this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering all the restrictions and their impact on the possible a_j's.\n\nWait, another angle: for each restriction [l_i, r_i], the maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. So, for any j in [l_i, r_i], a_j can be at most x_i, but also, the maximum in the interval must not exceed x_i. So, for the interval, at least one a_j must be exactly x_i if all others are x_i or lower, but that's not necessarily required—just that the maximum is at most x_i.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution will set as many a_j as possible to their maximum allowed values, provided that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut again, the problem is ensuring that each constraint's interval's maximum is <= x_i.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each j, compute the maximum allowed a_j as the minimum of h and all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i].\n\n2. Then, for each restriction [l, r], check if the maximum a_j in [l..r] is <= x_i. If yes, proceed. If not, then we need to reduce some a_j's in [l..r] so that the maximum is <= x_i.\n\n3. The challenge is to find which a_j's to reduce in each interval to minimize the loss in profit while satisfying all constraints.\n\nBut how to model this efficiently.\n\nHmm, but this seems like a system of inequalities that needs to be satisfied. For example, for each interval [l, r], the maximum of a_l ... a_r <= x_i.\n\nEach a_j can be at most some value, say b_j = min(x_i for all i where j is in [l_i, r_i], h).\n\nSo, the initial a_j's are set to b_j, which gives the maximum possible without considering the constraints' maximum per interval.\n\nBut then, for each restriction, we need to ensure that the maximum in its interval is <= x_i.\n\nIf for all restrictions, the initial a_j's satisfy this, then we're done. Otherwise, we have to reduce some a_j's in the interval to bring the maximum down.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nThis seems like a problem that could be modeled as a graph where each node represents a position, and edges represent the constraints. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each restriction, the maximum a_j in [l, r] must be <= x_i. So, for each such restriction, the maximum of a_l to a_r must be <= x_i.\n\nSo, for all i, the maximum of a[l_i ... r_i] <= x_i.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that for each i, the maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing a_j's such that for each i, max(a_j for j in [l_i, r_i]) <= x_i, and a_j <= b_j, and maximize sum(a_j^2).\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nOne way is to model it as a linear programming problem. But since the variables are integers, it's integer programming, which is NP-hard. But given the small constraints (n=50, m=50), perhaps we can find a way.\n\nBut implementing an integer programming solution is probably not feasible for a competition setting.\n\nAnother approach: since the constraints are on the maximum in certain intervals, perhaps we can model the problem by determining for each interval the maximum allowed, and then propagating these constraints to other intervals.\n\nWait, but the constraints are interdependent because some intervals may overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents the maximum allowed a_j up to that point, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to consider the constraints as a set of overlapping intervals and find a way to set the a_j's such that all constraints are met.\n\nLet me think differently: for each position j, the maximum allowed a_j is b_j as defined earlier. Then, for each restriction [l, r], the maximum a_j in [l, r] must be <= x_i. So, for each such restriction, we can say that the maximum a_j in [l, r] is min(current_max_in_interval, x_i). But how to model this.\n\nWait, but for each restriction, the maximum in its interval can't be more than x_i. So, for the entire interval, the maximum can't exceed x_i. So, for each i, we can think that the maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] is at most x_i.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to process each restriction and enforce that the maximum in their interval is <= x_i.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: for each interval [l, r], the maximum a_j in this interval must be <= x_i. So, for each such interval, at least one of the a_j's must be <= x_i. But no, that's not correct. The maximum is the largest a_j in the interval; it has to be <= x_i.\n\nSo, for the interval [l, r], the maximum a_j in that interval must be <= x_i.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to consider that for each interval [l, r], the maximum a_j in that interval is the minimum of all the x_i's that apply to that interval and any overlapping ones.\n\nWait, but that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where nodes represent the possible maximums of certain intervals, and edges represent transitions when adding a new interval. But this seems vague.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem using dynamic programming, where for each position j, we track the maximum allowed a_j and the maximum of any overlapping intervals ending at j.\n\nWait, maybe the state can be the maximum in the current run. For example, for each j, we track the maximum a_j so far, and for each j, we know which restrictions apply to it.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each position j, we can keep track of the maximum a_j in all intervals that end at j. Then, for each new interval [l, r], we can update the maximums accordingly.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the problem as a DAG where each node represents the current maximum in a certain interval, and edges represent adding a new spot and updating the maximum.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here. Let's think of another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution is to assign each a_j as high as possible, subject to all the constraints. So, the initial step is to set each a_j to b_j, as defined earlier.\n\nThen, for each restriction, check if the maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] is greater than x_i. If so, we need to reduce some a_j's in that interval to make the maximum <= x_i.\n\nThe question is: how to choose which a_j's to reduce to minimize the loss in the profit, while still keeping the maximum in the interval <= x_i.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis sounds like a problem where for each restriction, if the initial a_j's exceed x_i, we have to find a way to reduce some a_j's in the interval to x_i or lower, in such a way that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut the problem is that multiple restrictions may overlap, and changing one a_j can affect multiple constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps the way forward is to model this as a graph where each node represents a possible state of a_j's, but given the size, this is impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a system of constraints and find the optimal a_j's that satisfy all constraints and maximize the sum of squares.\n\nAnother thought: since the sum of squares is a convex function, the maximum occurs at the boundaries. So, the optimal a_j's are either at their maximum possible value (b_j) or at some lower value determined by the constraints.\n\nWait, but since the constraints are on the maximum in certain intervals, perhaps the optimal solution can be found by considering each constraint and setting the a_j's in their interval to the minimal possible values that satisfy the constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node represents the maximum allowed a_j up to that point, and transitions are made based on the constraints.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me consider that each a_j can be at most b_j, and for each restriction [l, r], the maximum a_j in [l, r] must be <= x_i.\n\nSo, for each j, a_j <= b_j.\n\nAnd for each i, max_{j=l_i..r_i} a_j <= x_i.\n\nSo, the problem is to select a_j's within their b_j limits, such that for each i, the maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nThis looks like an optimization problem with inequality constraints.\n\nIn such cases, perhaps the optimal solution is to set each a_j as high as possible, but ensuring that for each restriction, the maximum in its interval is <= x_i.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Compute b_j for each j as min(h, min{x_i for all i where l_i <= j <= r_i}).\n\n2. For each restriction i, check if the current maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] (which is b_j's maximum) is <= x_i. If yes, leave it as is. If not, we need to reduce some a_j's in [l_i, r_i] to ensure the maximum is <= x_i.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nWait, but the initial a_j's are all set to b_j. So, for each restriction i, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is the maximum of b_j's in that interval. So, if this maximum is > x_i, then we need to reduce some a_j's in that interval.\n\nSo, for each such restriction, we can compute the maximum in its interval, and if it's larger than x_i, we need to find a way to reduce the a_j's in the interval so that their maximum is <= x_i.\n\nBut the problem is that multiple restrictions may overlap, so changing a_j in one interval affects others.\n\nThis suggests that we need to process all the constraints and find a way to adjust the a_j's to satisfy all.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a graph where each node represents a position, and edges represent the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position j, the maximum a_j can be is min(b_j, x_i) for all i where j is in [l_i, r_i]. Wait, no. Because for each i, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. So, for j in [l_i, r_i], a_j can be up to x_i, but the maximum in the interval must not exceed x_i.\n\nSo, the initial approach where a_j is set to min(b_j, x_i) for each i covering j is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that other a_j's in the same interval may be higher.\n\nWait, but in the initial setup, a_j is set to min(b_j, ...), which is the minimal possible from all constraints. But that doesn't ensure that the maximum in any interval is <= x_i.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the initial setup may have a maximum in an interval that is higher than x_i.\n\nThus, the solution is to find a way to adjust a_j's in such a way that for each interval, the maximum is <= x_i, and the sum of squares is as large as possible.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem, but solving it optimally is challenging.\n\nGiven the small constraints, perhaps the solution can be found by enumerating all possibilities, but that's probably not efficient.\n\nWait, but considering that n is up to 50, trying all possibilities is impossible. So, another approach is needed.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can model the problem using a bitmask or binary representation for each a_j, but that's not feasible for n=50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a series of intervals where each a_j is constrained by the minimal x_i in their coverage, and the maximal in each restriction's interval.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints can be processed in a way that for each interval, the maximum is set to the minimal x_i in that interval.\n\nWait, but the x_i's vary per restriction, and the same j can be in multiple restrictions.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find for each j the maximum possible a_j such that:\n\na_j <= b_j,\n\nand for each restriction i where j is in [l_i, r_i], the maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] <= x_i.\n\nSo, the maximum a_j for each j is the minimum of b_j and the minimal x_i across all restrictions that include j, but also ensuring that for any restriction i, the maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to model this as a graph where each node represents the maximum a_j in the current interval, and for each new spot, we decide the a_j value, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, let's try to model the problem with dynamic programming.\n\nLet's define dp[j][current_max] as the maximum profit achievable up to position j, with the maximum a_j being current_max. However, this seems memory-intensive, but for n=50 and h=50, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but how do we manage the constraints for all the intervals that include j? Because j could be part of multiple intervals.\n\nHmm, perhaps the DP state needs to track the maximum in the current and all relevant intervals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP state can track the maximum a_j up to the current position, and for each new position, we can consider the new maximums for all overlapping intervals.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a system of constraints on the a_j's, and the objective is to maximize the sum of squares under these constraints.\n\nThis is a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.\n\nBut solving such a problem exactly is computationally intensive for larger n and m, but given the small constraints, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, but with n=50, it's 50 variables. Solving a quadratic program for 50 variables is not trivial, especially in a competition setting.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the constraints can be represented as a graph where each node represents a spot, and edges represent the constraints between them. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding the tightest constraints for each interval and enforcing those.\n\nLet me think of the example given.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1-1 with x=1.\n\n2-2 with x=3.\n\n3-3 with x=2.\n\nSo, for j=1, the maximum allowed is min(3, 1) = 1.\n\nFor j=2, the maximum allowed is min(3, 3) =3.\n\nFor j=3, min(3, 2) =2.\n\nSo, initial a_j's are [1,3,2]. The sum is 14.\n\nNow, check all restrictions:\n\nRestriction 1: 1-1, max is 1 <=1: okay.\n\nRestriction 2: 2-2, max is 3 <=3: okay.\n\nRestriction 3: 3-3, max is 2 <=2: okay.\n\nSo, all constraints are satisfied.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2-3 with x=8.\n\n3-4 with x=7.\n\nSo, for j=1: no constraints except h=10.\n\nFor j=2: min(10, 8) =8.\n\nj=3: min(10, 8,7) =7.\n\nj=4: min(10,7)=7.\n\nSo, initial a_j's are [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nCheck constraints:\n\nRestriction 2-3: max in 2-3 is 8, which is <=8: okay.\n\nRestriction 3-4: max is7, which is <=7: okay.\n\nSo, all constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo, in this case, the initial assignment works.\n\nBut what if in a different scenario, the initial a_j's don't satisfy a particular restriction.\n\nLike, suppose a restriction [2,3] with x=5, and after setting a_2=6, a_3=5, but the initial a_j's would have a_2=6 because it's allowed by some other constraint. But for the restriction [2,3], the maximum is 6>5, which violates the constraint.\n\nSo, in this case, we need to reduce either a_2 or a_3 to 5 or lower.\n\nBut how to choose which to minimize the loss.\n\nIn such a case, perhaps the optimal is to set a_2=5 and a_3=5, but that may not be the case if a_3 is involved in other constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a_3 can be set to 5, and a_2 can stay at 6 if it's allowed elsewhere, but no, because the restriction [2,3] requires that the maximum is <=5.\n\nSo, in that case, a_2 must be <=5.\n\nWait, but in the initial setup, a_2 was set to 6 because it's allowed by another restriction. So, the problem is that the initial setup may violate some constraints.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute b_j for each j as min of h and all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i].\n\n2. For each restriction i, compute the maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] in the initial setup. If it's >x_i, then we need to adjust the a_j's in [l_i, r_i] so that their maximum is <=x_i.\n\n3. Find the optimal way to adjust the a_j's in each such interval to minimize the loss in the sum of squares, while ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each such restriction i, we can create a sub-problem where the a_j's in [l_i, r_i] are adjusted to have their maximum <=x_i, while the rest can remain as per the initial setup.\n\nBut the issue is that the a_j's in [l_i, r_i] may be part of other restrictions as well. So, adjusting them for one restriction may affect others.\n\nBut given the small constraints, perhaps we can model this as a series of constraints and use backtracking or memoization to find the optimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to find for each j the maximum possible a_j, ensuring that all constraints are met.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints can be represented as a graph where each node represents a j, and edges represent the constraints that a_j's maximum in an interval is <= x_i. But I'm not seeing a clear way to model this.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the problem can be reduced to a graph where each node is a j, and for each restriction, we add edges that require that a_j's in [l_i, r_i] cannot exceed x_i. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where each node represents a j, and edges represent the constraints that a_j <= some value, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node represents the current state of a_j's, but with n=50, this is not feasible.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by first computing the initial a_j's and then for each restriction that is violated, we find the earliest j in the interval where a_j can be reduced to x_i, thereby minimizing the impact on the sum.\n\nWait, but this is a greedy approach and may not yield the optimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each restriction, we can identify the positions in the interval where a_j is higher than x_i and must be reduced.\n\nWait, but how to choose which positions to reduce.\n\nAnother idea: for each restriction, the maximum in the interval must be <= x_i. So, for the interval, the maximum a_j is the maximum of the a_j's in that interval. So, to satisfy the constraint, at least one a_j in the interval must be <=x_i. Or wait, no: the maximum is the largest a_j in the interval, so all a_j's in the interval must be <=x_i, and at least one is equal to x_i.\n\nNo, that's not correct. The maximum is the largest a_j in the interval, which must be <=x_i. So, all a_j's in the interval must be <=x_i, but at least one is exactly x_i (if the maximum is x_i). Wait, no: for example, if all a_j's are <=x_i, then the maximum is automatically <=x_i.\n\nWait, no. Suppose all a_j's in the interval are <=x_i. Then the maximum is <=x_i. So, the constraint is satisfied.\n\nSo, the maximum in the interval is the maximum of the a_j's in that interval. So, for each restriction, the maximum must be <=x_i. Which is equivalent to all a_j's in the interval being <=x_i.\n\nBecause if any a_j is >x_i, then the maximum is >x_i, which violates the constraint.\n\nSo, for each restriction, all a_j's in [l_i, r_i] must be <=x_i.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nYes! Because the maximum of the a_j's in the interval must be <=x_i. So, all a_j's in the interval must be <=x_i, and the maximum is the largest among them.\n\nSo, for each restriction i, all a_j in [l_i, r_i] must be <=x_i.\n\nThat's a crucial insight! So, the problem is to find a_j's such that:\n\nFor each j, a_j <= b_j, where b_j is min of h and all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i].\n\nAdditionally, for each i, all a_j in [l_i, r_i] must be <=x_i.\n\nWait, but wait: for a restriction i, the maximum a_j in [l_i, r_i] must be <=x_i. So, for all j in [l_i, r_i], a_j must be <=x_i.\n\nYes! So, this is a much simpler way to model the problem.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\n- a_j <= b_j for each j.\n\n- For each i, a_j <=x_i for all j in [l_i, r_i].\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting a_j's that are <= their b_j and <=x_i for all restrictions that cover j, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nWait, but wait: for j in [l_i, r_i], a_j must be <=x_i for all i. So, for j, a_j must be <= the minimum of b_j and all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i].\n\nWait, no. Because for j, a_j must be <=x_i for each i where j is in [l_i, r_i]. So, a_j must be <= the minimum of all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i], and also <=h.\n\nWhich is exactly the b_j as defined earlier.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign a_j's such that a_j <=b_j for each j, and for each restriction i, a_j <=x_i for all j in [l_i, r_i]. The goal is to maximize the sum of squares of a_j's.\n\nWait, that's a much simpler way to model it!\n\nSo, the initial approach was correct: for each j, a_j can be at most the minimum of h and all x_i's that include j in their interval.\n\nBut also, for each restriction i, all a_j's in [l_i, r_i] must be <=x_i.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nFor each j: a_j <= b_j.\n\nFor each i: for all j in [l_i, r_i], a_j <=x_i.\n\nSo, the problem is now to find a_j's that satisfy these constraints and maximize the sum of squares.\n\nThis is a much clearer formulation.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nWe can model this as a problem where for each j, a_j has an upper bound of b_j, and for each i, all a_j in [l_i, r_i] have an upper bound of x_i.\n\nThis is a problem of maximizing the sum of squares with multiple upper bounds on variables.\n\nThis is a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints. Unfortunately, it's NP-hard, but given the small constraints (n=50), perhaps a brute-force approach is manageable.\n\nWait, but n=50 variables, each can take up to 50 values (since h is up to 50). So, the total number of possibilities is 50^50, which is completely infeasible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother idea: the optimal a_j's will be either their b_j or some x_i that covers j, whichever is smaller. Because higher a_j's contribute more to the sum, so we want to set them as high as possible within the constraints.\n\nSo, for each j, a_j can be set to min(b_j, x_i) for all i that include j.\n\nWait, but no: because for a particular i, x_i may be smaller than some x_j's for j in [l_i, r_i]. So, for j in [l_i, r_i], a_j must be <=x_i, but also <=b_j.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal a_j is the minimum of b_j and all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i].\n\nWait, but that's exactly what b_j is. Because b_j is min(h, min x_i over all i covering j). So, a_j is <=b_j.\n\nBut the constraints for each i further restrict a_j's in their interval.\n\nWait, but for a particular i, the x_i could be lower than the b_j's for some j in [l_i, r_i]. So, a_j's in [l_i, r_i] must be <=x_i, which may be lower than their b_j.\n\nSo, for each j, a_j can be at most min(b_j, x_i) for all i where j is in [l_i, r_i].\n\nBut wait, no. Because for each i, the a_j's in [l_i, r_i] must be <=x_i. So, for j, a_j must be <=x_i for all i where j is in [l_i, r_i]. So, a_j's upper bound is the minimum of all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i], and also <=h.\n\nWhich is exactly the definition of b_j.\n\nSo, for each j, a_j can be up to b_j, but also, for each i that includes j, a_j must be <=x_i.\n\nWait, but that's already considered in b_j. Because b_j is the minimum of all x_i's that include j, along with h.\n\nSo, for each j, a_j can be up to b_j, which already satisfies all x_i's for i that include j.\n\nWait, no. Because b_j is min(h, min x_i for i covering j). So, a_j can be up to b_j, which is <=x_i for all i covering j.\n\nBecause for each i that covers j, x_i >= min x_i, which is part of b_j's calculation.\n\nSo, if a_j is <=b_j, then for all i covering j, a_j <=x_i.\n\nThus, the constraints for each i are automatically satisfied if a_j's are set to <=b_j.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because for a particular i, the x_i may be lower than the b_j for some j in [l_i, r_i]. So, setting a_j to b_j would violate the constraint for i.\n\nWait, no, because b_j is min(x_i for i covering j). So, for any i that covers j, x_i >= the min x_i, which is part of b_j's calculation. So, b_j <=x_i for all i that cover j.\n\nThus, a_j <=b_j implies a_j <=x_i for all i covering j.\n\nSo, the constraints for each i are automatically satisfied if a_j's are <=b_j.\n\nWait, that's a critical insight! So, the initial approach of setting a_j's to their b_j's is sufficient to satisfy all constraints.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier example where setting a_j's to their b_j's could have a maximum in a restriction's interval exceeding x_i.\n\nWait, let's re-examine.\n\nIn the earlier example, suppose:\n\nn=3, h=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\ni=1: l=1, r=3, x=2.\n\nSo, for j=1, x_i is 2.\n\nj=2: x_i is 2.\n\nj=3: x_i is 2.\n\nSo, b_j for each j is min(3, 2) =2.\n\nSo, a_j's are [2,2,2].\n\nSum is 12.\n\nNow, for each restriction:\n\nFor i=1, the interval is 1-3, maximum a_j is 2 <=x_i=2: okay.\n\nSo, all constraints are satisfied.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=2, h=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\ni=1: l=1, r=2, x=2.\n\ni=2: l=1, r=2, x=3.\n\nSo, for j=1, x_i's are 2 and 3. The min is 2.\n\nFor j=2, x_i's are 2 and3. Min is 2.\n\nSo, b_j's are 2 and 2.\n\nSo, a_j's are [2,2]. Sum is 8.\n\nNow, for i=1: maximum is 2 <=2: okay.\n\nFor i=2: maximum is 2 <=3: okay.\n\nSo, all constraints are satisfied.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, h=3.\n\nRestriction 1: l=1, r=2, x=1.\n\nRestriction 2: l=1, r=2, x=2.\n\nSo, for j=1, x_i's are 1 and 2. Min is 1.\n\nFor j=2, x_i's are 1 and 2. Min is 1.\n\nSo, b_j's are 1 and 1.\n\nSo, a_j's are [1,1]. Sum is 2.\n\nBut what if we could set a_j=1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to build houses on a street such that the total profit from the houses is maximized while adhering to given zoning restrictions. Each house contributes a profit equal to the square of its height, and each restriction limits the maximum height of houses in a specific range.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each restriction specifies a range of spots and a maximum allowable height. For each spot, the height of the house must be less than or equal to the minimum of all applicable restrictions' heights and the global maximum height `h`.\n\n2. **Compute Maximum Allowed Heights**: For each spot, compute the maximum allowed height as the minimum of `h` and the smallest height allowed by any restriction that covers that spot.\n\n3. **Check Validity of Restrictions**: Ensure that for each restriction, the maximum height in its specified range does not exceed the given limit.

Each restriction is stored as a tuple with adjusted 0-based indices.\n\n2. **Compute Maximum Allowed Heights**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by considering the smallest value among all applicable restrictions and the global maximum height `h`.\n\n3. **Check Constraints**: For each restriction, iterate through the specified range to ensure that no spot's height exceeds the restriction's limit. If any spot violates a restriction, the solution is marked invalid.\n\n4. **Calculate Profit**: If all constraints are satisfied, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the heights of all spots.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the profit while respecting all zoning restrictions efficiently.",
