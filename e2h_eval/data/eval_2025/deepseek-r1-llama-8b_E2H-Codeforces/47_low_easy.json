His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to understand what affects the LCM when we add k to both a and b. Wait, let's think about the expressions (a + k) and (b + k). Since they are being added by the same k, their difference remains the same as (b - a), but wait, no, because if a < b, then b +k - (a +k) = b -a. So the difference between them is fixed.\n\nWait, that's an important observation. The difference between a +k and b +k is the same as the original difference between a and b. Because (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So the two numbers are always d apart, where d is |a - b|. Or wait, actually, if a > b, then the difference would be negative, but since we take absolute value, it's the same as |a - b|.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y such that y = x + d, and we want to minimize the LCM of x and y, where x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\nWait, but since d is fixed, maybe I should compute d first. Let me set d = |a - b|. Because if a and b are equal, then any k will result in the same pair, so the LCM is just a +k. So in that case, the minimal LCM is achieved when a +k is as small as possible, which is when k=0. So output 0.\n\nSo for the general case where a != b, d is positive. Let's assume without loss of generality that a < b, so d = b - a. Then, x = a +k, y = x + d.\n\nWe need to find x such that x >= a (since k is non-negative), and y = x +d, so y >= x +1 (since d is at least 1, because a and b are different).\n\nWait, but if a equals b, then d is zero, so y = x. So the LCM is x, which is minimized when x is as small as possible, i.e., k=0.\n\nSo, the key is when a and b are different. So, the problem becomes: given two numbers x and x +d, find x such that LCM(x, x+d) is minimized.\n\nOur task is to find the minimal possible LCM(x, x +d) over x >= a, x +d >= b, but since x can be anything as long as it's >= a and x +d >= b, but wait, because k is non-negative, x must be >= a, and y =x +d must be >= b. But since d is b -a, then y = x +d = x + (b -a). Since x >= a, then y >= a + (b -a) = b. So y is automatically >= b, so the only condition is x >= a.\n\nSo, our goal is to find x >= a such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized.\n\nNow, how do we approach this? Let's think about the LCM function. The LCM of two numbers is equal to (x*(x+d)) / GCD(x, x+d). So to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of x and x +d.\n\nWhat's the GCD of x and x +d? Well, GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, (x +d) -x) = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, the GCD is determined by the factors of d and x.\n\nSo, to maximize the GCD, we can try to have x be a divisor of d. Because then, GCD(x, d) = x, which could be a large value, thus reducing the LCM.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because GCD(x, d) is the same as the GCD of x and d. So, if x divides d, then GCD(x, d) is x, but if x doesn't divide d, then it's a smaller number.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal x is a divisor of d. Because that way, the GCD is x, which is as large as possible.\n\nBut wait, x can be larger than d. For example, suppose d is 4. If x is 6, then GCD(",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key observation is that the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) remains constant as \\( |a - b| \\). Let this difference be \\( d \\). Thus, we need to find \\( x = a + k \\) such that \\( x \\) and \\( x + d \\) have the smallest possible LCM.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of two numbers can be expressed as \\( \\text{LCM}(x, x + d) = \\frac{x(x + d)}{\\text{GCD}(x, x + d)} \\). To minimize this, we need to maximize the GCD of \\( x \\) and \\( x + d \\).\n3. **Optimal \\( x \\)**: The optimal \\( x \\) is a divisor of \\( d \\) because this maximizes the GCD, thereby minimizing the LCM. We check all divisors of \\( d \\) to find the smallest \\( k \\) that results in the minimal LCM.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_min_k(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    d = abs(b - a)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    # Find all divisors of d\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            candidate = a + i\n            if candidate >= a and (candidate + d) >= b:\n                current_gcd = math.gcd(candidate, d)\n                current_lcm = (candidate * (candidate + d)) // current_gcd\n                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < (a + best_k)):\n                    min_lcm = current_lcm\n                    best_k = candidate - a\n                # Also check the other divisor\n                candidate = a + d // i\n                if candidate >= a and (candidate + d) >= b:\n                    current_gcd = math.gcd(candidate, d)\n                    current_lcm = (candidate * (candidate + d)) // current_gcd\n                    if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < (a + best_k)):\n                        min_lcm = current_lcm\n                        best_k = candidate - a\n    # Also check when k is 0\n    candidate = a\n    if candidate >= a and (candidate + d) >= b:\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(candidate, d)\n        current_lcm = (candidate * (candidate + d)) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < (a + best_k)):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = candidate - a\n    return best_k\n\n# Read input\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_min_k(a, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is immediately \\( 0 \\) since any \\( k \\) will result in the same value.\n3. **Finding Divisors**: We compute the absolute difference \\( d \\) and find all divisors of \\( d \\). Each divisor is considered as a potential \\( x \\) (i.e., \\( a + k \\)).\n4. **Evaluating Candidates**: For each candidate \\( x \\), we compute the LCM of \\( x \\) and \\( x + d \\). We keep track of the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n5. **Output**: The smallest \\( k \\) that yields the minimal LCM is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and the GCD-LCM relationship.",
