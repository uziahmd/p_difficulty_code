Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. But since we're trying to minimize the number, we want each new card to contribute as much as possible towards balancing the sum.\n\nLet me think: the initial sum is S = sum of the found cards. The target is 0, so the required sum from the additional cards is -S.\n\nBut each additional card can contribute at most x in absolute value. So, the minimal number of cards needed is the absolute value of the required sum divided by x, rounded up.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nFor example, if S is 5 and x is 3. Then we need 5/3 → 2 cards (since 3*1=3 <5, 3*2=6>=5).\n\nAnother example: if S is 4, x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333, so we need 2 cards.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |S| / x.\n\nWait, but wait—what about when the sum is exactly divisible by x?\n\nLike S=6 and x=3. Then 6/3=2, so 2 cards.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute the required sum: target = -S.\n3. The minimal number of cards is the smallest k such that k * x >= |target|. Or, in other words, k = ceil(|target| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if target is zero? Then no additional cards are needed.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the input: n and x, then the list of n integers.\n- Compute S as the sum of those integers.\n- If S is zero, output 0.\n- Else, compute |S|, divide by x, round up to get the minimal k.\n\nWait, but what about the case where S is negative? Like S = -5, x=3. Then target is 5, which divided by 3 is 2 (since 5/3 is ~1.666, so 2).\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCompute s = sum of the found cards.\n\nIf s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    required = abs(s)\n    min_cards = (required + x -1) // x   # This is equivalent to ceiling division.\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but let's test with examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S is (-1) +1 +2 = 2.\n\nSo required is 2, x is 2.\n\nSo 2/2=1 → 1 card.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4.\n\nAbsolute is 4. x is 3.\n\n4 /3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2.\n\nWhich matches the second sample.\n\nWhat about another case:\n\nn=1, x=5.\n\nFound card is 3.\n\nSum is 3.\n\nSo required is 3.\n\n3/5 is 0.6 → ceiling is 1. So one card of -3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=1, x=5.\n\nFound card is 5.\n\nSum is 5.\n\nRequired is 5 → 5/5=1. So one card of -5.\n\nAnother case: sum is 7, x=3.\n\n7/3 is 2.333 → 3 cards.\n\nBecause 3*3=9 ≥7.\n\nWait, 3 cards would be 3*3=9, which is enough.\n\nSo yes.\n\nWhat about sum is 0? Then no cards needed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nSo now, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the first line as n and x.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute their sum.\n\nIf sum is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute required = abs(sum).\n\nmin_cards =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and new) equals zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Vanya has found some cards with specific integers, each within the range from `-x` to `x`.\n   - The goal is to find the minimum number of additional cards such that the total sum of all cards (found and new) is zero.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Calculate the sum of the found cards.\n   - If the sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - If the sum is non-zero, compute the absolute value of the sum. This gives the target sum that the additional cards must achieve to make the total sum zero.\n   - Each additional card can contribute at most `x` in absolute value towards reducing the target sum. Therefore, the minimum number of additional cards required is the ceiling of the target sum divided by `x`.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the sum of the found cards.\n   - If the sum is zero, return 0.\n   - Otherwise, calculate the absolute value of the sum and determine the minimum number of cards using ceiling division.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    required = abs(s)\n    min_cards = (required + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. The second line reads the integers on the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards.\n- **Check for Zero Sum**: If the sum is zero, print 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n- **Calculate Required Cards**: If the sum is non-zero, compute the absolute value of the sum and use ceiling division to determine the minimum number of additional cards needed to balance the sum to zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards required using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
