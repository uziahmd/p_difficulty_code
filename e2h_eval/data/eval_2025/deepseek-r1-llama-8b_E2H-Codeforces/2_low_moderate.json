Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The definition they give is specific. So, Valera's paper is a square with n x n letters, where n is odd. The letters form an 'X' if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, for each test case, I need to:\n\n- Check that the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is all the same character.\n- Check that the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) is all the same character.\n- Ensure that both diagonals have the same character. Wait, no: the problem says both diagonals are the same. So the diagonal and anti-diagonal must consist of the same letter each, but all the other cells must be another single letter.\n\nWait, let me re-read the condition:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nOh right, so the two diagonals must each consist of the same letter, but perhaps different between the two? Or wait, no. Because the first part says both diagonals are the same. So the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must be the same character.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me see the example:\n\nIn the sample input, the second test case is 3x3:\n\nw s w\ns w s\nw s w\n\nSo the main diagonal is w, s, w? No, wait, no. Wait, for n=3, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So the characters are 'w', 'w', 'w'? Because the first row is 'wsw', so position (0,0) is 'w', (1,1) is 'w' (since the second row is 'sws'), (2,2) is 'w'. So main diagonal is all 'w's.\n\nThe anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Looking at each row, (0,2) is 'w', (1,1) is 'w', (2,0) is 'w'. So both diagonals are 'w's.\n\nThen, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from 'w'. So in this case, the non-diagonal cells are 's's. So it's a valid 'X'.\n\nSo for the code, steps are:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. For each grid, check the following:\n\n   a. All elements on the main diagonal are the same character. Let's call this char 'd'.\n\n   b. All elements on the anti-diagonal are the same character. Let's call this char 'a'.\n\n   c. 'd' must equal 'a'? Because both diagonals must be the same letter.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says both diagonals are the same. So 'd' should be equal to 'a'. Otherwise, the condition fails.\n\nBut wait, looking back: the problem says, \"both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same.\" So yes, the main and anti-diagonal must each be the same, and also their letters must be the same as each other.\n\nSo step 2c is to check that d == a.\n\n3. Then, check that all the non-diagonal cells have the same character, which is different from 'd' (and thus same as 'a').\n\nSo how to proceed:\n\nFor each grid:\n\n- Check main diagonal: collect all (i,i) positions. Are they all the same?\n\n- Check anti-diagonal: collect all (i, n-1 -i). Are they all the same?\n\n- Check if the main and anti-diagonal are the same character.\n\n- Then, check all other cells (those not on either diagonal) are the same, and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES; else NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, reading the input. The first line is n, then n lines, each line being a string of n characters.\n\nSo, for example, the sample input has three test cases. Wait, wait no. Wait, the input provided is three strings, each representing a test case. So the first line is 5, followed by five lines. Second test case is 3, etc. So each test case is a separate grid.\n\nWait, but in the sample input",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\". The grid must meet specific conditions regarding its diagonals and non-diagonal elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the grid dimensions and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - Ensure the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) has the same character throughout.\n   - Ensure the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) has the same character throughout.\n3. **Compare Diagonals**: Verify that both the main and anti-diagonals have the same character.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Ensure all elements not on the diagonals are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrids = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndef is_x(grid):\n    # Check main diagonal\n    diag_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        if diag_char is None:\n            diag_char = grid[i][i]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][i] != diag_char:\n                return False\n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    anti_diag_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        j = n - 1 - i\n        if anti_diag_char is None:\n            anti_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != anti_diag_char:\n                return False\n    # Both diagonals must be the same\n    if diag_char != anti_diag_char:\n        return False\n    # All other cells must be the same and different from diag_char\n    other_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue  # skip diagonals\n            current_char = grid[i][j]\n            if other_char is None:\n                other_char = current_char\n            else:\n                if current_char != other_char:\n                    return False\n    # Check if other_char is different from diag_char\n    if other_char == diag_char:\n        return False\n    return True\n\nfor grid in grids:\n    if is_x(grid):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution reads the grid and checks each condition step-by-step:\n1. **Main Diagonal Check**: Iterate through each element of the main diagonal to ensure they are all the same.\n2. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, iterate through each element of the anti-diagonal.\n3. **Diagonal Character Comparison**: Ensure the main and anti-diagonals have the same character.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Elements Check**: Verify all non-diagonal elements are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the grid forms the letter \"X\".",
