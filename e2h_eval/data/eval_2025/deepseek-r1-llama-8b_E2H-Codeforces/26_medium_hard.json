Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on their sides. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides x, y, z. The conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, it's required that x, y, z form a non-degenerate triangle, which means x + y > z must hold because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since z is the largest (because x ≤ y ≤ z), checking x + y > z should suffice.\n\nWait, wait. No, actually, for a triangle, all three conditions must hold: x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z > x. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the most restrictive condition is x + y > z. Because y ≤ z, so z ≥ y, and x ≤ y, so x + y ≤ 2y. So, if x + y > z, then automatically, since z >= y, x + z will be larger than y (as x is positive), and similarly for y + z > x. So yes, checking x + y > z is sufficient.\n\nSo the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nNow, how do I count all possible triples (x, y, z) that satisfy:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\nand x + y > z.\n\nHmm, okay. So the variables are x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]. But we also have the condition x + y > z.\n\nLet me think about how to model this efficiently.\n\nThe brute force approach would be to iterate through all possible x, y, z in their respective ranges and check the condition. But given that A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, that's not feasible. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me consider that for each possible pair (x, y), I can find the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z < x + y and z ≤ D. Then sum over all valid x and y.\n\nBut even that could be O((B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)) operations, which for 5e5 could be 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the variables and see if I can find a mathematical way to express the count.\n\nWe can represent the possible x and y as ranges:\n\nx ranges from A to B,\n\ny ranges from B to C.\n\nFor each x, y, the minimum z is C, the maximum is min(D, x + y - 1). Because z has to be at least C and less than x + y.\n\nSo for each (x, y), the number of valid z's is max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1).\n\nSo the total count is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C] of max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1).\n\nBut again, iterating over all x and y is not feasible.\n\nI need a way to compute this sum efficiently by grouping terms or using some mathematical properties.\n\nLet me think about the sum S = sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C max(0, min(x+y-1, D) - C + 1).\n\nThis can be rewritten as S = sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C [min(x + y - 1, D) >= C] * (min(...) - C + 1).\n\nWhich simplifies to summing over all (x,y) where x + y - 1 >= C, and then for those cases, add (min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a fixed x, the inner sum over y can be computed as:\n\nsum_{y = B}^{C} max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1).\n\nLet me denote for a fixed x, the sum over y is:\n\nsum_y = sum_{y=B}^C [max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1)].\n\nLet me analyze this expression.\n\nWe can split the sum into two parts: where x + y - 1 <= D, and where x + y - 1 > D.\n\nWait, but min(x + y -1, D) is either x + y -1 if it's <= D, else D.\n\nSo for a given x and y, if x + y -1 >= C, then the term is (min(x + y -1, D) - C + 1). Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nSo for each x, we can find the range of y where x + y -1 >= C.\n\nLet me rephrase: x + y -1 >= C => y >= C - x + 1.\n\nBut y has to be >= B, so the lower bound for y is max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nBut wait, y can only be in [B, C], so the lower bound is the maximum between B and (C - x + 1), and the upper bound is C.\n\nIf the lower bound exceeds C, then no y contributes, so sum is zero.\n\nOtherwise, for each y in [lower, C], the term is (min(x + y -1, D) - C + 1).\n\nSo for y in [lower, ... , y_max], where y_max is min(C, D - x + 1 + 1 -1?) Wait, no.\n\nWait, min(x + y -1, D) is D when x + y -1 >= D.\n\nSo for a given y, if x + y -1 >= D, then the term is D - C + 1.\n\nElse, it's x + y -1 - C + 1 = x + y - C.\n\nSo for each y in [lower, ...], we can split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: x + y -1 <= D.\n\nThen the term is x + y - C.\n\nCase 2: x + y -1 > D.\n\nTerm is D - C + 1.\n\nSo for a fixed x, the sum can be broken into two intervals of y.\n\nFirst interval: y such that lower <= y <= y0, where y0 is the maximum y where x + y -1 <= D.\n\ny0 is the maximum y where x + y <= D + 1.\n\nSo y0 = min(C, D + 1 - x).\n\nWait, because x + y -1 <= D => y <= D +1 -x.\n\nSo y can go up to min(C, D +1 - x).\n\nIf D +1 -x < lower, then there are no y's in this case.\n\nSimilarly, the second interval is y > y0, but y can't exceed C.\n\nSo for each x, we can compute:\n\ny_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\nif y_low > C: sum is 0.\n\nelse:\n\ny0 = min(C, D + 1 -x)\n\nif y0 < y_low: all y in [y_low, C] satisfy x + y -1 >= D. So each contributes (D - C + 1).\n\nElse, split into two parts:\n\npart1: y from y_low to y0: each contributes (x + y - C).\n\npart2: y from y0+1 to C: each contributes (D - C + 1).\n\nSo the sum for x is:\n\nsum_part1 = sum_{y=y_low}^{y0} (x + y - C)\nsum_part2 = (C - y0) * (D - C + 1)\ntotal = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nBut wait, what if D is smaller than C? Then D - C +1 is negative, but since z has to be >= C, and D >= C, that can't happen. So in any case, D >= C.\n\nSo now, for each x, we can calculate this sum in O(1) time.\n\nBut considering that x ranges up to 5e5, and for each x, we need to perform this calculation, it's manageable as 5e5 iterations are acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop through each x from A to B.\n\nFor each x:\n\nCompute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\nIf y_low > C: continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute y0 = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n\nIf y0 < y_low: then all y from y_low to C contribute (D - C + 1) each.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute sum_part1 = sum from y=y_low to y=y0 of (x + y - C)\n\nWhich is an arithmetic series. The number of terms is y0 - y_low + 1.\n\nFirst term is x + y_low - C, last term is x + y0 - C.\n\nSum = (number of terms) * (first + last) / 2.\n\nsum_part2 = (C - y0) * (D - C + 1)\n\nTotal for x is sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\nAdd this to the overall sum.\n\nBut wait, what about when x + y -1 < C? Then the term is zero, but we have y_low as the starting point where y >= C -x +1, which implies x + y -1 >= C. So for y >= y_low, x + y -1 >= C.\n\nSo the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo now, the steps:\n\n1. Iterate x from A to B.\n\n2. For each x:\n\n   a. Compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n   \n   b. If y_low > C: continue\n   \n   c. Compute y0 = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n   \n   d. If y0 < y_low: all y in [y_low, C] contribute (D - C + 1)\n   \n      i. count = C - y_low + 1\n      ii. add count * (D - C + 1) to sum\n   \n   e. Else:\n      \n      i. Compute sum_part1: sum of (x + y - C) for y from y_low to y0.\n      \n         This is sum = (x - C) + (x + y_low - C) + ... + (x + y0 - C)\n         \n         Number of terms: y0 - y_low + 1\n         First term: a = x + y_low - C\n         Last term: l = x + y0 - C\n         sum = (a + l) * (y0 - y_low + 1) // 2\n      \n      ii. Compute sum_part2: (C - y0) * (D - C + 1)\n      \n      iii. Total for x is sum_part1 + sum_part2\n      iv. Add this to the global sum.\n\n3. After processing all x, output the sum.\n\nBut wait, another edge case: when x + y -1 < C. That is, for some y >= B, but y < C -x +1. But in our initial step, y_low is set to max(B, C -x +1), which ensures that for y >= y_low, x + y -1 >= C. So for y < y_low, x + y -1 < C, which makes the term zero. So these y's don't contribute anything, hence they can be ignored.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nWe'll loop x from 1 to 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 -1 +1) = max(2, 3) =3.\n\nBut 3> C=3? No, since C is 3. So y_low=3.\n\ny0 = min(3, 4+1 -1) = min(3,4) =3.\n\nSo y0 >= y_low.\n\nsum_part1: y from 3 to 3.\n\nEach term is 1 +3 -3 =1.\n\nsum_part1 = 1.\n\nsum_part2: 3-3=0. So nothing.\n\nTotal for x=1 is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-2+1)= max(2,2)=2.\n\ny0 = min(3, 4+1 -2)= min(3,3)=3.\n\nsum_part1: y from 2 to 3.\n\nFor y=2: 2+2-3=1.\n\ny=3: 2+3-3=2.\n\nSum_part1 is 1+2=3.\n\nsum_part2: 3-3=0.\n\nTotal for x=2: 3.\n\nOverall sum is 1+3=4. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput: 1 2 2 5\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nx runs from 1 to 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2-1+1)=max(2,2)=2.\n\ny0 = min(2,5+1 -1)= min(2,5)=2.\n\nsum_part1: y=2.\n\nterm is 1+2-2=1.\n\nsum_part1=1.\n\nsum_part2: 2-2=0.\n\nTotal x=1:1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2-2+1)=max(2,1)=2.\n\ny0 = min(2,5+1-2)=min(2,4)=2.\n\nsum_part1: y=2: 2+2-2=2.\n\nsum_part1=2.\n\nsum_part2: 0.\n\nTotal x=2:2.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the output is 3.\n\nWait, something's wrong. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate for x=2:\n\ny can be 2.\n\nz must be >=2, <=5.\n\nAnd x + y =4, so z must be <4. But since z >=2, z can be 2 or 3.\n\nSo for x=2, y=2: z can be 2 or 3.\n\nWait, but according to our formula, for x=2, y_low is 2, y0 is min(2, 5+1-2)=4. So y0=2.\n\nsum_part1 is y=2: 2+2-2=2.\n\nsum_part2 is (2-2)* (5-2+1) = 0.\n\nSo x=2 contributes 2.\n\nSo overall sum is 1+2=3, which matches the sample.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought x=2 contributes 3, that was wrong. So the approach works.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nx can only be 500000.\n\ny can only be 500000.\n\nz can be 500000.\n\nCheck x + y > z: 500000 +500000 >500000 → yes.\n\nSo count is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in code.\n\nBut I have to handle large numbers, up to 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize the sum to 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   if y_low > C:\n\n       continue\n\n   y0 = min(C, D +1 - x)\n\n   if y0 < y_low:\n\n       count = C - y_low +1\n\n       sum += count * (D - C +1)\n\n   else:\n\n       # sum_part1\n\n       a = x + y_low - C\n\n       l = x + y0 - C\n\n       num_terms = y0 - y_low +1\n\n       sum_part1 = (a + l) * num_terms // 2\n\n       # sum_part2\n\n       rem = C - y0\n\n       sum_part2 = rem * (D - C +1)\n\n       sum += sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nSo, this should work.\n\nBut wait, what about when D < C?\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it's given that A <= B <= C <= D. So D >= C, so D - C +1 is non-negative.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when C = D.\n\nIn that case, z can only be C.\n\nSo, the condition is x + y > C.\n\nThus, for each x, y >= max(B, C -x +1), and y <= C.\n\nAnd z can only be C, provided x + y > C.\n\nSo, the code correctly computes that.\n\nAnother edge case: when x + y -1 <= D.\n\nFor example, if D is very large, then for all y in [y_low, C], min(x + y -1, D) is x + y -1.\n\nThus, the code correctly uses the sum_part1 for all y in that interval.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, what about when x + y -1 is greater than D? Like when x=1, y=3, D=3.\n\nThen, min is 3, and the term is 3 - C +1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nTesting the code with the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-1+1=3) → 3.\n\ny0 = min(3,4+1 -1=4) →3.\n\nSo y0 >= y_low.\n\nsum_part1: a=1+3-3=1, l=1+3-3=1. num_terms=1.\n\nsum_part1=1*1=1.\n\nsum_part2: 3-3=0.\n\nTotal x=1:1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2,3-2+1=2) →2.\n\ny0= min(3,4+1-2=3) →3.\n\nsum_part1: a=2+2-3=1, l=2+3-3=2. num_terms=2.\n\nsum_part1=(1+2)*2//2=3.\n\nsum_part2: 3-3=0.\n\nTotal x=2:3.\n\nTotal sum is 4.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: 1 2 2 5.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2,2-1+1=2) →2.\n\ny0 = min(2,5+1-1=5) →2.\n\nsum_part1: a=1+2-2=1, l= same. sum is 1.\n\nsum_part2: 2-2=0.\n\nx=1 contributes 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2,2-2+1=1) →2.\n\ny0 = min(2,5+1-2=4) →2.\n\nsum_part1: a=2+2-2=2. sum is 2.\n\nsum_part2: 0.\n\nTotal x=2:2.\n\nSum is 3.\n\nSample 3:\n\nx=5e5.\n\ny_low = max(5e5, 5e5 -5e5 +1) →5e5.\n\ny0 = min(5e5,5e5 +1 -5e5) → min(5e5,1)=1.\n\nWait, wait! Wait, D is 5e5, so D+1 -x =5e5 +1 -5e5=1.\n\ny0 is min(5e5,1) →1.\n\nBut y_low is 5e5, which is >1.\n\nThus, y0 < y_low, so all y in [y_low, C] (which is 5e5) contribute (D - C +1) = (5e5 -5e5 +1) =1.\n\nNumber of y's:5e5 -5e5 +1=1.\n\nSo sum is 1*1=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: when D is less than x + y.\n\nFor example, A=2, B=3, C=4, D=5.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(3,4-2+1=3) →3.\n\ny0 = min(4,5+1-2=4) →4.\n\nsum_part1: y from 3 to4.\n\nFor y=3: 2+3-4=1.\n\ny=4: 2+4-4=2.\n\nSum_part1=1+2=3.\n\nsum_part2: 4-4=0.\n\nTotal x=2:3.\n\nx=3:\n\ny_low = max(3,4-3+1=2) →3.\n\ny0 = min(4,5+1-3=3) →3.\n\nsum_part1: y=3:3+3-4=2.\n\nsum_part2:4-3=1. So 1*(5-4+1) =2.\n\nTotal x=3:2+2=4.\n\nSo overall sum is 3+4=7.\n\nLet me see manually:\n\nPossible x and y:\n\nx=2, y=3: z can be 4,5.\n\nBecause 2+3>4:5>4, yes.\n\nWait, 2+3=5>4. So z can be 4,5.\n\nWait, but according to the code, for x=2, y_low=3, y0=4.\n\nsum_part1 is sum of (2+3-4)+(2+4-4) =1+2=3.\n\nWhich is for y=3 and 4.\n\nBut wait, z must be >=4, <=5.\n\nFor y=3: x+y=5>4, so z can be 4,5.\n\nWait, why does the code say 3?\n\nAh, because in the code, for y=3: the term is min(5,5) -4 +1 →5-4+1=2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for x=2, y=3:\n\nz can be >=4, and < x+y=5.\n\nSo z can be 4.\n\nBecause 5>4 → z can be 4.\n\nWait, x + y =5>4. So z can be 4,5?\n\nNo, wait, the condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo for z=4: 5>4 → yes.\n\nz=5:5>5? No, because it's equal. So z must be less than x+y.\n\nSo for x=2, y=3: z can be 4.\n\nThus, in this case, for y=3, the term is 4 is allowed.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nx=2, y=3: x + y =5.\n\nz can be up to 4, because 5>4, but 5 is not allowed.\n\nSo for z, the maximum allowed is 5-1=4.\n\nWait, but the condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo z can be any value from C to min(D, x + y -1).\n\nIn this case, C=4, x + y -1 =5-1=4.\n\nSo z can be 4.\n\nThus, for y=3, x=2, the number of z's is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4: x=2, y=4: x + y=6>4.\n\nz can be 4 or 5.\n\nSo, for y=3, the term is 1, for y=4, it's 2.\n\nSum_part1 is 1+2=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code correctly counts 3 for x=2.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said that for y=3, the term is 1.\n\nBut according to the code, for x=2, y=3: min(5,5)=5. So 5-4 +1=2.\n\nWait, no: the code says, for each y, the term is min(x + y -1, D) - C +1.\n\nWait, for x=2, y=3: x+y-1=4, D=5.\n\nSo min(4,5)=4.\n\n4 -4 +1=1.\n\nWait, that's different from before.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the code.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nterm = min(x + y -1, D) - C +1.\n\nSo for x=2, y=3: x+y-1=4, D=5. min is 4.\n\nSo term is 4-4 +1=1.\n\nYes. So for y=3: 1.\n\ny=4: x+y-1=5. D=5. min is 5.\n\n5-4+1=2.\n\nSo sum_part1 is 1+2=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, I think the code is correct.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nBut wait, in Python, reading inputs as strings, then splitting.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is four integers per line.\n\nWait, no, the first line is four integers, and the other lines are similar? Or is each line a separate test case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nSo, each test case is one line.\n\nBut the sample shows that the input is ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSo each line is a test case.\n\nThus, the code needs to read each line, split into four integers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A,B,C,D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute sum\n\n    total =0\n\n    for x in range(A, B+1):\n\n        y_low = max(B, C - x +1)\n\n        if y_low > C:\n\n            continue\n\n        y0 = min(C, D +1 -x)\n\n        if y0 < y_low:\n\n            count = C - y_low +1\n\n            add = count * (D - C +1)\n\n            total += add\n\n        else:\n\n            a = x + y_low - C\n\n            l = x + y0 - C\n\n            num = y0 - y_low +1\n\n            sum_p1 = (a + l) * num //2\n\n            sum_p2 = (C - y0) * (D - C +1)\n\n            total += sum_p1 + sum_p2\n\n    print(total)\n\nWait, but for x=5e5, in the third sample, x is 5e5, which is within the loop.\n\nBut in Python, loops from 5e5 may take time. Wait, 5e5 iterations is manageable as each iteration is O(1).\n\nBut let me think: 5e5 is 500,000. Each iteration is simple calculations, so it's acceptable.\n\nTesting this code with the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nLoop x=1 and 2.\n\nAs before, gives 4.\n\nSample 2:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nx=1 and 2.\n\nAs before, sum is 3.\n\nSample3:\n\nA=5e5, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5.\n\nOnly x=5e5.\n\ny_low= max(5e5, 5e5 -5e5 +1)=5e5.\n\ny0= min(5e5,5e5+1 -5e5)=1.\n\nSince y0 < y_low, count=5e5 -5e5 +1=1.\n\nadd=1*(5e5 -5e5 +1)=1.\n\nThus, total=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=2, B=3, C=4, D=5.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low=3.\n\ny0= min(4,5+1-2=4).\n\nSo y0=4 >=3.\n\nsum_part1: a=2+3-4=1, l=2+4-4=2. num=2.\n\nsum_p1= (1+2)*2//2=3.\n\nsum_p2: 4-4=0.\n\nsum +=3.\n\nx=3:\n\ny_low=3.\n\ny0= min(4,5+1-3=3).\n\nsum_p1: y=3.\n\na=3+3-4=2.\n\nsum_p1=2.\n\nsum_p2:4-3=1. (5-4+1)=2. sum_p2=2.\n\nsum +=2+2=4.\n\nTotal sum 3+4=7.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, handling the case when D is very large, but x + y -1 is less than D.\n\nLike, x=1, y=2, D=10.\n\nThen, min(3,10)=3.\n\nSo term is 3 - C +1.\n\nBut if C is 3, then 3-3+1=1.\n\nThus, the code correctly adds 1 for each such y.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that can be formed with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\) and \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find all valid triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) form a non-degenerate triangle. This means \\(x + y > z\\). Given the constraints on \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), we can efficiently compute the count without brute-forcing through all possible values.\n\n2. **Constraints and Ranges**:\n   - \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\).\n   - \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\).\n   - \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\).\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - For each \\(x\\), determine the valid range of \\(y\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\) and \\(z\\) is within its range.\n   - For each valid pair \\((x, y)\\), compute the number of valid \\(z\\) values that satisfy both the range constraints and the triangle inequality.\n\n4. **Mathematical Insight**:\n   - For each \\(x\\), calculate the minimum \\(y\\) (denoted as \\(y_{\\text{low}}\\)) such that \\(x + y \\geq C\\).\n   - Calculate the maximum \\(y\\) (denoted as \\(y_0\\)) such that \\(x + y - 1 \\leq D\\).\n   - Sum the contributions of valid \\(y\\) values in two parts: those where \\(x + y - 1 \\leq D\\) and those where \\(x + y - 1 > D\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_triangles(A, B, C, D):\n    total = 0\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n        if y_low > C:\n            continue\n        y0 = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n        if y0 < y_low:\n            count = C - y_low + 1\n            add = count * (D - C + 1)\n            total += add\n        else:\n            a = x + y_low - C\n            l = x + y0 - C\n            num = y0 - y_low + 1\n            sum_p1 = (a + l) * num // 2\n            sum_p2 = (C - y0) * (D - C + 1)\n            total += sum_p1 + sum_p2\n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        print(count_triangles(A, B, C, D))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, each containing four integers representing \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\).\n- **Loop Through \\(x\\) Values**: For each \\(x\\) in the range \\([A, B]\\), compute the valid range for \\(y\\).\n- **Calculate Valid \\(y\\) Range**: Determine \\(y_{\\text{low}}\\) and \\(y_0\\) to split the valid \\(y\\) values into two parts.\n- **Sum Contributions**: For each valid \\(y\\), compute the number of valid \\(z\\) values and accumulate the total count.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid triangles without iterating through all possible combinations, making the solution feasible even for large input sizes.",
