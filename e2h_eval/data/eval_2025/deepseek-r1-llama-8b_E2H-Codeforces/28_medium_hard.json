String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Vasily the Bear is looking for beautiful strings. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, a string is beautiful if it meets certain criteria. The string consists only of 0s and 1s. The counts of 0s and 1s must be exactly n and m, respectively. Also, we can modify the string in certain ways to get a character g (either 0 or 1). The modifications are done by replacing two last characters with one. Each modification reduces the length by one. For example, replacing \"00\" with \"0\", which would reduce the length by one each time.\n\nBut wait, each modification requires that the string has at least two characters. So, each operation reduces the length by one. But how does this affect the final count of 0s and 1s?\n\nHmm. The goal is to find the number of beautiful strings such that after some number of modifications (possibly zero), the resulting string ends with 'g'. But wait, no—wait, the problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So, s can be modified into a string that ends with g. Or perhaps more accurately, after some modifications, the resulting string's last character is g.\n\nWait, no. Let me read that part again: \"we can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So, the process allows us to modify the string, possibly multiple times, and end up with a string that has g as its last character. Because each modification replaces the last two characters, so the last character changes based on those operations.\n\nWait, let me think about what each modification does. Suppose the last two characters are 'x' and 'y'. After a modification, they are replaced by 'z', where z is 0 if x and y are both 0, else 1. So, the last character after a modification depends on the previous two.\n\nWait, for example, if the last two are '00', replace them with '0' → last character is 0.\nIf the last two are '01', replace them with '1'.\nIf the last two are '10', replace them with '0'.\nIf the last two are '11', replace them with '1'.\n\nSo, each modification affects the last character. Therefore, any sequence of modifications will change the last character(s) in a way that depends on the current state.\n\nBut the problem states that after some modifications, the string s becomes a string where the last character is g. So, for each beautiful string s (which has exactly n 0s and m 1s), we need to determine whether it's possible to perform some number of modifications such that the resulting string's last character is g.\n\nWait, but each modification reduces the length by one. So, the initial string has length k = n + m. Then, each modification reduces it by 1. So, after t modifications, the length is k - t. The final string must have exactly one character (since each modification reduces the length by 1 until it's 1, then you can't modify anymore). Wait, but wait. Because the problem says that the modification is allowed only when the length is at least two. So, if the initial length is L, then the maximum number of modifications is L-1. Because each step reduces by one.\n\nSo, after t modifications, the string's length is L - t. But the problem is about whether, through some t steps, the resulting string ends with g. And the initial string is a beautiful string, meaning it has exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n\nWait, but the modifications change the counts of 0s and 1s. So, after each modification, the number of 0s and 1s can change. Because modifying two 0s into a 0 reduces the count by one. Modifying two 0s into a 0: before, there were two 0s, after, one. So the total count decreases by one. Similarly, modifying two 1s into a 1: same thing. If you modify a 0 and 1 into a 1: then you lose one 0 and one 1, and gain one 1. So the net effect is 0 0s and 1 1 is lost, but one 1 is added. So overall, 0s decrease by 1, 1s remain the same.\n\nWait, wait. Let's model the changes.\n\nEach modification takes two characters and replaces them with one, depending on their values.\n\nCase 1: both are 0 → replaced by 0. So, the number of 0s decreases by one (from two 0s to one 0).\nCase 2: both are 1 → replaced by 1. So, 1s decrease by one.\nCase 3: 0 followed by 1 → replaced by 1. So, 0 count decreases by one, 1 remains the same (since two 1s would have been replaced by one, but here it's one 1 and one 0 being replaced by one 1. So overall, 0 count decreases by one, 1 count remains the same (because before, one 1 is kept and another 1 is added? Wait, no: original two chars are 0 and 1. After replacement, it's 1. So, the 0 is removed, and the 1 is kept as 1. So, 0 count decreases by 1, 1 count remains the same.\n\nSimilarly, case 4: 1 followed by 0 → replaced by 0. So, 1 count decreases by one, 0 count remains the same.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again:\n\nIn case 3: the two characters are 0 and 1. So, the new character is 1. So, in the string, the count of 0s decreases by one, since one 0 is removed, but the count of 1s increases by one because two 1s would have become one, but in this case, it's a 0 and a 1 becoming a 1. Wait, no: original count is one 0 and one 1. After replacement, the two are replaced by one 1. So, the total 0 count decreases by one, and 1 count decreases by zero (since before, there was one 1, now it's one 1 again).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the string is \"01\". Then, after one modification, it becomes \"1\". So, the initial counts were 1 zero and 1 one. After modification, it's 0 zeros and 1 one. So, zero count decreased by one.\n\nAnother example: string is \"10\". After modification, it becomes \"0\". So, the 1 count decreases by one.\n\nSo, for each modification, the number of 0s and 1s can change as follows:\n\nIf the two last characters are 00 → 0, so 0 count decreases by 1 (from 2 to 1).\nIf the two are 01 → 1, so 0 count decreases by 1, 1 count remains same (from 1 to 1).\nIf the two are 10 → 0, so 1 count decreases by 1, 0 remains same (from 1 to 0).\nIf the two are 11 → 1, 1 count decreases by 1.\n\nWait, in each case, the modification reduces either the 0s or 1s count by one. Because in each case, two characters are being replaced by one, thus reducing the total count by one.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the initial string has exactly n 0s and m 1s. After modifications, the counts of 0s and 1s can vary. But for the string to be beautiful, it's required that the initial string has exactly n 0s and m 1s. So, the initial string is a beautiful string regardless of the modifications, but the question is whether after some modifications, the resulting string can have the last character equal to g.\n\nSo, for each beautiful string, we need to see if there exists a way to perform some number of modifications (t ≥0) such that the resulting string's last character is g.\n\nWait, but the resulting string can be of any length less than or equal to the original. But the key is that after t modifications, the last character is g.\n\nBut how does the last character change based on the modifications?\n\nEach modification replaces the last two characters. So, the last character after each modification depends on the previous two.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe instead of thinking about all possible sequences of modifications, we can model the possible last characters that can be achieved after t modifications, given the initial string.\n\nWait, but for each beautiful string, we need to determine if it's possible to reach a string ending with g via some number of modifications. So, for each beautiful string, we can model the possible last characters after 0,1,2,... t modifications, but considering that each modification changes the last two characters into one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that the last character after t modifications depends on the parity of the length and the initial string.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of modifications t must be such that the length after t modifications is even or odd. Because each modification reduces the length by 1. So, the initial length is L = n + m.\n\nAfter t modifications, the length is L - t.\n\nThe last character after t modifications is determined by the initial string and the t modifications. How?\n\nEach modification affects the last two characters, so the last character after each step depends on the previous two.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the last character after each possible number of modifications.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's denote dp[t][state] as the possible last character(s) after t modifications.\n\nBut since the last two characters determine the next state, perhaps the state needs to include the last two characters.\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the last character after t modifications depends on the initial string's last character and the parity of t.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the initial string ends with '0' and '1'. So, the last two are '0' and '1'. After one modification, it becomes '1', so the last character is '1'.\n\nNow, suppose the initial string ends with '1' and '0'. After one modification, it becomes '0'.\n\nWhat if the initial string ends with '0' and '0'? After one modification, it's '0' → last character is '0'.\n\nSimilarly, initial ends with '1' and '1' → after modification, '1'.\n\nSo, the last character after one modification depends only on the last two characters.\n\nBut for longer strings, the process is more involved.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key insight is that the last character after any number of modifications can be determined by the initial last character and the parity of the number of modifications.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's try to see.\n\nConsider that each modification reduces the length by 1. So, after t modifications, the string's length is L - t.\n\nThe last character after t modifications is influenced by the initial string's last few characters and the number of modifications.\n\nBut this seems tricky. Maybe we can model the problem differently.\n\nWait, the problem requires that after some t modifications, the last character is g. So, for the beautiful string s, is there a way to perform t modifications such that the resulting string ends with g.\n\nBut since each modification changes the last two characters, perhaps the final character depends on the initial string's last character and the parity of t.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nIf the initial last character is '0', and t is even, then perhaps the last character remains '0' if t is even, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of t determines whether the last character is the same as the initial or not.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nCase 1: Initial last two are '0' and '0' → modification leads to '0' → last character is '0'. So, after 1 modification, last character is '0' again.\n\nWait, no: initial last two are '0' and '0'; after modification, it's '0' → last character is '0'.\n\nSo, after t=1, last character is '0'.\n\nIf the initial last two are '0' and '1', then after one modification, it's '1' → last character is '1'.\n\nIf the initial last two are '1' and '0', then after one modification, it's '0'.\n\nHmm, perhaps the last character after t=1 depends on the initial last two.\n\nBut perhaps for t=2, the initial last two could be different.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that the last character after t modifications depends on the initial string's last character and the parity of the number of modifications. Because each modification potentially flips the last character based on the previous two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last character after t modifications is determined by the initial string's last character and the number of modifications t.\n\nWait, let's consider that for each beautiful string, the last character can be changed by performing a certain number of modifications. So, perhaps for each beautiful string, we can compute whether it's possible to reach a string ending with g after some t modifications.\n\nBut since n and m can be up to 105, the number of beautiful strings is C(n+m, n), which can be very large. So, iterating over each beautiful string is not feasible.\n\nThus, we need a dynamic programming approach that can calculate the total number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string ending with g via some modifications.\n\nHmm. So, the approach is to model the problem in terms of the initial string's last two characters and the possible transformations.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the initial string's last two characters determine the possible last characters after each modification. So, for each possible pair of last two characters, we can model the transitions when performing a modification.\n\nBut considering that the initial string has n 0s and m 1s, the last two characters can be any combination that sums to the correct counts. However, this seems difficult as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: for a string s with n 0s and m 1s, can we reach a string that ends with g via some modifications. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of modifications needed is important. Or perhaps, the parity of the length.\n\nWait, perhaps the last character after t modifications is determined by the initial string's last character and the parity of the initial length minus t.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about the initial string's last character and the number of modifications t, and see what the final character can be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last character after t modifications is equal to the initial last character XOR some function of t.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it clearly.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Since each modification reduces the length by 1, and the last two characters are modified, perhaps the last character after t modifications can be determined by the initial string's last (k) characters, where k is the minimal necessary to capture the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last character after t modifications is the same as the initial string's last character if the number of modifications is even, and different otherwise. But that doesn't seem to hold based on earlier examples.\n\nWait, another idea: each modification can be seen as a transition that may change the last character. But perhaps for the purpose of determining whether a string can be modified to end with g, the initial last character and the parity of the initial string's length are sufficient.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose the initial string's last character is c. Then, each modification may change it based on the previous two. But perhaps, after each modification, the last character can be determined in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last character after any number of modifications is the same as the initial last character if the number of modifications is even, and different if it's odd. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nWait, let's take some examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInitial string: \"01\"\nLength is 2.\n\nAfter one modification (t=1), it becomes \"1\" → last character is 1.\n\nSo, initial last character is 1, after t=1 (odd), last character is 1.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit my hypothesis.\n\nAnother example:\nInitial string: \"00\"\nAfter t=1: \"0\" → last character is 0.\n\nt=2: impossible since length becomes 1 after t=1, can't modify further.\n\nSo, initial last character is 0, after t=1 (odd) → 0.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother example:\nInitial string: \"010\"\n\nLast two characters are '1' and '0'.\n\nAfter one modification: '0' → last character 0.\n\nt=1: last character is 0.\n\nt=2: but after t=1, the string is '0', so can't modify.\n\nSo, for t=1, last character is 0.\n\nAnother example:\n\nInitial string: \"0101\"\n\nLast two characters are '0' and '1'.\n\nAfter one modification: becomes '1' → last character 1.\n\nt=1: last character 1.\n\nAnother modification (t=2): but after t=1, the string is '1' → can't modify.\n\nSo, for t=1, last character is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial last character and the parity of t determine the outcome.\n\nWait, in the first example, initial last character is '1', t=1 is odd, and the result is '1'.\n\nIn the second example, initial last character is '0', t=1 is odd, result is '0'.\n\nIn the third example, initial last character is '0', t=1 is odd, result is '0'.\n\nAnother example:\n\nInitial string: \"011\"\n\nLast two are '1' and '1'.\n\nAfter one modification: becomes '1' → last character 1.\n\nt=1: odd → last character 1.\n\nAnother example:\n\nInitial string: \"0011\".\n\nAfter one modification (last two are '1' and '1'), becomes '1' → last character 1.\n\nt=1: odd.\n\nAnother example:\n\nInitial string: \"0000\".\n\nAfter one modification: '00' → '0' → last character 0.\n\nt=1: even? No, t=1 is odd. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the number of modifications t doesn't directly determine the parity, but rather, the parity of the initial length minus t.\n\nWait, the initial length is L = n + m.\n\nAfter t modifications, the length is L - t.\n\nThe last character depends on the initial string and the number of modifications t.\n\nBut perhaps the last character after t modifications is the same as the initial last character if (L - t) is even, and different if (L - t) is odd.\n\nWait, that might make sense.\n\nBecause each modification reduces the length by 1, so the parity of the length changes each time.\n\nSo, for t=0: length is L. The last character is the initial last character.\n\nt=1: length is L-1. So, if L is even, L-1 is odd.\n\nt=2: length is L-2.\n\nBut how does this relate to the last character.\n\nWait, perhaps the last character after t modifications is the same as the initial last character if the initial length minus t is even, and different otherwise.\n\nWait, in the first example: initial string is \"01\" (length 2, even). After t=1, length is 1 (odd). So, the last character is 1. The initial last character was 1.\n\nHmm, same as initial.\n\nAnother example: initial string \"00\" (length 2, even). After t=1, becomes '0' → last character 0. Same as initial.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. Because in the first case, initial last character is 1, after t=1 (even?), but the length is now odd.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.\n\nAlternative approach: the last character after t modifications depends on the initial last character and the parity of t.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nIf the initial last character is c, then after an even number of modifications, the last character remains c, and after an odd number, it becomes 1 - c.\n\nNo, wait:\n\nIn the first example, initial last character is 1.\n\nAfter t=1 (odd), last character is 1.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the last character after t modifications is determined by the initial last character and whether the number of modifications is even or odd, but the exact relationship depends on the initial last two characters.\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps it's better to model the problem as follows: for a beautiful string s, can we find a way to perform t modifications such that the resulting string's last character is g.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the last character after t modifications can be either the initial last character or the other, depending on the parity of t and the initial last two characters.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAnother angle: the problem requires that the initial string can be modified in some way to end with g. So, for the initial string s, the last character after any number of modifications must be g.\n\nBut each modification reduces the string's length by 1, so the number of modifications can range from 0 up to L-1, where L is the initial length.\n\nBut considering all possible t is computationally expensive, so we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the last character after t modifications can be determined by the initial last character and the parity of the number of modifications.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as the initial string's last character being c, and we can choose t such that after t modifications, the last character is g. So, for each possible t, check if the last character can be g.\n\nBut again, for each beautiful string, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of modifications t must be such that the initial length L minus t is 1, i.e., t = L-1. Because once the string is reduced to a single character, no more modifications can be made.\n\nWait, because each modification reduces the length by 1. So, the maximum number of modifications is L-1.\n\nWait, but after L-1 modifications, the string is of length 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the only way for the string to end with g is if, after L-1 modifications, the last character is g.\n\nBut wait, no. Because you can stop at any t < L-1, and the last character could be g.\n\nSo, the problem is to find whether, for the initial string, there exists a t in 0..L-1 such that the last character is g.\n\nBut how to model this for all beautiful strings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each beautiful string, the possible last characters after any t modifications form a certain set, and we need to check whether g is in that set.\n\nBut again, for large n and m, enumerating all beautiful strings isn't feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find, for each possible pair of last two characters (a, b), the possible last characters after each possible number of modifications.\n\nBut again, this seems too involved.\n\nAnother Idea: For a beautiful string to be able to reach a string ending with g via some modifications, the following must hold:\n\nEither the initial last character is g, and the initial length is at least 1 (so t=0 is allowed).\n\nOr, after some number of modifications, the last character becomes g.\n\nBut without knowing how the last character changes, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial string's last character is c. After any number of modifications, the last character can be either c or 1-c, depending on the parity of the number of modifications.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nFor example, in the first example, initial last character is 1. After t=1, it's 1. So, same as initial.\n\nAnother example: initial last two are 0 and 1. After t=1, it's 1. So, 1 is different from initial last character 0.\n\nHmm, that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the last character can be determined based on the initial last character and the number of modifications modulo 2.\n\nBut in some cases, it's the same, in others, it's different.\n\nWait, perhaps the last character after t modifications is equal to the initial last character if the number of modifications is even, and different if it's odd. But this doesn't hold in all cases.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the last character after t modifications as a function f(c, t), where c is the initial last character.\n\nBut how does t influence this function?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible initial last character c, the possible last characters after t modifications are either c or something else, depending on t.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps the last character after t modifications is c XOR (t mod 2). But that's just a guess.\n\nFor example, if c is 0:\n\nt=0 → 0\nt=1 → 1\nt=2 → 0\nt=3 → 1\n\nIf c is 1:\n\nt=0 →1\nt=1→0\nt=2→1\nt=3→0\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nTake initial string '00' (c=0). After t=1, it becomes '0' → last character 0. So, 0 XOR 1=1, which is not the case. So, the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAnother example: initial string '01' (c=1). After t=1, it becomes '1' → last character 1. 1 XOR 1=0, which is not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the last character after t modifications is determined by the initial last character and the parity of the initial string's length minus t.\n\nWait, because each modification reduces the length by 1, so the parity of the length changes each time.\n\nSo, for t modifications, the length is L - t.\n\nThe parity of L - t is (L mod 2) XOR (t mod 2).\n\nSo, perhaps the last character after t modifications is the initial last character if (L - t) is even, and 1 - initial last character if it's odd.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nExample 1: initial string is '01' → L=2, even. After t=1, L-t=1, odd. So, last character should be 1 - c.\n\nInitial c is 1 → 1 -1=0. But after t=1, last character is 1. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the last character after t=1. It's determined by the last two characters of the initial string. For t=2, the last two characters are the last two after t=1, which is one character, so we can't apply t=2.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because after t=1, the string is of length L-1, which can be further modified if L-1 >=2.\n\nWait, but for t=2, the last two characters are the last two of the string after t=1.\n\nWhich is one character, but that's not possible. So, perhaps t can't be 2 in this case.\n\nWait, no. After t=1, the string is of length L-1. So, if L-1 >=2, we can perform another modification, which would reduce it by 1 again.\n\nSo, for each t, the last two characters are the last two of the string after t-1 modifications.\n\nBut modeling this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nGiven the complexity of tracking the last character through modifications, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: For the initial string s, can we perform t modifications such that the resulting string's last character is g.\n\nBut since the problem is to count all such beautiful strings, perhaps the key is to find for each beautiful string s, whether it's possible to have a t such that after t modifications, the last character is g.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the only way for the last character to be g is that the initial string's last character is g, and the initial length is even. Or something along those lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last character after any number of modifications is the same as the initial last character. But that's not true as shown in earlier examples.\n\nWait, another Idea: Let's consider that each modification can change the last character in a certain way. But perhaps the last character can be either 0 or 1, depending on the initial last two characters.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to find the number of beautiful strings s where either:\n\n1. The last character of s is g, and the length is even. Because then, you can choose t=0 and the last character is already g.\n\nOR\n\n2. The last two characters of s are such that, after one modification, the last character becomes g. So, for example, if the last two are '00', then after modification, it becomes '0' → if g is 0, then it's possible.\n\nOR\n\n3. More generally, for some t, after t modifications, the last character is g.\n\nBut again, it's unclear how to model this for all possible s.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nInstead of trying to model the modifications, perhaps we can find that for a beautiful string s to be counted, the initial last character and the parity of the initial length must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to note that the last character after any number of modifications can be g only if the initial string's last character is g, or the initial string's last two characters can be modified into a state where the last character is g in one step.\n\nWait, let's think: if the initial string's last two characters are '00', then after one modification, it's '0' → last character is 0. So, if g is 0, this is acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, if the initial last two are '01', modification leads to '1' → last character is 1.\n\nSo, for a beautiful string s to be counted, it must be possible that either:\n\n- The last character is g (allowing t=0), or\n\n- The last two characters are such that a single modification can change them into a string whose last character is g.\n\nWait, but this might not capture all possibilities, since after multiple modifications, the last character could change again.\n\nBut perhaps, considering that each modification changes the last character based on the previous two, the minimal number of steps to reach g is either zero or one.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the initial last character is g, then t=0 is acceptable.\n\nElse, if there exists a way to perform one modification such that the last character becomes g, then it's acceptable.\n\nElse, perhaps it's impossible.\n\nBut why would it be impossible beyond that?\n\nBecause each modification can only change the last two characters, and the last character depends on those two.\n\nSo, for a beautiful string s, it can be modified to end with g in either zero or one modification steps.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, let's consider:\n\nCase 1: s ends with g → t=0 is acceptable.\n\nCase 2: s ends with two characters that, when modified, become a string ending with g.\n\nSo, for the last two characters of s, after a modification, the last character is g.\n\nSo, for each beautiful string s, check if s's last character is g, or if the last two characters are such that modifying them would result in a last character of g.\n\nIf either condition holds, then s is counted.\n\nOtherwise, it's not counted.\n\nIs this accurate?\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: n=1, m=1, g=0.\n\nPossible beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\".\n\nFor \"01\":\n\nEnds with '1' → not 0. But the last two are '0' and '1' → modifying them gives '1', which is not 0. So, can't be modified to end with 0 in one step. So, according to this logic, it wouldn't be counted. But the sample output says it is counted.\n\nWait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, wait in the first sample, the output is 2, which includes both \"01\" and \"10\".\n\nSo according to the problem statement, these two strings are beautiful.\n\nSo, according to our current approach, for \"01\", the last character is 1, which is not g (g=0). The last two characters are '0' and '1', which when modified give '1' → which is not 0. So, according to our earlier logic, \"01\" shouldn't be counted. But it is counted.\n\nHmm, so our approach is flawed.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, in the first sample, the beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\". So, both are beautiful.\n\nBut according to our earlier reasoning, \"01\" can't be modified to end with 0.\n\nSo, what's wrong with our reasoning?\n\nAh! Because \"01\" can be modified once, but the resulting string is \"1\", which ends with 1. So, it's not helpful for g=0.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, both \"01\" and \"10\" are beautiful strings. So, what's the reason?\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that after some modifications, the resulting string ends with g. So, perhaps the initial string itself can be considered as a valid string if it's already ends with g, regardless of the length.\n\nYes! Because the problem says that the initial string is beautiful, and we can perform zero or more modifications. So, if the initial string ends with g, then it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the initial string \"01\" ends with 1, which is not g=0. So, how is it counted?\n\nAh, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: a string is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:\n\n- It consists only of 0 and 1.\n\n- It has exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n\nThen, we can obtain character g from string s with some number of modifications.\n\nWait, the initial string s is beautiful, but we can modify it to get a string s' that ends with g.\n\nWait, the initial string s is beautiful, but after some modifications, s' must end with g.\n\nSo, the initial string's last character doesn't matter; what matters is whether, through some modifications, the resulting string ends with g.\n\nSo, the problem is not about the initial string's last character, but about the possibility of transforming it into a string that ends with g.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point I misunderstood.\n\nSo, the initial beautiful string s can have any last character, but after some modifications, the resulting string s' must end with g.\n\nSo, the initial last character is irrelevant. What matters is whether a sequence of modifications can lead to a string ending with g.\n\nSo, the problem is to count all beautiful strings s where it's possible to perform some number of modifications (t ≥0) such that the resulting string ends with g.\n\nSo, for each beautiful string s, we need to determine whether there exists a t ≥0 such that after t modifications, the string ends with g.\n\nThus, the approach is to model for each beautiful string s, whether such a t exists.\n\nBut since n and m can be up to 105, the number of beautiful strings is C(n+m, n), which can be up to around 1e20, which is way too big to handle directly.\n\nSo, we need a dynamic programming approach that can model the possible last two characters and the possible resulting last character after t modifications.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative Idea: For each possible last two characters (a, b), compute whether it's possible to perform a certain number of modifications to end with g.\n\nBut this seems too involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the problem as a state machine, where the state represents the last two characters of the string, and transitions represent the effect of a modification.\n\nEach modification replaces the last two characters (a, b) with a new character z, which is 0 if a and b are both 0, else 1.\n\nThus, the state after a modification is (b, z).\n\nSo, for each state (a, b), applying a modification leads to state (b, z), where z is determined by a and b.\n\nAdditionally, the initial state is the last two characters of the beautiful string.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each beautiful string s, checking whether starting from the state (s[-2], s[-1]), we can reach a state where the last character is g after any number of transitions.\n\nIf yes, then s is counted.\n\nThus, the problem is to count all beautiful strings s such that from the initial state (s[-2], s[-1]), there exists a path in the state machine that ends in a state where the last character is g.\n\nBut since the number of beautiful strings is huge, we cannot process each individually.\n\nThus, the solution must find a way to model the state transitions and count the number of beautiful strings that can reach a state ending with g.\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming, where we track the number of beautiful strings that end with a certain last two characters and can reach a state ending with g.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute all possible states (a, b), where a and b are 0 or 1.\n\n2. For each state, determine whether it can reach a state where the last character is g via some number of modifications.\n\n3. For each state (a, b) that can reach g, compute the number of beautiful strings that end with (a, b).\n\nSum these counts.\n\nBut how to compute the number of beautiful strings that end with (a, b)?\n\nThis is the crux.\n\nEach beautiful string has exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n\nThe last two characters are (a, b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string ending with a specific character 'g' through a series of modifications. Each modification reduces the length of the string by one and changes the last two characters based on certain rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: A beautiful string consists of exactly 'n' zeros and 'm' ones. We can modify the string by replacing the last two characters with one character based on their values. The goal is to determine how many such strings can be modified to end with 'g'.\n\n2. **State Representation**: Use a dynamic programming approach where each state represents the last two characters of the string. This helps in tracking the possible transitions after each modification.\n\n3. **Transition Function**: For each state (a, b), determine the next state after a modification. This transition depends on the current last two characters (a, b) and the modification rule.\n\n4. **Reachability Check**: For each state, check if it can reach a state where the last character is 'g' after some number of modifications.\n\n5. **Count Beautiful Strings**: For each state that can reach 'g', count the number of beautiful strings that end with that state.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    m = int(input[1])\n    g = int(input[2])\n\n    from collections import deque\n\n    # Precompute for each state whether it can reach a state ending with g\n    reachable = {}\n    queue = deque()\n    initial_states = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n    for a, b in initial_states:\n        reachable[(a, b)] = False\n        queue.append((a, b))\n\n    while queue:\n        a, b = queue.popleft()\n        current_last = b\n        if current_last == g:\n            reachable[(a, b)] = True\n            continue\n        z = 0\n        if a == 0 and b == 0:\n            z = 0\n        elif a == 0 or b == 0:\n            z = 1\n        else:\n            z = 1\n        new_state = (b, z)\n        if not reachable[new_state]:\n            reachable[new_state] = True\n            queue.append(new_state)\n\n    total = 0\n    for a in [0, 1]:\n        for b in [0, 1]:\n            if reachable.get((a, b), False):\n                ways = 0\n                if a != 0:\n                    ways += comb(n - a + m - b - 1, n - a)\n                if b != 0:\n                    ways += comb(m - b + n - a - 1, n - a)\n                total += ways\n                total %= MOD\n\n    print(total % MOD)\n\ndef comb(n, k):\n    if n < 0 or k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    numer = 1\n    denom = 1\n    for i in range(n, n-k, -1):\n        numer *= i\n        denom *= i\n        numer %= MOD\n        denom %= MOD\n    inv_denom = pow(denom, MOD-2, MOD)\n    return numer * inv_denom % MOD\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **State Representation**: Each state is represented by the last two characters of the string.\n- **Transition Function**: For each state (a, b), compute the next state after a modification based on the given rules.\n- **Reachability Check**: Determine if each state can eventually reach a state where the last character is 'g'.\n- **Counting Beautiful Strings**: For each reachable state, count the number of beautiful strings that end with those characters using combinatorial methods.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid beautiful strings by leveraging dynamic programming and combinatorial counting to handle the constraints effectively.",
