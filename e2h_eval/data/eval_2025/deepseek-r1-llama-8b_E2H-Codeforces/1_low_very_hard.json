    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate that has been divided into w x h cells. We need to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the previous one. Each ring is 1 cell wide.\n\nWait, let me think about how each ring is formed. The first ring is along the edge, which would be all the perimeter cells of the original rectangle. Then the next ring is two cells in, so the inner rectangle would be (w-4) x (h-4), because we subtract 2 from both sides for each ring. And each ring adds another border.\n\nHmm, but wait, how does that work for multiple rings? Like, for the second ring, it's the perimeter of the rectangle that's 2 cells in from the edge. So for each ring i, the size of the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). Wait no, because each ring is 2 cells away from the previous. So the first ring is at 0 cells away (the outermost). The second ring is 2 cells in, which reduces the width and height by 4 each (subtracting 2 from each side: left and right). Oh right, because each side loses 2 cells—so for each ring, the rectangle for the next ring is smaller by 2*2=4 on both dimensions.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w -4(i-1)) x (h -4(i-1)). So for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum them all.\n\nWhat's the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle? Well, for a rectangle with width W and height H, the perimeter is 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter is the number of cells on the border. For example, a 3x3 square has 8 cells (since 3x3 is 9, minus the center which isn't on the perimeter).\n\nWait, let's test that. If W=3 and H=3, then 2*(3+3-2) = 2*(4) =8, which matches the example where the output is 8 for input 3 3 1.\n\nAnother example given: 7 9 1 gives 28. Let's see. For W=7, H=9: perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) =28. Yep.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current W is w -4*(i-1), and H is h -4*(i-1). Then perimeter is 2*(W + H -2). But wait, what if W or H becomes less than or equal to 2 after some rings? Because for each ring, the rectangle might become too small. But according to the problem statement, the input k is such that it won't go beyond the possible rings. So we don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize total_gilded = 0\n- For each i from 1 to k:\n   - Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   - Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   - Compute perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n   - Add perimeter to total_gilded\n- Output total_gilded\n\nWait, let me check with the third example given. Input is 7 9 2.\n\nFirst ring: current_w=7, current_h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2)=2*14=28.\nSecond ring: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output of 40.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are straightforward. Now, the code needs to read w, h, k as integers from input, loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter, accumulate the sum, and then print the sum.\n\nHow to handle the input? It's given as a single line, possibly with spaces. So in Python, we can read the line, split into parts, convert each to integer.\n\nEdge cases:\n\n- What if k is 1? Just compute the perimeter once.\n- What if w or h is 3, and k is 1: e.g., 3x3, which has",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate that has been divided into w x h cells. We need to add k gilded rings, each forming a border around an inner rectangle, with each subsequent ring being 2 cells away from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the original rectangle, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring reduces the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter of the current rectangle can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is \\(2 \\times (width + height - 2)\\). This accounts for all the bordering cells.\n3. **Summing Up**: For each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input values\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers w, h, and k. These represent the dimensions of the plate and the number of rings.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the current width and height of the rectangle after accounting for the reduction due to previous rings.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each iteration, calculate the perimeter of the current rectangle and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all k rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases as specified.",
