Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So it's a perfect matching between R ships and B bases.\n\nBut there's a catch: the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. The paths are straight lines in 2D space, and we need to make sure none of them cross each other.\n\nHmm, how to model this? I think this is similar to checking if a bipartite graph is matchable and whether the edges (representing non-intersecting paths) form a matching.\n\nWait, but how do we determine if two paths intersect? Because for any two pairs of points (ship A to base X and ship B to base Y), their line segments should not cross.\n\nSo, for a given matching, we need to ensure that all the corresponding line segments don't intersect with each other.\n\nThe approach I can think of is:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between R ships and B bases.\n2. For each matching, check if any two line segments between ships and bases intersect.\n3. If any matching exists where none of the segments intersect, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, \"No\".\n\nBut wait, generating all possible matchings might be computationally intensive, especially since R and B can be up to 10. Oh, but 10! is about 3.6 million, which is manageable because for each matching, we'll have to check B choose 2 pairs of lines, but that's O(1) per pair since B is small.\n\nWait, no. Each matching will involve R line segments (since each ship is connected to a base). So for each matching, we have to check all possible pairs of these R lines to see if any two intersect. That could be O(R^2) per matching.\n\nSo for R=10, each matching involves 10 lines, so 45 comparisons. And with up to 3.6 million matchings, that's 3.6e6 * 45 = around 162 million operations. Hmm, that's manageable in Python, I think.\n\nBut wait, R and B are both up to 10, so R might not equal B? Wait, no, the problem says that it's a perfect matching. So R must equal B for a perfect matching to exist. Oh right, because otherwise you can't have a bijection. So first, I should check if R != B. If they're not equal, then it's automatically impossible, so output \"No\".\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: It says that the assignment is a perfect matching, which requires R = B. So if R != B, the answer is definitely \"No\".\n\nSo the first step is to check if R == B. If not, output \"No\" immediately.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNext, for all possible perfect matchings between the R ships and B bases, check for each matching whether all the line segments in that matching are non-crossing.\n\nSo how to generate all possible perfect matchings?\n\nWell, since R is up to 10, this is feasible. One way is to represent the problem as a bipartite graph where each ship is connected to each base, and then find a perfect matching.\n\nBut wait, the key is not just that a matching exists, but also that the edges (line segments) in the matching do not cross.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the paths (from base to ship) do not cross. So each path is a line segment from the base point to the ship point.\n\nWait, no. Wait the problem says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane.\"\n\nSo each path is from a base to its assigned ship. So for each pair of such paths, their line segments should not intersect.\n\nSo for a given matching, say M, which is a set of R pairs (ship i, base j), we need to check that for any two distinct pairs (i,j) and (k,l), the line segments from ship i to base j and ship k to base l do not intersect.\n\nIf any such pair of line segments in the matching cross, then this matching is invalid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Check if R != B. If so, output No.\n\n- Else, generate all possible perfect matchings.\n\n- For each matching, check all pairs of line segments in that matching for intersection.\n\n- If any matching passes this check, output Yes.\n\n- If none do, output No.\n\nNow, the next steps are to figure out how to represent the data and implement the necessary functions.\n\nFirst, parse the input:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nThen read R ship coordinates, then B base coordinates.\n\nThen, for the matching, perhaps represent each possible permutation of the ships to the bases.\n\nWait, because for a perfect matching, each ship is assigned to exactly one base, and vice versa.\n\nSo each permutation of length B (since R = B) represents a possible assignment. But wait, no, because when R is 3 and B is 3, each permutation is a possible bijection. But for R=2 and B=2, it's the same.\n\nSo for each possible permutation of the B bases, assign each ship to a base in order. Wait, but the order might matter in terms of how the permutation is generated.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible matching, which is a set of R pairs where each base is used exactly once.\n\nBut generating all possible perfect matchings can be done via permutations.\n\nWait, for example, for R=3 ships and B=3 bases, each permutation of 0..B-1 represents a mapping from ships to bases. So ship 0 is assigned to base p[0], ship 1 to p[1], etc.\n\nSo in code, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(range(B)), we can create a list of assignments.\n\nWait, but the ships are indexed from 0 to R-1, and the bases are from 0 to B-1.\n\nSo for each permutation p of 0..B-1, the assignment is ship i → base p[i].\n\nOnce we have such an assignment, we need to check whether any two line segments (ship_i to base_p[i]) and (ship_j to base_p[j]) intersect.\n\nSo for each permutation p, create the list of line segments.\n\nThen, for all pairs of line segments in this list, check if they intersect.\n\nIf any pair does, the permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo, the core part is writing a function to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nI remember that there's a standard way to check if two line segments intersect using the cross product.\n\nThe algorithm goes something like this:\n\nGiven two line segments, AB and CD.\n\nCompute the orientation of points C, D relative to AB, and D, C relative to AB. Or wait, maybe I should use the method where we compute whether the segments cross by checking the four orientations.\n\nWait, here's a way:\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n- Points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\n- Points C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nAdditionally, we have to handle cases where the endpoints lie on the other segment.\n\nBut implementing this can be a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to use parametric equations for the line segments and see if they intersect within the segments.\n\nLet me think.\n\nEach line segment can be represented as a parametric equation. For AB, a point on the segment can be written as A + t*(B - A), where t is in [0,1]. Similarly for CD, D + s*(C - D), s in [0,1].\n\nWe can set up the equations:\n\nA.x + t*(B.x - A.x) = C.x\n\nA.y + t*(B.y - A.y) = C.y\n\nSimilarly for y and x components.\n\nSolving for t and s.\n\nIf t is between 0 and 1, and s is between 0 and 1, then the segments intersect.\n\nBut this approach ignores the possibility that the endpoints are colinear but lie on different segments.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that no three points are colinear, so we don't have to worry about that case. So in our problem, the general case applies.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nFor two segments AB and CD:\n\nCompute the determinant to find if the segments cross.\n\nWait, but more accurately, let's compute the cross products to determine the orientation.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Compute the orientation of A, B, C.\n\norientation(A, B, C) = (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\nIf this is zero, points are colinear.\n\n2. Similarly for A, B, D.\n\n3. Then, check if C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nWhich means that if orientation(A, B, C) and orientation(A, B, D) have opposite signs, or one is zero.\n\nBut since no three points are colinear, we can ignore zero.\n\nSame for checking if A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nSo the function to check if two segments AB and CD intersect would:\n\n- Compute the orientations of (A,B,C), (A,B,D), (C,D,A), (C,D,B).\n\n- If (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) have opposite signs, and (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) have opposite signs, then the segments intersect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should structure it as:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- Points C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nAND\n\n- Points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nBecause if that's the case, the segments cross each other.\n\nWait, perhaps I should refer to the standard algorithm.\n\nUpon recalling, the correct condition for two segments AB and CD to intersect is that:\n\n- The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and\n\n- The points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nThis ensures that the two segments cross each other.\n\nSo, the function to check for intersection is as follows.\n\nImplementing this in code.\n\nSo, I'll write a helper function called segments_intersect that takes four points: A, B, C, D.\n\nIt returns True if the two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nWait, but in our case, each segment is a pair of points. So for each pair of segments (s1, s2) in the matching, where s1 is a ship to base assignment, and s2 is another, we need to check if their line segments intersect.\n\nSo, for a matching, collect all the line segments as a list of tuples, each tuple being (ship_point, base_point).\n\nThen, for each pair of segments in this list, check if they intersect.\n\nIf any pair does, the matching is invalid.\n\nOtherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output 'No'.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R ship points.\n\nRead B base points.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the B bases. Since each permutation corresponds to a mapping from ships to bases.\n\nFor each permutation p:\n\n   Create a list of segments, where each segment is (ship[i], base[p[i]]) for i in 0..R-1.\n\n   Check all pairs of segments in this list to see if any two intersect.\n\n   If none of the pairs intersect, return 'Yes'.\n\nIf after checking all permutations, none satisfy the condition, return 'No'.\n\nSo, now, the main challenge is to implement the permutation generation and the segment intersection check.\n\nNow, for the permutation part, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, for B=3, itertools.permutations(range(3)) gives all possible orderings.\n\nSo, for each p in permutations(range(B)), we can construct the list of segments.\n\nThen, for each pair of segments in the list, check if they intersect.\n\nSo, for each pair (i, j) where i < j, take segments[i] and segments[j], and call the helper function.\n\nIf any pair returns True, the permutation is invalid.\n\nElse, the permutation is valid.\n\nOnce a valid permutation is found, output 'Yes' and terminate.\n\nOtherwise, after all permutations, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the helper function for segment intersection.\n\nImplementing the cross product-based method.\n\nLet me write a function:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # a and b are endpoints of segment 1\n    # c and d are endpoints of segment 2\n\n    # Compute the orientation\n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x)\n    \n    # Check if points are colinear\n    if ccw(a, b, c) == 0 and ccw(a, b, d) == 0:\n        # All four points are colinear. But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so this can't happen.\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if c and d are on opposite sides of AB\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    if (ccw1 > 0 and ccw2 < 0) or (ccw1 < 0 and ccw2 > 0):\n        # c and d are on opposite sides of AB\n        pass\n    else:\n        # They are on the same side or not across AB\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if a and b are on opposite sides of CD\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n    if (ccw3 > 0 and ccw4 < 0) or (ccw3 < 0 and ccw4 > 0):\n        pass\n    else:\n        return False\n    \n    # Now, check if the segments actually intersect.\n    # We need to ensure that the point of intersection lies within both segments.\n    # But since the points are in general position (no three colinear), the segments must cross.\n    return True\n\nWait, but what about when the endpoints lie on the other segment? Like, for example, if a point is exactly on the other segment.\n\nIn that case, the function may return False, but according to the problem statement, such a case cannot occur because no three points are colinear. So the function should correctly return whether the segments cross in the middle.\n\nWait, but perhaps the function needs to check if the line segments actually cross, including the endpoints.\n\nWait, the function as written may miss some edge cases where the endpoints are on the other segment.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, it is guaranteed that no three points are on the same line, so the only way two line segments can share an endpoint is if a base is assigned to a ship that's already in another segment. But in the matching, each base is assigned exactly once, so each base is only present once in the segments.\n\nWait, no. Because the segments are between ships and their assigned bases. So each base is in exactly one segment.\n\nTherefore, the endpoints of the segments are all distinct. So two segments can't share an endpoint.\n\nThus, the function above is sufficient.\n\nWait, but what about the case where one segment is entirely contained within another? But again, no three points are colinear, so that's not possible.\n\nSo, the helper function seems correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B: print No.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R ships: a list of tuples.\n\nRead B bases: a list of tuples.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the B bases.\n\nFor each permutation p:\n\n   segments = [(ships[i], bases[p[i]]) for i in range(R)]\n\n   valid = True\n\n   for i in range(len(segments)):\n       for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n           a, b = segments[i]\n           c, d = segments[j]\n           if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n               valid = False\n               break\n       if not valid:\n           break\n   if valid:\n       print(\"Yes\")\n       exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, print(\"No\").\n\nWait, but in Python, when R and B are 10, itertools.permutations will generate 10! = 3,628,800 permutations. For each permutation, checking 45 pairs of segments. So 3.6e6 * 45 = ~162 million operations.\n\nIs that acceptable for Python? Well, considering that each operation is simple, perhaps, but 1e8 operations might take a second or two. But 1.6e8 is maybe a bit tight.\n\nWait, but in practice, for many permutations, the checking will fail early. For example, in the first example, the correct permutation is found quickly, so the code can exit early.\n\nBut in the worst case, it's 3.6e6 * 45 steps.\n\nWait, but for R=10, B=10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800.\n\nAnd for each permutation, we have 10 segments. So for each permutation, the number of pairs is 10*9/2 = 45.\n\nSo total pairs across all permutations is 3.6e6 * 45 = 162,840,000.\n\nEach pair requires a call to segments_intersect, which involves several calculations.\n\nBut Python can handle this, perhaps, within reasonable time.\n\nWait, but 1e8 operations in Python can take about 10 seconds, but 1.6e8 might be 16 seconds, which is beyond the typical time limits for programming competitions.\n\nHmm, but in the problem statement, the constraints are R and B up to 10, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the corresponding segments do not cross. Then, the problem reduces to checking whether there's a perfect matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nBut finding a maximum bipartite matching, but with the constraint that edges are allowed only if their segments don't cross.\n\nBut even so, the number of possible edges is R*B, which is up to 100, but the maximum matching is up to 10.\n\nBut this approach may not save time because in the worst case, it's the same as checking all permutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps memoization isn't useful here.\n\nAnother idea: instead of generating all permutations, perhaps try to find a matching that satisfies the non-crossing condition.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to approach that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a non-crossing bipartite matching.\n\nBut I'm not familiar with any algorithms for that.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is the best.\n\nBut perhaps for the code, it's manageable.\n\nAnother thing to consider: precomputing the edges that are allowed.\n\nWait, for each ship and base, compute whether the line segment connecting them is compatible with any other such segment.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each pair of ships, precompute which bases can be connected without causing a crossing.\n\nBut that might not help.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can proceed as planned.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nbases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSample Output: Yes.\n\nIn this case, the matching is ship 0 → base 0, ship 1 → base 1, ship 2 → base 2.\n\nCheck the segments:\n\n0,0 to -2,1: line from (0,0) to (-2,1).\n\n2,0 to 0,3: line from (2,0) to (0,3).\n\n3,1 to 2,2: line from (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nDo any of these cross?\n\nProbably not.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\nWait, no, wait, no, the sample input is as follows:\n\nWait, the input in the problem statement is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the first line is R=3, B=3, then the ships, then the bases.\n\nWait, the first input line is '3 3', then 3 ship positions, then 3 base positions.\n\nThen the second input line is '2 1', which is R=2, B=1.\n\nWait, that can't be because R and B are supposed to be the same for a perfect matching.\n\nAh, perhaps the input is structured as:\n\nThe first line is R and B.\n\nThen R lines for ships.\n\nThen B lines for bases.\n\nThen the second test case is R=2, B=1?

According to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so this case cannot happen.\n\nSo, the function correctly returns whether the two segments cross.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nShip 0 at (0,0) is connected to base 0 at (-2,1).\n\nShip 1 at (2,0) connected to base 1 at (0,3).\n\nShip 2 at (3,1) connected to base 2 at (2,2).\n\nDo any of these segments cross?\n\nSegment 0: (0,0) to (-2,1).\n\nSegment 1: (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nDo they cross?\n\nLet's compute:\n\nCompute ccw for a=(0,0), b=(2,0), c=(2,0), d=(0,3). Wait, no, the segments are (0,0)->(-2,1) and (2,0)->(0,3).\n\nCompute ccw for a=(0,0), b=(2,0), c=(-2,1):\n\nccw(a,b,c) = (2-0)(1-0) - (0-0)(-2-0) = 2*1 - 0*(-2) = 2.\n\nccw(a,b,d) = (2-0)(3-0) - (0-0)(0-0) = 2*3 - 0*0 = 6.\n\nccw1=2, ccw2=6: same sign. So they are on the same side. So the first condition fails.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the segments don't cross.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, a is (0,0), b is (2,0), c is (-2,1), d is (0,3).\n\nSo, AB is the segment from (0,0) to (2,0).\n\nCD is from (-2,1) to (0,3).\n\nWait, no: in the code, the segments are a-b (ship0 to base0) and c-d (ship1 to base1).\n\nWait, a is ship0, which is (0,0), b is base0, which is (-2,1).\n\nc is ship1, (2,0), d is base1, (0,3).\n\nSo, the segments are:\n\nAB: from (0,0) to (-2,1).\n\nCD: from (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nDo these segments cross?\n\nLet me plot them mentally.\n\nAB goes from (0,0) to (-2,1): it's a line going to the left and upwards.\n\nCD goes from (2,0) to (0,3): it's a line going to the left and upwards.\n\nThese two lines should cross somewhere in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps my function is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's compute the function.\n\nIn the code, the function checks if C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nIn this case, C is (2,0), D is (0,3).\n\nCompute ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c) where a is (0,0), b is (-2,1), c is (2,0).\n\nWait, a is (0,0), b is (-2,1), c is (2,0).\n\nccw1 = (b.x -a.x) * (c.y -a.y) - (b.y -a.y) * (c.x -a.x)\n\nSo, ( -2 - 0 ) * (0 - 0 ) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0 )\n\n=> (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2.\n\nSimilarly, for D (0,3):\n\nccw2 = (b.x -a.x) * (d.y -a.y) - (b.y -a.y) * (d.x -a.x)\n\n=> (-2) * (3-0) - 1*(0 - 0) => (-2)*3 - 0 = -6.\n\nSo, ccw1 is -2, ccw2 is -6: same sign. So C and D are on the same side of AB.\n\nThus, the function returns False for segments_intersect.\n\nBut according to my earlier analysis, the segments should cross.\n\nSo perhaps the function is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWhat is the correct condition for two segments to cross?\n\nPerhaps I got the direction wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should return True if the segments cross, but in this case, it's returning False, but the segments do cross.\n\nHmm, this suggests a bug in the function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is correct, but my mental analysis was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the two segments don't cross.\n\nWait, let's compute the lines:\n\nAB: from (0,0) to (-2,1). The line equation is y = (1/-2)x + 0 → y = (-1/2)x.\n\nCD: from (2,0) to (0,3). The line equation is y = (3)/(-2)x + 3 → y = (-3/2)x + 3.\n\nDo these lines cross?\n\nSet (-1/2)x = (-3/2)x +3 → (2/2)x =3 → x=3.\n\nAt x=3, y = (-1/2)*3 = -1.5.\n\nBut the segments AB runs from x=0 to x=-2, and CD runs from x=2 to x=0. So the lines intersect at (3, -1.5), which is outside the segments.\n\nSo the segments do not cross.\n\nSo the function correctly returns False.\n\nSo in the first sample, the segments do not cross, hence the matching is valid.\n\nIn that case, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample, where the output is 'No'.\n\nIn that case, R=2, B=2.\n\nShips at (1,0) and (2,2).\n\nBases at (2,1) and (3,1).\n\nWait, but the input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the first test case is R=3, B=3, and the second is R=2, B=2.\n\nIn the second test case, the ships are at (1,0) and (2,2).\n\nThe bases are at (2,1) and (3,1).\n\nNow, trying all permutations:\n\nThere are two permutations: [0,1] and [1,0].\n\nFor permutation [0,1]:\n\nSegments are:\n\nShip 0 → base 0: (1,0) → (2,1).\n\nShip 1 → base 1: (2,2) → (3,1).\n\nDo these segments cross?\n\nCompute the line segments.\n\nSegment 1: from (1,0) to (2,1).\n\nSegment 2: from (2,2) to (3,1).\n\nDo they cross?\n\nCheck if segments_intersect returns True.\n\nCompute the function.\n\na = (1,0), b = (2,1), c=(2,2), d=(3,1).\n\nCompute ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c).\n\na is (1,0), b is (2,1), c is (2,2).\n\nccw1 = (2-1)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-1) = 1*2 - 1*1 = 2-1=1.\n\nccw2 = ccw(a, b, d) = (1)*(1-0) - 1*(3-1) = 1*1 -1*2= 1-2= -1.\n\nSo ccw1 is positive, ccw2 is negative: they are on opposite sides.\n\nSo condition 1 is satisfied.\n\nNow, check condition 2: a and b are on opposite sides of CD.\n\ncd is from (2,2) to (3,1).\n\nCompute ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a) = (3-2)*(0-2) - (1-2)*(1-2) → (1)*(-2) - (-1)*(-1) → -2 -1 = -3.\n\nccw4 = ccw(c, d, b) = (1)*(1-2) - (-1)*(2-2) → 1*(-1) - (-1)*0 → -1.\n\nSo ccw3 is -3, ccw4 is -1: same sign.\n\nThus, condition 2 is not satisfied.\n\nThus, the function returns False.\n\nSo the segments do not cross.\n\nWait, but according to the sample output, the second case is 'No', meaning that no matching exists.\n\nWait, but in this permutation, the segments do not cross.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the permutation.\n\nWait, in the second test case, R=2, B=2.\n\nShips: (1,0) and (2,2).\n\nBases: (2,1) and (3,1).\n\nSo the possible permutations are:\n\np = (0,1): assign ship 0 to base 0, ship 1 to base 1.\n\nAs before, the segments are (1,0)-(2,1) and (2,2)-(3,1). Do these cross?\n\nEarlier calculation said that condition 1 is satisfied (c and d are on opposite sides of AB), but condition 2 is not.\n\nSo the function returns False.\n\nAnother permutation: p = (1,0). So ship 0 is assigned to base 1, and ship 1 to base 0.\n\nSo segments are:\n\nship0: (1,0) → base1: (3,1).\n\nship1: (2,2) → base0: (2,1).\n\nSo, the two segments are:\n\n(1,0)-(3,1) and (2,2)-(2,1).\n\nDo these cross?\n\nCheck the function.\n\na=(1,0), b=(3,1), c=(2,2), d=(2,1).\n\nCompute ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c).\n\na is (1,0), b is (3,1), c is (2,2).\n\nccw1 = (3-1)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-1) → 2*2 - 1*1 =4-1=3>0.\n\nccw2 = ccw(a, b, d) → (3-1)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(2-1) → 2*1 -1*1=2-1=1>0.\n\nSo, same sign. Thus, condition 1 is not met.\n\nThus, the function returns False.\n\nThus, in this permutation, the segments do not cross.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the answer is 'No' because no matching exists.\n\nWait, but in both permutations, the segments do not cross.\n\nWait, that's not possible. What's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the function returns True when the segments cross, but in reality, the segments in the second permutation do cross.\n\nWait, in the second permutation, the segments are:\n\nship0 → base1: (1,0)→(3,1).\n\nship1 → base0: (2,2)→(2,1).\n\nDo these segments cross?\n\nLooking at the line from (1,0) to (3,1): it's a diagonal going from lower left to upper right.\n\nLine from (2,2) to (2,1): it's a vertical line downward.\n\nThey intersect at (2,1.5), which is on both segments.\n\nWait, yes, because ship1's segment is from (2,2) to (2,1), which includes (2,1.5).\n\nShip0's segment is from (1,0) to (3,1), which is a straight line. At x=2, y=1.5 is on that line.\n\nSo, the two segments cross at (2, 1.5).\n\nThus, the function should return True for this pair.\n\nBut according to the function, in this case, the function returns False.\n\nWhy?\n\nLet's compute the function.\n\na=(1,0), b=(3,1), c=(2,2), d=(2,1).\n\nccw1 = ccw(a, b, c) = (3-1)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-1) → 2*2 -1*1=4-1=3>0.\n\nccw2 = ccw(a, b, d) → (3-1)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(2-1) → 2*1 -1*1=1>0.\n\nSo, same sign. So condition 1 fails.\n\nThus, the function returns False.\n\nBut the segments do cross.\n\nSo, the function is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see.",
