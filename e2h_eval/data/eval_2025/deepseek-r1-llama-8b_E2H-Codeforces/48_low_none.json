            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to convert a number from base a to base b, but the catch is that when the second part is 'R', it means that we're dealing with Roman numerals for the conversion. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo the input is two lines. The first line has a and b. The second line is a number in base a which might have an 'R' as the second digit. Wait, no, actually, the second line is c in base a. Each door has four parts: a, then either b or R, then c, and then nothing. So for each door, the c part is in base a, and we need to represent it in base b, considering whether the second part is R or not.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the second part is either integer b or R. Oh right, so for each door, the second part is either a number (which would be base b) or R, which indicates that the number is in Roman numerals. So the overall process is: take c in base a, and then if the second part is R, convert c into Roman numerals, else convert c into base b.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the description says: Each door has 4 parts. The first part is a, the second is either b or R, third is c, fourth is empty. So for each door, you have to open it by converting c from base a to base b, but if the second part is R, then you have to write c as a Roman numeral.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says that for each door, the second part is either an integer b or an R. So when the second part is R, the conversion is done using Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's converted normally into base b.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nEach door's four parts are: a (base), second part (b or R), c (number in base a), and empty. To open the door, you take c (in base a) and convert it into the target base, which is either base b or Roman numerals if the second part is R.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not accurate. Because according to the problem, when the second part is R, the conversion is done using the Roman numeral system. Otherwise, it's converted to base b.\n\nSo for each test case, the second part of the door determines how c is represented. So if the second part is R, we have to output c as a Roman numeral. Otherwise, we output c in base b, omitting leading zeros.\n\nWait, looking back at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, the first case is:\n\n10 2\n1\n\nSo a=10, b=2, c is 1 in base 10. Since the second part is 2, which is not R, we convert 1 in base 10 to base 2, which is '1'.\n\nSecond case:\n\n16 R\n5\n\nHere, a=16, b is R, so c is 5 in base 16. Since the second part is R, we convert 5 into Roman numerals, which is 'V'.\n\nThird case:\n\n5 R\n4\n\nHere, a=5, b=R, so c is 4 in base 5. But since the second part is R, we convert 4 into Roman numerals, which is 'IV'.\n\nFourth case:\n\n2 2\n1111001\n\na=2, b=2, so c is 1111001 in base 2. Since the second part is 2 (not R), we convert it to base 2, which is the same as the original, but without leading zeros. So 1111001 in base 2 is 1111001 in base 2, but since it's all digits, it's correct.\n\nFifth case:\n\n12 13\nA\n\na=12, b=13, c is 'A' in base 12. Wait, wait, the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a. So in this case, c is 'A' which in base 12 is 10. Since the second part is 13 (not R), we convert 10 from base 12 to base 13, which is 'A' (since 10 is less than 13).\n\nSo the output is 'A'.\n\nSo the task is: for each test case, given a and b, and c in base a, determine whether to convert c to base b or to Roman numerals based on whether the second part is R or not.\n\nBut wait, the second part is either a number (like b) or R. So in the code, perhaps the second part is a string, which can be either 'R' or a digit. Or perhaps, the second part is a number",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to either base `b` or Roman numerals based on the given input. The conversion depends on whether the second part of the door's specification is `R` (indicating Roman numerals) or a number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** We read the input values which include two integers `a` and `b`, followed by a string `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Determine Conversion Type:** Check if the second part of the door's specification is `R`. If it is, we convert the number `c` into Roman numerals. Otherwise, we convert `c` into base `b`.\n3. **Conversion Functions:**\n   - **Roman Numeral Conversion:** Convert a given integer to its Roman numeral representation.\n   - **Base Conversion:** Convert a number from base `a` to base `b` and ensure leading zeros are omitted.\n4. **Output the Result:** Print the converted number based on the specified conversion type.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'), (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        num = num * base + int(ch)\n    return num\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        a_b, c = line.split('\\n')\n        a, b = map(int, a_b.strip().split())\n        c_val = c.strip()\n        \n        if 'R' in a_b:\n            roman_num = int_to_roman(str_to_int(c_val, a))\n            print(roman_num)\n        else:\n            target_base = b\n            if target_base == a:\n                print(c_val.lstrip('0') or '0')\n                continue\n            decimal = str_to_int(c_val, a)\n            converted = []\n            while decimal > 0:\n                remainder = decimal % target_base\n                converted.append(str(remainder))\n                decimal = decimal // target_base\n            converted_str = ''.join(reversed(converted))\n            print(converted_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read and split into lines. Each line contains the bases `a` and `b`, and the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion Determination:** Check if the second part of the door's specification is `R`. If so, use the Roman numeral conversion; otherwise, use base conversion.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion:** The function `int_to_roman` converts an integer to its Roman numeral string by iterating through predefined values and their corresponding Roman symbols.\n4. **Base Conversion:** The function `str_to_int` converts a string in a given base to an integer. The main function then converts this integer to the target base and prints the result, ensuring no leading zeros are included.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both types of conversions and ensures correctness by leveraging well-defined conversion functions.",
