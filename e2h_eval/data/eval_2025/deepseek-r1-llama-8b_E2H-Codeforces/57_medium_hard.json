His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about Vasya's Olympiad results. The teacher knows that Vasya's total points (sum of first and second tour) are at least x. But the teacher has the results of the two tours, but without knowing which participant got which result. The task is to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten based on how the points are combined.\n\nHmm, the key here is to compute for each possible way of combining a_i and b_j such that their sum is >=x, what's the best and worst rank Vasya can achieve.\n\nWait, no. Wait, more accurately: the participants' points are given in arbitrary order for the first and second tours. So, the first array is the points from the first tour, but not in any particular order—meaning, for example, the first element of a could be someone else's first tour score. Similarly for b.\n\nSo, when we combine each a_i with a b_j, we get the total points for each participant. But since the actual assignment of a and b is unknown, we need to consider all possible permutations where each a is matched with a b in some way.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each participant took both tours, so for each participant, there's one a and one b. So, the a's and b's are lists of points, and each corresponds to a participant, but the correspondence is lost. So, the problem is to pair each a_i with some b_j, possibly in any permutation, such that the sum a_i + b_j is the total for that participant.\n\nBut the way the problem is structured, the a and b arrays may not be in any particular order. So, for each participant, their total is a_i plus some b_j, but the matching between a and b is arbitrary except that each a is used exactly once and each b is used exactly once.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that each participant participated in both tours, so for each participant, their first tour points are one of the a's, and their second tour is one of the b's. So, the a and b arrays are lists of all the participants' scores for the first and second tours, respectively, but in arbitrary order.\n\nSo, the first step is to compute all possible ways to match a's and b's such that each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa.\n\nThe problem then is, for each possible pairing, compute the total points for each participant, sort them, and determine Vasya's possible ranks.\n\nBut since the pairing is unknown, we need to find the best and worst possible ranks across all possible valid pairings.\n\nBut considering all possible pairings might be computationally intensive, especially since n can be up to 105. However, perhaps there's a smarter way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank for Vasya is when his sum is as high as possible, which allows him to be in higher positions. And the worst possible rank is when his sum is as low as possible, but still at least x.\n\nWait, but the sum depends on the pairing. So, for each possible pairing, we have a certain set of total sums, and within that, Vasya's sum is a_i + b_j >=x for some i,j.\n\nWe need to find the minimal and maximal possible ranks he can have, given that in some pairing, the sum of his a_i and b_j is >=x.\n\nBut how do we model the possible pairings?\n\nLet me think differently. For each possible way to assign the a's and b's, the total points for each participant are a_p + b_q, where p and q are a permutation such that each is used exactly once.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all possible permutations σ of the b's indices, such that for each i, the sum a_i + b_{σ(i)} is computed, and then the ranks are determined based on these sums.\n\nOur goal is to find, among all possible such permutations σ, the minimum and maximum possible ranks of Vasya's sum.\n\nBut considering all possible σ is O(n!) which is impossible for n=105.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what determines Vasya's rank. His rank is 1-based, and it's determined by how many participants have a total sum strictly greater than his, plus one if others are equal.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can arrange them in any order. So, in the sorted list, all those with the same sum can be placed anywhere relative to each other.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, we want Vasya to have the highest possible sum, which would make him either the top or tied with others, but the jury can place him first.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we want him to have as low a sum as possible, but the sum must be >=x.\n\nWait, but the sum is a_i + b_j, and it's given that Vasya's sum is at least x. So, Vasya's sum is s = a_v + b_w, where s >=x.\n\nBut since the a and b are in arbitrary order, for any possible pairing, as long as s >=x, we can arrange things to maximize or minimize his rank.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal and maximal possible ranks of s across all possible valid pairings.\n\nWait, but for any pairing where s is fixed, the rank depends on how many participants have a sum higher than s, plus whether s is unique or tied.\n\nBut since the pairing can vary, perhaps the best way to model this is:\n\n- For the best possible rank, find the maximum possible s that is >=x, and then arrange the rest to minimize the number of participants with higher s.\n\n- For the worst possible rank, find the minimal possible s that is >=x, and arrange the rest to maximize the number of participants with higher s.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the pairing affects both the sum and the arrangement of others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and the rest are arranged in such a way that as few as possible have higher sums. Similarly, the worst rank is when Vasya's sum is as low as possible, and as many others as possible have higher sums.\n\nSo, for the best case:\n\n- Find the maximum possible sum s that Vasya can have (s >=x). Then, for all other participants, arrange their a and b such that their sums are as small as possible.\n\nWait, but the a and b are fixed. So, the way to maximize Vasya's sum is to pick a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible, but still s >=x.\n\nOnce we choose s as the maximum possible, then for the best rank, we need to arrange the other participants' a and b in such a way that their sums are as small as possible, thus making Vasya's rank as high as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case, choose the minimal possible s (>=x), and arrange others' sums to be as large as possible, thus making Vasya's rank as low as possible.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For all possible pairs (i,j), compute s = a_i + b_j. We only consider those s >=x, as Vasya's sum must be at least x.\n\n2. For each such s, calculate the best and worst possible rank.\n\n3. Among all possible s, find the minimal s that allows the best rank, and the maximal s that allows the worst rank. Or wait, perhaps for the best rank, we take the maximum s possible, because higher s leads to better rank.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nBest rank: To get the best possible rank, Vasya should have the highest possible sum s. Because higher s means fewer people can have a sum higher than s.\n\nSo, the best rank is achieved when s is as large as possible. So, for the best rank, find the maximum possible s such that s >=x, and then arrange the other participants to have as small sums as possible, thus allowing Vasya to be in a higher position.\n\nSimilarly, the worst rank is when s is as small as possible, but still >=x, and arrange others to have as large as possible sums, leading to Vasya being in a lower position.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute all possible s = a_i + b_j where s >=x.\n\n- For each such s, determine what is the best possible rank and worst possible rank.\n\nThen, among all possible s, find the maximum s that gives the best possible rank, and the minimum s that gives the worst possible rank.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, the best possible rank is determined by how many participants can have a sum > s, plus whether s is unique or not.\n\nWait, no. Because when you fix s, the best possible rank is determined by the minimal number of participants who can have sum >= s.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nTo find the best possible rank for Vasya:\n\n- Choose the maximum possible s such that s >=x. Then, for the other participants, arrange their sums to be as small as possible, so that as few as possible have sum >=s.\n\nThis would give the best possible rank.\n\nSimilarly, to find the worst possible rank:\n\n- Choose the minimum possible s such that s >=x. Then, arrange the other participants' sums to be as large as possible, so that as many as possible have sum >=s.\n\nSo, the steps for best possible rank:\n\n1. Find all possible s where s = a_i + b_j, s >=x.\n\n2. For each such s, compute the maximum possible number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum <= s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each s, the best possible rank is the number of participants whose sum is > s, plus one.\n\nWait, but for the best possible rank, we want to minimize this number.\n\nSo, for each possible s, the best rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum > s.\n\nBut since the pairing can be chosen, for a given s, what is the minimal number of participants that can have sum > s?\n\nThat is, for a given s, the minimal number of participants that must have sum > s, regardless of pairing.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given s, the minimal possible number of participants with sum > s is the minimal possible when the other participants are arranged to have as small a sum as possible.\n\nSo, to compute the best possible rank for each s, we can compute the minimal number of participants that have sum > s, and then add 1.\n\nSo, the best rank for s is 1 + (number of participants who, in any pairing, must have sum > s).\n\nWait, but how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible s (a_i + b_j, s >=x), compute the minimal possible count of participants (other than Vasya) who can have sum > s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nWait, but that's tricky.\n\nPerhaps another angle: for a given s, what's the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum < s?\n\nBecause for Vasya's rank to be as good as possible, we want as many others as possible to have sum < s.\n\nSo, for a given s, the maximum possible number of participants with sum < s is m. Then, the best rank is m+1 (if no one else is above s).\n\nWait, but how to compute this for a given s.\n\nWait, for a given s, the maximum number of participants (other than Vasya) that can have sum < s is equal to the maximum number of pairs (i,j) such that a_i + b_j < s, but ensuring that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nWait, no. Because the pairing is a bijection between a and b.\n\nSo, for a given s, the maximum number of participants (excluding Vasya) that can have sum < s is the maximum number of a's and b's that can be paired in such a way that their sum is < s.\n\nBut this is equivalent to finding a matching between a and b where as many pairs as possible have sum < s.\n\nSo, this becomes a bipartite graph problem, where we have a's and b's as two sets of nodes, and edges exist between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j < s.\n\nWe need to find the maximum matching in this bipartition, which would give the maximum number of participants (other than Vasya) that can have sum < s.\n\nThus, the best possible rank for s is 1 + (n-1 - maximum_matching_size), because the maximum_matching_size is the maximum number of participants that can have sum < s. So, the number of participants with sum > s is (n-1 - maximum_matching_size), since the remaining participants (other than Vasya) have sum >=s.\n\nWait, not sure. Let's clarify.\n\nTotal participants: n.\n\nVasya is one of them. So, the other n-1 participants.\n\nIn the best scenario for Vasya, we want as many of the other n-1 participants as possible to have sum < s. So, the maximum possible is the maximum matching size, which is the maximum number of a's and b's that can be paired to sum less than s.\n\nSo, the number of participants with sum < s is max_matching_size.\n\nThen, the number of participants with sum >=s is (n-1 - max_matching_size).\n\nBut wait, because some of those (n-1 - max_matching_size) may have sum equal to s. Those can be placed before or after Vasya.\n\nWait, for the best rank, we want to place Vasya as early as possible. So, for the participants with sum ==s, they can be placed after Vasya or before. Since the jury can decide, we can arrange them to be after Vasya, thus not affecting his rank.\n\nTherefore, for the best rank, Vasya's rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum > s).\n\nSo, the best rank is 1 + (n-1 - max_matching_size).\n\nSimilarly, for the worst rank, we want as many participants as possible to have sum > s, so that Vasya's rank is as bad as possible.\n\nThus, for the worst rank, we need to find the minimal number of participants (other than Vasya) that can have sum < s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the worst rank, we want as many participants as possible to have sum > s. So, the number of participants with sum > s is as large as possible.\n\nThus, for a given s, the worst possible rank is 1 + (max number of participants that can have sum > s).\n\nHow do we compute this?\n\nWait, for a given s, the worst possible rank is when as many participants as possible have sum > s.\n\nSo, the number of participants with sum > s is as large as possible.\n\nWhich implies that the number of participants with sum <=s is as small as possible.\n\nSo, for a given s, the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s is (n-1 - min_possible_participants_with_sum_leq_s).\n\nBut what is the minimal possible number of participants with sum <=s?\n\nThat's the minimal number of a's and b's that can be paired to sum <=s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe it's similar to the maximum matching problem.\n\nWait, for the worst case, for a given s, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s is (n-1 - minimal_matching_size), where minimal_matching_size is the minimal number of a's and b's that can be paired to sum <=s.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal_matching_size is the maximum number of participants that can have sum <=s.\n\nSo, for a given s, the worst possible rank is 1 + (n-1 - minimal_matching_size).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn the worst case for Vasya, we want as many other participants as possible to have sum >s. So, the number of participants with sum >s is as large as possible.\n\nWhich is equivalent to having as few participants as possible with sum <=s.\n\nSo, for the worst possible rank, for a given s, the number of participants with sum >s is (n-1 - minimal_matching_size), where minimal_matching_size is the maximum number of participants (other than Vasya) that can have sum <=s.\n\nWait, no. Minimal matching size is the maximum number of participants that can have sum <=s, but we want to minimize that. Wait, perhaps it's the minimal number of participants that can have sum <=s.\n\nNo, perhaps not. Let's think differently.\n\nFor a given s, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s is (n-1) minus the maximum number of participants that can have sum <=s.\n\nBecause, for the participants, each can have sum >s, sum =s, or sum <s.\n\nWe want as many as possible to have sum >s, so we need as few as possible to have sum <=s.\n\nThus, the minimal possible number of participants (other than Vasya) with sum <=s is the minimal number required.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number is the maximum between (total_a_less_s + total_b_less_s) - (n-1), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number is the maximum number of participants that can have sum <=s.\n\nWait, no. Because when pairing, the a and b are used exactly once.\n\nSo, to find the maximum number of participants (other than Vasya) that can have sum <=s, we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j <=s. Then, the maximum matching in this graph is the maximum number of participants that can have sum <=s.\n\nSo, the minimal number of participants with sum >s is (n-1) - maximum_matching_size.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank for s is 1 + (n-1 - maximum_matching_size).\n\nWait, no. Because the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >s plus one.\n\nSo, the worst rank is (number of participants with sum >s) + 1.\n\nWhich is (n-1 - maximum_matching_size) + 1 = n - maximum_matching_size.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me think with an example.\n\nSuppose n=5, and s is such that in the bipartition, maximum matching size is 3.\n\nSo, maximum_matching_size is 3 participants can have sum <=s.\n\nSo, the number of participants with sum >s is 5-1-3=1.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 1+1=2.\n\nBut if the maximum_matching_size is 3, then the worst rank is 2.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWell, in the worst case, as many as possible have sum >s. So, with maximum_matching_size 3, meaning 3 participants have sum <=s, then the remaining 1 (5-1=4, 4-3=1) have sum >s. So, the worst rank is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each possible s, the best possible rank is 1 + (n-1 - maximum_matching_size_for_best), where maximum_matching_size_for_best is the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum <s.\n\nWait, earlier I thought for best rank, it's 1 + (n-1 - maximum_matching_size), but now I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express this.\n\nFor a given s, the best possible rank is the minimal possible number of participants (including Vasya) with sum >=s.\n\nBut wait, no. Vasya's sum is s. So, the participants with sum >s will come before him, and those with sum ==s can be arranged either before or after.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1 plus the number of participants with sum >s.\n\nSo, for a given s, the best possible rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum >s).\n\nSimilarly, the worst possible rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum >s).\n\nWait, no. Because for the worst rank, the jury can arrange participants with sum ==s to come after Vasya, so the number of participants with sum >s is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the worst rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum >s).\n\nThus, for each s, the best possible rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum >s), and the worst possible rank is also 1 + (number of participants with sum >s).\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because for the best rank, you can arrange the participants with sum ==s to come after Vasya, thus not affecting his rank.\n\nThus, the best rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum >s).\n\nSimilarly, the worst rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum >s).\n\nBecause in the worst case, the jury arranges all participants with sum >s to come before Vasya, and those with sum ==s to come after.\n\nSo, for a given s, the best and worst rank are the same.\n\nWait, that's not correct according to the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\n5 participants, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nEach possible pairing gives each participant a sum of 2.\n\nSo, in the best case, Vasya can be ranked first, and in the worst case, last.\n\nSo, the best and worst ranks are 1 and 5.\n\nBut for each s=2, the number of participants with sum >s is zero.\n\nThus, best rank is 1, worst rank is 1+0=1? But in reality, the worst rank is 5.\n\nAh, so my previous reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of participants with sum >s is zero, but the sum equals s for all.\n\nSo, for the best rank, the jury can arrange all participants with sum equal to s to come after Vasya. So, he is first.\n\nFor the worst rank, the jury can arrange all participants with sum equal to s to come before him, so he is last.\n\nThus, in this case, the best and worst ranks are 1 and 5.\n\nSo, for a given s, the number of participants with sum >s is zero. But the number of participants with sum ==s is n-1 (since all have sum 2). So, the best rank is 1, the worst is (n-1)+1=5.\n\nSo, the previous approach is incorrect. It seems that when s is such that many participants have sum ==s, the best and worst ranks can vary widely.\n\nThus, the initial approach is wrong. So, I need to rethink.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor a given s, the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can arrange all participants with sum ==s to come after Vasya.\n\nThe worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >s plus the number of participants with sum ==s, because the jury can arrange all those with sum ==s to come before Vasya.\n\nWait, no. Because the participants with sum ==s can be ordered in any way relative to each other.\n\nSo, for the worst possible rank, the number of participants with sum >s comes before Vasya, and the number of participants with sum ==s can be arranged before or after.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum >s).\n\nWait, but in the example, all participants have sum 2, so the number of participants with sum >s is zero. So, the worst rank is 1 + 0=1, which contradicts the sample where the worst is 5.\n\nThus, perhaps this approach is missing something.\n\nAnother angle: the problem statement says that the participants are sorted in decreasing order of their sum. If two have the same sum, their order is arbitrary. So, for the purpose of determining the rank, the participants with sum >s will be before Vasya, and those with sum ==s can be either before or after.\n\nThus, the best rank is 1 (because the jury can arrange all sum ==s to come after Vasya), and the worst rank is (number of participants with sum >s + 1) + (number of participants with sum ==s) - 1.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, for the worst rank, the jury can arrange all participants with sum >s to come before Vasya, and all participants with sum ==s to come after him. So, Vasya's rank is (number of participants with sum >s) + 1.\n\nBut in the sample, all participants have sum 2. So, for s=2, the number of participants with sum>2 is zero. Thus, Vasya's worst rank is 1.\n\nBut according to the sample, the worst rank is 5.\n\nThis suggests that my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the rank is determined by the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum, plus the number of participants with sum equal to Vasya's sum that are placed before him.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is when all participants with sum equal to s are placed before him. Thus, the rank is (number of participants with sum >s) + (number of participants with sum ==s).\n\nSo, for the sample, sum is 2. Number of participants with sum >s is zero, number with sum ==s is 4 (since including Vasya). So, the worst rank is 4 + 1 =5.\n\nAh, that makes sense.\n\nThus, the formula for the worst possible rank is (number of participants with sum >s) + (number of participants with sum ==s).\n\nAnd for the best possible rank, it's 1, because the jury can arrange all sum ==s to come after.\n\nWait, no. Because for the best possible rank, the best is 1. For the worst, it's (number of participants with sum >s) + (number of participants with sum ==s).\n\nSo, for each possible s, the best possible rank is 1, and the worst possible rank is (k + l), where k is the number of participants with sum >s, and l is the number of participants with sum ==s (including Vasya).\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the sample, for s=2, k=0, l=5. So, worst rank is 0+5=5, which matches.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each possible s (where s >=x):\n\n- Compute the number of participants with sum >s: k.\n\n- Compute the number of participants with sum ==s: l.\n\n- Then, the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can arrange all l-1 (other participants with sum ==s) to come after Vasya.\n\n- The worst possible rank is (k + l), because the jury can arrange all l participants (including Vasya) to be after the k participants with sum>s.\n\nWait, no. Because including Vasya, the l includes himself. So, the worst possible rank is (k) + (l-1) +1 =k + l.\n\nBecause the k participants are before Vasya, and the l-1 others with sum ==s can be arranged before or after. For the worst case, all l-1 are arranged before, making Vasya's rank (k + (l-1)) +1 =k + l.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each s, the worst possible rank is k + l, where k is the number of participants with sum>s, and l is the number of participants with sum==s.\n\nThe best possible rank is 1, because the jury can arrange all l-1 participants with sum==s to come after Vasya.\n\nThus, for each possible s, the best possible rank is 1, and the worst possible rank is (k + l).\n\nBut wait, the best possible rank isn't always 1. Suppose there are multiple participants with sum>s. For example, suppose s is 10, and there are two participants with sum>10, say 11 and 12. Then, the best possible rank for Vasya is 3 (since the two are before him), and the worst is 3 + (number of sum==s) ?\n\nWait, no. Because for the best rank, the jury can arrange the participants with sum ==s to come after Vasya, regardless of others. So, the best possible rank is always 1.\n\nWait, but no. Because if Vasya's sum is s, and there are participants with sum >s, then in the best case, the jury can arrange those participants to come before Vasya, and the ones with sum ==s can come after. So, Vasya's rank is (number of sum>s) +1.\n\nWait, no. Because the participants with sum ==s can be placed either before or after, depending on the jury's decision. So, for the best possible rank, the jury can arrange them to come after, so Vasya's rank is 1 + (number of sum>s).\n\nWait, but in the sample, when all have sum ==s, the best rank is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the best possible rank is 1 + (number of sum>s).\n\nBut then, in the sample, that would be 1 +0=1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose s=5, and there are 2 participants with sum>5. Then, the best rank is 3 (because the two are before Vasya, and he is third). But according to the previous idea, the best rank is 1.\n\nBut that's not correct, because the two participants with sum>5 would come before him, so his rank is 3.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the initial approach was incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to reevaluate.\n\nLet me try to formalize:\n\nThe rank of a participant is 1-based. Participants are sorted in non-increasing order of their sum. Ties can be arranged arbitrarily.\n\nThus, for a given s, the participants are divided into three groups:\n\nA: sum > s.\n\nB: sum == s.\n\nC: sum < s.\n\nThe size of A is |A|, B is |B|, C is |C|.\n\nThe participants in group A will all come before those in group B and C.\n\nWithin group B, their order is arbitrary.\n\nWithin group C, their order is arbitrary.\n\nThus, for the best possible rank of Vasya (who is in group B), the best case is that he is placed as early as possible.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1 + |A|.\n\nBecause the |A| participants are before him, and he is placed immediately after.\n\nWait, but in group B, other participants can be placed before him, which would lower his rank.\n\nNo, because group B is the same sum as Vasya. So, the jury can arrange Vasya to be first in group B.\n\nThus, in the best case, Vasya's rank is |A| + 1.\n\nIn the worst case, all other group B participants are placed before him, making his rank |A| + |B|.\n\nThus, for each s:\n\n- |A| is the number of participants with sum >s.\n\n- |B| is the number of participants with sum ==s.\n\nThen, the best possible rank is |A| + 1.\n\nThe worst possible rank is |A| + |B|.\n\nSo, for the sample input, when s=2:\n\n|A|=0, |B|=5.\n\nThus, best rank is 1, worst is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: suppose s=5, and |A|=2, |B|=3.\n\nThen, best rank is 3, worst is 5.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each possible s (s >=x), compute:\n\nbest_rank = |A| + 1\n\nworst_rank = |A| + |B|\n\nThen, for all possible s, the best possible overall rank is the minimum of all best_ranks, and the worst possible overall rank is the maximum of all worst_ranks.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, the best possible rank for Vasya is |A| +1, and the worst possible is |A| + |B|. But for our problem, we need to find the best possible overall rank (the smallest possible) and the worst possible overall rank (the largest possible).\n\nWait, no. The best possible rank is the minimal possible rank across all possible s, and the worst possible rank is the maximal possible rank across all possible s.\n\nWait, no. Because for different s, the best and worst ranks can vary.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the best and worst possible ranks that Vasya could have.\n\nSo, for each s, compute the best and worst ranks, and then overall, the best possible rank across all s is the minimal possible, and the worst possible is the maximal possible.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible s = a_i + b_j, where s >=x.\n\n2. For each s, compute |A| = number of participants with sum >s.\n\n   |B| = number of participants with sum ==s.\n\n3. Compute best_rank = |A| + 1.\n\n   Compute worst_rank = |A| + |B|.\n\n4. Among all s, find the minimal best_rank and the maximal worst_rank.\n\nThus, the output is the minimal best_rank and the maximal worst_rank.\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nIn the sample input:\n\nAll s are 2.\n\nThus, for each s=2:\n\n|A|=0, |B|=5.\n\nbest_rank=1.\n\nworst_rank=5.\n\nThus, the minimal best_rank is 1, the maximal worst_rank is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3, x=5.\n\na = [3,3,3]\n\nb = [3,3,3].\n\nPossible s: 6.\n\nFor each s=6:\n\n|A|=0, |B|=3.\n\nbest_rank=1.\n\nworst_rank=3.\n\nThus, output is 1 3.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3.\n\na = [1,2,3]\n\nb = [4,5,6].\n\nPossible s:\n\ni=1, j=1: 5.\n\ni=1, j=2:6.\n\ni=1, j=3:7.\n\ni=2, j=1:6.\n\ni=2, j=2:7.\n\ni=2, j=3:8.\n\ni=3, j=1:7.\n\ni=3, j=2:8.\n\ni=3, j=3:9.\n\nNow, x=5.\n\nSo, possible s are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nFor each s:\n\nCompute |A| and |B|.\n\nLet's take s=5.\n\nParticipants' sums:\n\nParticipant 1: 1+4=5.\n\nParticipant 2:2+5=7.\n\nParticipant 3:3+6=9.\n\nSo, |A|=2 (participants 2 and 3 have sum>5).\n\n|B|=1 (participant 1).\n\nThus, best_rank = 2+1=3.\n\nworst_rank=2+1=3.\n\nAnother s=6:\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nAssuming a is [1,2,3], b is [4,5,6].\n\nFor s=6, the possible pairs are:\n\n1+5=6, 2+4=6, 3+3=6 (but 3 is not in b, since b is [4,5,6]. So, 3+3 is not possible.\n\nWait, sorry, for s=6, possible a_i +b_j =6.\n\nLooking for a_i and b_j such that a_i +b_j =6.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n1+5=6.\n\n2+4=6.\n\n3+3=6 → but 3 is not in b (b is [4,5,6]).\n\nThus, only two pairs.\n\nSo, in the pairing, two participants have sum 6, and the third has sum 9.\n\nWait, no. Because the pairing is a permutation. So, for s=6, how many participants have sum>6.\n\nWait, for a given s=6, the a and b arrays are fixed, but the pairing can be any permutation.\n\nWait, no. The a and b arrays are given, but the pairing is a permutation. So, for s=6, the a and b are paired in any way, but the sum is 6.\n\nSo, for s=6, the possible participants are those who are paired to sum 6.\n\nBut to compute |A| and |B|, we need to know how many participants have sum>6.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible s, we can compute the maximum and minimum possible |A| and |B|.\n\nWait, but this is getting too time-consuming.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to:\n\nFor each possible s, compute the maximum and minimum possible |A| and |B|.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for each s, the minimal possible |A| is the maximum between (number of a_i > s - b_j) etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, the maximum possible |A| is the number of a_i + b_j >s.\n\nWait, no, because the pairing affects which a and b are used.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the way to proceed is as follows:\n\nFor each possible s (a_i + b_j, s >=x), compute:\n\n- |A| is the maximum possible number of participants with sum >s.\n\nWait, no. Because |A| is dependent on the pairing.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, the maximum possible |A| is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves considering all possible pairs of points from the two tours and calculating the resulting ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the best and worst ranks Vasya could achieve given that his total points (sum of points from both tours) are at least `x`. Each participant's total points are determined by pairing each participant's first tour points with another participant's second tour points.\n\n2. **Generate Possible Sums**: For each possible pair of points from the first and second tours, compute the sum. Only consider sums that are greater than or equal to `x`.\n\n3. **Calculate Ranks for Each Sum**: For each valid sum:\n   - Determine how many participants can have a higher sum (`|A|`).\n   - Determine how many participants have the same sum as Vasya (`|B|`).\n\n4. **Determine Best and Worst Ranks**: For each sum, the best rank is 1 (as Vasya can be placed first if others with the same sum are arranged after him). The worst rank is calculated as the number of participants with a higher sum plus the number of participants with the same sum, as they can all be placed before Vasya.\n\n5. **Find Minimum and Maximum Ranks**: Among all valid sums, find the smallest best rank and the largest worst rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    possible_sums = []\n    for ai in a:\n        for bj in b:\n            s = ai + bj\n            if s >= x:\n                possible_sums.append(s)\n\n    min_best = float('inf')\n    max_worst = -float('inf')\n\n    for s in possible_sums:\n        # Compute |A| and |B|\n        count_a = 0\n        count_b = 0\n        # Create a frequency dictionary for all possible sums\n        freq = {}\n        for ai in a:\n            for bj in b:\n                total = ai + bj\n                if total == s:\n                    count_b += 1\n                elif total > s:\n                    count_a += 1\n                # else: total < s, do nothing for this loop\n        # Now, we need to see if it's possible for |A| to be as high as count_a\n        # But wait, in reality, not all a_i and b_j can form sums >s because each a and b can be used only once\n        # So, the maximum possible |A| is determined by the minimal between the counts of a_i and b_j that can form sums >s\n        # Alternatively, perhaps the maximum |A| is the minimum between the number of a_i that can form sum >s and the number of b_j that can form sum >s.\n        # But I'm not sure.
