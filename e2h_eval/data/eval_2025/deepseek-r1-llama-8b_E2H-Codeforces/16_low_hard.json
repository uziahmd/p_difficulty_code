Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) formed by roads in Crazy Town. Each road is an infinite line defined by an equation aix + biy + ci = 0. My home and university are in some blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to the university's block. Each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\nHmm. So, how do I model this? I think each road can partition the plane into two halves. The blocks are regions separated by these roads. But since roads are lines, each additional road can intersect existing ones, creating more regions.\n\nWait, but for our problem, the key is to figure out how many roads separate the home and university points. Because each such road would contribute to the number of steps required.\n\nWait, wait. Because when you cross a single road line, it divides the plane. So, if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then they are in different blocks. Each such road adds a step.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: suppose there are k roads that separate home and university. Then, the minimal steps would be k. Because each time you cross a road, you move from one block to another. So, if you have to cross k roads, you'd need k steps.\n\nYes, because each road you cross adds one step. So, the minimal steps are equal to the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each road, determine whether the home and university are on the same side or not.\n2. Count the number of roads where they are on opposite sides.\n3. That count is the answer.\n\nHow to check if two points are on the same side of a line?\n\nFor a line ax + by + c = 0, compute the value f(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c. If f(h) and f(u) have the same sign, they are on the same side; otherwise, they are on opposite sides.\n\nWait, but what if f(h) and f(u) are both zero? But the problem states that neither home nor university lie on any road. So, we don't have to worry about that case.\n\nSo, for each road, compute f(h) and f(u). Multiply them. If the product is negative, then they are on opposite sides. So, the number of such roads is the answer.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read home (x1, y1), university (x2, y2).\n- Read n roads.\n- For each road (a, b, c):\n   - Compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   - Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n   - If s1 * s2 < 0: increment the count.\n- Output the count.\n\nThat's the approach!\n\nSo, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0 --> line y=0\n1 0 0 --> line x=0\n\nWait, the home is (1,1), which is above both lines. University is (-1,-1), which is also above both lines? Wait no.\n\nWait for the first road: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0. Home is (1,1): y=1>0. University is (-1,-1): y=-1<0. So, they are on opposite sides of this road. So, count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. Home is x=1>0. University is x=-1<0. Again, opposite sides. So count +=1. Total steps 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example in the sample input is when there are three roads, including 1x +0y -3=0 → x=3. Home is (1,1) is x=1 <3, so f=1+0*1 -3 = -2. University (-1,-1): f= -1 -3 = -4. Both are negative. So same side. So, this road doesn't contribute.\n\nSo, for that road, they are on same side. So, the count remains 2.\n\nHence, the output is 2.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe need to read the home and university coordinates as integers. Then read n, then read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nFor each line, compute s1 and s2. Check if their product is negative. Sum those cases.\n\nFinally, output the sum as a string.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nWhat if n=0? No, n is at least ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road (line) in Crazy Town can partition the plane into two halves. If your home and university are on opposite sides of a road, they belong to different blocks separated by that road. The minimum number of steps required to move from one block to another is equal to the number of such roads that separate the home and university.\n\n1. **Check Road Separation**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), compute the value of \\(ax + by + c\\) at both the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, it means the home and university are on opposite sides of that road.\n2. **Count Separating Roads**: Count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1 = int(input[idx])\n    y1 = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    x2 = int(input[idx])\n    y2 = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        b = int(input[idx+1])\n        c = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx +=3\n        \n        s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count +=1\n    \n    print(str(count))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Each Road**: For each road, it computes the value of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Separation**: It checks if these values have opposite signs, indicating that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n4. **Counting Steps**: The total count of such roads is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home's block to the university's block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their geometric interpretations.",
