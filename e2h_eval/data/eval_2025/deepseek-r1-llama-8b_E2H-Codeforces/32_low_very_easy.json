    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Array Stabilization. We are given an array of integers. The instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array. Our task is to remove exactly one element from the array such that the resulting instability is minimized. We need to find this minimum possible instability.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I think is, what's the approach here? Well, let's see.\n\nLet me think about the sample input. For example, in the first case, the array is [1,3,3,7]. If we remove 7, the new array is [1,3,3], so max is 3, min is 1, instability is 2. But if we remove 1, then the array becomes [3,3,7], max is 7, min is 3, instability is 4. So clearly, removing the max or min can help reduce the instability.\n\nWait, but sometimes that's not the case. Like in the second sample where the array is [1, 100000]. Removing either gives a single element, so instability is zero. So the idea is to find which element, when removed, leads to the smallest possible max - min of the remaining array.\n\nSo, how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe naive approach would be to try removing each element, compute the max and min of the remaining array, and track the minimum instability across all these possibilities. But with n up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow.\n\nI need a more efficient method.\n\nLet me think: the initial instability is (max(a) - min(a)). When we remove an element, the new instability depends on whether that element was the current max, min, or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way to minimize the instability is to choose to remove either the current max or current min. Because by doing so, the new max or min could be closer, thus reducing the overall difference.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple max or min elements? Like in the first sample, the array has two 3s and a 7 and 1. So when we remove 7, the max becomes 3, which is lower than before. Similarly, if the array has multiple maxes, like [5,5,3], then removing one of the 5s won't change the max.\n\nSo, maybe the approach is:\n\n- Compute the initial max and min of the entire array.\n- Find all occurrences of the max and min in the array.\n- For each occurrence of max, consider removing it. Then compute the new max and min of the remaining elements. The instability would be new_max - new_min.\n- Do the same for each occurrence of the min.\n- Then, among all these possibilities, find the minimal instability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to just consider the cases where we remove the global max or min. Because removing any other element won't affect the max or min as much.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the array is [2, 1, 5, 5]. The initial max is 5, min is 1. If I remove one 5, the max remains 5, min is still 1. So the instability is 4. If I remove the 1, the min becomes 2, max is 5, instability is 3. So in this case, removing the min is better.\n\nBut if I have an array where the second max is very close to the second min, perhaps removing a non-extreme element could lead to a smaller instability.\n\nWait, let's take another example. Suppose the array is [10, 1, 9, 8, 2]. The initial max is 10, min is 1. Instability is 9.\n\nIf I remove 10: the new array is [1,9,8,2]. New max is 9, min is 1. Instability is 8.\n\nIf I remove 1: new array is [10,9,8,2]. Max is 10, min is 2. Instability is 8.\n\nIf I remove 9: new array is [10,8,2,1]. Max is 10, min is 1. Instability is 9.\n\nWait, so in this case, removing either the max or min gives a worse result than some other element. Wait, but no, because both give 8, which is better than 9.\n\nWait, but what if the array is [5,5,3,5]. Max is 5, min is 3. If I remove a 5, the array becomes [5,3,5]. Max is 5, min is 3. Instability is 2. Which is better than if I remove ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Elements**: The primary candidates for removal are the current maximum and minimum values in the array. Removing either can potentially reduce the instability.\n2. **Compute Instability for Each Candidate**: For each candidate (current max and min), compute the instability of the array if that candidate is removed. This involves finding the new maximum and minimum values of the remaining elements.\n3. **Determine Minimum Instability**: Track the minimum instability across all candidates considered.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal element to remove without having to recompute the entire array's properties from scratch each time, thus optimizing the solution to run in linear time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    current_max = max(a)\n    current_min = min(a)\n    # Find all indices where a[i] is current_max or current_min\n    candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] == current_max:\n            candidates.append(i)\n        if a[i] == current_min:\n            candidates.append(i)\n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    for idx in candidates:\n        temp = a[:idx] + a[idx+1:]\n        if not temp:\n            continue\n        new_max = max(temp)\n        new_min = min(temp)\n        inst = new_max - new_min\n        if inst < min_instability:\n            min_instability = inst\n    print(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If there is only one element, the instability is zero since no removal is needed.\n3. **Identifying Candidates**: We identify all occurrences of the current maximum and minimum values in the array.\n4. **Evaluating Candidates**: For each candidate (each occurrence of max or min), we create a new array excluding that candidate and compute its instability.\n5. **Finding Minimum Instability**: We track the minimum instability encountered during the evaluation of all candidates.\n\nThis method efficiently narrows down the potential elements to remove and computes the required result in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
