He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, which must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C added them. The count can be equal to both, but that's also allowed.\n\nThe string I'm given must satisfy these conditions. So, I need to verify:\n\n1. The string must consist of only 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. Any deviation from this order is a 'NO'.\n\n2. The count of 'c's (let's call it c_count) must be equal to the count of 'a's or to the count of 'b's.\n\nAlso, since each step appends to the end, the string structure must be non-decreasing in terms of the character sequence. So 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nSo, the steps to solve this are:\n\nFirst, check the order of the string. It should have a's, then b's, then c's without any mixing.\n\nThen, count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n\nThen, check if c_count equals a_count or b_count.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but how to check the order? Because the string must be a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. So, once a 'b' appears, no 'a's should come after it. Similarly, after the first 'c', no other characters except 'c's should appear.\n\nSo, for example, the string 'aabba' would be invalid because after the 'bb', an 'a' comes again.\n\nSimilarly, 'abac' is invalid because after a 'b', a 'a' appears, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Split the string into three parts: a_part, b_part, c_part.\n- The string should be such that all a's come before any b's, which in turn come before any c's.\n\nHow to do that:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and track the current allowed characters. Once we switch from 'a' to 'b', we can't go back to 'a'. Similarly, once we switch to 'c's, we can't switch back.\n\nSo, during the iteration, if we find a character that doesn't follow the current allowed set, the string is invalid.\n\nAnother approach is to split the string into runs of each character and ensure that the runs are in the order a, b, c.\n\nYes, that's another way. For example, the runs would be like:\n\nFor 'aaabccc': the runs are a (3), b (2), c (3).\n\nFor 'aabc': a (2), b (1), c (1). Wait, no, wait the string is 'aabc' which is a a b c. So runs are a, a, b, c? Or wait, no, the runs are a (2), b (1), c (1). But the order is correct because a comes before b before c.\n\nBut in the case of 'abacc', the runs would be a (1), b (1), a (1), c (2). So the order is a, b, a, which is invalid because a comes after b.\n\nSo, the runs must form a sequence of exactly a, then b, then c. No more than three runs, and the order must be a, b, c.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nI can split the string into groups where each group consists of the same character. For example, 'aabbbccc' becomes ['aa', 'bbb', 'ccc'].\n\nThen, check if the groups are in the order 'a', 'b', 'c'. Also, there should be exactly three groups, because after A appends, B appends, then C appends. So the string must have a part with a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo, if the groups are less than 3, it's invalid. For example, a string with only a's and b's is invalid because C didn't append anything, but according to the problem statement, the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. Wait, no: the problem says that when C appends, he appends some number of c's, so the string will have at least one c as well. So the string must have a's, b's, and c's. Therefore, the groups must be exactly three, in the order a, b, c.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Check if the string has at least one a, one b, and one c. If any of these counts is zero, output 'NO'.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial string from A is all a's, then B appends some b's, so the combined string before C appends will have a's and b's. Then C appends c's, so the final string will have a's, b's, and c's. So, the given string must have all three letters present.\n\nSo, if the string doesn't contain 'a', 'b', and 'c', it's automatically 'NO'.\n\nSo, first, check if all three are present. Else, output 'NO'.\n\nSecond, split into runs, and check that the runs are in the order a, b, c, and there are exactly three runs.\n\nIf any of these checks fail, output 'NO'.\n\nThird, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck if the count of c's is equal to a's count or b's count.\n\nIf all these are true, output 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 'aaabccc'\n\nRuns: a (3), b (2), c (3). So, yes, three runs, order correct.\n\nCounts: a=3, b=2, c=3.\n\nc_count is 3, which equals a_count (3). So condition met. Output 'YES'.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc'.\n\nWait, the string is 'bbacc'? Wait, the input is ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'].\n\nWait, let me see the second input: 'bbacc' — the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'? Or wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me see: the string is 'bbacc' — so the first two are 'b's, then 'a', then 'c's. So the runs are 'bb', 'a', 'cc'. So the runs are b, a, c. So the order is incorrect. So the string fails the run order check. So output is 'NO'.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' — runs are a (2), b (1), c (1). So order is correct. Counts: a=2, b=1, c=1. So c_count is 1, which equals b_count (1). So condition met. Output 'YES'.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: what if the string is 'abba'? Then the runs are a, b, a. So the order is a, b, a — which is wrong. So 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' — runs are a, b, c, a, b, c. So the order is incorrect because after c comes a again. So 'NO'.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbbc' — runs a, b, c. Correct. a=2, b=3, c=1. So c_count is 1, which is neither a nor b count. So output 'NO'.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbc' — runs a, b, c. a=4, b=4, c=1. So c_count is 1, which isn't equal to a or b. So 'NO'.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbc' — a=3, b=3, c=1. So c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So 'NO'.\n\nWhat about 'aabbaa'? Runs are a, b, a. So the order is wrong. So 'NO'.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaaccc' — runs a, b, a, c. So the order is a, b, a, which is wrong. So 'NO'.\n\nWhat about a string where the order is correct, but c_count is equal to a and b counts?\n\nLike 'aabbccc': a=2, b=2, c=3. So c_count is 3, which is not equal to a or b. So 'NO'.\n\nAnother example: 'aaabbbccc' — a=3, b=3, c=3. So c_count is 3, which equals both a and b. So 'YES'.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbaabbaa' — no, because the runs are a, b, a, etc. So order is wrong.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where the string is 'abc' — runs a, b, c. a=1, b=1, c=1. So c_count is 1, which equals a and b. So 'YES'.\n\nAnother edge case: 'acb' — runs a, c, b. So order is wrong. 'NO'.\n\nAnother edge case: 'cba' — same, runs c, b, a. 'NO'.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabbc' — runs a, b, c. a=2, b=2, c=1. So c_count is 1. Not equal to a or b. So 'NO'.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' — a=1, b=3, c=1. c_count is 1, which equals a. So 'YES'.\n\nAnother case: 'abccc' — a=1, b=1, c=3. c_count is 3, which is equal to a and b? No, a is 1, so c_count is 3 which is larger. So 3 != 1, so 'NO'.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, C appends some number of 'c's, which is equal to the number of a's or b's in the string before adding c's. So the count of c's must be equal to the count of a's OR b's in the string up to that point.\n\nSo, for example, in 'abccc', the string before C appends is 'ab', which has a=1, b=1. So C can choose to add 1 or 1 'c's. So 'abccc' is valid if the count of c's is 1 or 1. Wait, but the count is 3. So it's invalid.\n\nSo 'abccc' is invalid.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the string after B appends is something like 'aaabbb' (for example), then C appends 'ccc' where the length is equal to the number of a's or b's. So the count of c's is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nSo, the c_count can be equal to a_count or b_count, regardless of their values.\n\nSo, in the case where a_count is 5, b_count is 3, and c_count is 3, that's okay because c_count equals b_count.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n1. Check that the string has all three letters.\n\n2. Split into runs, and check that the runs are a, b, c, in order.\n\n3. Count a, b, c.\n\n4. Check if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the string S.\n\nCheck if 'a' in S and 'b' in S and 'c' in S. If any is missing, print 'NO'.\n\nElse, split into runs.\n\nTo split into runs, we can iterate through the string, keeping track of the current character and the current count.\n\nInitialize prev_char as S[0], count = 1.\n\nThen, for each next character:\n\nif same as prev_char, increment count.\n\nelse, add the current run (prev_char, count) to the runs list, reset prev_char and count.\n\nAfter iteration, add the last run.\n\nOnce runs are generated, check:\n\n- len(runs) == 3.\n\n- runs[0].char == 'a', runs[1].char == 'b', runs[2].char == 'c'.\n\nIf not, output 'NO'.\n\nElse, compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\nCheck if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nIf yes, output 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nNow, let's write code.\n\nFirst, handling the runs.\n\nImplementing runs:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n    print('NO')\n    exit()\n\nruns = []\ncurrent_char = s[0]\ncount = 1\nfor char in s[1:]:\n    if char == current_char:\n        count +=1\n    else:\n        runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n        current_char = char\n        count = 1\nruns.append( (current_char, count) )\n\nif len(runs) !=3:\n    print('NO')\n    exit()\n\n# Check the runs order and characters\nif runs[0][0] != 'a' or runs[1][0] != 'b' or runs[2][0] != 'c':\n    print('NO')\n    exit()\n\na_count = runs[0][1]\nb_count = runs[1][1]\nc_count = runs[2][1]\n\nif c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n    print('YES')\nelse:\n    print('NO')\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, the length is at least 1, but in the code, we have 'a', 'b', 'c' in the string, so the runs cannot be empty.\n\nWait, the problem says the string is given as S, and 1 <= |S| <=5000.\n\nBut in our code, the first check is whether 'a', 'b', 'c' are all present. So for a string like 'a', it will fail because 'b' and 'c' are not present, so correctly output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' — runs are a, b, a. So len(runs) is 3, but the chars are a, b, a — which is invalid. So code correctly outputs 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' — runs a, b, c. So yes, and c_count is 1, which equals a and b counts. So 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: 'acb' — runs a, c, b. So runs[0] is a, runs[1] is c. So code will output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabbbccc' — runs a, b, c. a=3, b=3, c=3. c_count is 3, which equals a and b. So 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabbaa' — runs a, b, a, b, a — so len(runs) is 5>3. So code will output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' — runs a, b, a. So len(runs)=3, but runs[2][0] is 'a', which is not 'c'. So code will output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabc' — runs a, b, c. a=2, b=1, c=1. So c_count is 1, which equals b_count. So 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' — runs a, b, c, a, b, c. So len(runs) is 6>3, so 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' — runs a, b, a, c. So len(runs) is 4>3, so 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabbb' — this string has no 'c's. So code will detect that 'c' is not present and output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' — runs a, b, a, c. So len(runs)=4>3, so 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaa' — runs a, b, a. So 'NO'.\n\nWhat about the string 'abbbc' — runs a, b, c. a=1, b=3, c=1. c_count is 1, which equals a_count. So 'YES'.\n\nWait, in this case, C appends 1 'c' which equals a's count of 1. So it's valid.\n\nYes, code will output 'YES' for this.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific process involving three steps: appending 'a's, 'b's, and then 'c's with certain constraints.

If any of these characters are missing, the answer is \"NO\".\n2. **Split into Runs**: Convert the string into runs of consecutive identical characters. For example, \"aaabccc\" would be split into runs [('a', 3), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].\n3. **Validate Run Order**: Ensure the runs follow the exact order of 'a', 'b', and 'c' without any deviations or additional runs.\n4. **Count Validation**: Verify that the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if all required characters are present\nif 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Split the string into runs\n    runs = []\n    current_char = s[0]\n    count = 1\n    for char in s[1:]:\n        if char == current_char:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            runs.append((current_char, count))\n            current_char = char\n            count = 1\n    runs.append((current_char, count))\n    \n    # Check if there are exactly three runs and the order is correct\n    if len(runs) != 3:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if (runs[0][0] != 'a' or\n            runs[1][0] != 'b' or\n            runs[2][0] != 'c'):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            a_count = runs[0][1]\n            b_count = runs[1][1]\n            c_count = runs[2][1]\n            \n            if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Check**: The code first ensures the string contains 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n2. **Run Generation**: The string is converted into runs of consecutive characters to check the order.\n3. **Run Validation**: The runs must be exactly three in number and follow the sequence 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n4. **Count Check**: The number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's for the string to be valid.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the string meets the problem's requirements.",
