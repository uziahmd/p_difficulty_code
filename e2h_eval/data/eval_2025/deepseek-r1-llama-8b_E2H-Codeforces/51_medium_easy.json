Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if the pile of letters found in the morning can be used to exactly form both the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters left. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines: guest, host, and pile.\n2. Combine the guest and host names into a single string.\n3. Check if the pile has exactly the same letters as this combined string, with no extra letters and no missing letters.\n\nHmm, right. So the approach is to count the frequency of each character in the combined guest and host strings and then compare it to the frequency in the pile. If they match exactly, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSo first, I need to process each input line. Wait, but the input lines are given as three separate strings. Oh, wait, looking at the example input, it seems like each line is a string that represents the name. So for example, the first sample has three lines, which are the guest's name, host's name, and the pile.\n\nWait, but in the example, the guest's name is 'SANTACLAUS', the host's is 'DEDMOROZ', and the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'. When you combine them, their total letters should match the pile.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Concatenate guest and host to get all the required letters.\n- Then, create a frequency dictionary for this concatenated string.\n- Create a frequency dictionary for the pile.\n- Compare if both dictionaries are equal.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, I can use the `collections.Counter` class, which creates a dictionary-like object from a sequence, counting the occurrences of each element.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n1. Read the three input lines. Each line is a string, possibly containing multiple words (like a name), but for our purpose, we just need to process all the characters together.\n\nSo, read line 1 as guest, line 2 as host, line 3 as pile.\n\nWait, but the input is provided as three lines, right? So in the code, I'll read them via standard input. So, perhaps using input().strip() for each line.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So, for reading, perhaps:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, concatenate guest and host into one string: combined = guest + host.\n\nThen, create a Counter for combined and another Counter for pile.\n\nIf these two Counters are equal, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined length: len(SANTACLAUS) + len(DEDMOROZ) = let's see: SANTACLAUS is 10 letters, DEDMOROZ is 8. Total 18.\n\nPile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's count the letters: same as combining guest and host, so the Counters should match.\n\nSecond example:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL\nHost: JOULUPUKKI\nPile: BABONATALE FATHERCHRISTMAS BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nWait, when combined, the guest and host letters are PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. The pile is BABONATALEFATHERCHRISTMASBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nWait, the note says that in the second sample, the pile is missing a 'P' and has an extra 'L'. So the combined guest+host has certain letters, and the pile doesn't have enough P's or has more L's.\n\nSo the code should correctly detect that.\n\nThird example: the pile has an extra 'L'.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where one of the lines is empty? But according to the problem statement, each line is not empty.\n\nAnother case: all letters are same. Like guest is 'A', host is 'A', pile is 'AA' → should return YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is 'AB', host is 'BA', pile is 'ABBA' → yes.\n\nWhat if the pile has same letters but different counts? E.g., guest+host is 'AAA' and pile is 'AA' → NO.\n\nAlso, what if the sum of the lengths of guest and host is not equal to the pile's length? Well, the Counters would automatically take care of that since the total number of characters would differ.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, implementing it in Python.\n\nImport Counter from collections.\n\nRead the three lines.\n\nCombine guest and host.\n\nCheck if Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile). If yes, print YES, else NO.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but what about case sensitivity? The problem states all letters are uppercase Latin letters, so no issue.\n\nAnother thing: the order of processing letters doesn't matter because Counter counts each occurrence.\n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nRead the three inputs, strip any leading/trailing whitespace (probably unnecessary, but better safe than sorry), combine guest and host, make Counters, compare.\n\nSo, code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in some cases, the input could have leading or trailing spaces. But the problem says that each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters, so probably, the .strip() is unnecessary. Because, for example, in the sample input, each line is a single word, but perhaps in other cases, it could have multiple words, but the problem says each line is the name, so it's a single string regardless.\n\nSo, perhaps, no need to strip. Or maybe it's better to include the strip() just in case.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each line does not exceed 100, but in any case, the .strip() is harmless.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is something like 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'—but wait, no, the sample input is written as a list, but in reality, the input is three lines, each being a string.\n\nWait, no, the sample input is given as:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nBut in actuality, when the program reads from stdin, each line is read as a single string. So, for example, if the input is:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThen, in the code, guest will be 'SANTACLAUS', host 'DEDMOROZ', pile 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nSo, the code correctly processes them.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nguest = 'SANTACLAUS'\n\nhost = 'DEDMOROZ'\n\ncombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'\n\nPile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nWe can check: do they have the same letters?\n\nYes. So the code returns YES.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nguest: 'PAPAINOEL'\n\nhost: 'JOULUPUKKI'\n\ncombined: 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI'\n\nPile: 'BABONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'\n\nWait, the pile is 'BABONATALEFATHERCHRISTMASBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER' when concatenated.\n\nSo, the combined guest and host have certain letters. The pile may have an extra 'L' or missing 'P'.\n\nSo, the code would correctly find that the Counters are different.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: guest is 'A', host is 'A', pile is 'AA' → YES.\n\nAnother test case: guest is 'AA', host is 'A', pile is 'AAA' → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is 'AB', host is 'CD', pile is 'ACBD' → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is 'AB', host is 'CD', pile is 'ABC' → NO, because CD is two letters, pile has three letters, but counts won't match.\n\nWait, no. Guest and host combined: 'ABCD' (4 letters). Pile is 'ABC' (3 letters). So counters will not match.\n\nSo the code will correctly output NO.\n\nI think this covers all possible cases.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
