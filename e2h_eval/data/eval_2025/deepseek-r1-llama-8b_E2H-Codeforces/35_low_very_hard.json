Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Valera and his array a. He has an array of n integers, and a function f(x) that depends on the binary representation of x. The goal is to find the maximum value of f(x) for all x in the range [0, m], where m is given as a binary string.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. The function f(x) is calculated by summing certain elements from the array a. Specifically, for each bit i in the binary representation of x, if the bit is set (i.e., equals 1), we add a_i to f(x). So f(x) is the sum of a_j where j is the positions of the set bits in x.\n\nWait, but how are the bits indexed? Oh right, the problem says that bit(i) is 1 if the i-th position in x's binary is 1. So for example, if x is 11, which is 1011 in binary, then the bits set are at positions 0, 1, and 3 (if we consider the least significant bit as position 0). So f(11) would be a0 + a1 + a3.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, when n=4 and x=11 (which is 1011), the function f(x) is a0 + a1 + a3. So yeah, that's right.\n\nSo the task is to find the maximum f(x) for x between 0 and m inclusive.\n\nNow, the input gives n, the array a, and then a binary string representing m. We need to compute the maximum f(x) for x up to m.\n\nHmm. The constraints are n up to 105, which is manageable. But what's the size of m? Since the binary string can be up to n digits long, but each digit is 0 or 1. Wait, no, the binary string's length is up to 2n-1? Or wait, no. Looking back: the third line is s0s1...sn-1, which is the binary representation of m. So m is a number with up to n bits. Because n can be up to 105, m can be as large as 2^105 - 1, which is way too big to handle with brute force.\n\nSo we can't just iterate through every possible x from 0 to m and compute f(x) each time. That's impossible because m can be like 2^100, which is way beyond anything we can process.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible f(x)? It's the sum of all a_i where i is a bit position less than n. Because for any x, f(x) is the sum of a_i for each bit i set in x. So the maximum possible f(x) would be the sum of all a_i where the corresponding bit can be set in some x <=m.\n\nWait, but perhaps some bits can't be set in any x <=m. For example, if m's binary has fewer bits than the maximum required for all a_i.\n\nSo the strategy is to find for each possible subset of the bits, whether there exists an x <=m where those bits are set. Then, for each such subset, compute the sum of a_i for those bits and keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut how do we efficiently determine which subsets of bits can be set?\n\nThis sounds like a bitmask problem, but with a very large n (up to 105). So standard bitmask techniques won't work because 2^105 is way too big.\n\nAlternative approach: think recursively or using dynamic programming, trying to build the best possible x bit by bit, ensuring that the current prefix is less than or equal to m's prefix.\n\nYes! This reminds me of the problem where you have to find the maximum XOR subset under a certain limit. So perhaps a digit DP approach can be used here.\n\nDigit DP is a technique used to count numbers with certain properties up to a given limit. Here, instead of counting, we want to maximize a function based on the bits set.\n\nSo let's model the problem as a digit DP problem.\n\nEach step in the DP will represent processing a bit of x, starting from the highest bit down to the lowest. For each position, we decide whether to set the bit or not, ensuring that the number we're building doesn't exceed m.\n\nBut since we're trying to maximize f(x), which is the sum of a_i for each set bit i, we want to include as many high-value a_i as possible.\n\nWait, but each a_i contributes its value to f(x) only if the i-th bit is set. So the goal is to select a subset of bits (i) such that their corresponding a_i is included in the sum, and the number x formed by these bits is <=m.\n\nBut x must",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function f(x) for all x in the range [0, m], where f(x) is defined as the sum of elements from an array a based on the binary representation of x. Given the constraints, a brute force approach is infeasible, so we use a digit dynamic programming (DP) approach to efficiently determine the maximum value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function f(x) sums elements from the array a based on the bits set in x's binary representation. We need to maximize this sum while ensuring x does not exceed m.\n2. **Digit DP Insight**: We can model this problem using digit DP, where each state represents the current position in the binary string of m and whether the number being built is already less than m up to that position.\n3. **State Representation**: The DP state will track the position in the binary string, whether the number is tight (i.e., exactly matches m up to the current position), and the maximum sum achievable so far.\n4. **Transition**: For each bit position, we decide whether to set the bit to 1 or 0. If setting it to 1 keeps the number within the limit, we include the corresponding element from the array a in the sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1].split()))\n    s = input[2]\n    \n    m_bin = s\n    m_int = int(m_bin, 2)\n    a_values = a\n    \n    # Convert the binary string into a list of integers, most significant bit first\n    m_bits = [int(c) for c in m_bin]\n    len_m = len(m_bits)\n    \n    # Precompute the a values with their indices\n    a_dict = {i: a_values[i] for i in range(n)}\n    \n    # Initialize DP variables\n    MOD = 10**18 + 1\n    dp = [[-1 for _ in range(2)] for __ in range(len_m + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0  # Starting with zero, no bits set\n    \n    for pos in range(len_m):\n        for tight in [0, 1]:\n            if dp[pos][tight] == -1:\n                continue\n            max_sum = dp[pos][tight]\n            current_bit = m_bits[pos]\n            \n            # Try setting the bit to 1\n            new_tight = 1 if (tight and (current_bit == 1)) else 0\n            new_sum = max_sum + a_dict.get(pos, 0)\n            if dp[pos+1][new_tight] < new_sum:\n                dp[pos+1][new_tight] = new_sum\n            \n            # Try setting the bit to 0\n            new_tight_0 = 0\n            new_sum_0 = max_sum\n            if dp[pos+1][new_tight_0] < new_sum_0:\n                dp[pos+1][new_tight_0] = new_sum_0\n    \n    # After processing all bits, the maximum sum is the maximum of dp[len_m][0] and dp[len_m][1]\n    result = max(dp[len_m][0], dp[len_m][1])\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution uses a digit DP approach to efficiently compute the maximum value of the function f(x). The DP state tracks the current position in the binary representation of m and whether the number being built is still within the limit. By considering each bit position and deciding whether to set it to 1 or 0, the algorithm ensures that the number remains within the allowed range while maximizing the sum of the corresponding elements from the array a.
