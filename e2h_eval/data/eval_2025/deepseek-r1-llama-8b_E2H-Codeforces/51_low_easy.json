Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if the pile of letters found in the morning can be used to exactly form both the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters left. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines: guest, host, and pile.\n2. Combine the guest and host names into a single string.\n3. Check if the pile has exactly the same letters as this combined string, with no extra letters and no missing letters.\n\nHmm, right. So the approach is to count the frequency of each character in the combined guest and host strings and then compare it to the frequency in the pile. If they match exactly, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSo first, I need to process each input line. Wait, but the input lines are given as three separate strings. Oh, wait, looking at the example input, it seems like each line is a string that represents the name. So for example, the first sample has three lines, which are the guest's name, host's name, and the pile.\n\nWait, but in the example, the guest's name is 'SANTACLAUS', the host's is 'DEDMOROZ', and the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'. When you combine them, their total letters should match the pile.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Concatenate guest + host, then sort all the characters.\n- Sort the pile's characters.\n- Compare the two sorted lists. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nAlternatively, since sorting might take O(n log n) time, but for small n (up to 200), it's acceptable.\n\nAnother way is to use a counter for each string. For the combined guest and host, create a frequency dictionary. Then do the same for the pile. Compare the two dictionaries.\n\nYes, that's probably more efficient, especially for larger inputs, though here it's not a problem.\n\nSo, in Python, I can use the collections.Counter class for this.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the three lines from input. The input lines could have newline characters, but I think when we read from stdin, using input().strip() will handle that. Or perhaps, read each line as is, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nWait, the problem says each line is not empty and consists of uppercase letters only. So perhaps, for each line, just take the entire string, including any newlines? Or does the newline matter? Because, for example, if a line ends with a newline, it's not part of the letters. So I think we should strip each line.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host.\n\nNow, check if the sorted letters of combined are equal to the sorted letters of pile.\n\nOr, using Counter:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nif Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each character regardless of order. So yes, this should work.\n\nTesting this against the examples:\n\nFirst example:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWait, let me see. The combined length is len(guest) + len(host). Pile must be the same length as the sum.\n\nIf the lengths don't match, we can immediately return NO.\n\nSo, another initial check: if len(combined) != len(pile), print NO.\n\nThis is an optimization.\n\nBut in the case where the lengths are different, it's impossible, so adding this check can save some computation.\n\nSo the steps now:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\nCheck if (len(guest) + len(host)) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if the combined letters match the pile.\n\nSo, code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ntotal_length = len(guest) + len(host)\npile_length = len(pile)\n\nif total_length != pile_length:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check if all letters match\n    if (guest + host) == pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but that's incorrect. Because 'guest + host' may have the same length as pile, but the letters may differ.\n\nFor example, if guest is 'AB', host is 'BC', pile is 'ACB' â€” lengths are same, but letters differ.\n\nSo, the earlier approach of using Counter is better.\n\nSo, correct code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be used to exactly form both the guest's name and the host's name without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Check Lengths:** First, check if the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, print \"NO\" immediately.\n3. **Count Character Frequencies:** Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in the combined string of guest and host names.\n4. **Compare Frequencies:** Compare the frequency counter of the combined string with the frequency counter of the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the total length of guest and host equals the length of pile\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check if the combined characters match the pile\n    if Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The guest's name, host's name, and pile are read as strings from standard input.\n- **Length Check:** Before proceeding, we check if the sum of the lengths of the guest's and host's names equals the length of the pile. This is an early exit condition to quickly determine if it's impossible to form the names from the pile.\n- **Frequency Counting:** Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the frequency of each character in both the combined string of guest and host names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The frequency counters are compared. If they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names, so we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the possibility of forming the names using the given pile, handling all edge cases and ensuring correctness.",
