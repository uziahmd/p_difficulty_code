The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each of towns 1 to n with a probability of 1/2 each, and these are independent events.\n\nAfter building the towers, we need to assign signal powers such that:\n- Towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal.\n- Each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\nThe goal is to compute the probability that this is possible, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So for each subset of built towers, we need to check if there's an assignment of powers that satisfies the conditions.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, we're to find the probability that after building the towers (randomly), there exists a valid power assignment. So the probability is over all possible subsets of built towers, multiplied by the indicator whether a valid assignment exists.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S (where S is a subset of {1,2,...,n}) such that there's a way to assign p_i (signal power) to each i in S, satisfying the coverage conditions.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems like the problem is combinatorial, perhaps similar to tiling or interval covering problems.\n\nLet me think: for a given subset S of towns with towers, what must be true for a valid assignment to exist?\n\nEach town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once. So the signals must form a partition of the towns into intervals, where each interval is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nMoreover, the signals must not cover town 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, so the coverage intervals must start at some point >=1 and end at <=n, without touching 0 or n+1.\n\nAlso, each interval must be centered at a tower in S.\n\nWait, not exactly centered, because the signal power p determines how far it covers. For a tower at i with power p, it covers [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)], but since towns are on a line, the exact coverage is from max(0, i-p+1) to min(n+1, i+p-1). But we require that 0 and n+1 are not covered. So for any tower in S, their coverage must not include 0 or n+1.\n\nSo for each tower i in S, the coverage interval is [i - (p_i - 1), i + (p_i - 1)]. But since we don't want 0 or n+1 to be covered by any tower, each tower's coverage must not reach beyond those points.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, a tower at position 1 with p=2 would cover towns 0 and 1 and 2. But that's not allowed because town 0 is supposed to be uncovered. So that tower can't have p=2.\n\nWait, wait, the coverage is |c - i| < p, which is equivalent to c being in (i - p, i + p). Since c is an integer, that means c can be from i - p +1 to i + p -1.\n\nSo for a tower at i, its coverage is the interval [i - p +1, i + p -1].\n\nSo for town 0, which is position 0, to not be covered by any tower, all towers i must have either p=1 (so coverage is just i itself) or their p is such that i - p +1 > 0. Wait, no. Wait, for any tower, if i is 0, but in our case, towers are only built in 1..n. So for any i in 1..n, the coverage starts at i - (p-1) + 1 = i - p + 2, but that's maybe not the right way.\n\nWait, let's rephrase: for a tower at i, the coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)] inclusive? Or is it [i - (p-1) +1, i + (p-1) -1]?\n\nWait, the problem says that a tower at i with power p reaches every city c where |c - i| < p. So c can be i - (p-1) up to i + (p-1) -1. Because, for example, when p=1, |c-i| <1 implies c=i only. So yes, the coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)-1], but in integer terms, since c must be an integer.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: |c -i| < p is equivalent to c being in (i - p, i + p). Since c is an integer, that means c can be from floor(i - p) +1 to ceil(i + p) -1. But since i is an integer, it's from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1) -1. Because:\n\nFor example, p=2, i=3: c can be 2, 3,4. So 3-1=2, 3+1=4. So coverage is 2,3,4.\n\nWait, 3-2=1 < 2, 3+2=5>2? No, wait, |c -3| <2 → c can be 2,3,4. So the coverage is 2,3,4.\n\nWhich is 3 - (2-1) = 2, and 3 + (2-1) -1=4.\n\nSo yes, coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1) -1].\n\nSo for the coverage not to include 0, for each tower i, i - (p_i-1) >=1.\n\nSimilarly, for the coverage not to include n+1, i + (p_i -1) <=n.\n\nSo for each tower in S, its coverage must satisfy:\n\ni - (p_i -1) >= 1\n\ni + (p_i -1) <=n\n\nBut also, the coverage intervals must not overlap, except at the edges, and together they must cover exactly 1..n.\n\nWait, no. The coverage intervals must partition 1..n, with each point covered exactly once.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a set of non-overlapping intervals, each centered at a tower in S, that together cover all points from 1 to n.\n\nAdditionally, each interval must not touch 0 or n+1.\n\nSo the problem is similar to tiling the line with certain intervals, each centered at some point in S, and the intervals are non-overlapping.\n\nThis feels familiar. Maybe it's related to domino tiling or something similar.\n\nAnother approach: think of the intervals as being determined by the tower positions and their chosen p. The key is that the intervals must form a partition of 1..n, each being an odd length, centered at a tower.\n\nWait, not necessarily odd, but the intervals must be such that their lengths are 2k+1 for some k. Because the coverage is symmetric around the tower, and the length is 2*(p-1)+1 = 2p-1.\n\nWait, wait, no: the coverage is (p-1)*2 +1. So each interval has an odd length. For example, p=1: length 1. p=2: length 3, etc.\n\nSo, the problem is to select a set S of towers, and assign p_i to each, such that the union of the intervals is exactly 1..n, and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover 1..n without including 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, each interval is [a, b], where a = i - (p_i -1), b = i + (p_i -1), and a >=1, b <=n.\n\nAnd the intervals must form a partition of 1..n.\n\nNow, the question is: for a given S, can we choose p_i's such that this is possible?\n\nWe need to count the number of subsets S where this is possible, then multiply by (1/2)^n, since each tower is built independently with probability 1/2.\n\nSo the total probability is (number of valid S) / 2^n.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, enumerating all subsets is impossible. So we need a dynamic programming approach or some combinatorial formula.\n\nHmm, perhaps the structure of valid S is that the towers form a certain kind of binary structure.\n\nWait, let's think recursively.\n\nSuppose for a segment of length l, the middle is at position m, and the next segment to the right is of length r. Then, for the segment, we can have a tower at m with p such that it covers both m-r and m+r, but wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as tiling the line with tiles of certain lengths, each tile centered at a tower.\n\nEach tile has an odd length, and each tile's center is a tower in S.\n\nSo the entire 1..n must be covered by such tiles, non-overlapping.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to tiling 1..n with odd-length intervals, each centered at a tower in S.\n\nWait, but S is the set of centers. So the tiling is determined by the positions of the centers and their assigned p's.\n\nBut each tile must have an odd length, so each tile's length is 2k+1 for some k.\n\nBut the length is determined by the p_i: length is 2(p_i -1)+1 = 2p_i-1.\n\nSo for each tile, the length is an odd number, and the tile is centered at the tower.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a set of centers and assigning each a tile of some odd length, such that all tiles together cover exactly 1..n, and the tiles are non-overlapping, and none extend beyond 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but the tile placement must ensure that the first tile starts at least at 1, and the last ends at most at n.\n\nSo for a tile starting at s and ending at e, s >=1, e <=n.\n\nAnd all tiles must cover 1..n without overlapping.\n\nSo the tiling must consist of contiguous non-overlapping intervals, each of odd length, covering the entire 1..n.\n\nNow, the question is: for each possible tiling configuration, what is the number of subsets S that allow such a tiling.\n\nBut this seems complex. Another angle: perhaps the problem is similar to counting the number of ways to arrange certain blocks, and each block corresponds to a tower and its coverage.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a recurrence relation. Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to cover the first i towns, following the rules.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the minimal possible configuration. For example, each tile can be as small as length 1 (p=1), covering a single town.\n\nIf we have a town i that is covered by a tile of length 1 (p=1), then no other tower can cover it.\n\nWait, but if a tile is of length 1, then the tower must be at position i, with p=1.\n\nSo for the entire 1..n to be covered, each position must be the center of exactly one tile.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is equivalent to having a subset S where the positions in S can be used to form a partition of 1..n into intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a position in S.\n\nSo, for a subset S to be valid, S must consist of exactly the centers of such a partition.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to count all subsets S where S is the set of centers of such a partition.\n\nSo, for each possible way to partition 1..n into intervals of odd lengths, the centers of those intervals form a subset S. We need to count all such possible S's.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for each such partition, the subset S is uniquely determined. So the total number of valid S's is equal to the number of such partitions.\n\nWait, no. Because different partitions can have different S's. So the total number of valid S's is the number of possible centers for all possible valid tilings.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let's think about the structure of the problem.\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as a graph, where each node represents a town, and edges represent possible transitions via a tile. Then the problem becomes finding all possible paths that cover all nodes, with each step being a tile of odd length.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to count the number of valid tilings, which is known for a line. The number of ways to tile a line of length L with squares (each square is a 1x1 tile, but here the tiles are of varying odd lengths).\n\nWait, for a line of length L, the number of ways to tile it with squares of various sizes is a known recurrence. But in our case, each tile is of odd length, but their arrangement can vary.\n\nWait, but our tiles can be of any odd length, as long as they cover the entire line without overlapping.\n\nWait, but for our problem, the tiles must be placed consecutively, without gaps. So the problem is similar to tiling a 1xn board with dominoes and squares, but in our case, all tiles are of odd length.\n\nWait, no. Because dominoes are even length, but our tiles are odd.\n\nWait, but for our problem, each tile must have an odd length, and cover some part of the line. So the problem is to partition the line into such tiles.\n\nBut in that case, the number of tilings is a known quantity.\n\nWait, for example, for n=1, there's only one way: a tile of length 1.\n\nFor n=2: impossible, since 2 is even, and all tiles are odd lengths. So you can't cover 2 with tiles of odd lengths. So no valid tiling.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the sum of the tile lengths must equal n. But since each tile is odd, the sum is the sum of several odd numbers. Sum of k odd numbers is k mod 2. So n must be congruent to k mod 2, where k is the number of tiles. But n is fixed. So for a given n, the number of tiles must have the same parity as n.\n\nWait, for example, n=3: possible with 1 tile (length 3), or 3 tiles (each length 1). So total tilings is 2.\n\nBut in our problem, the tiles can be of any size, as long as they are odd, and placed consecutively.\n\nSo the number of ways to tile a 1xn grid with tiles of odd lengths is equal to the (n)th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, perhaps. Let me see:\n\nFor n=1: 1 way.\n\nn=2: 0 ways.\n\nn=3: 2 ways (either one tile of 3, or three tiles of 1 each).\n\nn=4: 3 ways (tile 1+3, 3+1, or four 1's? Wait, no, 4 is even and each tile is odd, so the number of tiles must be even. Wait, no, the sum of tile lengths is 4, which is even. Since each tile is odd, the sum is the sum of k odd numbers. Sum is even iff k is even. So for n=4, the number of tilings is the number of ways to write 4 as the sum of an even number of odd integers.\n\nPossible partitions:\n\n1+1+1+1: four 1's.\n\n3+1: two tiles.\n\n1+3: same as above.\n\nSo for n=4, the number is 3.\n\nWait, but what is the recurrence here?\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\nn | number of tilings\n\n1 → 1\n\n2 → 0\n\n3 → 2\n\n4 → 3\n\n5 → ?\n\nLet me try n=5:\n\nPossible partitions:\n\nAll 1's: 5 tiles.\n\nOne tile of 5.\n\nOr, 3+1+1.\n\n1+3+1.\n\n1+1+3.\n\nOr, 3+ (two 1's): but wait, that's 3+1+1, which is already considered.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to find a recurrence.\n\nLet f(n) be the number of ways to tile a 1..n grid with tiles of odd lengths.\n\nFor n=0: 1 way (empty tiling).\n\nn=1: 1.\n\nn=2: 0.\n\nn=3: 2.\n\nn=4: 3.\n\nn=5: ?\n\nWhat's the pattern? 1,0,2,3,...\n\nLooking for a recurrence.\n\nAt each step, the first tile can be of length 1, 3, 5, etc., up to n if n is odd.\n\nSo for f(n), the first tile could be of length 1, leaving a grid of n-1, whose number of tilings is f(n-1). Or the first tile could be of length 3, leaving n-3, contributing f(n-3). Similarly for 5, etc.\n\nSo the recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... until subtracting an odd number doesn't make n negative.\n\nWait, but what about n=4:\n\nf(4) = f(3) + f(1) → 2 +1=3 → correct.\n\nYes.\n\nn=5: f(4)+f(2) → 3 +0=3. But earlier thinking for n=5, I thought it was more than 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let's calculate f(5):\n\nPossible tilings:\n\n1. One tile of 5.\n\n2. One tile of 3 followed by two tiles of 1 → 3,1,1.\n\n3. One tile of 1 followed by a tile of 3 followed by two tiles of 1 → 1,3,1.\n\n4. Three tiles of 1 followed by a tile of 3 → 1,1,3.\n\nWait, wait, but the order matters. So for the case of 3,1,1: is that considered a separate tiling? Or does the order matter?\n\nIn tiling counts, the order of tiles matters. So for example, 3 followed by 1 followed by 1 is different from 1 followed by 3 followed by 1.\n\nSo for n=5:\n\nThe tilings are:\n\n- 5\n\n- 3,1,1\n\n- 1,3,1\n\n- 1,1,3\n\n- 1,1,1,1,1\n\nWait, that's 5 tilings. So according to the recurrence, f(5) should be f(4) + f(2) =3+0=3, which is less than actual.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the recurrence isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption about the recurrence is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: look for OEIS sequences.\n\nWait, the sequence for n=1:1, n=2:0, n=3:2, n=4:3, n=5:5.\n\nWait, that looks like the Fibonacci sequence shifted.\n\nFibonacci numbers: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,...\n\nSo our sequence is:\n\nn=1:1, n=2:0, n=3:2, n=4:3, n=5:5, n=6:?\n\nWait, for n=6:\n\nPossible tilings:\n\n1. All 1's: 6.\n\n2. 5+1.\n\n3. 3+1+1+1.\n\n4. 3 followed by 3.\n\n5. 3 followed by 1 followed by 1 followed by 1.\n\n6. 1 followed by 3 followed by 1 followed by 1.\n\n7. 1 followed by 1 followed by 3 followed by 1.\n\n8. 1 followed by 1 followed by 1 followed by 3.\n\n9. 3+1+1+1, 1+3+1+1, 1+1+3+1, 1+1+1+3.\n\n10. 1+1+1+1+1+1.\n\n11. 5+1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the number of tilings for n is equal to the (n)th Fibonacci number. Because for n=1, f=1; n=2, 0; n=3, 2; n=4, 3; n=5,5; which matches Fib(5)=5.\n\nWait, Fibonacci numbers are typically defined as F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8.\n\nSo our sequence is matching F(n) for n≥1, except for n=2, which is 0 instead of 1.\n\nWait, so perhaps the number of ways to tile a line of length n with tiles of odd lengths is equal to F(n), except when n is even, it's zero?\n\nNo, because for n=4, it's 3, which is F(4)=3.\n\nWait, but n=2 is even, but F(2)=1, but in our case, f(2)=0.\n\nSo perhaps the recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), but only when n is ≥3, and for even n, f(n)=0.\n\nWait, for n=3: f(3)=f(2)+f(1) =0+1=1, but earlier calculation said f(3)=2.\n\nHmm, conflicting results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), but with f(1)=1, f(2)=1, but for even n, f(n)=0.\n\nWait, for n=3: f(3)=f(2)+f(1) =1+1=2, which matches.\n\nn=4: f(4)=f(3)+f(2)=2+1=3, which matches.\n\nn=5: f(5)=f(4)+f(3)=3+2=5, which matches.\n\nn=6: f(6)=f(5)+f(4)=5+3=8.\n\nSo for even n, f(n) is equal to the Fibonacci number minus 1, perhaps?\n\nWait, but for n=2: f(2)=0, which is 1-1=0.\n\nWait, yes! So for n≥1, f(n) is equal to the (n)th Fibonacci number if n is odd, and zero if n is even.\n\nBecause for n=1: Fib(1)=1, f(1)=1.\n\nn=2: Fib(2)=1, but f(2)=0.\n\nn=3: Fib(3)=2, f(3)=2.\n\nn=4: Fib(4)=3, f(4)=3.\n\nn=5: Fib(5)=5, f(5)=5.\n\nn=6: Fib(6)=8, f(6)=8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the number of ways to tile a line of length n with tiles of odd lengths is f(n) = Fib(n) if n is odd, and 0 if n is even.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause for even n, the sum of odd numbers (tiles) must be even. Since each tile contributes an odd length, the sum of k tiles will be even iff k is even. So for even n, you can have tilings with an even number of tiles. But in our case, for n=2, it's impossible to have any tiling, hence f(2)=0.\n\nSo for even n, f(n)=0; for odd n, f(n) is Fib(n).\n\nSo, the number of valid tilings for a line of length n is f(n) as above.\n\nNow, for each such tiling, the subset S is the set of centers of the tiles.\n\nEach tile is of odd length, so the center is at (start + end)/2, which is an integer.\n\nThus, for each tiling, the centers are determined uniquely.\n\nBut wait, for example, in n=3, a tiling could be a single tile of length 3, centered at 2. Or three tiles of length 1, each centered at 1,2,3.\n\nSo in this case, S is either {2} or {1,2,3}.\n\nSo the number of valid subsets S is equal to the number of such tilings, because each tiling gives exactly one subset S.\n\nSo the total number of valid S is f(n), where f(n) is the number of tilings as above.\n\nWait, but in the case of n=3, f(3)=2, and indeed the subsets S are {2} and {1,2,3}.\n\nSo for each tiling, there's exactly one subset S.\n\nThus, the number of valid S is equal to f(n), which is Fib(n) if n is odd, else zero.\n\nWait, but wait: n=5, f(5)=5, so there are 5 valid subsets S.\n\nEach of these subsets corresponds to a unique tiling.\n\nSo the number of valid S is equal to f(n), which is Fib(n) for odd n, 0 for even n.\n\nBut wait, the sample input for n=2 has output 1/4.\n\nWait, for n=2, f(2)=0. So the probability is 0 / 4 = 0. But in the sample, the output is 1/4.\n\nHmm, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input in the problem statement is for n=2, and the real answer is 1/4.\n\nWait, but according to our reasoning, for n=2, there are zero valid tilings, so the probability is zero. But the sample says it's 1/4.\n\nSo there's a mistake in our reasoning.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the relation between the tilings and the subsets S.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of valid subsets S is not f(n), but something else.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nThe problem is to find subsets S such that the centers of the tiles in S can form a partition of 1..n into intervals of odd lengths.\n\nEach such tiling corresponds to exactly one subset S.\n\nBut for n=2, what is the number of valid S?\n\nIn the sample, when n=2, the valid subsets are {1,2}, which can be tiled as two tiles of length 1 each. So S={1,2}, which is a valid subset.\n\nWait, according to the sample explanation, when n=2, the only valid subset is S={1,2}, which allows p_1=1 and p_2=1.\n\nSo for n=2, f(2)=0, but the number of valid subsets S is 1.\n\nSo our previous reasoning was wrong.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the number of valid S is not directly f(n), but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of valid subsets S is equal to the number of compositions of n into parts of odd integers, where each part is represented by a tower in S.\n\nBut each composition may correspond to multiple subsets S.\n\nWait, perhaps for each tiling (composition), the subset S is determined as the centers of the tiles.\n\nIn the case of n=2, the only possible tiling is two tiles of length 1, so S is {1,2}.\n\nThus, the number of valid S is 1 for n=2.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3:\n\nPossible tilings are:\n\n1. One tile of 3 → S={2}\n\n2. Three tiles of 1 → S={1,2,3}\n\nSo f(3)=2, which is correct.\n\nBut for n=2, the number is 1.\n\nSo the previous reasoning about f(n) being Fib(n) for odd n and 0 for even n is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps f(n) is the number of compositions into odd parts, regardless of the order.\n\nWait, the number of compositions of n into odd parts is indeed equal to the Fibonacci number F(n), but that's for the number of compositions, which counts ordered compositions.\n\nBut in our case, each composition corresponds to exactly one subset S.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of valid subsets S is equal to the number of compositions of n into odd parts, considering that each part is a tile.\n\nBut for n=2, the number of compositions into odd parts is 1 (only 1+1). So that aligns with the sample.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3, the compositions are 3, 1+1+1, 1+2 (but 2 is even, so no). Wait, no, only compositions into odd parts are 3, 1+1+1, 1+2 is invalid.\n\nWait, wait, n=3 can be written as 3, 1+1+1, 1+2 (invalid). So the number of compositions into odd parts is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo, the number of valid S is equal to the number of compositions of n into odd parts.\n\nWait, but for n=4, the number of compositions into odd parts is 3: 1+1+1+1, 3+1, 1+3.\n\nWhich matches f(4)=3.\n\nSo, for any n, the number of valid S is equal to the number of compositions of n into odd parts.\n\nWhich is known to be equal to Fib(n).\n\nWait, but wait: for n=2, Fib(2)=1, which is correct.\n\nFor n=3, Fib(3)=2, correct.\n\nn=4, Fib(4)=3, correct.\n\nn=5, Fib(5)=5.\n\nSo, the number of valid S is Fib(n) for all n.\n\nWait, but wait, for n=2, the sample shows that the valid subsets are S={1,2}, which is 1, which is Fib(2)=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the number of valid subsets S is equal to Fib(n).\n\nWait, but for n=5, Fib(5)=5, which would imply 5 valid S's. Let's see:\n\nThe compositions are:\n\n5 → S={3}.\n\n1+1+1+1+1 → S={1,2,3,4,5}.\n\n3+1+1 → S={2,3,4}.\n\n1+3+1 → S={1,3,4}.\n\n1+1+3 → S={1,2,4}.\n\nWait, that's five compositions, each corresponding to a unique S.\n\nSo yes, the number of valid S's is Fib(n).\n\nThus, the number of valid subsets S is Fib(n).\n\nSo the probability is Fib(n) / 2^n.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, Fib(2)=1, 2^2=4 → 1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nFor n=3, Fib(3)=2, 2^3=8 → 2/8=1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nFor n=5, Fib(5)=5, 2^5=32 → 5/32, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to computing Fib(n) modulo MOD, where MOD=998244353, and then compute Fib(n) * inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nWait, but how to compute Fib(n) efficiently for n up to 2e5?\n\nYes, using matrix exponentiation or fast doubling method.\n\nSo, steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Compute Fib(n) modulo MOD.\n\n2. Compute inv(2^n) modulo MOD.\n\n3. Multiply them, mod MOD.\n\nBut how to compute inv(2^n) mod MOD?\n\nSince MOD is a prime, inv(2) is 499122177. Then, 2^n mod MOD can be computed, and its modular inverse is pow(2, MOD-1 -n, MOD), because Fermat's little theorem states that a^(MOD-1) ≡ 1 mod MOD. So inv(a^b) = a^(MOD-1 -b) mod MOD.\n\nBut since MOD is 998244353, which is prime, and 2 is coprime with MOD, this holds.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nCompute Fib(n) as Fib(n) mod MOD.\n\nCompute inv_two_pow_n = pow(2, MOD-1 -n, MOD).\n\nResult is (Fib(n) * inv_two_pow_n) mod MOD.\n\nWait, but for n=0, but n is at least 1.\n\nSo, now, the problem is to compute Fib(n) quickly.\n\nImplementing the fast doubling method is efficient for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Compute Fib(n) mod MOD.\n\n- Compute inv_two_pow = pow(2, n, MOD). Then compute inv_two_pow = pow(inv_two_pow, MOD-2, MOD).\n\n- Multiply Fib(n) by inv_two_pow mod MOD.\n\nBut wait, no. Because 2^n mod MOD is inv_two_pow, but the inverse is pow(2, MOD-2) raised to the power n mod MOD.\n\nAlternatively, since inv_two_pow is 2^{-1} mod MOD, which is 499122177, then 2^{-n} mod MOD is (499122177)^n mod MOD.\n\nBut calculating that directly for n=2e5 is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute inv_two_pow_n = pow(2, n, MOD), then compute inv_two_pow_n_inv = pow(inv_two_pow_n, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nAlternatively, compute it as pow(2, MOD-2, MOD) raised to the n-th power mod MOD.\n\nWhich is more efficient depends on the implementation.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, either approach is acceptable.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute Fib(n) mod MOD.\n\nCompute inv_two_pow = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nCompute inv_two_pow^n mod MOD: which is pow(inv_two_pow, n, MOD).\n\nMultiply Fib(n) by this value mod MOD.\n\nOutput the result.\n\nThus, the main task is to compute Fib(n) mod MOD.\n\nImplementing the fast doubling method:\n\nFast doubling uses the following identities:\n\nFib(2n-1) = Fib(n)^2 + Fib(n-1)^2\n\nFib(2n) = Fib(n) * (2*Fib(n-1) + Fib(n))\n\nBut perhaps the recursive approach is manageable for n up to 2e5.\n\nAlternatively, iterative approach with O(n) time.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, even the recursive approach is manageable.\n\nWait, but for n=2e5, recursion depth would be log2(2e5) ~ 18, which is manageable.\n\nSo, implement the fast doubling method.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: n=2.\n\nFib(2)=1.\n\ninv_two_pow = 499122177.\n\n1 * (499122177^2 mod MOD) ?\n\nWait, no: 2^2 is 4, inv is 748683265 (since 4*748683265 mod MOD is 1).\n\nSo 1 * 748683265 mod MOD is 748683265, which is 3/4 mod MOD.\n\nWait, but sample output for n=2 is 748683265, which is 1/4 mod MOD.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, 2^2 is 4. Its inverse is 748683265.\n\nSo 1/4 mod MOD is 748683265.\n\nWhich is the sample output for n=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would correctly output 748683265 for n=2.\n\nAnother sample: n=3.\n\nFib(3)=2.\n\ninv_two_pow = 748683265 (since 2^3=8, inv is 124780544 mod MOD).\n\nWait, wait, 2^3 is 8, inv is 8^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nCompute 8^(-1) mod 998244353.\n\nBut 8*124780544 = 998244352 → which is -1 mod MOD. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the inverse of 8 is 124780544.\n\nBecause 8 * 124780544 = 998244352 = -1 mod MOD.\n\nSo, 8 * (-124780544) = 1 mod MOD.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, 8 * x ≡1 mod MOD.\n\nWe can compute x as 8^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nBut for the purposes of coding, it's handled automatically.\n\nIn any case, for n=3, the result is Fib(3)=2 * (inv(8)) → 2 * inv(8) = 2 * 124780544 mod MOD.\n\nWhich is 249561088 mod MOD.\n\nBut 249561088 divided by MOD is 249561088 < MOD, so the result is 249561088.\n\nBut the sample output for n=3 is 748683265, which is 1/4 mod MOD.\n\nWait, no, wait the sample output for n=3 is 748683265, which is 1/4.\n\nWait, this suggests that the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier analysis, for n=3, Fib(3)=2, 2^3=8.\n\nSo 2/8=1/4, which is 748683265 mod MOD.\n\nAh, right. So for n=3, the result is Fib(3) * inv(8) mod MOD.\n\nSo ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 to n, we can set their signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.

Each interval must be centered at a tower and have an odd length.\n2. **Combinatorial Insight**: The number of valid configurations is equivalent to the number of compositions of n into odd parts, which is known to follow the Fibonacci sequence.\n3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the ratio of the number of valid configurations to the total number of possible subsets of towers, which is \\( \\frac{Fib(n)}{2^n} \\). Using modular arithmetic, we compute this as \\( Fib(n) \\times inverse(2^n) \\mod 998244353 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef fib(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return (0, 1)\n    a, b = fib(n >> 1)\n    c = a * ((2*b - a)) % MOD\n    d = (a*a + b*b) % MOD\n    if n & 1:\n        return (d, (c + d) % MOD)\n    else:\n        return (c, d)\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    fib_n, _ = fib(n)\n    inv_two_pow = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_two_pow = pow(inv_two_pow, MOD-2, MOD)\n    result = (fib_n * inv_two_pow) % MOD\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: The function `fib` computes the nth Fibonacci number using the fast doubling method, which efficiently handles large values of n up to 200,000.\n2. **Modular Inverse**: The modular inverse of \\( 2^n \\) is computed using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for a prime modulus \\( p \\), the inverse of \\( a \\) is \\( a^{p-2} \\mod p \\).\n3. **Result Calculation**: The result is computed as \\( Fib(n) \\times inverse(2^n) \\mod 998244353 \\), giving the required probability.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct for large values of n, leveraging combinatorial properties and modular arithmetic.",
