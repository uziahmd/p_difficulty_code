    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem called Golden Plate. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a plate. The plate is a rectangle split into w x h cells. We need to add k rings of gilding. Each ring is along the edge of a certain size, and each subsequent ring is two cells inward from the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is the outermost border, which is straightforward. For a rectangle of width w and height h, the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). Because for a grid, the number of cells around the edge is calculated that way.\n\nWait, right. For example, if it's 3x3, then the perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8, which matches the first example where the output is 8.\n\nThe second ring would be two cells in from the edge. So the new rectangle is (w-4) by (h-4), because each side reduces by 2 on both ends. Wait, no. Wait, each ring is one cell thick, but each next ring is two cells away from the previous edge. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Because each ring takes up one cell on each side, so each step inwards reduces both dimensions by 4? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the i-th ring is formed by the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for the first ring (i=1), it's w×h. Then for i=2, it's w-4 × h-4. So each ring is built by taking the next inner rectangle after removing two cells from each side.\n\nBut wait, the first ring is the outermost, which is correct. The second ring is the next layer, which is two cells inside, so yes, subtracting 4 from each dimension.\n\nSo, for each ring i, the perimeter is calculated based on the current rectangle's w and h, which are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\nSo the number of cells in the i-th ring is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). But we have to make sure that when the current_w or current_h becomes less than or equal to 1, we don't calculate any more rings beyond that.\n\nWait, but according to the input constraints, k is given such that it doesn't exceed the maximum possible rings. So for each i from 1 to k, we can compute the perimeter and sum them all.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Initialize a total count to 0.\n2. For each i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n   c. If current_w <= 1 or current_h <=1, break (since further rings are impossible)\n   d. Compute the perimeter: 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n   e. Add this to the total.\n3. Output the total.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the examples.\n\nIn the first sample input, '3 3 1':\nFor i=1, current_w=3, current_h=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2)=8. So total is 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond sample input is '7 9 1'. So for i=1, current_w=7, current_h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. So output is 28. Correct.\n\nThird sample input is '7 9 2'. So i=1: 7*9 gives perimeter 28. i=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the third output.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\ni=1: 5x5 → perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16.\n\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So current_w=1, current_h=1. So the perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0. So total is 16+0=16.\n\nWait, but wait. When the current_w or current_h is 1, the perimeter is 0 because the rectangle is just a single cell. So in that case, adding nothing.\n\nAnother test case: w=4, h=4, k=2.\n\ni=1: 4x4 → 2*(4+4-2) = 12.\n\ni=2: 4-4=0, which is invalid. But wait, the initial condition is 3<=w, h <=100. So for i=2, current_w=0, which is less than 3? No, because 4-4*(2-1)=0. So perhaps we shouldn't process i=2, but in this case, the maximum possible k is floor( (min(4,4)+1)/4 )= floor(5/4) =1. So k cannot be 2 in this case. So the code will not process i=2 as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input constraints state that k is at most floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So for w=4, h=4, min is 4. (4+1)/4=1.25, floor is 1. So k can't be 2.\n\nSo our code can proceed under the assumption that for each i up to k, current_w and current_h are at least 3, but wait, no. Because for example, if i=1, current_w could be 3, and i=2, current_w is 3-4= -1, which is invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because for i=1, current_w is w. For i=2, current_w is w-4, but only if i<=k. So in cases where w or h is too small for a particular i, but k is allowed by the problem statement, how do we handle it?\n\nWait, the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ), so for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h must be at least 3, right?\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose min(w,h) is m. Then for the maximum k_max = floor( (m+1)/4 ). Let's see.\n\nIf m=3, then (3+1)/4=1. So k_max is 1. So for i=1, current_w is 3, current_h is 3.\n\nFor i=2, current_w would be 3-4= -1, but since k can't be 2, it's not considered.\n\nAnother example: m=7, so (7+1)/4=2, so k_max is 2. So for i=1: 7, i=2:3.\n\nSo, in the code, for each i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h are computed, but we have to ensure that they are >= 3, else the perimeter would be zero.\n\nWait, no. Because for a rectangle with w=3 and h=5, the perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)=12. So it's fine.\n\nWait, but if current_w is 1, then the perimeter is 2*(1 + current_h -2) = 2*(current_h -1). But if current_h is 1, then it's 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the k is limited so that each i-th ring is valid. So in the code, we can proceed without checking whether current_w and current_h are >=3, because the constraints on k ensure that.\n\nSo in the code, for each i from 1 to k, compute current_w = w -4*(i-1), current_h = h -4*(i-1). Then compute perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). Sum all these perimeters.\n\nWait, but wait. What about when current_w or current_h becomes less than or equal to 1? For example, let's say w=5, h=5, and k=2.\n\nFor i=1: 5x5 → perimeter 16.\n\ni=2: 1x1 → perimeter is 0.\n\nSo total is 16.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, for k=2, is it allowed?\n\nCompute min(w,h)=5. (5+1)/4=1.5, floor is 1. So k cannot be 2.\n\nSo the problem statement ensures that for all i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3, right? Because the maximum k is determined such that after k steps, the minimum of w and h minus 4*(k-1) is still >=3.\n\nWait, no. Let's take w=7, h=9. So min is 7. (7+1)/4=2. So k can be up to 2. For i=1, w=7, h=9. For i=2, 7-4=3, 9-4=5. Both >=3.\n\nYes. So for each i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3. So their perimeters are correctly calculated.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor i in 1..k:\n\n   cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(cw + ch -2)\n\n   add perimeter to total.\n\nOutput total.\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nNow, let's see the examples.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 28.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 12 =40.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=1 → perimeter is 2*(5+5-2)=16.\n\nw=5, h=5, k=2 → but according to the problem statement, k can't be 2 because (5+1)/4 is 1.5, so floor is 1. So the code won't process i=2.\n\nBut if somehow k=2 is allowed, then i=2 would give cw=1, ch=1. Perimeter is 2*(1+1-2)=0. So total is 16.\n\nBut according to the problem's input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo now, the code can be written.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as a single line, split into three integers.\n\nThen loop k times, for each i from 1 to k.\n\nCalculate current_w and current_h as w -4*(i-1), h -4*(i-1).\n\nCompute perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h -2).\n\nSum all perimeters.\n\nFinally, print the sum as a string.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    cw = w -4*(i-1)\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch -2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait. What if during the loop, cw or ch becomes less than 3?\n\nNo, because as per the problem statement, k is within the allowed limit, so for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7,9 → 2*(7+9-2) = 28.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5 → 2*(3+5-2)= 2*6=12.\n\nTotal 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=3, h=3, k=1 → 8.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=7, k=2.\n\ni=1:5+7-2=10 → 20.\n\ni=2:5-4=1,7-4=3 → 2*(1+3-2)= 2*2=4. So total 24.\n\nIs that correct? Let's see.\n\nRing 1: perimeter of 5x7 is 2*(5+7-2) = 20.\n\nRing 2: 1x3. The perimeter is 2*(1+3-2) = 4. So yes.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code-wise, what about when k is 0? But according to the problem statement, k is at least 1.\n\nWait, no, the problem says 1 ≤k ≤ ... So k can't be zero.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of an increasingly smaller rectangle inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a perimeter around a rectangle. The first ring is the outermost edge, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each subsequent ring is formed by reducing both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is calculated as the perimeter of the current rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by `2 * (w + h - 2)`.\n3. **Iterative Summation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` which represent the width, height, and number of rings respectively.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the current width and height of the rectangle after accounting for the reduction due to the previous rings.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each iteration, compute the perimeter of the current rectangle and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing the perimeters, ensuring that each step is performed in constant time, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
