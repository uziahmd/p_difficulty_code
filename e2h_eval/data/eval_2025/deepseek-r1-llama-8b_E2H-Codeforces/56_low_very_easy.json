Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So it's a perfect matching between R ships and B bases.\n\nBut there's a catch: the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. The paths are straight lines in 2D space, and we need to make sure none of them cross each other.\n\nHmm, how to model this? I think this is similar to checking if a bipartite graph is matchable and whether the edges (representing non-intersecting paths) form a matching.\n\nWait, but how do we determine if two paths intersect? Because for any two pairs of points (ship A to base X and ship B to base Y), their line segments should not cross.\n\nSo, for a given matching, we need to ensure that all the corresponding line segments don't intersect with each other.\n\nThe approach I can think of is:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between R ships and B bases.\n2. For each matching, check if any two line segments between ships and bases intersect.\n3. If any matching exists where none of the segments intersect, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, \"No\".\n\nBut wait, generating all possible matchings might be computationally intensive, especially since R and B can be up to 10. Oh, but 10! is about 3.6 million, which is manageable because for each matching, we'll have to check B choose 2 pairs of lines, which is manageable.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a matching of size R, each ship is assigned to a base. So for each pair of ships (i,j) and (k,l), their line segments must not cross.\n\nBut for a perfect matching, the number of pairs to check is C(R,2) per matching. Since R is up to 10, C(10,2) is 45, which isn't too bad.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Read R and B.\n- Read R ships' coordinates and store them in a list.\n- Read B bases' coordinates and store them in another list.\n- Check if R != B. If they are not equal, then it's impossible to have a perfect matching. So output \"No\".\n- Else, generate all possible perfect matchings (permutations of B bases for R ships).\n- For each permutation:\n   - Check if the permutation is a valid assignment, i.e., each ship is assigned to a unique base.\n   - For each pair of ships in the permutation, compute the line segments between their assignments.\n   - Check if any two line segments intersect.\n   - If no intersections for all pairs, return \"Yes\".\n- If none of the permutations satisfy, output \"No\".\n\nWait, but generating all possible permutations could be expensive. Wait, no, because for R=10, it's 10! = 3.6 million permutations. Each permutation requires checking C(10,2)=45 pairs. And each pair requires checking if two line segments intersect. Each line segment check is O(1), I think.\n\nSo total operations would be around 3.6e6 * 45 = about 160 million. Hmm, that's manageable in Python, but perhaps tight. Are there optimizations possible?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using backtracking to find a matching without generating all possibilities. But I'm not sure; maybe it's easier to proceed with the permutation approach.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, R and B can be up to 10, but in some cases, like when R=3 and B=3, we have 3! =6 permutations to check. For R=10, 10! is 3.6 million, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nNow, the main challenge is implementing the line segment intersection check correctly.\n\nHow to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect?\n\nI remember the standard method is to use the cross product to determine the orientation of points and see if the segments intersect properly.\n\nLet me recall the algorithm:\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n- The points A and B are on opposite sides of CD, and C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nOr, one of the endpoints lies on the other segment.\n\nBut handling all these cases can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, here's a function I can write:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # a and b are endpoints of the first segment\n    # c and d are endpoints of the second segment\n\n    def ccw(p, q, r):\n        # Returns the cross product (p-q) x (r-q)\n        return (q[0]-p[0])*(r[1]-p[1]) - (q[1]-p[1])*(r[0]-p[0])\n\n    # Check if a",

Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading and Initial Checks**: Read the input values and check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, output \"No\" because a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate All Perfect Matchings**: Use permutations to generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases.\n3. **Check for Intersecting Paths**: For each permutation (perfect matching), check if any two line segments connecting a spaceship to a base intersect. This involves:\n   - Using the cross product to determine the orientation of points relative to each other.\n   - Checking if the segments intersect by ensuring that the endpoints of one segment lie on opposite sides of the other segment and vice versa.\n4. **Output Result**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting paths, output \"Yes\". If none do, output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    def on_segment(p, q, r):\n        if min(p[0], r[0]) <= q[0] <= max(p[0], r[0]) and min(p[1], r[1]) <= q[1] <= max(p[1], r[1]):\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    ccw1 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw2 = ccw(c, d, b)\n    if (ccw1 == 0 and on_segment(c, d, a)) or (ccw2 == 0 and on_segment(c, d, b)):\n        return True\n    ccw3 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw4 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    if (ccw3 == 0 and on_segment(a, b, c)) or (ccw4 == 0 and on_segment(a, b, d)):\n        return True\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    R_B = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    R = int(R_B[0])\n    B = int(R_B[1])\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    for perm in permutations(bases, R):\n        valid = True\n        ship_indices = list(range(R))\n        for i in range(R):\n            ship_i = ships[i]\n            base_i = perm[i]\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                ship_j = ships[j]\n                base_j = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(ship_i, base_i, ship_j, base_j):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for spaceships and bases.\n2. **Checking Equality**: If the number of spaceships does not equal the number of bases, output \"No\".\n3. **Permutations**: Generate all possible permutations of bases to check as potential assignments for spaceships.\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: For each permutation, check if any two segments (from a spaceship to a base) intersect using the cross product method to determine orientation.\n5. **Result Determination**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting paths, print \"Yes\".
