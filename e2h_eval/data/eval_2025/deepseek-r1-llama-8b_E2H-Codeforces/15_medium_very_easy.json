They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine all the winning integers x for a given tournament setup. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the tournament is a knockout style with 2^n teams. Each game eliminates one team, and the process continues until one champion remains. The way the games are structured is important. In each phase, the teams are paired as (1,2), (3,4), etc., and in each phase, certain rules apply based on the string s.\n\nThe string s has n characters, each being '0' or '1'. For each phase i (from 0 to n-1, maybe?), the rule is: if s[i] is '0', then in each match during that phase, the lower-skilled team wins. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins. Wait, wait, no—wait, the description says that s_i denotes the result of games in the i-th phase. So for each game in that phase, the outcome depends on s_i.\n\nHmm, but how are the phases ordered? Let me think about the example. Oh right, the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, then the next phase has 2^(n-2) games, and so on, until the nth phase, which is just one game.\n\nWait, actually, the initial description says that the tournament consists of 2^n - 1 games, held in phases. The first phase has 2^{n-1} games, then the second phase has 2^{n-2} games, etc., until the last phase has 1 game. So, the phases are ordered from the initial pairing down to the final.\n\nEach phase corresponds to a level in the binary tournament tree. For each phase i (starting from 0), the number of games is 2^{n - i - 1}, because the first phase has 2^{n-1} games, then 2^{n-2}, etc., until the last phase has 1 game.\n\nBut how does the string s relate to these phases? The string s has length n. So for each phase i, where i ranges from 0 to n-1, s[i] determines the outcome of all the games in that phase.\n\nWait, perhaps the phases are in order from the first phase (with 2^{n-1} games) to the last phase (with 1 game). So s[0] corresponds to the first phase, s[1] to the second, and so on until s[n-1].\n\nSo for each phase i, the games in that phase are determined by s[i]. So for each phase, we can model the outcome of the matches based on s[i].\n\nThe permutation p is such that the skill levels are assigned to the teams. Our task is to find all x where there exists a permutation p where team x becomes the champion.\n\nWe need to find all possible x where such a permutation exists.\n\nSo the approach is to model the tournament, considering the given rules for each phase, and determine which positions x can end up as the winner.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the total number of teams is 2^18 = 262144. So brute-forcing all possible permutations is impossible.\n\nHmm, so we need a smart way to model the possible winners.\n\nLet me think about the tournament structure. The tournament is a binary tree, with each node representing a game. The leaves are the initial matches, and the root is the final match.\n\nEach internal node represents a game whose winner proceeds to the parent node.\n\nBut since each phase has a certain rule (s[i]), each level of the tournament tree has its own rule.\n\nWait, no: each phase is a set of games at a particular level. So for phase i (the i-th phase), all the games in that phase have their outcomes determined by s[i].\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because each phase is a grouping of 2^i games. Or maybe each phase is a specific level in the tournament tree. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's model each round as a stage where certain matches happen, and the outcome depends on the current s character.\n\nWait, perhaps each phase corresponds to a certain level in the tournament. For example, the first phase is the initial round where 2^{n-1} games are played. Then the second phase is the next round, with 2^{n-2} games, etc., until the last phase, which is the final game.\n\nSo for each phase i, the games are at a certain level, and the outcome of those games depends on s[i].\n\nSo for each phase, the way the games proceed is as follows:\n\nIn phase i, the teams are grouped into matches. For example, in phase 0 (the first phase), the teams are paired as (1,2), (3,4), etc. The winners of these matches proceed to the next phase. But in phase 1, the winners from phase 0 are paired again, but now perhaps the groupings are different.\n\nWait, no. Because after phase 0, the 2^{n-1} winners proceed to phase 1. But in phase 1, how are they paired? Are they grouped into 2^{n-2} matches, each consisting of two consecutive winners from phase 0?\n\nWait, I think so. So, for phase i, the number of games is 2^{n-i-1}, and the participants are the winners from phase i-1, grouped into consecutive pairs.\n\nSo, for example, in phase 0, 2^{n-1} games, each pair is consecutive teams. The winners form a list of 2^{n-1} teams, which then are paired into consecutive pairs again for phase 1, and so on.\n\nSo, for phase i, the participants are the winners from phase i-1, arranged in the same order, and then grouped into consecutive pairs for the next phase.\n\nSo the key is that each phase's pairings are based on the previous phase's winners, in order.\n\nNow, the outcome of each phase's games is determined by s[i], where i is the phase index.\n\nWait, but what is the phase index? Because the string s has n characters. For n=3, the phases are 0,1,2.\n\nWait, for n=3, the phases are 0, 1, 2. The first phase is phase 0, which has 4 games. Then phase 1 has 2 games. Then phase 2 has 1 game.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each phase i, from 0 to n-1, the games in that phase are determined by s[i].\n\nSo each phase is characterized by a rule (s[i]) and the current set of participants.\n\nNow, the goal is to model the tournament process, considering the rules for each phase, and determine for which x it's possible for a permutation p to make x the winner.\n\nHmm, but how do we model the tournament with varying rules per phase?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the tournament as a binary decision tree, where each node represents a game, and each edge represents the outcome of that game (which team wins). However, since the rules vary per phase, each level of the tree (each phase) has a rule that determines how the matches proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the tournament as a series of stages, each stage having a certain rule.\n\nEach stage i (phase i) will have 2^{n-i-1} games. The way the teams are paired is in consecutive groups of two. So, for the initial phase, it's straightforward: team 1 vs 2, team 3 vs 4, etc. But for the next phase, the winners are in order, so for phase i+1, the first winner is the winner of the first pair in phase i, the second is the winner of the second pair, etc. So the pairings for phase i+1 are (winners of phase i's first and second games), (winners of third and fourth games), etc.\n\nSo, for each phase, the teams are in a certain order, and the games are paired as consecutive pairs.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model the possible progression of teams through each phase, considering the rules for each phase.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can model this using a bitmask representation, but with n up to 18, the mask would need to represent 2^18 = 262,144 bits, which is manageable but computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the possible teams that can reach each phase, under the given rules, and track their possible positions.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent for each phase, the possible teams that could win that phase, given the rules up to that point.\n\nWait, but the outcome of each phase depends on the previous phase's winners, so perhaps dynamic programming is needed.\n\nLet me think: for each phase i, and for each possible subset of teams that could be the winners of phase i-1, and the rules for phase i, compute the possible winners of phase i.\n\nBut even that might be too slow for n=18.\n\nWait, but n is up to 18, and each phase reduces the number of teams by half. So the number of phases is 18, and each phase's processing would involve O(2^{n - i}) possibilities, but for n=18, 2^18 is about 260k, which is manageable for 18 steps.\n\nWait, but 2^18 is 262,144, which for each phase would require handling a lot of subsets. So perhaps it's feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can model the state more efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively: for each phase, given the current set of possible winners, and the rule for that phase, compute the possible winners for the next phase.\n\nWait, perhaps it's manageable with memoization or something similar.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model for each phase i, the possible set of teams that can be the overall winner, considering the rules up to phase i.\n\nSo, starting from phase 0, which has 2^{n-1} games, each determined by s[0], we can compute the possible winners of phase 0, then for each of those, compute the possible winners of phase 1, and so on until phase n-1.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. For each phase i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n   a. Determine the rule for this phase: whether higher or lower skill wins.\n   \n   b. For each possible team that could have won phase i-1, simulate the possible outcomes of the matches in phase i, and compute the possible winners of phase i.\n   \n   c. Keep track of all possible winners up to this phase.\n\n2. After processing all phases, collect all possible x that are winners.\n\nBut wait, how do we model the teams that are still in the competition after each phase?\n\nFor phase 0, each game is between two teams. The winner of each game proceeds to phase 1. So for phase 0, the winners are determined by s[0]. So for each pair of teams (like 1 and 2), depending on s[0], either the higher or lower skill team wins.\n\nBut the permutation p is a permutation of the numbers 1..2^n, meaning each team has a unique skill level. So, for each pair in phase 0, depending on s[0], the winner is either the higher or lower of the two.\n\nWait, but the permutation is fixed. So, for each possible permutation p, the tournament plays out according to the rules, and the winner is determined.\n\nBut since we need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the winner, perhaps we can model the process by considering, for each phase, the constraints on the ordering of the teams.\n\nWait, maybe it's helpful to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each non-leaf node is a game, and each leaf is a team. Each internal node represents a game, and the outcome depends on the phase's rule.\n\nBut the problem is that the rules vary per phase, so each level of the tree has a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model for each position in the tournament bracket, what is the earliest phase where a particular team can win.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the tournament is a single elimination, with the structure of a binary tree. Each game is determined by the rules of its phase.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the possible winners through each phase, considering the rules.\n\nSo, for each phase i, given the current list of teams, and the rule for phase i (whether higher or lower skill wins), we can compute the possible winners for phase i.\n\nBut since the teams are in a certain order for phase i, the pairings are consecutive. So for phase i, the teams are in a list, say L, and the games are L[0] vs L[1], L[2] vs L[3], etc.\n\nEach game's outcome depends on s[i]. So for each pair in the current list, the winner is determined by s[i], and the next list is the winners of each pair.\n\nSo, for each phase i, we can model the possible winners as a function of the previous phase's winners and the rule.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, let's think about this step by step.\n\nInitially, before any phase, all teams are present. So for phase 0, the list is [1, 2, 3, ..., 2^n].\n\nThen, for each phase i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a. For each team in the current list, they are grouped into consecutive pairs.\n\n   b. For each pair, based on s[i], the winner is determined. So for each pair (a, b), if s[i] is '0', the lower-skilled team (p^{-1}(min(a,b))?) wins, else the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the permutation p gives the skills. So, for two teams x and y, their skills are p[x] and p[y]. So, if s[i] is '0', then in the game x vs y, the winner is the one with the lower skill. So, the team with the smaller p value wins. Conversely, if s[i] is '1', the team with the higher p value wins.\n\nSo, for a pair (x, y), the winner is min(x,y) if s[i] is '0', else max(x,y).\n\nWait, no. Wait, p is a permutation of 1 to 2^n. So, for a pair (x, y), their p values are p_x and p_y. If s[i] is '0', the lower-skilled (smaller p) team wins. So, the winner is the one with the smaller p value. If s[i] is '1', the higher-skilled (larger p) team wins.\n\nSo, for a pair (x, y), the winner is x if p_x < p_y and s[i] is '0', else y if p_y < p_x and s[i] is '0'. Or, more simply, the winner is the one with the lower p value if s[i] is '0', else the higher p.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the current list is processed in pairs, and for each pair, the winner is determined based on s[i].\n\nSo, for phase i, the list after phase i is the list of winners from each pair in phase i.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\ncurrent_list = [1, 2, 3, ..., 2^n]\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n    next_list = []\n    for j in 0 to len(current_list)-1 step 2:\n        a = current_list[j]\n        b = current_list[j+1]\n        if s[i] == '0':\n            # lower p wins\n            if p[a] < p[b]:\n                winner = a\n            else:\n                winner = b\n        else:\n            # higher p wins\n            if p[a] > p[b]:\n                winner = a\n            else:\n                winner = b\n        next_list.append(winner)\n    current_list = next_list\n\nAfter processing all phases, the current_list will have only one element, which is the winner.\n\nBut since the permutation p is variable, our task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the final winner.\n\nSo, the question is: which x can be the final winner for some permutation p that satisfies the rules for each phase.\n\nBut trying all permutations is impossible due to the size.\n\nSo, we need a way to model the possible winners through each phase, considering the rules, and for each phase, track which teams can possibly be the final winner.\n\nWait, but how? Because the outcome of each phase depends on the permutation p. So, for a given phase i, the possible winners are constrained by the choices made in earlier phases.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model for each phase i, the set of possible teams that can be in the current_list, given the rules up to phase i.\n\nBut the current_list is a list of 2^{n-i} teams, and for each phase i+1, the current_list is built from the previous phase's current_list.\n\nSo, the key is to model the possible winners for each phase, considering the rules.\n\nWait, but for each phase i, the current_list is a list of 2^{n-i} teams. Each team is part of the current list, and for phase i+1, the current list is built by pairing them into consecutive pairs, determining the winner for each pair based on s[i+1], and then proceeding.\n\nBut since the permutation p is variable, the outcome of each phase's matches depends on the order of the teams in the current_list, which in turn depends on the permutation p.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to consider for each phase, the possible orderings of the teams that would allow certain teams to reach the next phase.\n\nBut that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the possible sets of teams that can reach each phase, given the rules.\n\nWait, for each phase i, the current_list is a list of teams. Each team in the list must have survived all previous phases. So, for phase i, the current_list is the list of winners from phase i-1.\n\nBut since the outcome depends on the order of the teams in phase i-1, which depends on the permutation p, this seems tricky.\n\nAnother angle: the final winner must be the strongest possible team under the constraints imposed by the phases.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the set of possible winners is determined by certain conditions on their relative strengths.\n\nWait, for example, if a phase i has rule '0', then the winner of that phase's game must be the weaker team in the pair. So, for a pair (A, B), A must be weaker than B for A to win, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but the permutation p assigns each team a unique strength. So, for phase i, when the rule is '0', each pair's winner is the weaker team. So, in each pair, the winner is the one with the lower p value.\n\nSimilarly, for phase i with rule '1', the winner is the stronger team.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the selection of the winners is determined by the rule s[i].\n\nNow, the key idea is that for a team x to be the final winner, it must be the strongest possible in all the necessary phases.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the possible winners as a function of the rules, and for each phase, determine the constraints that a winner x must satisfy.\n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can model for each phase i, the required condition that a team x must satisfy in order to be a possible winner.\n\nWait, for example, in the first phase (i=0), the rule is s[0]. So, for a team x to reach the next phase, it must win its match in phase 0. Since phase 0 has 2^{n-1} games, each decided by s[0], x must be the winner of its own pair in phase 0.\n\nSo, for x to reach phase 1, it must be the winner of its pair in phase 0.\n\nSimilarly, for phase 1, the rule is s[1], so in that phase, x must win its match, which is against another team that has already won in phase 0.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the team x must be the winner of its match in phase i, which depends on s[i] and the other participant in that match.\n\nBut the other participant is determined by the outcomes of phase i-1.\n\nHmm, this seems like a recursive problem.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, we can model the possible winners as a set, and for each phase, update the set based on the rule.\n\nSo, let's model this as a DP:\n\n- dp[i]: a set of possible winners after phase i.\n\nWe start with dp[0] being the set of all possible winners of phase 0, given s[0].\n\nThen, for each phase i from 1 to n-1, we compute dp[i] based on dp[i-1] and s[i].\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause for phase i, the participants are the winners of phase i-1. These winners are arranged in a list, and then they are paired into consecutive pairs for phase i.\n\nEach pair's outcome is determined by s[i]. So, for each possible pair of winners from phase i-1, the winner of the phase i's pair depends on s[i].\n\nBut the problem is that the order in which the winners from phase i-1 are arranged affects which teams can meet in phase i.\n\nWait, but the permutation p determines the order in which the teams are arranged in each phase.\n\nSo, for phase i, the current_list is the list of winners from phase i-1. The way they are ordered in this list depends on the permutation p.\n\nSo, for phase i, the current_list is a list of 2^{n-i} teams. The way they are paired is consecutive, so the first two form one pair, the next two form another, etc.\n\nSo, for phase i, the outcome of each pair depends on s[i], and thus the next_list is built.\n\nBut the order in the current_list for phase i is determined by the permutation p, which is variable.\n\nSo, the key is to find an ordering of the phase i-1's winners such that, for each pair in phase i, the outcome is compatible with the rule s[i], and that the final winner is x.\n\nHmm, but this seems difficult to model directly.\n\nAlternative approach: for each phase i, the current list is a certain order of teams, and the next list is determined by the rules. So, for the next phase, the list's order is determined by the order of the winners from the previous phase.\n\nBut since the order is determined by the permutation p, perhaps the order can be chosen to maximize the possibility of a certain x being the winner.\n\nSo, perhaps for each phase, the order of the current_list can be chosen to arrange the teams in such a way that x can progress through the tournament.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, we can represent the possible orderings of the current_list that would allow x to reach the next phase.\n\nBut even that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model for each phase i, the minimal and maximal possible p values of the current_list, and see how that affects the possible winners.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the current_list must consist of 2^{n-i} teams. The exact order isn't known, but the composition is such that for each pair, the winner is determined by s[i].\n\nBut perhaps for each phase, the minimal and maximal possible p values among the current_list can constrain the possible winners.\n\nWait, for example, in phase i, if s[i] is '0', then each pair's winner is the team with the lower p value. So, the current_list for phase i will consist of the lower-skilled teams in each pair.\n\nIn this case, the minimal p value in the current_list is the winner of the first pair, the next minimal is the winner of the next pair, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, if s[i] is '1', then each pair's winner is the higher-skilled team. So, the current_list will consist of the higher-skilled teams in each pair.\n\nHmm, this suggests that for each phase, the way the current_list is formed depends on s[i], and thus the composition of the current_list is constrained.\n\nSo, perhaps for each phase i, the current_list is a subset of the teams, and the way they are ordered depends on s[i].\n\nBut how to model this for all possible permutations.\n\nAnother idea: think recursively for each team x. For x to be the winner, it must be the winner of all the matches in each phase along its path to the final.\n\nBut the path depends on the order in which the teams are paired in each phase.\n\nWait, perhaps for x to be the winner, in each phase i, x must be the winner of its match in phase i. So, for each phase i, x must be able to win against the opponent it faces in that phase.\n\nBut the opponent it faces in phase i depends on the results of phase i-1.\n\nHmm, but the opponent is determined by the permutation p and the way the teams are ordered in each phase.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to construct for each phase i, the possible opponents x can face, given the rules, and then recursively determine the constraints on x's p value relative to those opponents.\n\nBut again, this seems complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model for each phase, the minimal and maximal p values that a team must have to be a possible winner.\n\nWait, for example, in phase i, if s[i] is '1', then each pair's winner is the higher-skilled team. So, the current_list after phase i will consist of the higher-skilled teams from each pair. So, the minimal p value in the current_list is higher than the minimal p value in the previous phase.\n\nWait, no. Because in phase i, each pair contributes one higher-skilled team. So, the current_list is a subset of the teams, but their p values are not necessarily ordered.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think: phase i has s[i] = '1'. So, in each pair, the higher-skilled team wins. So, the current_list after phase i is the list of higher-skilled teams from each pair. So, the current_list's members are all higher-skilled than at least one other team in their pair.\n\nBut it's possible that some members of the current_list are higher-skilled than others.\n\nSo, for example, if in phase i, the pairs are (A, B), (C, D), where A > B, C > D, then the current_list is [A, C]. Now, in the next phase, these two will be paired, and the winner depends on s[i+1].\n\nSo, for phase i+1, if s[i+1] is '0', then the lower-skilled of A and C will win.\n\nThus, the final winner depends on both phases.\n\nSo, the problem is that the permutation p must be arranged such that x can emerge as the winner through all these phases.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps another approach is to model for each phase, the necessary conditions on the permutation p for x to be the winner.\n\nEach phase imposes certain constraints on the ordering of the teams.\n\nFor example, in phase i, if s[i] is '0', then in each pair, the lower-skilled team wins. So, in phase i, the current_list is built by selecting the lower-skilled team from each pair. Thus, for x to reach phase i+1, it must be the lower-skilled team in its pair in phase i.\n\nConversely, if s[i] is '1', x must be the higher-skilled team in its pair in phase i.\n\nSo, for x to be the winner, it must satisfy all these constraints across all phases.\n\nBut the problem is to find a permutation p such that x satisfies all these constraints.\n\nSo, the constraints for x are:\n\nFor each phase i, x must be the winner of its match in phase i. This requires that in phase i, the other team in x's match must have a lower (or higher) p value, depending on s[i].\n\nSo, for each phase i, the other team in x's match must have a p value that is either less than or greater than p[x], depending on s[i].\n\nBut the other team in phase i's match is determined by the previous phase's outcomes.\n\nWait, but the other team in phase i's match is the winner of a certain subtree of the tournament.\n\nThis seems too abstract.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model for each phase i, the set of possible opponents x could face in that phase, given the permutation p.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of trying to model the entire tournament for all possible permutations, perhaps we can represent the possible winners as a binary trie or something similar, where each node represents a possible outcome of a phase.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase, we can model the possible teams that can be in the current_list, along with some information about their relative strengths.\n\nBut again, the problem is the size.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nPerhaps for each team x, determine whether it's possible for x to win the tournament by ensuring that in each phase, x can be the winner of its match, given the rules.\n\nBut how to model the opponents in each phase.\n\nWait, perhaps the main constraint is that in each phase i, x must be the winner of its match, and the other team in that match must have been the winner of a certain sub-tournament in phase i-1.\n\nSo, for x to be the winner, in phase 0, it must win against its first opponent. That opponent is determined by the initial pairing.\n\nIn phase 1, x must win against another team that has won in phase 0.\n\nBut how to model the possible opponents in each phase.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model for each phase i, the set of possible opponents x could face in that phase, given the permutation p.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Binary Tournaments:\n\nIn a standard single-elimination tournament with a binary bracket, the winner must be the strongest team in some subtree.\n\nBut in this problem, the rules vary per phase, so it's not a standard bracket.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each phase, the way the teams are paired and the rule affects which teams can progress.\n\nSo, perhaps the final winner must be the team that can beat all the necessary opponents in each phase, given the rules.\n\nBut again, without knowing the opponents, it's difficult.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet’s think about the problem differently. We need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the winner. So, for x to be the winner, the permutation p must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nFor each phase i, x must be the winner of its match in phase i. So, for phase i, x's opponent must be a team that is either less than or greater than x in p, depending on s[i].\n\nSo, for each phase i, the other team in x's match must have a p value that allows x to win.\n\nBut the other team is determined by the previous phases. So, perhaps for each phase, we can represent the possible p values of the other team in x's match.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the other team in x's match must be a team that was the winner of a certain sub-bracket in phase i-1.\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nLet me think about what the output requires. It asks for all x where there exists a permutation p such that x is the winner.\n\nSo, perhaps for x to be a winner, x must be able to reach each phase's required outcome.\n\nLet me model this as constraints.\n\nSuppose x is a possible winner. Then, for each phase i, x must be the winner of its match in phase i.\n\nIn phase i, the match is against another team y, and the outcome is determined by s[i].\n\nSo, for phase i, if s[i] is '0', x must have a lower p value than y. If s[i] is '1', x must have a higher p value than y.\n\nBut y is the winner of another sub-bracket in phase i-1.\n\nSo, for x to be the winner, the permutation p must be arranged such that for each phase i, x is the winner against y_i, where y_i is the opponent in phase i.\n\nBut the arrangement of the teams in each phase is determined by the permutation p.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking whether there exists a permutation p where for each phase i, x is the winner of its match, given the rules.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the key is to model the constraints on the permutation p for each phase.\n\nFor phase 0: x must be the winner of its initial match. So, if s[0] is '0', x must be the team with lower p in its pair. So, x's pair is either (x, a), where a is another team. So, x must have a lower p than a.\n\nIf s[0] is '1', x must have a higher p than a.\n\nSo, in phase 0, x must be paired with a team a such that a's p is either higher or lower than x's p, depending on s[0].\n\nThen, in phase 1, x must be the winner of its match, which is against another team b, which is the winner of another sub-bracket in phase 0.\n\nSo, for phase 1, the rule is s[1], which determines whether x must be higher or lower than b.\n\nBut b is a team that won its own sub-bracket in phase 0.\n\nSo, for x to be the winner, it must be possible to arrange p such that in each phase, x is the winner of its match, given the rules.\n\nBut this seems like a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each x, check if it's possible to assign p values to the other teams such that x can win the tournament.\n\nBut with n up to 18, that's 262,144 teams, and for each, potentially O(n) steps, that's manageable.\n\nBut how to model the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a binary tree where each node represents a game, and each edge represents the outcome (who won). But the tree's structure varies per phase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, we can model the constraints on p such that x can win all necessary matches.\n\nLet me try to model this for a specific x.\n\nSuppose x is the desired winner.\n\nThen, for each phase i, x must be the winner of its match in phase i.\n\nIn phase i, the match is against a certain team y_i, which is the winner of a sub-bracket in phase i-1.\n\nSo, for each phase i, we can model the required relationship between x and y_i: x must have a p value higher or lower than y_i, depending on s[i].\n\nMoreover, the y_i's for each phase must themselves have been the winners of their own matches in previous phases.\n\nSo, for phase 0: y_0 is the team that x faced in phase 0. Depending on s[0], x must have a higher or lower p than y_0.\n\nFor phase 1: y_1 is the winner of another sub-bracket in phase 0. So, in phase 1, x must beat y_1, depending on s[1].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut how to model the relationships between all these y_i's and x.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a directed graph, where each node is a team, and edges represent the necessary p value relationships.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's better to model this with a bitmask approach.\n\nWait, another Idea: The tournament can be represented as a binary heap-like structure, where each match is determined by the phase's rule.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea inspired by the sample input:\n\nLooking at the sample input, for n=3 and s='101'.\n\nSample Output is ['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3'].\n\nSo, for x in 4,5,6,7, there exists a permutation where these are the winners.\n\nFor x=2 and 3, they can also be winners.\n\nWait, but why? What's special about these numbers.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that for a team x to be a winner, it must be possible to arrange the permutation such that in each phase, x is the winner of its match, considering the rules.\n\nSo, perhaps for x to be a winner, it must be possible to place x in a position where, in each phase, it can beat the required opponents.\n\nBut again, without knowing the permutation, it's challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's model the tournament as a series of decisions, where in each phase, the current_list is a subset of teams, and the order in which they are paired is determined by the permutation p.\n\nBut since the permutation is variable, perhaps the current_list can be ordered in any way that satisfies the constraints of the previous phases.\n\nSo, perhaps for each phase, the current_list can be arranged such that the winners are the ones that allow x to proceed further.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for each phase i, the current_list is a list of teams that have survived all previous phases. The order in which they are arranged in the current_list can be chosen to maximize the chances of x being the final winner.\n\nSo, for phase i, given the current_list, we can arrange the order of the teams in such a way that, for each pair, the winner is the one that allows x to proceed.\n\nBut how to formalize this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the current_list is a list of teams that can reach phase i. For each phase i, depending on s[i], the order of the current_list is arranged such that the winners of the pairs are the ones that will allow x to proceed.\n\nSo, for example, if s[i] is '0', then the current_list should be arranged in increasing order of p, so that the winners of each pair are the lower-skilled teams, which may include x.\n\nAlternatively, if s[i] is '1', arrange the current_list in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the winning integers for a given tournament setup where each game's outcome is determined by a string of rules. The goal is to identify which teams can be the champion under some permutation of skill levels.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is a knockout style with 2^n teams. Each game eliminates one team, and the process continues until one champion remains. The string `s` dictates the outcome of each phase: '0' means the lower-skilled team wins, while '1' means the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a team to be the winner, it must win all its matches in each phase. The order in which teams are paired and the winners are determined depends on the rules provided in the string `s`.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We model the tournament as a series of phases, where each phase reduces the number of teams by half. For each phase, we track the possible winners based on the current set of teams and the rules.\n\n4. **Bitmask Representation**: Use a bitmask to represent the set of possible winners at each phase. This helps efficiently track the progression of teams through each phase.\n\n5. **Recursive Simulation**: For each phase, simulate the possible outcomes based on the current rules. Update the set of possible winners for the next phase by considering each possible pairing and their outcomes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    size = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    result = []\n    \n    from itertools import product\n    \n    # Function to check if x can be the winner\n    def can_win(x):\n        # We need to arrange the permutation such that x can win all necessary matches.\n        # Let's model the required constraints on p.\n        # Each phase i (from 0 to n-1) imposes a condition on x's relative strength to its opponent.\n        \n        # We'll represent the required orderings as a list of tuples (y, i), where y is the team that must have lower p than x in phase i.\n        required = []\n        \n        # Phase 0: initial pairing\n        phase = 0\n        rule = s[phase]\n        # x must be in some pair.
