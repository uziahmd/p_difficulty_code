    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a TV game where two players, Homer and Marge, take turns picking digits from a string A. The string A has exactly 2n digits. They each make exactly n moves. On each turn, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A, appends it to their number, and then that digit is removed from A. The goal is to find the sequence of moves (H or M) that maximizes the sum of both players' numbers. And if there are multiple such sequences, any can be outputted.\n\nHmm, right. So, for each step, the choice is which player takes the next digit. Since each player must make exactly n moves, the order in which they pick will determine how the digits are distributed between them.\n\nBut wait, what's the objective? It's not just to maximize one player's score but the sum of both. So for each digit, depending on who takes it, it contributes to either S1 or S2. The sum S1 + S2 is to be maximized.\n\nSo the challenge is to decide, for each position, whether it's better for H or M to take it, considering all possible future choices.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem. Because for each state, we need to keep track of how many moves each player has made so far, along with the current state of A. But since A is being consumed digit by digit, the state can be represented by the remaining digits as a string and the counts of moves each player has made.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 18, which means 2n is 36 digits. So the state needs to be manageable.\n\nLet me think about the state representation. Let's say dp[i][h][m] represents the maximum possible sum achievable when we've processed i digits, with h moves made by H and m moves made by M. Wait, but h + m must equal i, because each move processes one digit. So perhaps h can range from 0 to i, but since each player must make exactly n moves, the final state must have h = n and m = n.\n\nSo, for each position i (from 0 to 2n), we can have h from max(0, i - n) to min(i, n), and similarly for m. Because h can't be more than n, nor can m.\n\nThe value of dp[i][h][m] would be the maximum sum achievable after processing i digits, with h and m moves made by each player. Then, for each step, we can choose whether the current player is H or M, and accordingly, add the digit's value to either H's total or M's total.\n\nWait, but the digits are taken in order. So the state also depends on which digits have been taken so far. Storing the entire string as part of the state is impossible because 2n can be up to 36, leading to 2^36 possible states, which is way too big.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So we need a way to represent the state without tracking every possible combination of digits taken so far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the state based on the current position in the string and how many moves each player has made so far. That is, dp[i][h][m], representing the maximum sum after taking i digits, with h moves by H and m by M. Then, for each state, we can try taking the next digit (either H or M) and update the DP accordingly.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the order in which the digits are taken determines their contribution, and the DP will consider all possible paths to maximize the sum.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the value of each digit in A as integers. For example, '3' becomes 3.\n\n2. Initialize a DP table where dp[i][h][m] represents the maximum sum achievable after taking i digits, with h moves by H and m moves by M.\n\n3. The base case is dp[0][0][0] = 0, meaning before taking any digits, the sum is zero.\n\n4. For each state (i, h, m), we can transition to the next state by taking the (i+1)th digit. If we assign it to H, then h increases by 1 (but cannot exceed n). Similarly for M.\n\n5. The recurrence relation is: for each possible state (i, h, m), and for each possible next action (H or M, if allowed), compute the new sum and update the next state's maximum.\n\n6. After processing all transitions, the answer is found in dp[2n][n][n].\n\nBut wait, the order in which the digits are taken matters because each digit is taken in order. So, for each step i, the next digit is the (i+1)th digit in the original string, but only if it hasn't been taken yet. Wait no— the process is that each time, the leftmost remaining digit is taken. So, the string is processed sequentially, and each step corresponds to the next digit in order.\n\nSo, the DP state must track how much of the string has been processed. Therefore, the state is (current_position, h, m), and for each state, we can take the next digit (the current_position-th digit, if using 0-based or 1-based index).\n\nWait, let's clarify: the initial string is A, which is a string of 2n digits. Each move takes the leftmost remaining digit. So, the first move takes A[0], the second takes A[1], etc., until all 2n digits are taken.\n\nSo, the DP can be represented as dp[i][h][m], where i is the number of digits taken so far, h is the number of H moves, m is the number of M moves.\n\nAt each step, we can choose to take the next digit (which is A[i], assuming 0-based) and assign it to either H or M, provided that h < n or m < n, respectively.\n\nSo, the transitions are as follows:\n\nFor dp[i][h][m], the next state can be:\n\n- Take A[i] by H: new_h = h + 1, new_m = m. The added value is the digit's value multiplied by 10^{k}, where k is the position in the respective player's number. Wait, no— because each digit is appended to the number, which could be longer, so the place value depends on the order in which the digits are added.\n\nOh, wait a minute! That complicates things. Because the value of S1 and S2 depends on the order of the digits chosen. For example, if H takes the first digit (say 1) and then the third (say 2), his number is 12, which is 12. But if he took 2 then 1, it's 21, which is larger. So, the order in which H's digits are taken affects the sum. Similarly for M.\n\nTherefore, the sum isn't just the sum of the digits, but their weighted sum based on their positions in their respective numbers.\n\nThis adds a layer of complexity because the same set of digits assigned to H can result in different sums depending on the order they are taken.\n\nSo, the DP approach needs to account for the fact that the value of the digits depends on the order they are added to S1 and S2.\n\nThis makes the problem more challenging because the state must not only track which digits have been taken but also their order. However, tracking the exact order is impossible due to memory constraints.\n\nHmm, so how can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the DP state as (i, h, m), and for each state, track the maximum possible sum for S1 and S2 given the digits taken so far. But even that might not be feasible because the sum can be very large (for n=18, 2n=36 digits, each up to 9, so maximum sum is about 9*36 * 10^17, which is a huge number and can't be stored in standard variables).\n\nWait, but maybe we can find a way to represent the sum incrementally. Because each digit's contribution depends on its position in the number.\n\nWait, for example, when building S1, each new digit is added to the right of the existing number. So, the first digit contributes d * 10^{k-1}, where k is the number of digits in S1 so far. The next digit contributes d * 10^{k}, and so on.\n\nBut in the DP state, it's hard to track the exact multipliers because they depend on the length of the numbers S1 and S2.\n\nSo, perhaps the key insight is to realize that the order in which the digits are assigned to each player affects their total, and the optimal strategy is to assign the largest possible digits to the earliest possible positions in S1 and S2.\n\nBecause adding a digit early in S1 gives it a higher weight than adding it later. For example, if you have two digits, 9 and 9: assigning both to S1 as 99 gives 99, but if you assign one to S1 and one to S2, their sum is 99 as well. Wait, but that's specific to this example. But in general, earlier digits contribute more.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to assign the largest available digits to the earliest positions possible, alternating between H and M as needed.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. So, the best way to maximize the sum is to greedily assign the largest remaining digit to the player whose turn it is, but perhaps sometimes it's better to save a larger digit for a later position in a player's number.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe a greedy approach isn't sufficient. For example, if a player has a choice between a large digit now and a slightly smaller one later, which is better depends on the overall sum.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose a player has the option to take a 9 now, or a 8 followed by a 9. If the player takes 9 now, their number gets 9. If they take 8 now and then 9, their number is 89, which is 8*10 +9=89, which is larger than 9. So, in this case, taking the smaller digit first allows a larger total.\n\nHmm, so the order in which digits are added to a player's number can significantly affect the total.\n\nThis suggests that a simple greedy approach may not work. Therefore, the DP approach seems necessary.\n\nSo, going back to the DP idea: each state is (i, h, m), representing that we've taken i digits, with h moves by H and m moves by M.\n\nFor each state, the next digit is A[i]. We can choose to assign it to H or M, but only if h < n or m < n, respectively.\n\nWhen assigning to H, the digit is added to the end of H's number, which is equivalent to multiplying the digit by 10^k, where k is the current length of H's number.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nBut how do we track the current length of H's and M's numbers in the DP state?\n\nBecause the length depends on how many times each player has moved so far. For example, in state (i, h, m), h is the number of times H has moved, so H's number has h digits. Similarly, M's number has m digits.\n\nSo, when we assign the (i+1)th digit to H, the value added is digit * 10^h.\n\nSimilarly, assigning to M adds digit * 10^m.\n\nWait, that's a crucial observation. Because, for each player, the number of digits they have so far is h for H and m for M. So, when a new digit is added, it's placed at the end, thus multiplied by 10 raised to the count of digits already present.\n\nSo, for the DP state (i, h, m), the next digit (A[i], 0-based) is the (i)th digit (since we've taken i digits so far, the next is the i-th). Wait, no. Wait, initially, i is 0, no digits taken. Then, for the first step, i=0, take A[0], then i becomes 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the digits as 0-based. So, for the state i, which represents that i digits have been taken. So, the next digit is the i-th in the original string.\n\nSo, for state (i, h, m), the next digit is A[i], and the current digit is A[i], which can be assigned to H or M, provided h < n or m <n.\n\nWait, but in the DP, the state is (i, h, m), which means we have taken i digits. So, the next digit is A[i], and the next state is (i+1, h', m'), where h' = h + 1 if H takes it, else h, and similarly for M.\n\nSo, the value added to the sum is:\n\nIf H takes it: digit * 10^h\n\nIf M takes it: digit * 10^m\n\nSo, the DP transition can be written as:\n\ndp[i+1][h+1][m] = max(dp[i+1][h+1][m], dp[i][h][m] + (digit * 10^h))\n\nand\n\ndp[i+1][h][m+1] = max(dp[i+1][h][m+1], dp[i][h][m] + (digit * 10^m))\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo, the plan is to:\n\n- Precompute the powers of 10 up to 18, since h and m can each be up to 18.\n\n- Initialize a 3-dimensional DP array where dp[i][h][m] represents the maximum sum achievable after taking i digits, with h and m moves by H and M.\n\n- For each state, iterate over all possible h and m values, and for each, try both possible transitions (assign to H or M, if possible), updating the next state's maximum sum.\n\n- Finally, the answer is in dp[2n][n][n].\n\nNow, considering the size of the DP array:\n\n- i ranges from 0 to 2n (up to 36)\n- h and m each range from 0 to n (up to 18)\nSo the total number of states is 36 * 19 * 19 = around 139,000. That's manageable.\n\nEach state transition involves computing two possibilities (H or M taking the next digit), so the total number of operations is acceptable.\n\nBut we need to handle the transitions correctly, especially initializing the DP properly.\n\nAnother thing to note is that for each state, the maximum sum is tracked, so we can initialize the DP with -infinity, except dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Read n and the string A.\n\n2. Precompute the powers of 10 up to 18.\n\n3. Initialize a 3D DP array, perhaps using a dictionary or a list of lists of lists.\n\nBut in Python, a 3D list can be initialized as follows:\n\nmax_n = 18\ndp = [[[ -infinity for _ in range(max_n+1)] for __ in range(max_n+1)] for ___ in range(2*n +1)]\n\nWait, but 2n can be up to 36, so the DP needs to cover i up to 36.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nsize_i = 2*n\ndp = [ [ [-inf for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)] for ___ in range(size_i +1) ]\n\nWait, but for each i, h can be up to min(i, n), and m is i - h, but constrained by h <=n, m <=n.\n\nSo, during the DP filling, for each i, h can be from max(0, i - (n)) ) to min(i, n).\n\nWait, no. Because h can't be more than n, and m can't be more than n.\n\nSo, for each i, h can vary from max(0, i - n) to min(i, n), because m = i - h, and m can't be more than n. So i - h <=n → h >= i -n. Also, since h can't be negative, h >= max(0, i -n).\n\nSimilarly, for each i, h can't exceed min(i, n), because h can't be more than i (as m = i -h ≥0).\n\nSo, for each i, h ranges from max(0, i -n) to min(i, n).\n\nSimilarly for m.\n\nThis is important for optimization, as it reduces the number of states we need to process.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nInitialize dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 2n-1:\n\n   for each possible h in the valid range for i:\n\n      for each possible m in the valid range for i:\n\n          if dp[i][h][m] is -inf, skip.\n\n          current_digit = int(A[i])\n\n          // Assign to H:\n\n          new_h = h +1\n\n          if new_h >n: can't assign to H.\n\n          new_m = m\n\n          if dp[i+1][new_h][new_m] < dp[i][h][m] + (current_digit * (10 ** h)):\n\n              update it.\n\n          // Assign to M:\n\n          new_h = h\n\n          new_m = m +1\n\n          if new_m >n: can't assign to M.\n\n          if dp[i+1][new_h][new_m] < dp[i][h][m] + (current_digit * (10 ** m)):\n\n              update it.\n\nOnce all transitions are processed, the maximum sum is in dp[2n][n][n].\n\nBut wait, the problem requires us to output the sequence of moves, not just the maximum sum. So, after finding the maximum sum, we need to reconstruct the path of H and M moves.\n\nSo, we need to track not just the maximum sum, but also the path that leads to it.\n\nTherefore, the DP should store, for each state (i, h, m), the maximum sum and the corresponding sequence of moves.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. Because the state would now include the path, which is a string of H and M's, making the state much larger.\n\nBut given that n is up to 18, 36 digits, and each move is either H or M, the path can be up to 36 characters long. So, for each state, storing the path is impractical because it would require 36 bits per state, leading to a state space that is too large.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of storing the entire path, we can keep a parent pointer or a way to backtrack once the maximum sum is found.\n\nSo, after computing the DP and finding the maximum sum, we can backtrack through the DP to find the sequence of moves.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can have a separate data structure that tracks, for each state (i, h, m), the previous state and whether the current digit was taken by H or M.\n\nAlternatively, we can reconstruct the path once we have the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the DP as described, storing the maximum sum for each state.\n\n2. Once the DP is filled, start from the end state (2n, n, n) and trace back through the DP to find the sequence of moves.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nWe can create a parent table, which for each state (i, h, m) records which state led to it (i.e., the previous state and whether the last digit was taken by H or M). This requires storing for each state (i, h, m) the best predecessor.\n\nBut given the constraints, this is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each state (i, h, m), during the DP computation, when we update a state (i+1, new_h, new_m), we can also record how we arrived there.\n\nFor example, when we assign a digit to H, the new state (i+1, h+1, m) is updated. We can note that the move was H.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nSo, during the DP transition, for each new state, we can note the move that led to it.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, we can reconstruct the path by starting from the end state and moving backwards, noting each move.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, the DP array will store the maximum sum for each state, and a separate parent array will store for each state (i, h, m) the move that was taken to reach it.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Read n and A.\n\n- Precompute powers of 10 up to 18.\n\n- Initialize the DP table: dp[i][h][m] = -infinity for all i, h, m except dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\n- Create a parent table, perhaps a 3D list, where parent[i][h][m] is a tuple indicating whether the last move was H or M, and the previous state (i_prev, h_prev, m_prev). Or perhaps, since the move is determined by the transition, we can just note the move.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each state, we can track the move that led to it.\n\nSo, for each i, h, m:\n\n   if dp[i][h][m] is not -inf:\n\n       current_digit = A[i]\n\n       // assign to H\n\n       if h+1 <=n:\n\n           new_sum = dp[i][h][m] + current_digit * (10 ** h)\n\n           if new_sum > dp[i+1][h+1][m]:\n\n               dp[i+1][h+1][m] = new_sum\n\n               parent[i+1][h+1][m] = ('H', i, h, m)\n\n       // assign to M\n\n       if m+1 <=n:\n\n           new_sum = dp[i][h][m] + current_digit * (10 ** m)\n\n           if new_sum > dp[i+1][h][m+1]:\n\n               dp[i+1][h][m+1] = new_sum\n\n               parent[i+1][h][m+1] = ('M', i, h, m)\n\nBut wait, in this setup, the parent[i+1][h+1][m] would store the move that was taken to reach that state, along with the previous state (i, h, m). This way, during reconstruction, we can backtrack step by step.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, the maximum sum is in dp[2n][n][n], and the moves can be reconstructed by starting from this state and following the parent pointers, collecting the moves in reverse order.\n\nSo, the reconstruction process:\n\ncurrent_state = (2n, n, n)\n\nmoves = []\n\nwhile current_state is not (0,0,0):\n\n   move, i_prev, h_prev, m_prev = parent[current_state.i][current_state.h][current_state.m]\n\n   moves.append(move)\n\n   current_state = (i_prev, h_prev, m_prev)\n\nThen, reverse the moves to get the correct order.\n\nWait, but in the parent, for each state, we need to know how we arrived there. So, the parent should store for each state (i, h, m), the move that was taken to reach it, as well as the previous state.\n\nBut perhaps it's sufficient to store the move and the previous state.\n\nIn code, for each state (i, h, m), when we assign a move, we can set:\n\nparent[i][h][m] = (move, i_prev, h_prev, m_prev)\n\nBut for i=0, h=0, m=0, the parent is None.\n\nSo, during the reconstruction:\n\nstart with i=2n, h=n, m=n.\n\nif i ==0 and h==0 and m==0: break.\n\nget the move from parent[i][h][m], append it, then set i, h, m to i_prev, h_prev, m_prev, and repeat.\n\nOnce all steps are done, reverse the moves to get the correct order.\n\nWait, but each step in the parent is the move that led to the current state. So, the first move in the parent is the last move in the sequence.\n\nSo, for example, if the last move was H, then the previous state was (i-1, h-1, m).\n\nSo, the moves collected during reconstruction are in reverse order.\n\nThus, after collecting all moves, we reverse them to get the correct sequence.\n\nPutting this together, the code outline is:\n\nRead n, A.\n\nCompute pow10 = [10^k for k in 0..n]\n\nInitialize dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\nparent = a 3D array initialized to None.\n\nFor each i from 0 to 2n-1:\n\n   for each h in valid range for i:\n\n       for each m in valid range for i:\n\n           if dp[i][h][m] is -inf: continue.\n\n           current_digit = int(A[i])\n\n           // Try assigning to H:\n\n           new_h = h+1\n\n           if new_h <=n:\n\n               new_sum = dp[i][h][m] + current_digit * (pow10[h])\n\n               if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_h][m]:\n\n                   dp[i+1][new_h][m] = new_sum\n\n                   parent[i+1][new_h][m] = ('H', i, h, m)\n\n           // Try assigning to M:\n\n           new_m = m+1\n\n           if new_m <=n:\n\n               new_sum = dp[i][h][m] + current_digit * (pow10[m])\n\n               if new_sum > dp[i+1][h][new_m]:\n\n                   dp[i+1][h][new_m] = new_sum\n\n                   parent[i+1][h][new_m] = ('M', i, h, m)\n\nOnce all transitions are processed.\n\nCheck if dp[2n][n][n] is -inf, which shouldn't happen because the problem says that both players make exactly n moves.\n\nThen, reconstruct the moves:\n\ncurrent_i = 2n\n\ncurrent_h = n\n\ncurrent_m = n\n\nmoves = []\n\nwhile True:\n\n   if current_i ==0 and current_h ==0 and current_m ==0:\n\n       break\n\n   if parent[current_i][current_h][current_m] is None:\n\n       // error, but according to the problem statement, this won't happen.\n\n       break\n\n   move, prev_i, prev_h, prev_m = parent[current_i][current_h][current_m]\n\n   moves.append(move)\n\n   current_i, current_h, current_m = prev_i, prev_h, prev_m\n\nmoves.reverse()\n\nprint(''.join(moves))\n\nWait, but wait— the parent for state (i, h, m) is the move that leads to it. So, for example, when a state (i+1, h+1, m) is created by assigning H, the parent points back to (i, h, m), and the move is H.\n\nThus, during reconstruction, each step gives the move that was taken to reach the current state, and then we move to the previous state.\n\nSo, the moves collected are in reverse order, hence the need to reverse them at the end.\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nn=2, A='9911'\n\nWait, wait, in the sample given, the output is 'HHMM' and 'HMHM'— wait, no, the sample shows input as ['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911'], but the output is ['HHMM', 'HMHM'].\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the sample.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nn=2\n\nA= '9911'\n\nWait, but the sample shows the output as 'HHMM' and 'HMHM'.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual sample is:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n9911\n\nOutput:\n\nHM HM\n\nWait, no, the sample shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample. Let me look again.\n\nThe problem statement says:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nWait, perhaps the first line is n=2, and the second line is 1234. Or perhaps it's a formatting issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is two lines, first is n=2, second is 9911.\n\nBut the problem statement's sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\nWhich perhaps is a typo, but in any case, the sample output is given.\n\nWell, regardless, let's proceed.\n\nNow, in the sample, n=2, A is 9911.\n\nSo, the digits are 9,9,1,1.\n\nThe maximum sum is achieved by H taking the first 9 and 1, and M taking the second 9 and 1.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the first sequence is HHMM.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's output is for A=1234.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is not critical for our approach, but the code must correctly handle all cases.\n\nTesting the DP approach on the sample:\n\nn=2, A='9911'\n\nDigits: 9,9,1,1.\n\nWe need to split these into two numbers, each of length 2.\n\nThe sum is S1 + S2, where S1 and S2 are built by taking digits in the order they appear.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible sum?\n\nOption 1:\n\nH takes 9 (first digit) → S1 starts as 9.\n\nM takes 9 (second digit) → S2 starts as 9.\n\nH takes 1 (third digit) → S1 is 91.\n\nM takes 1 (fourth digit) → S2 is 91.\n\nSum is 91 +91=182.\n\nOption 2:\n\nH takes 9, M takes 9, H takes 1, M takes 1 → same as above.\n\nOption 3:\n\nH takes 9, M takes 9, H takes 1, M takes 1 → same.\n\nOption 4:\n\nH takes 9, M takes 1, H takes 9, M takes 1.\n\nS1: 99, S2:11 → sum 110.\n\nWhich is less than 182.\n\nSo, the maximum is 182, achieved by assigning the first two 9s to H and M, but no, wait: H takes the first 9, M the second 9, then H takes the first 1, M takes the second 1. So S1 is 91, S2 is 91.\n\nBut wait, the first digit is 9, so H's first digit is 9 (10^0=1). The second digit is 9, taken by M (10^0=1). Third digit 1 is taken by H (10^1=10). Fourth digit 1 is taken by M (10^1=10). So S1=9 +1*10=19, S2=9 +1*10=19. Sum is 38. That's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the digits are added.\n\nWait, the first digit is taken by H → S1 is 9.\n\nSecond digit is taken by M → S2 is 9.\n\nThird digit is taken by H → S1 becomes 9 followed by 1 → 91.\n\nFourth digit is taken by M → S2 becomes 9 followed by 1 → 91.\n\nSo the sum is 91 +91=182.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother option: H takes 9, then M takes 9, then H takes 1, then M takes 1 → same as above.\n\nAnother option: H takes 9, then M takes 1, then H takes 9, then M takes 1.\n\nS1:9, then 9 → 99.\n\nS2:1, then 1 → 11.\n\nSum is 110.\n\nLess than 182.\n\nSo, the maximum is 182, achieved by assigning the first two 9s to H and M, then the 1s to H and M.\n\nSo the sequence is H, M, H, M → 'H M H M' → 'HMHM'.\n\nBut the sample output is 'HHMM' for the first case. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is about A=1234, n=2.\n\nIn that case, the digits are 1,2,3,4.\n\nThe optimal assignment is to have H take 1 and 3, M take 2 and4.\n\nSo, S1=13, S2=24. Sum is 37.\n\nAlternatively, H takes 1, M takes 2, H takes 3, M takes4 → S1=13, S2=24 → same.\n\nAnother option: H takes 1, M takes 3, H takes 2, M takes4 → S1=12, S2=34 → sum 46.\n\nWait, that's better. So why is the sample output 'HHMM'?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is when A is '9911' and the optimal is to have H take 9, M take 9, then H take 1, M take 1 → sequence HMHM, which gives S1=91 and S2=91 → sum 182.\n\nBut in the sample output, it's 'HMHM' which is H, M, H, M → same as above.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not getting the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is A='1234' and the optimal sequence is H, H, M, M.\n\nWhich would give S1=13, S2=24. Sum is 37.\n\nBut another option is H, M, H, M → S1=12, S2=34. Sum is 46.\n\nSo why is the sample output 'HHMM'? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is for n=2 and A=9911, and the output is 'HMHM'.\n\nWhich would correspond to the sequence H, M, H, M.\n\nThus, S1 is 91, S2 is 91, sum 182.\n\nSo the code should correctly find this.\n\nBut in any case, the code should handle all possibilities.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. Handling leading zeros: the problem statement allows leading zeros in the numbers, so the DP doesn't need to worry about that.\n\n2. The pow10 precomputation: for each h up to 18, compute 10^h.\n\n3. The initial state is dp[0][0][0] =0.\n\n4. The DP transitions: for each state, try both options, H and M.\n\n5. The parent pointers for reconstructing the path.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- All digits are zero.\n\n- n=1, A has two same digits.\n\n- n=18, A has all 9s.\n\nAnother edge case: when the optimal path requires assigning a lower digit to a player's later move to allow for a higher digit in an earlier move.\n\nSo, the DP approach should handle all of these.\n\nNow, thinking about the code.\n\nImplementing the DP:\n\nIn Python, for 3D arrays, it's manageable. But initializing a 3D list can be done as follows:\n\nn_val = n\nsize_i = 2 * n_val\nINF = float('-inf')\ndp = [[ [INF]*(n_val+1) for _ in range(n_val+1)] for __ in range(size_i +1)]\ndp[0][0][0] = 0\n\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(n_val +1)]\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to size_i-1:\n\n   for h in range( max(0, i -n_val ), min(i, n_val) +1 ):\n\n       for m in range( max(0, i -n_val ), min(i, n_val) +1 ):\n\n           if dp[i][h][m] == INF:\n\n               continue\n\n           current_digit = int(A[i])\n\n           // Assign to H:\n\n           new_h = h +1\n\n           if new_h <=n_val:\n\n               added_value = current_digit * (pow10[h])\n\n               new_sum = dp[i][h][m] + added_value\n\n               if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_h][m]:\n\n                   dp[i+1][new_h][m] = new_sum\n\n                   // Record the parent for (i+1, new_h, m)\n\n                   parent[(i+1)][new_h][m] = ('H', i, h, m)\n\n           // Assign to M:\n\n           new_m = m +1\n\n           if new_m <=n_val:\n\n               added_value = current_digit * (pow10[m])\n\n               new_sum = dp[i][h][m] + added_value\n\n               if new_sum > dp[i+1][h][new_m]:\n\n                   dp[i+1][h][new_m] = new_sum\n\n                   parent[(i+1)][h][new_m] = ('M', i, h, m)\n\nBut wait, the indices are a bit tricky. Because in Python, the lists are 0-based, and the parent can be a 3D list of tuples.\n\nWait, perhaps the parent is a list of lists of lists of tuples.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nparent = [ [ [ None for _ in range(n_val+1) ] for __ in range(n_val+1) ] for ___ in range(size_i +1) ]\n\nThen, when assigning, for the new state (i+1, new_h, m), the parent is set to ('H', i, h, m).\n\nReconstruction:\n\ncurrent_i = 2*n_val\n\ncurrent_h = n_val\n\ncurrent_m = n_val\n\nmoves = []\n\nwhile True:\n\n   if current_i ==0 and current_h ==0 and current_m ==0:\n\n       break\n\n   if parent[current_i][current_h][current_m] is None:\n\n       //",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge in a TV game where they take turns picking digits from a string to maximize their total prize. Each player must make exactly `n` moves, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming (DP). The key idea is to use a 3D DP table where `dp[i][h][m]` represents the maximum possible sum achievable after taking `i` digits, with `h` moves made by Homer and `m` moves made by Marge. \n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a 3D DP array where `dp[0][0][0]` is set to 0 (indicating no moves made and no digits taken), and all other entries are set to negative infinity (indicating unreachable states).\n\n2. **Transitions**: For each state `(i, h, m)`, we consider the next digit in the string. We can either assign this digit to Homer or Marge, provided neither has exceeded their move limit (`n`). The value added to the sum depends on the position of the digit in their respective number (i.e., the digit's place value).\n\n3. **Parent Pointers**: To reconstruct the sequence of moves, we maintain a parent pointer table that tracks how each state was reached. This helps in backtracking from the final state to determine the optimal sequence of moves.\n\n4. **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the final state `(2n, n, n)` to reconstruct the sequence of moves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\n\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(n + 1)]\nsize_i = 2 * n\n\n# Initialize DP table and parent pointers\nINF = float('-inf')\ndp = [[[INF for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)] for ___ in range(size_i + 1)]\ndp[0][0][0] = 0\n\nparent = [[[None for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)] for ___ in range(size_i + 1)]\n\nfor i in range(size_i):\n    current_digit = int(A[i])\n    for h in range(max(0, i - n), min(i, n) + 1):\n        for m in range(max(0, i - n), min(i, n) + 1):\n            if dp[i][h][m] == INF:\n                continue\n            # Assign to H\n            new_h = h + 1\n            if new_h <= n:\n                added_value = current_digit * pow10[h]\n                new_sum = dp[i][h][m] + added_value\n                if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_h][m]:\n                    dp[i+1][new_h][m] = new_sum\n                    parent[i+1][new_h][m] = ('H', i, h, m)\n            # Assign to M\n            new_m = m + 1\n            if new_m <= n:\n                added_value = current_digit * pow10[m]\n                new_sum = dp[i][h][m] + added_value\n                if new_sum > dp[i+1][h][new_m]:\n                    dp[i+1][h][new_m] = new_sum\n                    parent[i+1][h][new_m] = ('M', i, h, m)\n\n# Reconstruct the path\ncurrent_i, current_h, current_m = size_i, n, n\nmoves = []\nwhile True:\n    if current_i == 0 and current_h == 0 and current_m == 0:\n        break\n    if parent[current_i][current_h][current_m] is None:\n        break  # Should not happen as per problem statement\n    move, prev_i, prev_h, prev_m = parent[current_i][current_h][current_m]\n    moves.append(move)\n    current_i, current_h, current_m = prev_i, prev_h, prev_m\n\nmoves.reverse()\nprint(''.join(moves))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of length `2n`.\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: These are used to calculate the place value of each digit as it is appended to the players' numbers.\n3. **DP Initialization**: The DP table is initialized with `dp[0][0][0] = 0` and all other entries set to negative infinity.\n4. **Filling the DP Table**: For each digit position, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge) and update the DP table accordingly.\n5. **Reconstructing the Path**: Using the parent pointers, we backtrack from the final state to determine the sequence of moves that led to the maximum sum.\n6. **Output the Result**: The sequence of moves is printed as a string of 'H' and 'M' characters.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently and find the one that maximizes the total prize.",
