    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing certain swap operations. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', or '1' and '2'. So, for example, you can swap '01' to get '10', but you can't swap '02' or '20'.\n\nHmm, right. So what does that mean for the arrangement of the characters? Well, let's think about the ordering possibilities.\n\nWait, in terms of lex order, '0' is smaller than '1', which is smaller than '2'. So to get the smallest possible string, we want as many '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nBut the constraints on swapping limit how we can rearrange the string. So, the key is figuring out how the swaps affect the relative positions of the different digits.\n\nLet me break down the allowed swaps:\n\n- '0' can be swapped with '1' if they're adjacent.\n- '1' can be swapped with '2' if they're adjacent.\n\nSo, any '0' can be moved past '1's by a series of adjacent swaps. Similarly, any '1' can be moved past '2's, but '0's can't move past '2's directly. Wait, no—wait: because a '0' can't be swapped with a '2' since that's not allowed. So, the only way a '0' can move past a '2' is if there's a '1' in between them, allowing the '0' to swap with the '1's to get around.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because suppose we have '0' followed by '1' followed by '2'. How can the '0' get past the '2'? Let's see.\n\nThe initial string is 0 1 2.\n\nWe can swap 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. But wait, no—wait, the allowed swaps are 0<->1 and 1<->2. So, after the first swap, 0 2 1: wait, no, because 1 and 2 are adjacent in the original. So, after swapping 1 and 2, the string becomes 0 2 1. Then, can the '0' move past the '2'? No, because '0' and '2' can't be swapped. So the '0' is stuck before the '2' unless there's a path through '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the conclusion is that the order of '0's relative to '2's cannot be changed except when there's a '1' in between. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that all '0's can be arranged among themselves, as they can swap with each other via '1's. Similarly, all '1's can be arranged among themselves via '0's and '2's, but wait, no. Wait, '1's can be swapped with '0's, but also with '2's. So, perhaps the '0's and '1's can be interleaved, but the '2's can't be moved past '0's directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a graph where each character can be connected to others via allowed swaps. For example:\n\n- '0' can be adjacent to '1's (since they can be swapped)\n- '1' can be adjacent to '0's and '2's\n- '2' can be adjacent to '1's\n\nSo, from this, perhaps '0's can't reach '2's through swaps, because '0' can only go through '1's. But once a '0' is behind a '2', can it ever get past?\n\nNo, because '0' can't directly swap with '2's. So, the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. Or wait, maybe not. Let's think of a longer example.\n\nSuppose the string is '021'. Can we rearrange it?\n\nThe allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and 1 and 2. So initially, the string is '0','2','1'.\n\nCan the '0' move past the '2'? Well, the '0' is at position 0, '2' is at position 1. They can't swap. So the '0' can't get past the '2' in this case. So the string remains '021' as the minimal possible.\n\nWait, but another example: '210'. How can we process this?\n\nWe can swap the '1' and '0' to get '201', then swap '0' and '2'—no, wait, '0' can't swap with '2'. So, the '0' is stuck before the '2's.\n\nWait, so perhaps the conclusion is that '0's can only appear before '2's in the final string. Because any '0' can't pass a '2' via the allowed swaps. So the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\nSimilarly, within the '1's and '0's, the '0's can be reordered among themselves, but only by moving through '1's. Wait, but '0's can be swapped with '1's, so any '0's can be moved to any position relative to each other, as long as they don't have '2's in between.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nFor each '0', all the '1's that come after it can be swapped with it, allowing the '0's to be moved to the left past '1's. Similarly, '1's can be moved to the left past '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that all '0's can be moved to the left as much as possible, then all '1's can be moved to the left as much as possible, while keeping the '0's before '1's and '1's before '2's.\n\nWait, but the '1's can't necessarily all be moved past '2's because of the '0's in the way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string is achieved by moving all '0's as far left as possible, then all '1's as far left as possible, while respecting the constraints that '0's can't cross '2's and '1's can't cross '2's.\n\nWait, but the '1's can cross '0's, but '0's can't cross '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to separate the string into three groups: '0's, '1's, and '2's, and then arrange them such that all '0's come first, then '1's, then '2's. But that might not always be possible due to the swap restrictions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string is determined by the following rules:\n\n1. All '0's must appear before any '2's, because '0's can't pass '2's.\n\n2. Among the '0's and '1's, '0's can be arranged in any order relative to each other, but since '0's are lex smaller, we want them as left as possible.\n\n3. Similarly, among the '1's and '2's, '1's can be arranged in any order relative to each other, but again, we want them as left as possible.\n\nWait, but in the first point, since '0's can't pass '2's, their relative order must be preserved. So if a '0' appears after a '2' in the original string, it can't be moved before the '2's. So that's a problem.\n\nSo, the key is that for any '0' in the string, all '2's that come before it must remain before it. Because you can't swap a '0' past a '2'.\n\nSimilarly, for '1's, since they can be swapped with '0's and '2's, perhaps their relative positions can be adjusted.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to process the string and for each character, determine the earliest possible position it can reach given the constraints.\n\nSo, for '0's, they can only move to the left past '1's, but can't move past '2's. So, for each '0' in the string, its earliest possible position is determined by the number of '0's and '1's to its left that can be moved past.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two separate passes:\n\n1. First, process the '0's, moving them as far left as possible, considering that they can only be swapped with '1's.\n\n2. Then, process the '1's, moving them as far left as possible, considering that they can be swapped with '0's and '2's.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the order of processing.\n\nAnother idea: since '0's can be swapped with '1's, and '1's can be swapped with '2's, perhaps the entire string can be considered as a series where '0's can be moved to the left past '1's, but '2's can't interfere with that. Similarly, '1's can be moved to the left past '0's and '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string will have all '0's first, followed by all '1's, then all '2's. But that's only possible if the original string has all '0's before '2's.\n\nOtherwise, if some '0's are after '2's, those '0's can't be moved before the '2's. So, the minimal string would have those '0's stuck after the '2's.\n\nSo, the minimal string is built by:\n\n- All '0's that are before any '2's in the original string, arranged in their order relative to each other, but as left as possible.\n\n- Then, the '1's, which can be arranged to the left as much as possible, but without crossing '0's or '2's.\n\nWait, but '1's can cross '0's, so perhaps the '0's can be moved left past '1's, and '1's can be moved left past '0's and '2's.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem differently. Since the allowed swaps allow '0's to move past '1's, but not '2's. So, the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. So, any '0' that comes after a '2' in the original string can't be moved before that '2'.\n\nSo, the first thing to do is to split the string into two parts: the part before the first '2', and the part from the first '2' onwards.\n\nIn the part before the first '2', we can process the '0's and '1's to arrange them in the lex smallest order.\n\nIn the part from the first '2' onwards, we can only have '2's, '1's, and any '0's that were originally after the first '2'. But those '0's can't be moved before the '2's, so they'll remain in their relative order.\n\nWait, but if a '0' is after the first '2' in the original string, can it ever be moved before the '2'? No, because '0's can't be swapped with '2's directly, and since there's a '2' before it, any '0's after the first '2' are stuck behind.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n1. Process the string from left to right, keeping track of the positions where '2's occur.\n\n2. For each segment between two '2's (or the start/end), collect all '0's and '1's, and arrange them in the lex smallest order.\n\nBecause within each such segment, we can arrange the '0's and '1's as desired.\n\nWait, yes! Because in each such segment (which is a substring that doesn't contain '2's), the '0's and '1's can be freely swapped as per the allowed operations. So, the lex smallest arrangement for that segment is the one with all '0's as far left as possible, followed by '1's.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n- Split the original string into runs separated by '2's.\n\n- For each run, process the characters as follows: count the number of '0's and '1's, then create a string with all '0's followed by all '1's.\n\n- Reassemble these processed runs, interleaved with the '2's in their original positions.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because the '2's are fixed in their positions relative to the runs. So, for example, if the string is '012201', the runs are ['01', '201'].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the runs are the parts between the '2's. So, in '012201', the '2's are at position 2 and 5 (assuming 0-based). So the runs are:\n\n- Before the first '2': '01'\n\n- Between the first and second '2's: '2' is at index 2, then the next '2' is at index 5. So the part between is '20' and '1'? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to split the string into tokens where each token is either a '2' or a sequence of non-'2's.\n\nSo for '012201', the tokens are ['0','1','2','2','0','1']? No, wait, perhaps I should consider the string as a list of runs, each run being a group of '0's and '1's, separated by '2's.\n\nSo for '012201', the groups are:\n\n- '01' (before the first '2')\n\n- '2' (the first '2')\n\n- '0' (after the first '2', before the next '2')\n\n- '21' (after the second '2')\n\nWait, no. The string is '0','1','2','2','0','1'. So the groups between '2's are '01', '' (because the first '2' is followed by another '2'), '0','1'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the string into a list where each element is either a '2' or a string of '0's and '1's.\n\nSo, for '012201', the split would be:\n\n['01', '2', '2', '01'].\n\nWait, no. Because the string is '0','1','2','2','0','1', so the groups are:\n\n- '0','1' → group 1\n\n- '2' → group 2\n\n- '2' → group 3\n\n- '0','1' → group4\n\nWait, but that's not correct because group 3 is just a single '2'. Alternatively, perhaps the split is done by taking all non-'2's as a group, and each '2' as a separate group.\n\nSo for '012201', the split would be:\n\nGroup 0: '01'\n\nGroup 1: '2'\n\nGroup 2: '2'\n\nGroup 3: '01'\n\nWait, but that's not right because the group 0 is before any '2's, group1 is a '2', group2 is another '2', group3 is after the last '2'.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Iterate through the string, and whenever a '2' is found, split the current run (if any) and add it as a group. Then add the '2' as a separate group.\n\n- After the loop, add any remaining run.\n\nOnce the groups are identified, for each group of '0's and '1's, we can process it to produce the lex smallest possible string for that group, which is all '0's followed by all '1's.\n\nThen, the overall minimal string is constructed by concatenating all the processed groups and the '2's in their original positions.\n\nWait, but the '2's are already part of the groups, so in the example above, the groups after processing would be:\n\nGroup0: '01' → processed to '00... no, wait, group0 is '0','1' → processed as '0' followed by '1's → '01' remains as is.\n\nGroup1: '2' → remains as is.\n\nGroup2: '2' → remains as is.\n\nGroup3: '0','1' → processed to '01'.\n\nSo the resulting string is '01' + '2' + '2' + '01' → '012201', which is the same as the original. But perhaps in another example, the groups would change.\n\nWait, let's take the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: '100210'\n\nSample Output: '001120'\n\nProcessing this:\n\nSplit into groups:\n\nLooking at '100210':\n\nThe '2's are at position 3 (0-based). So the string is:\n\nFirst, up to the first '2': '100'.\n\nThen, the '2' → group.\n\nThen, the remaining part: '10'.\n\nSo the groups are ['100', '2', '10'].\n\nProcessing each group:\n\nGroup0: '100' → '0's followed by '1's. So count the '0's: 2, '1's: 1 → '0011'.\n\nGroup1: '2' → remains.\n\nGroup2: '10' → '0' followed by '1' → '01'.\n\nSo the new string is '0011' + '2' + '01' → '001120', which matches the sample output.\n\nYes! So this approach works for the first sample.\n\nAnother sample: '20' → the output is '20'.\n\nBecause the group is '2', then '0' → but wait, no. Wait, the string is '2','0'.\n\nWhen processing, the first group is '2' → remains as is.\n\nThen, the next group is '0' → but since it's after a '2', it can't be moved before the '2'. So the processed string is '2' followed by '0' → '20'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample: '11222121' → the output is '11112222'.\n\nProcessing this:\n\nThe string is '1','1','2','2','2','1','2','1'.\n\nSo, the groups are:\n\nFirst, before the first '2': '11'.\n\nThen, each '2' is a separate group.\n\nThen, after the last '2', the remaining is '1'.\n\nSo groups are ['11', '2', '2', '2', '1'].\n\nProcessing each group:\n\nGroup0: '11' → processed as '11' (all '1's).\n\nGroup1: '2' → remains.\n\nGroup2: '2' → remains.\n\nGroup3: '2' → remains.\n\nGroup4: '1' → remains.\n\nSo the processed string is '11' + '2' + '2' + '2' + '1' → but wait, that's '112221'.\n\nWait, that doesn't match the sample output. Oh wait, no. Wait, the sample output is '11112222'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in splitting the groups.\n\nWait, the string is '11222121'.\n\nLet's see the indices:\n\nIndices 0-1: '1's → group0 is '11'.\n\nIndex 2: '2' → group1.\n\nIndex3: '2' → group2.\n\nIndex4: '2' → group3.\n\nIndex5: '1' → group4.\n\nIndex6: '2' → group5.\n\nIndex7: '1' → group6.\n\nWait, no, because the string is '11222121', which is 8 characters.\n\nWait, the groups are formed by splitting on '2's, each '2' is a group.\n\nSo the string is:\n\ngroup0: '11' → before first '2'.\n\ngroup1: '2'.\n\ngroup2: '22' → after group1 and group2 (but wait, group1 is '2', group2 is the next '2's).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the groups are formed.\n\nWait, the string is '1','1','2','2','2','1','2','1'.\n\nSo, the first '2' is at index 2. So group0 is '11'.\n\nThen, group1 is '2'.\n\nThen, the next character is another '2' (index3) → but since it's a '2', it's a separate group.\n\nWait, no. Because in the splitting logic, each '2' is a separate group, and the non-'2's form groups between the '2's.\n\nSo, the groups are:\n\ngroup0: '11' → before first '2'.\n\ngroup1: '2' → first '2'.\n\ngroup2: '22' → '2's after group1, until next '2' is found.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the next character after group1 is another '2' (at index3), so group1 is just '2', then group2 is '2' (index3), then group3 is '2' (index4), then group4 is '1' (index5), group5 is '2' (index6), group6 is '1' (index7).\n\nWait, that seems to complicate things. But according to the earlier approach, each '2' is a separate group, and the non-'2's between '2's form their own groups.\n\nWait, but in the string '11222121', the '2's are at positions 2,3,4,6.\n\nSo, the groups would be:\n\nGroup0: '11' → before first '2' at position 2.\n\nGroup1: '2' → position2.\n\nGroup2: '2' → position3.\n\nGroup3: '2' → position4.\n\nGroup4: '1' → position5.\n\nGroup5: '2' → position6.\n\nGroup6: '1' → position7.\n\nSo, each '2' is a separate group, and the non-'2's are grouped into the segments before, between, and after the '2's.\n\nSo, processing each group:\n\nGroup0: '11' → processed as '11' → all '1's.\n\nGroup1: '2' → remains.\n\nGroup2: '2' → remains.\n\nGroup3: '2' → remains.\n\nGroup4: '1' → remains.\n\nGroup5: '2' → remains.\n\nGroup6: '1' → remains.\n\nSo, the processed string is '11' + '2' + '2' + '2' + '1' + '2' + '1' → '11222121', which is the same as the input. But the sample output is '11112222'.\n\nWait, that suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this indicates that my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that I'm treating each '2' as a separate group, but that's not necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps the groups should be the sequences of '0's and '1's between the '2's, plus the '2's themselves as separate groups. So, for '11222121', the groups are:\n\nGroup0: '11' → before first '2'.\n\nGroup1: '222' → the '2's in a single group.\n\nGroup2: '1' → after the '2's.\n\nWait, no, because the '2's are consecutive, but each is a separate group.\n\nWait, no, in the splitting approach, each '2' is a separate group, regardless of whether they are consecutive.\n\nBut perhaps that's the problem. Because in the sample input, the '2's are consecutive, but in the output, they are all grouped together, followed by '1's.\n\nSo, perhaps the grouping approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the '2's can be moved among themselves. Because, '1's can be swapped with '2's. So, '2's can be reordered among themselves.\n\nWait, but according to the allowed swaps, '1's can be swapped with '2's, but '2's can't be directly swapped with each other. So, for example, '2's can't be reordered among themselves unless there's a '1' between them.\n\nWait, but if a '2' is followed by another '2', then they can't be swapped. So, the relative order of consecutive '2's is fixed.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial grouping approach is not sufficient because it doesn't account for the fact that '2's can be reordered through '1's.\n\nWait, for example, in the string '212', the '2's can't swap, but perhaps the '1' can be moved between them. So, '212' can be transformed into '122' or '221'?\n\nWait, no, because the '1' is between the '2's. So, to get '122', you need to swap the first '2' and '1', which is allowed. Then, the '1' is now before the '2's. But the second '2' is stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the '1' can be moved between the '2's, but the '2's can't be reordered beyond that.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the string as consisting of three separate lists:\n\n- Zeros: which can be moved past '1's but not '2's.\n\n- Ones: which can be moved past '0's and '2's, but not '2's directly.\n\n- Twos: which can't be moved past anything else.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. '1's can be moved past '0's and '2's because they can swap with both. So, perhaps the '1's can be reordered among themselves and with '0's and '2's, but the '0's can't move past '2's.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string is obtained by:\n\n- All '0's that appear before any '2's can be arranged in any order relative to each other, as they can be moved past '1's.\n\n- All '1's can be arranged before any '2's, but the '1's can't move past '2's.\n\nWait, but the '1's can be moved past '2's if there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the '1's can be moved to the left past '2's, but the '0's can't.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nMaybe it's better to try to model the problem as follows:\n\nEach '0' can be moved past any number of '1's to the left, but can't move past any '2's.\n\nEach '1' can be moved past '0's and '2's, but '1's can't move past each other unless there's a '0' or '2' in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the '1's can be moved past each other via '0's or '2's.\n\nWait, no: for example, in the string '121', the '1's can be swapped with each other if they are adjacent. So, '121' can be rearranged to '211' or '112' via swaps.\n\nWait, but the allowed swaps are between '0' and '1's, or '1' and '2's. So, '1's can be swapped with each other only if they have a '0' or '2' between them, allowing them to move past each other.\n\nWait, for example, '12' can be swapped to '21', and then '21' can't be swapped back because the allowed swaps are only '1' and '2' adjacent. So, '12' can become '21'.\n\nBut '1's can't be directly swapped with each other, but they can be moved past each other via '2's or '0's.\n\nSo, perhaps the '1's can be reordered among themselves, but the '0's can't move past '2's.\n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to process the string by greedily moving each '0' as far left as possible, and each '1' as far left as possible, considering the constraints.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each '0' in the string, move it as far left as possible, past any '1's that are to its right.\n\nBut '0's can't move past '2's.\n\n2. For each '1' in the string, move it as far left as possible, past any '0's and '2's that are to its right.\n\nBut '1's can't move past '2's directly unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, but '1's can be moved past '2's by first moving the '1' past any '0's and then past the '2's.\n\nThis is getting really complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe minimal string will have all '0's as far left as possible, followed by all '1's as far left as possible, followed by all '2's as far left as possible.\n\nBut this isn't always possible due to the constraints on swaps.\n\nWait, but perhaps the '0's can be arranged in any order relative to each other, and similarly for the '1's and '2's, but the '0's can't cross '2's and '1's can't cross '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to split the string into three parts:\n\n- The prefix consisting of '0's and '1's that are before any '2's.\n\n- The suffix consisting of '1's and '2's that are after any '0's.\n\nWait, no, because the '0's can't be moved past '2's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string can be built by processing each character and determining whether it can be moved to the left past certain characters.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps the initial approach of splitting into runs separated by '2's and processing each run to have all '0's followed by '1's is correct.\n\nWait, in the sample input '11222121', according to the initial approach, the groups are:\n\nGroup0: '11' → processed as '11'.\n\nGroup1: '2' → processed as '2'.\n\nGroup2: '2' → '2'.\n\nGroup3: '2' → '2'.\n\nGroup4: '1' → '1'.\n\nGroup5: '2' → '2'.\n\nGroup6: '1' → '1'.\n\nSo the processed string is '11' + '2' + '2' + '2' + '1' + '2' + '1' → '11222121', which doesn't match the sample output.\n\nBut the sample output is '11112222'.\n\nSo the initial approach is not sufficient.\n\nSo, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the grouping is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the string '11222121', the '2's are at positions 2,3,4,6.\n\nSo, the groups are:\n\n- Group0: '11' → before first '2'.\n\n- Group1: '2' → position2.\n\n- Group2: '2' → position3.\n\n- Group3: '2' → position4.\n\n- Group4: '1' → position5.\n\n- Group5: '2' → position6.\n\n- Group6: '1' → position7.\n\nSo, each '2' is a group.\n\nBut perhaps this is wrong because the '1's after a '2' can be moved past the '2's via the allowed swaps.\n\nWait, for example, the '1' at position5 can be moved past the '2' at position6, but how?\n\nBecause '1' can be swapped with '2's, so the '1' can move to the left of the '2' at position6.\n\nSo, in the string '11222121', the '1's after the '2's can be moved to the left of the '2's.\n\nThus, the '1's after '2's can be moved past the '2's and arranged before them.\n\nThis suggests that the grouping approach is incorrect because it treats each '2' as a fixed group, but in reality, '1's can move past '2's, allowing '1's to be reordered before '2's.\n\nSo, this invalidates the initial approach.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct way is to process the entire string, allowing '0's and '1's to move past each other and '1's to move past '2's, but '0's can't move past '2's.\n\nSo, the '0's can be moved to the left past '1's, and the '1's can be moved to the left past '0's and '2's.\n\nSo, the minimal string is achieved by arranging all '0's as left as possible, then all '1's as left as possible, then all '2's as left as possible.\n\nBut how to achieve this.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is as follows:\n\n- For each '0' in the string, move it as far left as possible, only past '1's.\n\n- For each '1' in the string, move it as far left as possible, past '0's and '2's.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, since '0's can be swapped with '1's, they can be reordered among themselves, but cannot pass '2's.\n\nSimilarly, '1's can be swapped with '0's and '2's, so they can be reordered among themselves and with '0's and '2's.\n\nSo, the '0's can be moved to their leftmost possible positions, but can't cross '2's.\n\nThe '1's can be moved to their leftmost possible positions, which may involve moving past '0's and '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\n1. Process the string by moving all '0's as far left as possible, but not crossing any '2's.\n\n2. Then, process the '1's, moving them as far left as possible, even if it means moving past '2's.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a greedy algorithm where:\n\n- We iterate through the string from left to right.\n\n- For each character, if it's a '0', we try to move it as far left as possible, past any '1's.\n\n- If it's a '1', we try to move it as far left as possible, past any '0's and '2's.\n\n- '2's are kept in their relative positions, but '1's can move past them.\n\nWait, but how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to construct the result string by building it step by step, deciding whether each character can be moved to the left past certain others.\n\nBut for a string of length up to 1e5, we need an O(n) solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: The minimal string will have all '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's. But the '0's can't cross '2's, and '1's can cross '2's.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Collect all the '0's, '1's, and '2's.\n\n2. Arrange the '0's as early as possible, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nBut ensuring that '0's are not placed before '2's unless they were originally before.\n\nWait, but this is not correct, as '0's can't cross '2's.\n\nSo, the correct arrangement would be:\n\n- All '0's that are before any '2's in the original string, arranged in any order relative to each other.\n\n- Then, all '1's that are before any '2's in the original string, arranged in any order relative to each other.\n\n- Then, all '2's, followed by any '1's and '0's that come after the first '2' in the original string.\n\nWait, but that might not capture the cases where '1's can be moved past '2's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- All '0's that are before any '2's can be moved to the front, in any order.\n\n- All '1's can be moved to the front, regardless of whether they are before or after '2's.\n\nBut '0's can't be moved past '2's.\n\nWait, but '1's can be moved past '2's, so all '1's can be moved to the front, even if they are after '2's.\n\nSo, the minimal string would consist of:\n\nAll '0's (in their original order, but moved as far left as possible), followed by all '1's (also in their original order, but moved as far left as possible), followed by all '2's (in their original order, but moved as far left as possible).\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because '0's can't move past '2's.\n\nWait, but '0's can't move past '2's, so the '0's that are before any '2's can be arranged as left as possible, but '0's after '2's can't be moved before the '2's.\n\nSo, the correct order is:\n\nThe '0's that are before any '2's can be arranged first, then the '1's (including those before and after '2's), then the '2's.\n\nWait, but '1's can be moved past '2's, so the '1's that are after '2's can be moved before the '2's.\n\nSo, in the minimal string, all '0's are first, then all '1's, then all '2's.\n\nBut how to arrange the '0's and '1's.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Split the string into two parts: the part before the first '2', and the part from the first '2' onwards.\n\n2. In the part before the first '2', collect all '0's and '1's. Sort them to have '0's first, then '1's.\n\n3. In the part from the first '2' onwards, collect all '1's and '0's, sort them to have '0's first, then '1's. But wait, '0's after '2's can",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1' or between adjacent '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that '0's can be reordered among themselves and with '1's, but cannot move past '2's.
