Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about matching left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. Each boot has a color which is a lowercase letter or '?'. Two boots are compatible if they are the same specific color, or one is '?'.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible. Also, each boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\nThe input gives two strings, l for left boots and r for right boots, each of length n.\n\nI need to output the maximum number of pairs and list them in some order.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the constraints: n can be up to 150,000, so any O(n^2) approach is out of the question. We need something efficient, probably O(n) or O(n log n).\n\nSo, the challenge is to find as many compatible pairs as possible, ensuring that each left and right boot is used only once.\n\nWait, but how? Because for each left boot, we need to find a right boot that's compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut considering all possibilities directly would be too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: group the left and right boots by their color (or '?'), and then for each possible color combination, calculate how many pairs can be formed between lefts of that color and rights of another compatible color.\n\nWait, but that might not capture the maximum correctly because some combinations could allow multiple pairings.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to model this as a bipartite graph where each left boot is connected to all right boots that are compatible with it. Then, the maximum matching in this graph would give the answer. But with n up to 1.5e5, building such a graph isn't feasible due to memory constraints.\n\nSo, I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me consider the counts of each color in left and right. For each possible color c, count the number of lefts and rights that can form a compatible pair.\n\nBut wait, the compatibility depends on whether both are the same, or one is '?'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should categorize each boot into its color type: specific (like 'a') or wildcard ('?'). Then, when matching, a specific left can only pair with specific rights of the same color, or with wildcard rights. A wildcard left can pair with any right.\n\nWait, but the pairing is more about individual boots than just the counts. Because each left is unique, and each right is unique. So, perhaps the way to maximize the pairs is to:\n\n1. Use as many wildcard lefts as possible to pair with any right, including wildcards.\n2. Then, for the remaining lefts (specific), pair them with specific rights of the same color.\n3. Also, use the wildcards in the rights for the specific lefts.\n\nBut how do I structure this?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about it as:\n\n- All wildcard lefts can pair with any right, including wildcards.\n- Specific lefts can pair with specific rights of the same color, or with wildcards.\n\nWait, but the problem is that using a wildcard right might prevent other specific lefts from pairing, since each right can be used once.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach: The problem is similar to the bipartite matching problem, but with a certain structure. Since each left must be matched to exactly one right, and vice versa, perhaps the maximum matching can be found by considering the following steps:\n\n1. First, process all the wildcard lefts and assign them to any available right that hasn't been paired yet. This includes both specific and wildcard rights.\n\n2. Then, process the specific lefts and assign them to specific rights of the same color, or to any remaining wildcard rights.\n\nWait, but this might not always yield the maximum. Maybe sometimes it's better to save some wildcard rights for later.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem as follows:\n\nWe have two sets:\n\n- L: list of left boots, each can be either specific (c) or wildcard (?).\n- R: list of right boots, each can be specific or wildcard.\n\nWe need to match as many L[i] to R[j] as possible, such that L[i] is compatible with R[j], and each i and j are used once.\n\nLet me represent the counts of each type:\n\nFor lefts:\n- count_l[c] = number of lefts with color c.\n- count_l_wild = number of lefts with color '?'.\n\nSimilarly for rights:\n- count_r[c] = number of rights with color c.\n- count_r_wild = number of rights with color '?'.\n\nNow, the total possible pairs can be broken down into:\n\n1. Pairs where left is specific and right is specific, same color.\n   For each c, the minimum of count_l[c] and count_r[c].\n\n2. Pairs where left is specific and right is wildcard.\n   The number here is the number of specific lefts minus the ones already paired in step 1, multiplied by count_r_wild (but each right can be used once).\n\n3. Pairs where left is wildcard and right is specific.\n   Similarly, after considering step 1 and 2, the remaining wildcard rights can be paired with any wildcard lefts.\n\n4. Pairs where both are wildcards.\n\nWait, but this approach may not capture all possibilities optimally. Because sometimes it's better to pair a specific left with a wildcard right, leaving a specific right for another specific left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum of:\n\na) The number of pairs between specific lefts and specific rights of the same color.\n\nb) The number of pairs between specific lefts and wildcard rights.\n\nc) The number of pairs between wildcard lefts and any rights (wildcard or specific).\n\nd) The number of pairs between wildcard lefts and wildcard rights, but this would require that these are not covered by other options.\n\nWait, but this might not add up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- The number of pairs formed by specific lefts and specific rights of the same color.\n\n- Plus the number of specific lefts that can be paired with wildcard rights.\n\n- Plus the number of wildcard lefts that can be paired with the remaining wildcard rights.\n\n- Plus the number of wildcard lefts that can be paired with specific rights that couldn't be paired before.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. It's getting a bit tangled.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that:\n\nEach wildcard left can pair with any right (either specific or wildcard). So, perhaps the strategy is to first pair as many specific lefts and specific rights as possible, then use the remaining specific lefts to pair with wildcards, and the remaining wildcards to pair with the remaining (specific or wildcard) rights.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about it as a resource allocation problem.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Specific lefts: S_L\n- Wildcard lefts: W_L\n\nSpecific rights: S_R\nWildcard rights: W_R\n\nEach specific left can pair with specific rights of the same color, or with wildcard rights.\n\nEach wildcard left can pair with any right (specific or wildcard).\n\nEach right can be used once.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs is the maximum possible matching under these constraints.\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute the maximum possible as:\n\nmax_pairs = min(S_L + W_L, S_R + W_R)\n\nBecause each pair uses one left and one right, so the maximum possible is the minimum of the total lefts and total rights.\n\nBut then, within that limit, we need to arrange the pairs optimally.\n\nBut even knowing that, how do we compute the actual pairs?\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is:\n\n1. First, for each specific color c, pair as many S_L[c] with S_R[c]. The number of such pairs is min(S_L[c], S_R[c]).\n\n2. Subtract these from S_L and S_R.\n\n3. Then, for the remaining S_L (sum of all S_L[c] minus those used in step 1), we can pair them with W_R and W_R.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's not the best way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should pair the specific lefts with wildcards first.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to pair specific lefts with wildcards before using specific rights, because that might leave more specific rights for other specific lefts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as:\n\n- Let A be the set of pairs between specific lefts and specific rights of the same color. The number is sum over c of min(l_c, r_c).\n\n- Let B be the number of specific lefts that can pair with wildcards.\n\n- Let C be the number of wildcard lefts that can pair with the remaining specific or wildcard rights.\n\nBut it's unclear.\n\nAnother idea: The problem is similar to bipartite matching, but the edges are based on the color compatibility.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, we can't construct the graph explicitly.\n\nSo, perhaps an alternative approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible pairs is the sum of:\n\n- The number of specific pairs (same color) as in step 1.\n\n- Plus the number of specific lefts that can pair with wildcards.\n\n- Plus the number of wildcard lefts that can pair with any remaining rights (specific or wildcards).\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let me try to structure the solution:\n\n1. Compute for each color c, the number of specific lefts (l_c) and specific rights (r_c). The number of pairs for same-color is s = min(l_c, r_c). Add s to the result. Subtract s from l_c and r_c.\n\n2. Now, for the remaining specific lefts (sum of all l_c), and the remaining specific rights (sum of all r_c), plus the wildcard rights (W_R), we can pair:\n\n   a. The remaining specific lefts can be paired with wildcard rights. Let x = min(sum(l_c), W_R). Add x to the result. Subtract x from sum(l_c) and W_R.\n\n   b. The remaining specific lefts can also be paired among themselves, but wait, they are specific but different colors. No, because a specific left can only pair with specific rights of the same color, which we've already handled.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, after step 1, the remaining specific lefts can only pair with wildcard rights.\n\nThen, the remaining wildcard lefts can pair with any remaining specific rights or wildcard rights.\n\nSo, after step 1:\n\nsum_l = sum of l_c (remaining specific lefts)\nsum_r = sum of r_c (remaining specific rights)\nw_r = W_R (wildcard rights remaining after step 1)\n\nWe can pair sum_l with w_r: x = min(sum_l, w_r). Add x.\n\nSubtract x from sum_l and w_r.\n\nThen, the remaining sum_l is 0, and the remaining w_r is 0.\n\nThen, the wildcard lefts (W_L) can pair with any remaining specific rights or wildcard rights.\n\nWait, but what's left?\n\nAfter step 1 and 2a, the remaining rights are:\n\nsum_r (specific rights not paired in step 1)\nplus any specific rights that were not used.\n\nWait, no. After step 1, sum_r is the remaining specific rights (sum of all r_c minus those used in step 1).\n\nIn step 2a, we used x = min(sum_l, w_r) pairs, so now sum_l -= x, w_r -=x.\n\nBut after that, the remaining w_r is zero, because we used as much as possible.\n\nSo, the remaining rights are sum_r (specific) and the original W_R - w_r_used_in_step_2a.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in step 1, we subtracted the same-color pairs, leaving sum_l as sum(l_c) and sum_r as sum(r_c). Then in step 2a, we use x = min(sum_l, w_r) pairs, where w_r is the original W_R.\n\nWait, no. In step 1, after pairing same colors, the W_R is untouched. So, in step 2a, we can pair the remaining sum_l with W_R.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, after step 2a, the W_R is reduced by x, and sum_l is reduced by x.\n\nBut wait, sum_l is the sum of the remaining specific lefts. So, if x is min(sum_l, W_R), then sum_l becomes sum_l - x, and W_R becomes W_R - x.\n\nThen, after that, the remaining rights are sum_r (specific) and (W_R - x) (wildcard) is now zero.\n\nWait, no: step 2a uses up W_R. So after step 2a, the remaining W_R is zero.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 2a, we're pairing specific lefts with wildcard rights. So, the W_R is the original count, and after using x, it's W_R - x.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 2a, we're using W_R to pair with the remaining specific lefts. So, yes.\n\nBut then, after step 2a, the remaining W_R is W_R - x.\n\nBut then, in the next step, we can pair wildcard lefts (W_L) with any remaining rights, which are sum_r (specific) and W_R - x (wildcard).\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nAfter step 2a, we have:\n\nsum_l = 0 (because we used all specific lefts in step 2a?)\n\nNo, no. Because sum_l was the sum of l_c after step 1, which is the remaining specific lefts. After step 2a, x is min(sum_l, W_R), so sum_l is sum_l - x.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nsum_l = 5, W_R = 3.\n\nx=3. So, sum_l becomes 2, W_R becomes 0.\n\nThen, the remaining rights are sum_r (from step 1) and 0 wildcard rights.\n\nSo, now, the wildcard lefts can pair with the sum_r and any remaining wildcard rights.\n\nWait, but in this case, W_R is zero.\n\nSo, the wildcard lefts can only pair with sum_r (specific rights).\n\nBut since the wildcard lefts can pair with any specific right, the maximum is min(W_L, sum_r).\n\nSo, step 2b: y = min(W_L, sum_r). Add y to the result.\n\nThen, subtract y from W_L and sum_r.\n\nWhat about the remaining W_R (wildcard rights)? They can be paired with the remaining W_L (wildcard lefts). Because a wildcard left can pair with a wildcard right.\n\nWait, but after step 2a, W_R is zero. So, no more wildcard rights left.\n\nSo, in that case, no more pairs can be formed from W_L and W_R.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each color c, pair min(l_c, r_c) specific pairs. Sum these, call it same_color_pairs.\n\n2. sum_l = sum of l_c - same_color_pairs (since each l_c contributes min(l_c, r_c) to same_color_pairs).\n\nWait, no. Actually, after step 1, for each c, l_c and r_c are reduced by same_color_pairs for that color.\n\nSo, for all c, l_c' = l_c - min(l_c, r_c), and r_c' = r_c - min(l_c, r_c).\n\nsum_l = sum(l_c') for all c.\n\nsum_r = sum(r_c') for all c.\n\n3. Now, the remaining specific lefts (sum_l) can be paired with wildcard rights (W_R). So, x = min(sum_l, W_R).\n\nAdd x to the total.\n\nSubtract x from sum_l and W_R.\n\n4. Now, the remaining specific rights (sum_r) can be paired with the remaining wildcard lefts (W_L). So, y = min(W_L, sum_r).\n\nAdd y to the total.\n\nSubtract y from W_L and sum_r.\n\n5. Finally, the remaining wildcard lefts (W_L - y) can be paired with the remaining wildcard rights (W_R - x). The number of such pairs is z = min(W_L - y, W_R - x).\n\nAdd z to the total.\n\nSubtract z from W_L and W_R.\n\nWait, but after step 4, W_L may still have some left, and W_R may have some left.\n\nBut these can form pairs because both are wildcards.\n\nSo, the total steps are:\n\ntotal_pairs = same_color_pairs + x + y + z.\n\nBut wait, this may not capture all possibilities, but perhaps this approach can lead to the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order of steps affects the outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps the order in which we process the steps can affect the total.\n\nFor example:\n\nSuppose we have:\n\nsum_l = 10, sum_r = 5, W_R = 15.\n\nIn step 2a, we pair 5 (min(10,15)).\n\nThen, sum_l becomes 5, W_R becomes 10.\n\nIn step 2b, we pair min(5, 5) =5. So, sum_r becomes 0, W_L becomes 0.\n\nBut perhaps if instead, in step 2a, we pair 5, and in step 2b, we pair 5, leading to 10 pairs, but in reality, perhaps pairing more in step 2a and less in step 2b might not be optimal.\n\nWait, perhaps the order doesn't matter because it's the sum of all possibilities.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is indeed the sum of same_color_pairs + x + y + z, as defined above.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of specific lefts per color, and the number of wildcard lefts.\n\nSame for rights.\n\n2. Compute same_color_pairs: for each color c, the minimum of l_c and r_c.\n\n3. Update l_c and r_c by subtracting same_color_pairs for each color.\n\n4. Compute sum_l = sum of l_c across all c.\n\n5. Compute x = min(sum_l, W_R). Add x to the total.\n\n6. Update sum_l -=x, W_R -=x.\n\n7. Compute y = min(W_L, sum_r). Add y.\n\n8. Update W_L -=y, sum_r -=y.\n\n9. Compute z = min(W_L, W_R). Add z.\n\n10. Update W_L -=z, W_R -=z.\n\nSo, the total is same_color_pairs +x +y +z.\n\nBut wait, this may not capture all possible pairs, because in some cases, it's better to pair some specific lefts with specific rights first, and then use wildcards, etc.\n\nBut perhaps this approach will work.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, create frequency dictionaries for left and right.\n\nFor lefts:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nl_counts = defaultdict(int)\nw_l = 0\n\nfor c in l:\n    if c == '?':\n        w_l +=1\n    else:\n        l_counts[c] +=1\n\nSimilarly for rights:\n\nr_counts = defaultdict(int)\nw_r =0\n\nfor c in r:\n    if c == '?':\n        w_r +=1\n    else:\n        r_counts[c] +=1\n\nThen, compute same_color_pairs.\n\nsame_color_pairs = 0\n\nfor c in l_counts:\n    if c in r_counts:\n        same_color_pairs += min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])\n\nThen, update l_counts and r_counts.\n\nBut wait, for each c in l_counts, if c is also in r_counts, we take the min and add to same_color_pairs.\n\nThen, for each c in l_counts, subtract the min from l_counts[c] and r_counts[c].\n\nBut this is tricky because, after that, l_counts and r_counts may have some entries with zero, which we can remove.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\n# compute same_color_pairs\nsame_color_pairs = 0\n# make a copy of the keys to avoid modifying during iteration\nfor c in list(l_counts.keys()):\n    if c in r_counts:\n        same_color_pairs += min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])\n        # subtract from both\n        if l_counts[c] >= r_counts[c]:\n            del r_counts[c]\n        else:\n            del l_counts[c]\n\nBut wait, no. Because after the subtraction, if one is zero, we can delete the key.\n\nWait, for example, if l_counts[c] was 5, r_counts[c] was 3. We add 3 to same_color_pairs, and then l_counts[c] becomes 2, r_counts[c] becomes 0. So, we can delete r_counts[c], and keep l_counts[c] as 2.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nfor c in list(l_counts.keys()):\n    if c in r_counts:\n        take = min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])\n        same_color_pairs += take\n        if l_counts[c] - take > 0:\n            l_counts[c] -= take\n        else:\n            del l_counts[c]\n        if r_counts[c] - take >0:\n            r_counts[c] -= take\n        else:\n            del r_counts[c]\n\nWait, no. Because if l_counts[c] is 5, r_counts[c] is 3. Then, same_color_pairs +=3. l_counts[c] becomes 2, r_counts[c] becomes 0. So, we delete r_counts[c], but l_counts[c] remains 2.\n\nBut in this case, in the next steps, the l_counts[c] will still be considered as 2 specific lefts of color c, which can be paired with wildcard rights.\n\nWait, but in the next steps, we are pairing the remaining specific lefts with wildcards.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nSo, after computing same_color_pairs, we can proceed.\n\nThen, sum_l is sum(l_counts.values())\n\nsum_r is sum(r_counts.values())\n\nCompute x = min(sum_l, w_r)\n\nAdd x to the total.\n\nsum_l -=x\n\nw_r -=x\n\nThen, compute y = min(w_l, sum_r)\n\nAdd y to the total.\n\nw_l -=y\n\nsum_r -=y\n\nThen, compute z = min(w_l, w_r)\n\nAdd z to the total.\n\nw_l -=z\n\nw_r -=z\n\nSo, total_pairs = same_color_pairs +x +y +z\n\nBut wait, what about the case where a specific left can pair with a specific right that's not of the same color? No, because in that case, the specific right would have a different color than the left, and they wouldn't be compatible unless one is a wildcard.\n\nSo, the initial same_color_pairs captures all possible same-color pairs.\n\nThen, the remaining specific lefts can only pair with wildcards, and the remaining wildcards can pair with any rights.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nBut now, how to collect the actual pairs.\n\nThat's the tricky part.\n\nBecause we need to track which left and right indexes are used.\n\nSo, the problem requires not just the count but the actual pairs.\n\nSo, the approach needs to collect the indices.\n\nThus, the previous approach works for the count, but for the actual selection of pairs, we need a different method.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each color c, pair as many same-color specific pairs as possible. For each such pair, note the left index and right index.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining specific lefts (those not used in same_color_pairs), pair them with the wildcard rights.\n\n3. Then, for the remaining wildcard lefts, pair them with the remaining specific rights.\n\n4. Finally, pair the remaining wildcard lefts and rights.\n\nBut again, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nWe need to collect the pairs, so perhaps we need to track the indices.\n\nAlternative idea: for each left and right, precompute which can be paired.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, this is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor the same_color_pairs, we can process each color c, and for each left and right in that color, pair them in order.\n\nBut how to get the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps for each color c, we can take the first k lefts and the first k rights, where k is the min of l_counts[c] and r_counts[c].\n\nBut how to track the indices.\n\nWait, for each left boot, we have its index (starting from 0 to n-1?), but the problem expects 1-based indices.\n\nSo, perhaps, for each color c:\n\nleft_indices = list of indices where l[i] == c, in order.\n\nright_indices = list of indices where r[i] == c, in order.\n\nThen, for each c, take the minimum of len(left_indices) and len(right_indices), say k.\n\nTake the first k left indices and first k right indices.\n\nThese form k pairs.\n\nOnce done, those left and right indices are marked as used.\n\nBut how to track used indices.\n\nThis is manageable.\n\nSo, let's structure this:\n\nCreate a list for each color, storing the indices of left and right.\n\nleft_per_color = defaultdict(list)\nright_per_color = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if l[i] == '?':\n        w_l +=1\n    else:\n        left_per_color[l[i]].append(i+1)  # assuming 1-based.\n\nSimilarly for r.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_per_color:\n\nif c is in right_per_color:\n\nk = min(len(left_per_color[c]), len(right_per_color[c]))\n\nsame_color_pairs +=k\n\nthen, take the first k left indices and k right indices.\n\nMark these indices as used.\n\nBut how? Perhaps create a set of used_left and used_right.\n\nused_left = set()\nused_right = set()\n\nfor each c in left_per_color:\n    if c in right_per_color:\n        k = min(len(left_per_color[c]), len(right_per_color[c]))\n        if k ==0:\n            continue\n        same_color_pairs +=k\n        # take the first k left indices\n        selected_left = left_per_color[c][:k]\n        selected_right = right_per_color[c][:k]\n        for l_idx in selected_left:\n            used_left.add(l_idx)\n        for r_idx in selected_right:\n            used_right.add(r_idx)\n        # remove processed entries\n        left_per_color[c] = left_per_color[c][k:]\n        right_per_color[c] = right_per_color[c][k:]\n\nWait, but this approach will only process the same_color_pairs.\n\nBut then, for the remaining specific lefts (those not in same_color_pairs), we need to pair them with wildcard rights.\n\nSo, the next step is to collect the remaining specific lefts (across all colors) that are not yet used.\n\nSimilarly, collect the remaining wildcard rights.\n\nSo:\n\nremaining_specific_lefts = []\nfor c in left_per_color:\n    if c not in right_per_color:\n        remaining_specific_lefts.extend(left_per_color[c])\n    else:\n        remaining_specific_lefts.extend(left_per_color[c][len(right_per_color[c]):])\n\nWait, no. Because for colors where c is in right_per_color, but after same_color_pairs, the left may still have some indices left.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to collect all left indices that haven't been used yet.\n\nSo, used_left is a set of all indices used in same_color_pairs.\n\nThen, for the remaining specific lefts:\n\nremaining_specific_lefts = []\nfor c in left_per_color:\n    if c in right_per_color:\n        remaining_specific_lefts.extend(left_per_color[c][k:])\n    else:\n        remaining_specific_lefts.extend(left_per_color[c])\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to iterate through all left indices, and see if they are not used.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, this is manageable.\n\nWait, but for the remaining specific lefts, their indices are known, and for the wildcard rights, their indices are in right_per_color['?'].\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor the same_color_pairs, collect the pairs as described.\n\nThen, collect the remaining specific lefts:\n\nremaining_specific_lefts = [i+1 for i in range(n) if (l[i] != '?' and (i+1) not in used_left)]\n\nWait, but checking for membership in a set is O(1), but for n=1.5e5, this would take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps precompute all the left and right indices, and track used flags.\n\nWait, perhaps for each index, track whether it's used.\n\nSo:\n\nused_left = [False] * (n+1)  # 1-based\nused_right = [False] * (n+1)\n\nThen, for same_color_pairs:\n\nfor each c in left_per_color:\n    if c in right_per_color:\n        k = min(...)\n        for i in range(k):\n            l_idx = left_per_color[c][i]\n            r_idx = right_per_color[c][i]\n            used_left[l_idx] = True\n            used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nThen, for the remaining specific lefts:\n\nremaining_specific_lefts = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if not used_left[i] and l[i-1] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right indices.\n\nWait, but for the next steps:\n\nWe need to pair the remaining specific lefts with wildcard rights.\n\nSo, the wildcard rights are the ones not yet used.\n\nSo, collect the indices of the wildcard rights that are not used.\n\nwildcard_rights = right_per_color.get('?', [])\nwildcard_rights_not_used = [r for r in wildcard_rights if not used_right[r]]\n\nThen, the number of possible pairs is min(len(remaining_specific_lefts), len(wildcard_rights_not_used)).\n\nTake x = min(...)\n\nThen, select the first x specific lefts and the first x wildcard rights.\n\nMark them as used.\n\nThen, the remaining specific lefts are those not used.\n\nSimilarly, for the next steps.\n\nWait, but this seems manageable.\n\nSo, the steps for collecting the pairs are:\n\n1. For same_color_pairs:\n\n   a. For each color c, process the first k pairs.\n\n2. For the remaining specific lefts:\n\n   a. Collect all specific lefts not used.\n\n   b. Pair them with wildcard rights not used.\n\n   c. Take x = min(...), mark as used.\n\n3. For the remaining wildcard lefts:\n\n   a. Collect all wildcard lefts not used.\n\n   b. Pair them with the remaining specific rights not used.\n\n   c. Take y = min(...), mark as used.\n\n4. For the remaining wildcard lefts and wildcard rights:\n\n   a.
