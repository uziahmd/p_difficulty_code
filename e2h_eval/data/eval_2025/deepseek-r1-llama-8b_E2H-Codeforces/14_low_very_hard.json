He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I need to output how many such numbers there are and the list of those numbers in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, and higher multiples contribute more. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division result is zero.\n\nSo the task is to find all n where this sum equals m. But how do I find the possible n's for a given m?\n\nI think the first step is to find the lower and upper bounds for n. For example, for a given m, the minimal n would be the smallest n where the trailing zeros count equals m. Similarly, the maximal n is the largest n where the count is m. The numbers between them (inclusive) would all have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple n's that give the same m? Like in the sample input where m=5, the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all give 5 trailing zeros. So for each m, I need to find the range of n's that produce it.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is >= m. Let's call this low.\n2. Find the largest n such that the number of trailing zeros is <= m. Let's call this high.\n3. If the trailing zeros for low is equal to m, then the numbers from low to high (but not exceeding the next multiple of 5) will all have m zeros.\n4. Otherwise, there are no solutions.\n\nWait, maybe I should rephrase: For a given m, we can find the minimal n where the trailing zeros just reach m. Then check if any higher n also has exactly m zeros. Since each time you add a number, the trailing zeros can either stay the same or increase, because adding a multiple of 5 increases the count.\n\nSo, the steps I think are:\n\n- Use binary search to find the smallest n where the trailing zeros function (let's call it count_zeros(n)) is equal to m. Let's call this n_start.\n- Then find the largest n where count_zeros(n) is equal to m. Let's call this n_end.\n- All n between n_start and n_end inclusive will satisfy the condition.\n- The count of such n is n_end - n_start + 1.\n- If no such n exists (like when m=0), then output 0.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle cases where m is such that there's no n with exactly m zeros? Like m=0, but according to the problem statement, m starts from 1, so maybe that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, the input constraints say m is between 1 and 100,000, inclusive. So m is at least 1.\n\nSo, first, I'll need a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\nLet me write that function:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNext, I need to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) == m. But wait, no—because sometimes, a certain n might have count_zeros(n) = m, but perhaps a larger n also does. So the minimal n is the first occurrence of m, and the maximal n is the last occurrence.\n\nWait, but how do I find all n that have exactly m trailing zeros? Because as n increases, the count can only stay the same or increase. So once the count reaches m, it might stay at m for several consecutive ns before increasing again.\n\nSo, for example, let's take m=5.\n\nLooking at n=5: 5/5=1, 5/25=0 → total 1.\nn=6: 6//5=1, 1//5=0 → 1.\nn=7: same as above.\nn=8: same.\nn=9: same.\nn=10: 10//5=2, 10//25=0 → 2.\nWait, wait. Wait, wait. No, for n=5, count is 1; n=6, same as 5? Or wait, n=5 has 5!, which is 120, so one zero. n=6 is 720, which has one zero. Hmm, yes, so 5,6,7,8,9 all have 1 trailing zero. Then ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the count of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This is because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, and higher powers of 5 contribute more zeros.\n   \n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: We can compute the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) using a helper function. This function repeatedly divides \\( n \\) by 5 and sums the quotients until \\( n \\) becomes zero.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it `low`) where the count of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - Similarly, find the largest \\( n \\) (let's call it `high`) where the count of trailing zeros is at most \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Determine Valid Range**: Check if the count of trailing zeros at `low` is exactly \\( m \\). If it is, then all integers from `low` to `high` will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Otherwise, there are no such integers.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Based on the valid range found, output the count of integers and the integers themselves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_low(m):\n    left, right = 0, 5 * m  # Initial guess; could be optimized\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n\ndef find_high(m):\n    left, right = 5 * m, 5 * m  # Initial guess; could be optimized\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt > m:\n            right = mid - 1\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    return right\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input_line)\n    \n    low = find_low(m)\n    high = find_high(m)\n    \n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        count = high - low + 1\n        result = [str(i) for i in range(low, high + 1)]\n        print(count)\n        print(' '.join(result))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Helper Function (`count_trailing_zeros`)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions of multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n  \n- **Binary Search Functions (`find_low` and `find_high`)**: These functions use binary search to efficiently determine the smallest and largest \\( n \\) values where the count of trailing zeros is exactly \\( m \\).\n\n- **Main Function**: Reads the input, uses the helper functions to find the bounds, checks if the bounds are valid, and prints the results accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy the trailing zero condition, leveraging binary search for optimal performance.",
