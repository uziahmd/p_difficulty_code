The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where a frog is jumping on a number line, and I need to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m. Each f(i) represents the number of distinct positions the frog can reach without going beyond [0, i]. Let me try to break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) is. The frog starts at 0, and in each step, it can jump either +a or -b. But it can't go beyond 0 or x. So for each x, f(x) counts all reachable positions within [0, x].\n\nHmm, but how do I compute f(x) efficiently, especially since m can be up to 1e9? Calculating each f(x) individually would be too slow. I need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think about the possible reachable positions. The frog's movement is governed by the steps it can take. Each jump adds or subtracts a or b. So the reachable positions are all integers that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b, but considering the constraints of not going beyond certain limits.\n\nWait, but more precisely, the frog can reach any position k if k is in the additive subgroup generated by a and b. But since a and b are positive, perhaps the reachable positions are of the form a * x - b * y, where x and y are non-negative integers. However, the frog can also move in both directions, so the reachable positions might be more complex.\n\nWait no, actually, the frog starts at 0. Each jump is either +a or -b. So the reachable positions are all numbers that can be written as (k*a) - (l*b), where k and l are non-negative integers such that the total doesn't drop below 0.\n\nBut wait, for example, if a=5, b=3, then starting at 0, the frog can reach 5, 10, etc., by jumping a each time. But it can also reach 2 by jumping a (to 5) and then -b (to 2). Then from 2, it can jump a again to 7, and so on.\n\nSo the reachable positions depend on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. If d = gcd(a, b), then all reachable positions must be multiples of d. Because a and b are multiples of d, any combination of jumps will result in a position that's a multiple of d.\n\nSo first, I should compute d = gcd(a, b). Then, the minimal step is d. So any reachable position is a multiple of d.\n\nThat's an important observation. So for any x, f(x) is the number of reachable positions that are <=x and >=0, and are multiples of d.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding, for each x, how many such multiples exist within [0, x], considering the frog's movement constraints.\n\nWait, but even within the multiples of d, not all may be reachable. For example, suppose a=4, b=5. Then d=1, so every integer is reachable. But wait, that's not necessarily true because the frog can only add a or subtract b, so for some x, maybe certain positions can't be reached.\n\nWait, no. Because if a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any integer that's congruent to 0 modulo d, which is 1 here. Wait, no—wait, the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of d. So when d is 1, the frog can reach any integer.\n\nWait, no. Because the frog can't make negative jumps. For example, if a=3, b=5, and you're at 0, you can't reach 2 by just adding 3 and subtracting 5. Or can you? Hmm, 0 +3 =3, then 3-5 is -2, which is outside the allowed range. So 2 isn't reachable. Wait, but if a=5 and b=3, then from 0, you can reach 5, then 2, then 7, 4, etc. So 2 is reachable.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently: the set of reachable positions is the set of all integers that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position remains >=0.\n\nThis is equivalent to the set S = { x | x ≡0 mod d, x >=0, and there exists integers k, l >=0 such that x = a*k - b*l }.\n\nSo S is the additive subgroup generated by a and b. The structure of S depends on the gcd d. Since d = gcd(a, b), S consists of all multiples of d. So any x in S must be a multiple of d.\n\nTherefore, for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line, given certain constraints. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by `a` or backward by `b` units. The goal is to compute the sum of these reachable positions for each integer from 0 to `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog's movement is governed by the steps it can take. Each jump adds or subtracts `a` or `b`, respectively. The set of reachable positions forms an additive subgroup generated by `a` and `b`, which means all reachable positions are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, denoted as `d`.\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: The key insight is that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of `d` and lies within the interval [0, x]. For each `x`, the number of such positions is the count of valid multiples of `d` up to `x`.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints, directly calculating each `f(x)` for every `x` from 0 to `m` is infeasible. Instead, we use mathematical properties to derive the sum efficiently:\n   - Compute the gcd `d` of `a` and `b`.\n   - Determine the minimal step size `d` and how many such steps fit into the interval [0, m].\n   - Sum the contributions of each step size to the total.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n    b = int(input[2])\n\n    d = a\n    if b != 0:\n        d = gcd(a, b)\n    \n    k = m // d\n    res = k * (k + 1) * d // 2\n\n    print(res)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    import math\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **GCD Calculation**: The gcd of `a` and `b` determines the smallest step size the frog can effectively use. This is crucial because only multiples of `d` are reachable positions.\n\n2. **Max Steps Calculation**: The maximum number of steps the frog can take without exceeding `m` is `k = m // d`. Each step contributes `d` to the reachable positions.\n\n3. **Summing Contributions**: The total number of reachable positions is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers multiplied by `d`. This sum is computed efficiently using the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers: `k * (k + 1) / 2`, then multiplied by `d`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required sum without iterating through each value from 0 to `m`, making it feasible even for large values of `m`.",
