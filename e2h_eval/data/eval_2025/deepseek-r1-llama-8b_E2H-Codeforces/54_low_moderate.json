Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options, any will do. The output should be the vertices v1, v2, v3 in order.\n\nHmm. So, the polygon is regular, which means all sides and angles are equal. That should help in figuring out the possible angles between vertices.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For a regular n-gon, each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So, when we pick three vertices, the angle at v2 can be determined based on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\nWait, right. Because in a regular polygon, the angle at a vertex depends on the positions of the other two. For example, if v2 is fixed, then the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 along the perimeter.\n\nSo, perhaps for each possible vertex v2, I can calculate the possible angles by considering different distances k around v2. Then, for each v2, find the k that makes the angle as close as possible to 'a'.\n\nBut wait, what defines the angle? Oh right, in a regular polygon, the internal angle at each vertex is known. But when considering three points, the angle formed might be an external or internal one, depending on where the points are.\n\nWait no, perhaps more accurately: when you choose three points v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is formed by the lines v2-v1 and v2-v3. The measure of this angle depends on the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angles between consecutive vertices are equal. So, if v1 is m steps away clockwise from v2, and v3 is m' steps away counter-clockwise, then the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the difference between these steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle can be found by looking at the arcs subtended by v1 and v3 at the center. The angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe that's for circles—no, wait, in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the central angle. So, if v1 and v3 are points on the circumference, then the angle at v2 is indeed half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, but in a polygon, the points are arranged on a circle. So yes, the same logic applies. So, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, but that's for the case where v2 is on the circumference and the points are on the circle. So in a regular polygon, yes, each vertex lies on a circle. So the angle at v2 is the inscribed angle over the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, the measure of the angle at v2 is half of the central angle between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, let's think about this. Suppose the central angle between v1 and v3 is θ degrees. Then the inscribed angle at v2 is θ/2. Is that correct?\n\nYes, because the inscribed angle is always half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n\nSo, for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 is (k * (360 / n)) / 2, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the shorter arc. But wait, no—because k can be up to (n-1), but we take the smaller arc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the possible angles as follows:\n\nFor a given v2, the angle at v2 can be formed by choosing points that are k steps away in both directions. The total steps between v1 and v3 is 2k, but since the polygon is circular, it could also be 2k mod n. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, for a given v2, the possible pairs (v1, v3) are such that the arc from v1 to v3 is minimal. So, the step count between v1 and v3 is the minimum of the clockwise and counter-clockwise steps.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for a given v2, the angle at v2 can vary based on how far apart v1 and v3 are. Let's say, for each possible distance k (steps from v2 to v1 in one direction, and similarly for v3), the angle can be computed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should fix v2 and then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any valid solution will suffice.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon and Angles**: A regular convex n-gon has all its vertices equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. The angle at a vertex formed by two other vertices can be calculated based on the arcs subtended by these points.\n\n2. **Inscribed Angle Calculation**: The angle at a vertex (v2) formed by two other vertices (v1 and v3) is an inscribed angle, which is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3. This means if the arc between v1 and v3 is θ degrees, the angle at v2 is θ/2 degrees.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Vertices**: For each vertex v2, calculate the possible angles by considering different pairs of vertices (v1, v3). The angle at v2 can vary based on how far apart v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\n4. **Minimize the Error**: For each possible pair (v1, v3), compute the angle at v2 and determine how close it is to the target angle 'a'. Track the minimum error and the corresponding vertices.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: After evaluating all possible configurations, output the vertices that yield the angle closest to 'a'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nmin_diff = float('inf')\nbest = []\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    for k in range(1, n//2 +1):\n        v1 = (v2 - k - 1) % n + 1\n        v3 = (v2 + k) % n\n        current_angle = 180 - (k * 360 // n) // 2\n        # Calculate the absolute difference\n        diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best = [v1, v2, v3]\n        elif diff == min_diff and (abs(v1 - v2) + abs(v3 - v2) + abs(v1 - v3)) < abs(best[0]-best[1]) + abs(best[2]-best[1]) + abs(best[0]-best[2]):\n            # Prefer the lex smallest or another condition if needed\n            pass\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, best)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Read the input values for n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n- **Loop Through Each Vertex**: For each vertex v2, consider it as the vertex where the angle will be formed.\n- **Calculate Possible Pairs**: For each possible distance k from v2, determine the vertices v1 and v3 such that they form an angle at v2.\n- **Compute the Angle**: Calculate the angle at v2 using the formula for the inscribed angle.\n- **Track Minimum Difference**: Keep track of the configuration with the smallest difference between the computed angle and the target angle 'a'.\n- **Output the Best Configuration**: Print the vertices that yield the angle closest to 'a'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible configurations and find the optimal solution by leveraging the properties of regular polygons and inscribed angles.",
