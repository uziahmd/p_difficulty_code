Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine all the letters from the guest and host names, the pile should have exactly those letters, no more, no less. \n\nSo the steps I need to do are:\n\n1. Take the three input lines: guest, host, pile.\n2. Combine the guest and host names into one string.\n3. Check if the combined string has the same letters as the pile, with the same counts for each letter.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nHmm. Well, one way is to count the frequency of each character in the combined guest+host string and compare it to the frequency in the pile. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, for example, if guest is \"SANTA\" and host is \"CLAU\", then combined is \"SANTACLAU\". Then the pile should have exactly those letters. So, for each character in the combined string, the count must match the pile's count.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nIn Python, I can use the collections.Counter class. Because Counter will count the occurrences of each character. Then, if the Counter of guest + host equals the Counter of the pile, then return YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both Counters have the same elements with same counts, then they are equal.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read three lines: guest, host, pile.\n- Combine guest and host into a single string.\n- Create Counter for combined string and for pile.\n- Compare the two Counters. If equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the combined length is different from the pile's length? For example, if the combined length is 5 and pile is 6 letters. Then obviously, the answer is NO. But the Counter comparison would catch that, since the counts would differ. Because, for example, if the combined string has 5 letters, and pile has 6, then the Counter for pile would have a total count of 6, but combined is 5. So the Counters would not be equal.\n\nSo that's handled automatically.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead the three lines. Let's see, the input is three lines. So in Python, perhaps read via input().strip() three times.\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, the first example is:\n\nInput is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, but that's a list of three elements, each being three lines? Or maybe the original input is three lines. Wait, the problem says that the input file consists of three lines. So for each test case, there are three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. So the sample input is three test cases. For example, the first test case's input is:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo for each of the three test cases, we need to process three lines.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows that the input is a list of three elements, each being three lines. But in reality, the actual input is three lines per test case. So for the code, perhaps the code is supposed to read three lines from stdin, process them, and output YES or NO.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is three lines. So for the code, the code needs to read three lines. However, the sample input shows that there are three test cases. So how is that handled?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is a list of three test cases. Each test case has three lines. The output is a list of three answers. So for example, the first test case's input is three lines, and the output is YES. The second test case's input is three lines, output is NO, etc.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, maybe the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the actual input for the code is three lines (for one test case). But that's conflicting with the sample input.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is three lines. The output is one line (YES or NO). However, the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines, and the output is three answers. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual input format.\n\nWait, maybe the sample input is formatted as a list of test cases. For example, the first test case's input is the first three lines, then the second test case's input is the next three lines, etc. But in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case, which is three lines. However, the sample input shows three test cases. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, each with three lines, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines for one test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user provided a sample input that's a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nSo each of the three elements in the input list is a separate test case. Each test case is three lines. So for example, the first test case's three lines are:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nBut in reality, the code is supposed to read three lines from standard input, which would be the three lines for one test case. However, in the sample input, it's presented as three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is presented in a way that's not matching the actual input format. Maybe the actual code is supposed to read three lines, and process one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. How to resolve this?\n\nWait, looking at the problem's input description again:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines. So for each test case, the input is three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how many test cases are there? The problem's sample input shows three, but the problem's input description doesn't mention that. \n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines (i.e., one test case) and output one line. But that would make the sample input's first element the input for the first test case, etc. So the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but how?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate. Let me check the problem's note. The note says that in the first sample, the letters in the last line can be used. So the first sample input is three lines, and the output is YES.\n\nBut the problem's sample input is given as a list of three test cases. Which suggests that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines (i.e., one test case), and output one line. \n\nBut that's conflicting with the sample input. So how can this be?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines (each line being one of the three inputs). For example, the code reads three lines, processes them, and outputs one line. But in the sample input, the first test case's three lines are given as the first element of the list. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case, and the sample input shows three test cases, but the code is supposed to read three lines for one test case.\n\nBut how to reconcile this? Well, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that's not the actual input format. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo, for each test case, the input is three lines. So the code is supposed to read three lines, process them, and output YES or NO. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the sample input is given as three test cases, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem's sample input is in a format that's not the actual input. For example, perhaps the sample input is a list of three test cases, each with three lines, but the code is supposed to read three lines (i.e., one test case) and output one line. But in that case, the sample input is not matching the actual input format. \n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases. Each test case is three lines. The sample output is a list of three answers. So the code should process multiple test cases. But according to the problem's input description, the input is three lines. So perhaps the problem's input is actually multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous. \n\nBut given that the sample input shows three test cases, and the output is three answers, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the input is three lines, and the sample input is given as three test cases. For example, the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code should process each of them. But how would the code know how many test cases there are?\n\nThis is a bit of a problem. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as three elements, each being three lines. The sample output is three elements. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how to read them? Because in practice, when you read from stdin, you can read all lines at once. For example, if the input is three test cases, each with three lines, then the code would read all lines and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. Therefore, the code should read three lines from stdin, and output one line.\n\nBut in that case, the sample input is not correct. However, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's not the actual input. For example, the sample input may be a list of three test cases, but the actual input for the code is three lines. \n\nBut how to proceed? Well, the problem's sample input and output is given as a list of three test cases. So the code should process multiple test cases, each with three lines. But how to read them? For example, in Python, reading all lines from stdin, then processing them in chunks of three.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not the actual input format. For example, perhaps the sample input is a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines (one test case), and output one line. \n\nBut given that the problem's sample input and output show three test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is represented as a single line (with \\n separators), but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the code is supposed to process each of them. For example, the code would read three lines for each test case. But how to read them? Let's think about the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWhich is a list of three strings, each representing three lines. For example, the first string is the first test case's three lines. So the code should process each of these three test cases. \n\nBut how to read that in Python? Because when the code runs, it's supposed to read from standard input. So, perhaps the actual input is three lines for each test case, but the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. \n\nThis is very confusing. But given the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. For example, the code reads all lines from stdin, and for each group of three lines, process them as a test case. \n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think about the sample input. For example, the first test case's three lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThe second test case's three lines are:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nThird test case's three lines are:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nSo, the code would read all lines, split them into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nBut how to read the input? In Python, the code can read all lines from stdin using sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), which returns a list of all lines. Then, process them in chunks of three.\n\nSo, for example, if there are N test cases, each with three lines, the code would process len(lines) // 3 test cases. But the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process only one test case, but the sample input shows three test cases. \n\nThis is very confusing. However, looking back at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. So, for example, the code reads all lines from stdin, and for each group of three lines, process them as a test case.\n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? Well, perhaps the code can read all lines, and then process them in groups of three. For example, the code can read all lines, then for i in range(0, len(lines), 3), take lines[i], lines[i+1], lines[i+2] as the three lines for a test case.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the three test cases are given as three separate entries. So the code should process them as three test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the problem's sample input is wrong, or there is a misunderstanding. \n\nBut given that the sample input and output are given as such, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. Therefore, the code needs to read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three, and process each group as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's proceed with that approach.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can read all lines, then iterate over them in chunks of three. For each chunk, process the three lines as guest, host, pile.\n\nSo, for example, the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n    guest = lines[i]\n    host = lines[i+1]\n    pile = lines[i+2]\n    # process and print result\n\nBut this would work for the sample input. However, the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process only one test case, and the sample input is given as three test cases. \n\nBut given that the sample input and output have three test cases, and the problem's output is three answers, I think that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, split into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the number of lines is not divisible by three? Well, the problem says that each test case is three lines, so the input should have a number of lines divisible by three. \n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. For example, the sample input may be a mistake, and the actual code is supposed to read three lines. \n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases. So the code should process three test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is a contradiction. \n\nBut perhaps the problem's input description is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is not properly formatted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but each test case is represented as three lines, but the code is supposed to read three lines for one test case. So the sample input is given as three test cases, but the code is supposed to read one test case. That would explain why the sample input is given as a list of three test cases. But how would that fit with the code?\n\nThis is very confusing. However, given that the sample input and output are given as such, perhaps the code is supposed to read three lines (one test case) and output one line. But in that case, the sample input is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but each test case's three lines are passed as separate lines. For example, the first test case's three lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThen the second test case's three lines are:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nAnd the third test case's three lines are:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nSo, the code needs to process three test cases, each with three lines. So the code should read all lines from stdin, and process them in groups of three.\n\nTherefore, the code will read all lines from stdin, split into groups of three, and for each group, process them.\n\nBut how to read the input? Let's assume that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. So, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, stripping whitespace, and then process them in groups of three.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, the sample input's first test case's pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nLet me check the first test case:\n\nguest is 'SANTACLAUS' (length 10?), host is 'DEDMOROZ' (length 8?), combined length is 18. The pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' which is SANTA (5) + MOROZ (5) + DED (3) + CLAUS (5) → let me count the letters. Well, the code would compare the Counter of guest + host with Counter of pile. \n\nIn the first test case, the combined string is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count letters. And the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's see if they are the same. \n\nBut the code would handle that.\n\nBut for the sample input's first test case, the code would output YES. Which matches the sample output.\n\nFor the second test case, the guest is PAPAINOEL, host is JOULUPUKKI. Combined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's see:\n\nCombined length: len(PAPAINOEL) is 9 letters, JOULUPUKKI is 10 letters → total 19. Pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count letters. Let me see, perhaps there is a missing P and an extra L. So the code would detect that the Counters are different, output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut in the sample input, the code would process three test cases. So the code would read all lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut how does that work with the input? For example, if the input is given as three lines, then len(lines) is 3, and the loop runs once. If the input is given as six lines, then two test cases are processed.\n\nBut according to the problem's input description, the input is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. So the code would read three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. \n\nBut the problem's sample input and output suggest that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code is written to process multiple test cases, each with three lines. \n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is conflicting. However, given the sample input and output, I think that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. \n\nBut how to know? Well, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code is expected to return three outputs for three test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. Hence, the code should read all lines from stdin and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? Let's proceed with that approach.\n\nNow, considering that, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut first, the code must read the three lines for each test case. Now, the code can read all lines, and then for each group of three lines, process them.\n\nBut what if the number of lines is not a multiple of three? Well, the problem says that each test case has three lines. So the input is guaranteed to be valid.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nImport sys and Counter.\n\nRead all lines, stripping whitespace.\n\nLoop over the lines in groups of three.\n\nFor each group, check if the combined guest + host has the same Counter as the pile.\n\nPrint YES or NO accordingly.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample input is three test cases. For example, the first test case's lines are:\n\nguest = 'SANTACLAUS'\n\nhost = 'DEDMOROZ'\n\npile = 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → let's count letters.\n\nThe pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nLet me count letters for combined and pile.\n\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ.\n\nLetters:\n\nLet me write down all letters:\n\nS A N T A C L A U S D E D M O R O Z → let's count each letter.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to trust the Counter.\n\nIn any case, the code would compare the two Counters.\n\nSo the code would return YES for the first test case.\n\nIn the second test case, guest is PAPAINOEL, host is JOULUPUKKI. Combined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters in combined and pile.\n\nCombined: PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI → letters:\n\nP A P A I N O E L J O U L U P U K K I → let's count:\n\nP: 3 (P appears in PAPAINOEL: P, P, and in JOULUPUKKI: P?)\n\nWait, guest is PAPAINOEL → letters P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → count:\n\nP: 2, A: 2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nHost is JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → counts:\n\nJ:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2+1=3.\n\nA: 2.\n\nI: 1+1=2.\n\nN: 1.\n\nO: 1+1=2.\n\nE: 1.\n\nL: 1+1=2.\n\nJ: 1.\n\nU: 3.\n\nK: 2.\n\nPlus other letters?\n\nSo total letters: let's see.\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → let's count:\n\nJ:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2.\n\nCompare with combined counts.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP:3?\n\nWait, in the combined guest + host:\n\nguest has P:2, host has P:1 → total 3.\n\nIn the pile, P:2. So that's a discrepancy. So the Counters would not be equal. Hence, output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, for the third test case:\n\nguest is BABBONATALE, host is FATHERCHRISTMAS → combined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS.\n\nPile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me check the counts. The pile has an extra L. So the code would detect that.\n\nThus, the code would output NO.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut how to read the input. For example, in the code, the lines are read via sys.stdin. So, for each line in the input, we read them, stripping any whitespace (like newlines).\n\nBut what about leading or trailing spaces? The problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. So, the lines are read as-is, and stripping whitespace (like newlines) is okay.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n    # Remove any empty lines (though problem says lines are not empty)\n    lines = [line for line in lines if line]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, when reading lines from stdin, using sys.stdin, each line includes the newline character. So using rstrip('\\n') would remove the newline. However, the problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So, the code can safely read each line, stripping the newline.\n\nBut perhaps using line.strip() would also work, but maybe not necessary. However, the problem says that the lines do not have any leading or trailing whitespace. So, perhaps just line.rstrip('\\n') is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, using line.strip() would also work, but perhaps better to use line.rstrip('\\n') to avoid stripping any possible leading/trailing spaces (but problem says there are none).\n\nBut given that the problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters, the code can safely read each line as line.rstrip('\\n').\n\nBut in practice, when reading from stdin, the lines may have trailing newlines. So, the code should process them correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nBut that would remove leading and trailing whitespace. However, the problem says that the lines contain only uppercase letters and are not empty. So, stripping is safe.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut what if the number of lines is not divisible by three? For example, if there are 4 lines, then the code would try to access lines[3], which is beyond the range. However, the problem says that the input is correct. So perhaps the code can assume that len(lines) is divisible by three.\n\nBut in practice, for the problem's test cases, this is the case.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as three test cases, each with three lines. So for the code, when processing the sample input, the lines list would have 3*3=9 lines. Then, the loop runs for i=0, 3, 6.\n\nFor i=0: guest is lines[0], host lines[1], pile lines[2].\n\nFor i=3: guest is lines[3], host lines[4], pile lines[5].\n\nFor i=6: guest is lines[6], host lines[7], pile lines[8].\n\nWhich matches the sample input.\n\nThus, the code would output the sample output.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So why would the code process multiple test cases?\n\nThis is the confusion. However, given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code is written as above.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's input is actually one test case, and the sample input is written in a way that's not correct. For example, perhaps the sample input is given as three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines (one test case). In that case, the code would process only one test case. But then the sample input is not correct.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. Thus, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code as written should be correct.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows. Also, note that the code may have to handle cases where the lines are read with empty lines. However, the problem says that all lines are not empty. So the code can skip that part.\n\nBut in the code, the lines are stripped, and the code uses [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin], which would include empty lines if any. However, the problem says that all lines are not empty. So the code can proceed without filtering out empty lines.\n\nThus, the code is as written.\n\nNow, the code is ready. Let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nFirst test case's three lines:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThe code combines guest + host: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's check if their Counters are equal.\n\nLet me count letters in combined and pile.\n\nCombined:\n\nSANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\nLetters:\n\nS: 2 (S in SANTA and S in DEDMOROZ?)\n\nWait, let's count each letter:\n\nguest: SANTACLAUS → letters S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S → counts:\n\nS: 2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\nhost: DEDMOROZ → D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z → counts:\n\nD:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nS:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let's count letters:\n\nS, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S → \n\nBreaking it down:\n\nS: 2 (first and last letters)\n\nA: 3 (positions 2, 5, 16)\n\nN: 1\n\nT: 1\n\nM: 1\n\nO: 2 (positions 7 and 8)\n\nR: 1\n\nZ: 1\n\nD: 2 (positions 11 and 12)\n\nE: 1\n\nC: 1\n\nL: 1\n\nU: 1\n\nSo the counts are same as the combined. Thus, Counter is equal. Output YES.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. So the final Python code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the characters in the pile exactly match the combined characters of the guest and host names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all input lines from standard input.\n2. **Group Processing**: Process each group of three lines as a separate test case. Each group consists of the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n3. **Character Counting**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each character in the combined string of the guest and host names. Similarly, count the characters in the pile.\n4. **Comparison**: Compare the character counts of the combined names and the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of lines, each stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Processing Groups**: The input lines are processed in groups of three. Each group represents a test case with the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n3. **Character Counting**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined guest-host string and the pile string.\n4. **Comparison**: By comparing the counters of the combined string and the pile, we determine if the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names. If the counters match, it means the pile has exactly the right characters; otherwise, it does not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact character match using counters, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
