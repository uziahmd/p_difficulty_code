Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check if all the cells in both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check if all the non-diagonal cells are the same and not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal cells. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, check if it's on either of the two diagonals. For a cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if either of those conditions is true, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the two diagonals have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is 'x' and the other diagonal is 'y'. Then the first condition fails. So, the first step is to check that all diagonal cells are the same.\n\nSo, let's proceed:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it is on a diagonal. Collect all these characters. Then check that all are the same. Let's say that's d_char.\n\nThen, for the non-diagonal cells, collect all their characters. Check that all are same and not equal to d_char.\n\nBut how to collect these?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n. Let's store this as a grid, perhaps a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\nCollect diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nIf the length of diagonal_chars is not 1, then return NO.\n\nElse, d_char is the only element in diagonal_chars.\n\nThen, collect non_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nIf the length of non_diagonal_chars is not 1, return NO.\n\nElse, check that the only element in non_diagonal_chars is different from d_char.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, return YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the non-diagonal cells are empty? Well, since n is at least 3, and for n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the center. So for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells. The total cells is 9, so non-diagonal cells are 4. So for non_diagonal_chars, there's 4 cells. But if all of them are same, then it's okay.\n\nBut what if all non-diagonal cells are same as d_char? Then the second condition fails.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nCheck that the diagonals are all same.\n\nCheck that the non-diagonals are all same and different from diagonals.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    non_diagonal_chars = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not (i == j or i + j ==",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all cells on both diagonals must contain the same character, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same character different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: Collect all characters from both diagonals (main diagonal and anti-diagonal) and ensure they are all the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Collect all characters from cells not on the diagonals and ensure they are all the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    non_diagonal_chars = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n                non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal where row index equals column index or anti-diagonal where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`), we collect its character in a set. If the set has more than one unique character, the answer is \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For cells not on the diagonals, we collect their characters in another set. If this set has more than one unique character or if the character is the same as the diagonal character, the answer is \"NO\". Otherwise, the answer is \"YES\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both conditions using sets to track unique characters, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
