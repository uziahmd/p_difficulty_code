Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. But wait, the problem says both diagonals must have the same letters. So, for example, all cells in both diagonals must be the same as each other? Or each diagonal can have their own letter, but both diagonals must have the same letters?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So that means all the cells in both diagonals must be the same. Like, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the other diagonal has 'x', then that's okay. But if one diagonal has 'x' and the other has 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo first step: collect all the cells in the two diagonals. Check that all of them are the same character. Then, check all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nLet me think about steps:\n\n1. Check if all diagonal cells are the same. Let's collect all the diagonal cells. For each cell (i,j) where i == j or i + j == n - 1. Wait, but for the center cell (when n is odd), it's part of both diagonals. So when checking, we need to collect all cells in either diagonal, but make sure that each cell is considered once. But for the purpose of checking if all are same, even if we check twice (like the center cell), it's okay. Because if the cell is part of both diagonals, but the value is same as others, it's okay.\n\nSo for the first step: collect all the cells in the diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Let's say that the diagonal character is 'd'.\n\nThen, check all non-diagonal cells. They should all be the same character, say 'o', and 'd' != 'o'.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Collect all diagonal cells. Check they are all same. If not, return NO.\n\n- Collect all non-diagonal cells. Check they are all same. Also check that this is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect the cells?\n\nFor each cell (i, j) in the grid:\n\nIf i == j or i + j == n-1 → part of diagonal.\n\nElse → non-diagonal.\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nCheck all diagonal cells are same. Let's take the first diagonal cell (0,0) as the reference. Then check all other diagonal cells against it.\n\nBut what if the grid is empty? Well, n is at least 3, so there are cells.\n\nBut for example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst example input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLooking at the diagonals:\n\nFirst row: x o o o x → the first and last are x. Then second row: o x o x o → the middle is x. Third row: s o x o o → the middle is x. Fourth row: o x o x o → middle x. Fifth row: x o o o x → first and last x. Wait, but the diagonals are the main diagonal (i == j) and the other diagonal (i + j = n-1). For n=5, n-1 is 4. So for each cell (i,j):\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4).\n\nOther diagonal: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nSo the diagonals include (2,2) which is part of both. So the cells in the diagonals are:\n\nLooking at the first input:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all cells on both diagonals of the square must contain the same letter, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonal Consistency**: Verify that all cells on both diagonals of the grid contain the same character. This includes both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Consistency**: Ensure that all cells not on the diagonals contain the same character, which must be different from the character found on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check if all diagonal cells are the same\ndiag_char = None\nvalid_diag = True\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            if diag_char is None:\n                diag_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n                    valid_diag = False\n                    break\n    if not valid_diag:\n        break\n\nif not valid_diag:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check non-diagonal cells\n    non_diag_char = None\n    valid_non_diag = True\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j and i + j != n - 1:\n                if non_diag_char is None:\n                    non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                        valid_non_diag = False\n                        break\n        if not valid_non_diag:\n            break\n\n    if valid_non_diag and non_diag_char != diag_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals, we check if it matches the initial character found on the diagonals (`diag_char`). If any mismatch is found, the diagonal check fails.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: After confirming the diagonals are consistent, we check all non-diagonal cells. These cells must all match a different character (`non_diag_char`) which should not be the same as `diag_char`.\n\nThis approach ensures that both conditions for forming the letter \"X\" are checked efficiently, with a time complexity of O(n²), which is suitable given the constraints.",
