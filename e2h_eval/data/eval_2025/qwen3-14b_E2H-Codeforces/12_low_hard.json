The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the movement. For example, if she is currently at position current_pos, and the next task is at a_i, how much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the road is a ring, moving clockwise. So the distance between current_pos and a_i can be calculated as (a_i - current_pos) mod n? Wait, but since movement is only clockwise, maybe not. Let's think: if current_pos is 1 and a_i is 3, and n is 4, then moving clockwise takes 2 steps (1→2→3). If current is 3 and a_i is 1, then moving clockwise would be (n - current_pos + a_i) steps? Like for n=4, current is 3, target is 1: 3→4→1 is 2 steps. So the distance is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target + n - current). Which can be written as (target - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if target is less than current, then (target - current) is negative. For example, current is 3, target is 1. (1-3) is -2. Mod 4 would be 2. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which is equivalent to (target - current) % n. But since in Python, modulo can return negative values, but maybe we can compute it as (target - current) % n. Wait, no. Let's see: if target is 1 and current is 3, n=4. (1-3) is -2. Mod 4 is 2. So yes. So the distance is (target - current) % n. But wait, if target is 3 and current is 1, then (3-1) is 2 mod 4 is 2, which is correct. So yes, the formula (target - current) % n gives the correct number of steps when moving clockwise.\n\nBut wait, in the first example:\n\nThe input is 4 3, and the tasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nThe initial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. So distance from 1 to 3 is (3-1) = 2 steps. Then she does the task. Then next task is 2. So current position is 3. Distance to 2 is (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. So 3 steps. Then she moves to 2. Then next task is 3 again. Current position is 2. Distance is (3-2) mod 4 = 1. So total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is to track the current position, and for each task in order, compute the distance from current position to the target, add that to the total time, and then update the current position to the target.\n\nBut wait, what if the same task is in the same house as the previous? Like if two consecutive tasks are in the same house. Then the distance is zero, so no movement needed. So that's handled automatically.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n   compute distance between current_pos and a_i, which is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, no. Because if a_i is equal to current_pos, then the distance is zero. But (a_i - current_pos) mod n would be zero. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the case where a_i is the same as current_pos, we don't need to move. So adding zero to the total time. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each task, we compute the distance from current position to a_i, add it to the total, then set current_pos to a_i",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the movement time between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task in the given sequence, compute the time required to move from the current position to the target house of the task.\n3. **Circular Distance Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, the distance between two houses can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. Specifically, moving from house `current_pos` to house `target` takes `(target - current_pos) % n` steps if moving clockwise.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the distances for all tasks to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    diff = (target - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the distance from the current position to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n- **Update Position**: After calculating the distance for each task, update the current position to the target house to prepare for the next task.\n- **Sum Distances**: Accumulate the total time taken for all movements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required time by leveraging modulo operations to handle circular movements, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
