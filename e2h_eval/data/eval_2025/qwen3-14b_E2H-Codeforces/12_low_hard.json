The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Time taken is 2.\n- Then, second task is at 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2, since it's clockwise, she can go 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. So total time now is 2+3=5.\n- Third task is at 3 again. She's at 2, so moving to 3 is 1 step. Total time 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nBut how do we model this in code?\n\nThe main idea is to track Xenia's current position and accumulate the time needed to move to each task's location in order.\n\nBut how to compute the movement between two positions on a ringroad?\n\nLet's think: For two positions current and next, what's the minimal steps needed to get from current to next in a clockwise direction?\n\nSince the ringroad is a circle of size n. The distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n? Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, if current is 3 and next is 2 in a 4-house setup, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But (2 -3) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. So yes, the formula (next - current) mod n gives the correct number of steps. Wait, but if next is greater than current, like current is 1 and next is 3, then (3-1) = 2 steps, which is correct. So yes, the formula (next - current) mod n gives the number of steps needed to move clockwise from current to next.\n\nWait, but when next is less than current, like current is 3 and next is 2, then (2 -3) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo for each task, we need to calculate the distance from the current position to the next task's position, add that to the total time, and then update the current position.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in order. So for the list a_1 to a_m, we have to process them in order. So for each i from 1 to m, we need to compute the steps from previous position to a_i, then update the previous position to a_i.\n\nBut the initial position is 1. So for the first task, the steps are (a_1 - 1) mod n? Wait, no. Because if a_1 is 1, then steps are 0. If a_1 is 2, steps are 1. But if a_1 is 3 and n is 4, steps are 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m:\n\n   compute distance from current_position to a_i: (a_i - current_position) mod n ?\n\nWait, but mod n could be zero. For example, if current is 1 and a_i is 1, then the distance is zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the mod operation can give 0, but in that case, the distance is zero steps. So yes.\n\nBut in code, how to compute that? For example, in Python, (a_i - current_pos) % n.\n\nBut let's take the first example:\n\nn=4, tasks are [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3",
