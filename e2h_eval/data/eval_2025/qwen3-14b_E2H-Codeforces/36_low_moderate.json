The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about calculating the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what configurations of towers allow for such an assignment. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nFor a tower configuration to be valid, there must be a way to assign power levels so that:\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower. So, for example, if there's a tower in town 1, its power can't be more than 1, because otherwise it would reach town 0. Similarly, a tower in town n can't have power more than 1. Also, for any tower, its power p must be such that the range doesn't include 0 or n+1.\n\nBut more importantly, each town 1..n must be covered exactly once. So the coverage must be a partition of the towns 1..n into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. How does this relate to the positions of the towers?\n\nLet me think of the towers as being placed in certain positions. For the coverage to work, each tower must cover some consecutive towns, and these ranges must not overlap. Also, each town is covered exactly once.\n\nWait, but the way the signal works is that a tower at position i with power p covers all cities c where |c - i| < p. Which means that the coverage is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). So the length of the interval is 2(p-1) + 1 = 2p-1. But since p is an integer between 1 and n, the maximum possible coverage is 2n-1, but that's probably not needed here.\n\nBut for the coverage to not reach town 0, the leftmost tower (say, at position i) must have p such that i - (p-1) > 0. Wait, no: |c - i| < p implies that c can be as low as i - p + 1. So for town 0 not to be covered, we must have that i - p + 1 > 0. Or i - p + 1 >= 1? Because town 0 is at position 0. So for a tower at position i, the leftmost position it covers is i - (p-1). To ensure that this is >= 1 (so that town 0 is not covered), then i - (p-1) >= 1 → p <= i - 0. So p can be up to i. But also, the rightmost coverage is i + p -1. For town n+1 not to be covered, we must have i + p -1 < n+1 → p <= n+1 - i. So the maximum allowed p for a tower at position i is min(i, n+1 -i). But when assigning p, we have to choose it such that the coverage doesn't go beyond 0 or n+1.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the arrangement of towers must form a certain structure. For example, each tower must cover a certain segment of towns, and these segments must be non-overlapping and cover all towns 1..n exactly once.\n\nThis seems similar to tiling problems. Maybe the valid tower configurations are those that form a set of towers where each tower is responsible for a certain interval, and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as requiring that the towers are arranged in such a way that they can be paired with ranges that cover exactly the towns once. How can this be achieved?\n\nLet me consider the example given. For n=5, towers at 2,4,5. The tower at 2 has power 2, covering towns 1,2,3. The towers at 4 and 5 have power 1, covering their own town. So the ranges are [1-3], [4], [5]. So each tower's coverage is a contiguous block, and they don't overlap.\n\nSo, in general, the valid tower configurations must allow for such a partitioning. So the towers must be placed in such a way that they can be grouped into non-overlapping ranges, each covered by exactly one tower. How to model this?\n\nAnother observation: For a tower to cover a certain range, say from a to b (inclusive), it must be placed at some position i in that range. The power p must be such that the coverage includes a to b. For example, if a tower is placed at i, and it's responsible for covering a to b, then the power p must be at least max(i - a + 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with a 1/2 chance), there exists a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Insight**: The key insight is to use dynamic programming to count valid configurations of towers that allow for the required signal coverage. We define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each position `i`, we consider two cases:\n   - If there is no tower at position `i`, then `dp[i]` can be derived from `dp[i-1]`.\n   - If there is a tower at position `i`, then we need to ensure it covers exactly the range from some previous position `j` to `i`, which leads to the recurrence relation involving `dp[j-1]`.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle divisions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (positions 1..i)\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: 0 towns, 1 way (no towers)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at position i\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        \n        # Case 2: tower at position i. Then, we need to choose a j where the tower covers from j to i\n        # The tower at i must cover from j to i, which requires that the tower's power is at least i - j + 1\n        # But since the tower's power can be chosen, we just need to ensure that the coverage doesn't extend beyond\n        # town 0 or n+1. However, the tower at i can cover up to i + p -1 < n+1 => p <= n+1 - i\n        # So, for the tower at i to cover from j to i, we need j >= i - (p - 1) + 1 = i - p + 2\n        # But since p can be chosen, the minimal requirement is that there's a tower at i and the previous tower ends at j-1.\n        # So, the tower at i can start covering from i - k + 1 to i, where k is the power.\n        # For simplicity, we consider that the tower at i can cover from any j to i, provided that the previous segment ends at j-1.\n        # So for each possible j, the number of ways is dp[j-1], but since j can be from 1 to i, and we have to sum over all possible j\n        # However, to avoid double counting, we notice that the tower at i must be the first in its segment. Hence, the previous segment must end at i-1, and the current tower starts at i.\n        # Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that when placing a tower at i, it must cover from some j to i, and the previous segment ends at j-1. Thus, we can sum over all possible j from 1 to i where the tower at i can cover from j to i. But how?\n        # Actually, the tower at i can be the start of a new segment. To cover from i to i, the power is 1. To cover from i-1 to i, power is 2, etc. However, the important thing is that the previous segment ends at j-1, and this segment starts at j. Therefore, for the tower at i, the possible starting points j can be from 1 to i, but the segment must start at j and end at i, with the tower at i. However, this seems complex.\n        # But looking at the example, for n=2, the valid configuration is both towers present. The answer is 1/4. So the DP approach should account for that.\n        # Another way to think: the valid configurations are those where the towers form a set of positions that can be partitioned into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. This resembles the tiling problem, where each tile is a tower that covers a certain length.\n        # So, for the recurrence, when placing a tower at i, we can look back to any position j where the tower at i covers from j to i. This would require that j is such that the tower at i can cover j to i. The minimal requirement is that j >= 1 and i - j + 1 <= min(i, n+1 - i). However, since the power can be chosen, the tower at i can cover any range [k, i], provided that the previous segment ends at k-1. So, the number of ways is the sum over all k from 1 to i of dp[k-1]. But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2e5.\n        # So, we need to find a way to compute this sum efficiently. Let's see: for each i, the sum is sum_{k=1}^i dp[k-1] = dp[0] + dp[1] + ... + dp[i-1]. Let's call this prefix_sum[i].\n        # So, dp[i] += prefix_sum[i] (but we have to consider that the tower at i is present, which has a probability of 1/2. Wait, but the DP counts the number of valid tower configurations, not the probability yet.)\n        # Wait, the DP counts the number of valid configurations. Each configuration has a probability of (1/2)^m, where m is the number of towers built. However, the problem requires us to compute the total probability, which is sum over all valid configurations (probability of that configuration).\n        # So, the DP should track the number of valid configurations, and then multiply by (1/2)^m for each, but that's complicated. Alternatively, since each tower is built independently with probability 1/2, the total probability is equal to (number of valid configurations) * (1/2)^n, because each configuration has exactly n towers (but no, some configurations have fewer towers). Wait, no. The number of towers varies. For example, in the first sample, the valid configuration has 2 towers, so the probability is (1/2)^2. But there might be other configurations with different numbers of towers that are valid.\n        # Therefore, the DP approach must account for the number of valid configurations, considering that each tower is present with probability 1/2, and the rest are absent. However, this complicates the DP approach. Instead, perhaps we can model the DP in terms of probabilities directly.\n        # Let me re-express the problem. The total probability is the sum over all valid tower configurations C of (probability of C).\n        # Each configuration C is a subset of {1, ..., n}, and the probability of C is (1/2)^k, where k is the size of C.\n        # So, the problem reduces to counting the number of valid subsets C multiplied by (1/2)^{|C|} summed over all valid C.\n        # However, this seems challenging. But perhaps we can model this with a DP that tracks both the number of valid subsets and their contribution to the probability.\n        # Let me think again. The initial approach was to count the number of valid configurations (subsets of towers) that allow for a valid signal assignment. Once we have that count, the total probability is (count) * (1/2)^n? No, because each subset C has probability (1/2)^{|C|} * (1/2)^{n - |C|} }? No, because the towers are built with probability 1/2 each, regardless of whether they are in the subset or not. Wait, no. Each tower is built with probability 1/2, independent of others. So the probability of a particular subset C is (1/2)^n. Because each tower is either present (prob 1/2) or not (prob 1/2), regardless of the subset. So for any subset C of size k, the probability is (1/2)^n. Wait, no! That's not right. Because the subset C is exactly the towers that are built. So the probability of a subset C is (1/2)^{n} if C is a subset of {1, ..., n}. Wait, no. For example, if a subset C has m elements, then the probability is (1/2)^m * (1/2)^{n - m} }? No, because each tower is built with probability 1/2. So the probability that exactly the subset C is built is (1/2)^{n} multiplied by 1, because for each tower, it's either present or not. So the total probability of all subsets is 2^n * (1/2)^n = 1. So the probability of a specific subset C is (1/2)^n, regardless of the size of C. Wait, that can't be right. Because if you have n=1, there are two subsets: empty set and {1}. Each has probability 1/2, which is (1/2)^1. So yes, the probability of any subset is (1/2)^n. Therefore, the total probability is (number of valid subsets) * (1/2)^n. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of valid subsets of towers, and then multiplying by (1/2)^n.\n\nNow, the DP approach needs to count the number of valid subsets of towers that allow for the signal assignment. Let's redefine dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (positions 1..i).\n\nFor the recurrence:\n- If we do not build a tower at position i, then dp[i] += dp[i-1].\n- If we build a tower at position i, then it must cover a segment from some j to i, and the previous segment must end at j-1. So, we can sum over all possible j from 1 to i, and add dp[j-1] to dp[i]. However, this would be O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nBut we can note that the tower at i must be the first tower in its segment. So the segment it covers starts at some j and ends at i. For this to be valid, the tower at i must cover from j to i, and there must be no tower between j and i except at i. But since we're considering the count of valid subsets, we can think recursively: the number of ways to have a valid configuration up to i, with a tower at i, is equal to the sum of dp[j-1] for all j from 1 to i, where j is the start of the segment covered by the tower at i.\n\nHowever, this sum can be optimized using prefix sums. Let's define prefix[i] = dp[0] + dp[1] + ... + dp[i]. Then, the sum for j from 1 to i of dp[j-1] is prefix[i-1].\n\nThus, the recurrence becomes:\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] + prefix[i-1]\n\nAnd the prefix array can be maintained as:\nprefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + dp[i]\n\nThis leads to an O(n) solution.\n\nFinally, the answer is dp[n] * inv(2^n) mod MOD, where inv is the modular inverse.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\n### Final Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 2)\n    \n    dp[0] = 1\n    prefix[0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at i\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        # Case 2: tower at i, which can cover from j to i, for any j from 1 to i\n        # sum_{j=1 to i} dp[j-1] = prefix[i-1]\n        dp[i] += prefix[i-1]\n        dp[i] %= MOD\n        \n        prefix[i] = (prefix[i-1] + dp[i]) % MOD\n    \n    # Now compute dp[n] * inv(2^n) mod MOD\n    inv_2n = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_2n = pow(inv_2n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    ans = (dp[n] * inv_2n) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: `dp[i]` keeps track of the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n- **Prefix Sum Array (`prefix`)**: This helps efficiently compute the sum of previous `dp` values needed for the recurrence relation.\n- **Modular Inverse**: The result is computed as `dp[n] * inv(2^n) % MOD` to convert the count of valid configurations into the required probability under modulo arithmetic.",
