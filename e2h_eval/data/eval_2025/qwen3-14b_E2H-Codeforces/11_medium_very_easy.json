A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs and what each part contributes.\n\nThe inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, first, calculate how much total drink they have. That's k * l milliliters. Each toast requires each friend to have nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Then, the total number of toasts possible based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Wait, but wait: for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total is n * nl. So total toasts possible from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, total_drink is k*l. So yes.\n\nThen, the lime slices. Each lime is cut into d slices. So total slices is c * d. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices are needed. So the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt: total salt is p grams. Each toast requires np grams per friend, so per toast, total is n * np. So the number of toasts possible from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources are required for each toast. So the maximum number of toasts possible is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nWait, but in the example given:\n\nFirst input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So per toast, total is n * nl. For the first example, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. Total drink is 20. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note where they say 20/3=6 toasts. Wait wait, maybe I messed up here. Wait the note says that the total drink is 20, which is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says that for the first sample, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Let me check:\n\nEach toast requires each friend to have 3 ml. So per toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So total drink is 20. How many toasts can be made? 20 divided by 9 is 2.222... So floor is 2. But the note says that it's 20 / 3 =6. Oh wait, that's a mistake in my thinking. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl ml. So for the first example, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait why is that?\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 =6 toasts\". Wait that suggests that per toast, each friend needs 3 ml, but the total per toast is 3 ml. Which would be possible if the problem says that per toast, each friend needs nl ml, but perhaps the total per toast is nl ml. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. So the note's example says that 20 ml is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. That would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml, not 3 * 3. So that suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait this is a critical point. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these things. So if there are n friends, each making a toast, then for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So for the first example, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. Total drink is 20. 20//9 is 2. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which suggests that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be possible if the problem says that per toast, all friends together need nl ml. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait the note says:\n\nIn the first sample, the drink is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. Wait why 20 divided by 3? Because 20 is the total drink, and 3 is the nl. So that would be per toast, each friend needs nl ml, but for one toast, the total is nl ml. Which would imply that for all friends, the total is nl ml. Which would be possible if the problem says that per toast, all friends together need nl ml. But that's conflicting with the problem description.\n\nThis suggests that I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these things. So, for one toast, each friend has one drink portion of nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. \n\nBut according to the note, the first sample has 20 ml of drink. The note says that it's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which implies that per toast, the total drink needed is 3 ml, not 3 * 3 =9. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have misread the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the note:\n\nIn the first sample: the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. How is that possible?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the number of toasts per friend is t. So for each friend, the total amount of drink they need is t * nl. So the total drink needed for all friends is n * t * nl. \n\nBut the total available drink is k * l. So the maximum t is (k*l) / (n * nl). But since t must be integer, it's floor division. \n\nBut in the first example, k*l is 4*5=20. n=3, nl=3. So 20/(3 *3) = 20/9 = 2.222... So floor is 2. But the note says that it's 20/3 =6 toasts. So why is that?\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait why is that? How does that calculation come about?\n\nAh! Oh! Maybe the problem is that the note is considering the total number of toasts, not per friend. Wait the problem says that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So for the drink, total required is t * n * nl. \n\nBut in the note's example, the calculation is 20 / 3 =6. Which would be if the total required is t * nl. So for example, if the total drink is t * nl. That would be the case if the total number of toasts is t, and each toast requires nl ml total. But that would be if each toast requires nl ml for all friends. \n\nBut this contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the problem statement is different than I thought. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts in total, not per friend. But then, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3, which gives 2. So that would imply that the total number of toasts is 6, and each friend makes 2 toasts. \n\nWait that's possible. So the problem is that the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. \n\nWait that's confusing. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem says: How many toasts can each friend make?\n\nSo each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend needs some amount. So for each friend, per toast, they need nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. For all friends, the total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nSo the total drink available is k*l. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the note's example, that would be 20 / (3 *3) = 20/9 = 2.222, so 2. But according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be t=6. But that would require 3 *6 *3 = 54 ml. Which is more than 20. So that's impossible. \n\nSo there's something wrong here. How does the note explain this?\n\nThe note says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the note is considering that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total number of toasts is t. So for each toast, each friend takes nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend takes t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. But the note says that 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the total drink is 20, and per toast, the total drink used is 3 ml. Which would be the case if for each toast, the total drink used is nl ml. \n\nSo that would suggest that the problem is that for each toast, the total drink required is nl ml, not per friend. \n\nBut the problem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml, so total is n * nl. \n\nBut the note's explanation suggests that the total per toast is nl. \n\nThis is a critical confusion. Let me recheck the problem statement once again. \n\nProblem statement:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those. So, for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl. \n\nBut according to the note's example, the total drink is 20, and the number of toasts possible is 20 / 3 =6. So that would be 20 / (nl) = 6. Which would imply that per toast, total drink is nl. \n\nWhich would mean that the problem is that for each toast, the total drink is nl. \n\nBut that would contradict the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total number of toasts is t. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. So for all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut the note says that the total drink is 20, and that it's enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if t is 6, and n * t * nl = 3 *6 *3 = 54. Which is way more than 20. \n\nSo this is impossible. \n\nSo there's something wrong here. Let me look at the note again. \n\nThe note says:\n\nthe drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. \n\nBut how? \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the number of toasts each friend can make is t. So for each friend, the total drink they need is t * nl. So for all friends, it's n * t * nl. \n\nBut the total available is k * l. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nIn the first example, k*l is 20, n=3, nl=3. So 20/(3 *3) = 20/9 = 2.222. So floor is 2. \n\nWhich would make the total toasts per friend 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be if the total number of toasts is 6, and each friend makes 2 toasts. \n\nAh! Oh! So the note is talking about the total number of toasts, not the number per friend. \n\nSo the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts in total. Then, since there are 3 friends, each can make 6 /3 = 2 toasts. \n\nSo the note is saying that the drink allows for 6 total toasts, but since each friend must make the same number, it's divided by n. \n\nAh! So the problem is that the total number of toasts is t_total. Each friend makes t_total /n toasts. \n\nBut that's only possible if t_total is divisible by n. But the problem says that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So the total number of toasts is t_total = t_per_friend * n. \n\nSo for example, if each friend makes t toasts, then total is n * t. \n\nSo the drink required for that is n * t * nl. \n\nSo the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the note's example, the drink is 20. \n\nSo 20 = n * t * nl → 20 = 3 * t * 3 → 20 =9t → t = 2.222. So t is 2. \n\nWhich would make the total toasts n*t=6. Which is what the note says. \n\nAh! So the note says that the drink allows for 6 total toasts, which is n * t. And then the answer is t. \n\nSo the note is correct. \n\nSo the way to compute the maximum number of toasts per friend is to calculate for each resource how many total toasts can be made (t_total), then divide by n to get the per friend toasts. \n\nBut since t_total must be divisible by n? No, because the per friend toasts must be an integer. \n\nWait, no. Because the maximum t_total is such that t_total = (some value) and then the per friend is t_total //n. \n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to calculate for each resource the maximum number of total toasts possible (t_total), then the answer is the minimum of these t_total divided by n (floor division). \n\nBut how to compute the t_total for each resource?\n\nLet me think again. \n\nDrink:\n\nTotal drink is k*l. Each toast requires n * nl ml (since each of the n friends uses nl per toast). So the maximum t_total for drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nLimes:\n\nEach toast requires n slices (since each of the n friends uses one slice per toast). Total slices is c*d. So maximum t_total for limes is (c*d) // n. \n\nSalt:\n\nEach toast requires n * np grams. Total salt is p. So maximum t_total for salt is p // (n * np). \n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three t_total values, divided by n? No. Wait, the answer is the minimum of the three t_total values, and then divided by n? Or is the answer the minimum of (drink_t_total, lime_t_total, salt_t_total) divided by n? \n\nNo. Because the t_total is the maximum number of total toasts possible. Since each friend must make the same number of toasts, the maximum t_per_friend is floor(t_total /n). \n\nBut wait, no. Because the t_total is the maximum number of total toasts that can be made given the resource. For example, if the drink allows for 6 total toasts, then each friend can make 6 /3 =2 toasts. Which is the sample. \n\nBut what if the drink allows for 7 total toasts? Then, since each friend must make the same number, the maximum is 7//3 = 2 toasts per friend (total 6 toasts). \n\nBut in that case, the drink could allow for 7 toasts, but the per friend is limited by the division. \n\nBut the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. \n\nSo the correct approach is to compute for each resource the maximum possible total toasts (t_total) that can be made, then take the minimum of those t_total values, and then divide by n, taking the floor. \n\nWait no. Because the minimum of the three t_total is the maximum possible total toasts that can be made, given all constraints. Then, since each friend must have the same number of toasts, the maximum per friend is (min_total_toasts) // n. \n\nBut in the first example, the min_total_toasts is min(6, 80, 100) =6. Then 6//3=2, which is the correct answer. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute for each resource the maximum total toasts possible (drink, limes, salt).\n\nTake the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nThen, divide that by n (integer division) to get the number of toasts per friend. \n\nWait, but why? Because the total toasts is min_total_toasts, and each friend must make the same number. So the number per friend is min_total_toasts // n. \n\nBut wait, suppose min_total_toasts is 7 and n is 3. Then 7//3=2. So each friend makes 2 toasts, total of 6. Which is allowed. \n\nBut why not take the floor of min_total_toasts divided by n? \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nBut how to compute the max total toasts for each resource?\n\nFor drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So total_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl). \n\nFor limes: total_slices = c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So total_toasts_limes = total_slices // n. \n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So total_toasts_salt = p // (n * np). \n\nThen, the minimum of these three numbers is the maximum total toasts possible. Then, divide by n to get per friend. \n\nWait, but in the first example, the total_toasts_drink is 20/(3 * 3) = 20//9=2. So the min_total_toasts is 2, and dividing by n (3) gives 0.666, which would be 0. But the sample answer is 2. \n\nWait this is a contradiction. \n\nWait no! Oh no, I think I have messed up the steps. \n\nWait the first example's min_total_toasts is min(6, 80, 100) =6. But according to my previous calculation, the drink's total_toasts is 20/(3 *3) = 2.222, floor to 2. So why is the note saying that the drink allows for 6 total toasts? \n\nThis suggests that my earlier understanding is completely wrong. \n\nSo I need to re-express the problem. \n\nLet me re-examine the note. \n\nIn the first sample, the note says:\n\nthe drink is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. \n\nWhich implies that for the drink, the total_toasts is 6. \n\nBut according to the formula I thought earlier, it's 20/(n * nl) = 20/(3 *3) = 20/9=2.222. \n\nBut the note says that it is 20/3 =6. \n\nSo this indicates that the formula is different. \n\nWhat is the correct formula for the drink? \n\nIf the total drink is 20 ml. \n\nEach toast requires each friend to have nl=3 ml. So for one toast, each friend has 3 ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is 3 * 3 =9 ml. \n\nSo for 6 toasts, total drink is 6 *9 =54 ml. Which is more than 20. \n\nBut the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. How? \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nWait the note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I have misread the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total per toast is nl milliliters. \n\nThat would mean that for each toast, the total drink consumed is nl milliliters. Which would mean that for one toast, each friend gets nl /n milliliters. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, all friends together need nl milliliters. So for example, if there are 3 friends, each toast requires 3 ml total. So per toast, each friend gets 1 ml. \n\nBut that would make the note's calculation correct. \n\nBut how does that fit with the problem statement? \n\nThe problem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl. \n\nBut the note says that for the first sample, the drink is 20ml, which is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. So this implies that for each toast, the total drink is 3 ml. \n\nWhich would mean that nl is 3 ml per toast total, not per friend. \n\nThis suggests that the problem statement might have a typo, or I'm misunderstanding it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the number of toasts per friend is t. So the total drink needed is n * t * nl. \n\nBut in the first sample, the total drink is 20. So:\n\nn * t * nl ≤ k*l → 3 * t * 3 ≤ 20 → 9t ≤20 → t ≤ 2.222. So t=2. Which is the sample output. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be t_total =6, which would be 3 * t *3 = 3*2*3= 18 ≤20. \n\nWait, but if the total toasts is 6, then t_per_friend is 6 /3 = 2. Which is the correct answer. \n\nSo the note is referring to the total toasts, not per friend. \n\nSo the way to calculate the maximum total toasts is:\n\ntotal_toasts_drink = (k*l) // (nl) \n\nWait why? Because if each toast requires nl milliliters total for all friends. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nLet me think again. \n\nIf the note says that for the first sample, the drink allows for 20/3 =6 toasts, then it must be that each toast requires 3 ml of drink total. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nThe problem statement says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, the total is n * nl ml. \n\nBut the note says that for the first sample, the drink allows for 20 /3 =6 toasts. So 20 /3 =6 implies that each toast requires 3 ml of drink. \n\nSo this suggests that the total per toast is nl ml, not n * nl. \n\nSo perhaps the problem statement has a mistake, and the actual requirement is that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total per toast is nl milliliters. \n\nBut that would mean that each friend gets nl /n milliliters per toast. Which seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total number of toasts is t. So for all friends, the total drink needed is t * nl. \n\nBut that would imply that for each toast, all friends together consume nl milliliters. So per toast, each friend consumes nl/n milliliters. \n\nBut this seems very strange. \n\nBut given the note's example, this must be the case. \n\nSo, assuming that the problem statement has a mistake, and that the correct way is that for each toast, the total drink needed is nl milliliters, not per friend. \n\nBut how to reconcile this with the problem statement?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for one toast, total is n * nl. \n\nBut the note says that for the first sample, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. \n\nSo 20 /3 =6 implies that each toast requires 3 ml. \n\nSo 6 toasts would require 6 *3 =18 ml. Which is within the 20 ml. \n\nBut this would mean that for each toast, the total is 3 ml, which would mean that each friend gets 3/n = 1 ml per toast. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl=3 ml per toast. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nSo what is the correct way to interpret the problem statement? \n\nMaybe the problem statement says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. For all friends, total is n * t * nl ml. \n\nBut in the first sample, n=3, t=2. So total drink is 3 * 2 *3 =18 ml, which is less than 20. So that's acceptable. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be t_total =6, but that would require n * t * nl =3 *6 *3 =54, which is more than 20. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. \n\nThis suggests that the note is wrong, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is explaining the drink's contribution to the total toasts, but it's not the limiting factor. \n\nWait the note says:\n\nthe drink is enough to make 20/3 =6 toasts. The limes are enough for 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100. However, there are 3 friends, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 =2. \n\nAh! So the note is saying that the drink allows for 6 total toasts, and then dividing by 3 (number of friends) to get per friend toasts. \n\nSo this implies that the total toasts is computed as (total_drink) / (nl), and then divided by n. \n\nWait, why? \n\nIf the total toasts is t_total, then each friend makes t_total /n toasts. \n\nBut how is t_total computed? \n\nIf for each toast, each friend needs nl ml, then for t_total toasts, each friend makes t_total /n toasts. \n\nWait, no. If each friend makes t toasts, then total toasts is n * t. \n\nSo for the drink, the total required is n * t * nl. \n\nSo t = (k*l) / (n * nl). \n\nBut the note says that for the first sample, the drink allows for 6 total toasts, which would be t_total =6. So t =6 /3=2. \n\nWhich would mean that the total drink is 3 * 2 *3 =18, which is ≤20. \n\nBut how is the t_total computed as 6? \n\nIt seems like the note is calculating t_total as (k*l) / nl, which is 20 /3 =6.666, floored to 6. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nBecause if for each toast, each friend needs nl ml, then for each toast, the total drink is n * nl. So for t_total toasts, the total drink is t_total * n * nl. \n\nBut the note is calculating t_total as (k*l) / nl. \n\nWhich would imply that for each toast, the total drink is nl. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nBut given the note's explanation, it seems that the correct way to calculate the maximum total toasts is:\n\ntotal_drink_toasts = (k * l) // nl \n\ntotal_lime_toasts = (c * d) // 1 (since each toast requires 1 slice per friend, and there are n friends per toast, so total slices per toast is n. So total_lime_toasts = (c * d) // n \n\ntotal_salt_toasts = p // np \n\nThen, the minimum of these three values is the maximum total toasts possible, and then divided by n to get per friend. \n\nWait let's try this with the first sample. \n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 \n\nSo:\n\nk*l = 4*5=20 \n\nnl =3 \n\ntotal_drink_toasts = 20 //3 =6 \n\ntotal_lime_toasts = c*d=10*8=80. Each toast requires n slices (3), so 80//3 =26.666 → 26. \n\nBut the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. So this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. \n\nHow? \n\nEach lime is cut into d=8 slices. c=10 limes, so total slices is 10 *8=80. \n\nEach toast requires n slices (since each friend needs one slice per toast). So for one toast, n slices are needed. So total toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n = 80 //3 =26. \n\nBut the note says it's 80 toasts. So this suggests that each toast requires one slice, not n slices. \n\nAh! This is the key. \n\nThe problem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So total slices per toast is n. \n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be if each toast requires 1 slice. \n\nSo this suggests that the problem statement is saying that each toast requires one slice per friend, but the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts, which would be if each toast requires one slice. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nBut the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 *8 =80 toasts\". So it's assuming that each toast requires one slice. \n\nSo this suggests that the problem statement is that for each toast, each friend needs one slice, but the total number of slices per toast is 1, not n. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nLet me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs ... a slice of lime ... \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, n slices are needed. \n\nBut the note says that for the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be if each toast requires 1 slice. \n\nSo this suggests that the note is wrong, or the problem statement is different. \n\nBut the note is part of the problem, so it must be correct. \n\nSo, let's look at the first sample's note:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nSo according to this note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which is c*d =10*8=80. \n\nThis suggests that each toast requires 1 slice. \n\nSimilarly, for the drink, it's 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that each toast requires 3 ml of drink. \n\nAnd for the salt, it's 100 /1 =100 toasts, suggesting that each toast requires 1 gram of salt. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, each toast requires:\n\n- nl milliliters per friend → total for toast is n * nl.\n\n- 1 slice per friend → total for toast is n slices.\n\n- np grams per friend → total for toast is n * np.\n\nBut according to the note, for the first sample, the drink is enough for 6 toasts, which would require 6 * n * nl =6 *3*3 =54 ml. But the total drink is 20, which is less than 54. This is impossible. \n\nSo this suggests that the note is incorrect, or that the problem statement is different. \n\nBut since the note is part of the problem, it must be correct. So I must find a way to reconcile this. \n\nLet me look at the note's calculation for the first sample:\n\n- Drink: 20 /3 =6 toasts. \n\n- Limes: 10*8=80 toasts.\n\n- Salt: 100 /1 =100 toasts.\n\nThen, min(6, 80, 100) is 6, divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2. \n\nSo the logic here is that for each resource, the number of toasts possible is calculated as (resource amount) divided by (per toast requirement). \n\nBut what is the per toast requirement for each resource?\n\nFor the drink, it's 3 ml per toast. \n\nFor the limes, it's 1 slice per toast. \n\nFor the salt, it's 1 gram per toast. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, each toast requires:\n\n- nl ml per friend → total per toast is n * nl.\n\n- 1 slice per friend → total per toast is n slices.\n\n- np grams per friend → total per toast is n * np.\n\nSo why does the note say that for the first sample, the drink allows for 6 toasts? \n\nIf the per toast drink requirement is 3 ml, then it's 20 /3 =6.666, which floors to 6. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the per toast drink requirement should be n * nl =3*3",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available from the bottles.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available from the limes.\n   - **Salt**: Use the given grams of salt directly.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints for Toasts**:\n   - **Drink**: Each toast requires `nl` milliliters per friend, so for `n` friends, the total drink required per toast is `n * nl`. The number of toasts possible with the available drink is the total drink divided by this value.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Each toast requires one slice per friend, so for `n` friends, the total slices required per toast is `n`. The number of toasts possible with the available slices is the total slices divided by this value.\n   - **Salt**: Each toast requires `np` grams per friend, so for `n` friends, the total salt required per toast is `n * np`. The number of toasts possible with the available salt is the total salt divided by this value.\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the minimum of the values calculated for each resource. This minimum value is then divided by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split the input into individual integers\n    values = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = values\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Drink per toast (total for all friends)\n    drink_per_toast = n * nl\n    toasts_drink = total_drink // drink_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Slices per toast (n slices)\n    slices_per_toast = n\n    toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // slices_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate salt available\n    total_salt = p\n    # Salt per toast (total for all friends)\n    salt_per_toast = n * np\n    toasts_salt = total_salt // salt_per_toast\n    \n    # Find the minimum of the three\n    min_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n    \n    # Output the result\n    print(min_toasts)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. This total is then divided by the amount of drink needed per toast for all friends combined.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is obtained by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime. This total is divided by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt is divided by the amount of salt needed per toast for all friends combined.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum number of toasts possible from any of the resources is determined, and this value is printed as the result since it represents the limiting factor for the number of toasts each friend can make.",
