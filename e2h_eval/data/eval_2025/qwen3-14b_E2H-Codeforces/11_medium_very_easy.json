A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires per friend: nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters...\". So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices per toast is n slices. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nNow, the number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made with that resource, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor the drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the number of toasts possible from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, if the total_drink is not enough for even one toast, then it's zero.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast needs n slices. So toasts possible from limes is total_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast needs n * np grams. So toasts possible from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check the example given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, no: per toast, each friend needs nl=3 ml. So per toast, total for all friends is 3 *3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note. Then the limes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Each toast needs 3 slices (n=3). 80//3 is 26. But the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, no. Wait the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait in the note, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check. The total slices is 10 * 8 = 80. Each toast requires n slices (3). So 80 / 3 is 26.666, which would floor to 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Oh wait, no. Wait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But that seems wrong. Wait maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. But why?\n\nAh, perhaps I have the calculation wrong. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. Therefore, for the total number of toasts t, the total slices needed is t * n. So the maximum t possible from the limes is (c*d) // n. So in the first example, c*d is 10*8=80. Divided by n=3, gives 26.666, which is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's conflicting. Wait what's the note saying?\n\nIn the note, the example says:\n\nOverall the friends have 20 ml of drink. Enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, but according to my previous calculation, the drink would be 20/(n * nl) = 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, which is 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait that's a contradiction. So clearly I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the note. The note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait why is the drink enough for 6 toasts? Because 20 / 3 equals 6.666...? Wait 20 divided by 3 is 6.666, but they took the floor? But then why is that the number of toasts?\n\nWait this suggests that the drink calculation is total_drink divided by nl, not multiplied by n. So perhaps I have the problem backwards. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, total drink needed is t * n * nl.\n\nBut in the note, the total drink is 20, and they say it's enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl = 3 ml per toast. But that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the note is considering per toast per friend, but the total toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So total drink is t * n * nl. But in the note, the calculation is 20 / 3 = 6. So 20 is total drink, divided by 3 (nl?), giving 6. So that would be t = 6. So that would imply that the total drink is t * nl. Which would be t * nl = 20. So t = 20 / nl. But that would be the case if each toast requires nl per friend, but for one toast, each friend has one toast. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl.\n\nBut according to the note, they are calculating total_drink / nl. Which would be 20 /3 = 6.666, which is 6. So that's the number of toasts. But according to the correct formula, it should be 20/(n * nl) = 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, which would be 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these things. So if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml of drink. So total for all friends is n * t * nl ml. \n\nBut in the note, the total drink is 20. They say that it is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which implies that 20 = t * 3. So t is 6.666, but they take the floor. So that would mean that the total drink required is t * 3. Which would be for each toast, total drink is 3 ml. Which would be for one toast, each friend needs 1 ml (since 3 ml total for 3 friends). But the problem says that nl is 3. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait the first input line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'. So nl is 3, np is 1.\n\nSo the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that per toast, the total drink needed is 3 ml. Which would be for one toast, each friend uses 1 ml. But the problem says that each friend needs nl = 3 ml per toast. So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, this suggests that perhaps I have misread the problem. Let me re-check.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl ml.\n\nBut in the note, the total drink is 20. For t toasts, the total required is t * 3 * 3 = 9t. So 9t <= 20 → t is 2.222, so floor 2. Which is the answer given in the note. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So why is that?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the note is wrong, but that's impossible. So I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the note again.\n\nThe note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100/1=100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\n\nWait, why is the drink enough for 6 toasts? How does that calculation work?\n\nIf the drink is 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 ml per friend, but there are 3 friends. So for one toast, each friend uses 3 ml, so total per toast is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. For 6 toasts, that's 6 * 9 = 54 ml. But the total available is 20. That's way over.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So how?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the note is considering per toast, each friend needs nl ml. But the total for all toasts is t * nl per friend. So for each friend, they have t toasts, each requiring nl ml. So total per friend is t * nl. For all friends, it's n * t * nl. But the note says that the total drink is 20, which is equal to t * nl * n? Or perhaps the note is considering that for each toast, the total drink is nl per friend. But that would be per toast per friend. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. So total is n * t * nl.\n\nBut the note says that 20 / 3 = 6. So 20 is the total drink, divided by 3 (nl?), giving t = 6. So that would imply that the total drink is t * nl. Which would be for all friends combined. Which would imply that for each toast, all friends together use nl ml. Which would be different from what the problem says.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps I have misread the problem statement. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl.\n\nBut according to the note, the calculation is 20 / 3 = 6. Which would be 20 divided by nl (3), giving 6. So that would be t = 6. Which would require total drink of 6 * 3 = 18 ml. Which is possible. But why is that the case?\n\nThis suggests that the note's calculation is that for each toast, the total drink needed is nl per friend. But that would be for one toast, each friend needs nl, so total per toast is n * nl. But the note says that the total drink is divided by nl, which would give t = total_drink / nl. Which would be t * n * nl = total_drink? No, because that would be t * n * nl = total_drink → t = total_drink/(n * nl).\n\nBut according to the note, they are doing t = total_drink / nl. Which would be incorrect. Unless there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, the entire group needs nl milliliters. But that would be strange. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for example, if there are 3 friends and each toast requires 3 ml per friend, then for one toast, total drink is 3*3=9 ml.\n\nBut the note says that the total drink is 20, which is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which is nl. So that would suggest that per toast, the entire group uses nl ml. Which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nThis is very confusing. But the note must be correct. So perhaps the problem statement is different than what I thought.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the example input and output. For the first input:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. Output is 2.\n\nAccording to the note, the calculation is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the min is 6, divided by 3 gives 2.\n\nSo what is 6? Where does that come from?\n\nThe note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So 20 is the total drink. So the drink calculation is total_drink divided by nl. Which is 20 / 3 = 6.666, floored to 6.\n\nBut how does that relate to the number of toasts?\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of toasts possible from the drink is total_drink // nl. But that would be for each toast, the total drink is nl. Which would imply that for each toast, the entire group uses nl ml. Which is not what the problem says. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut given that the note says that, perhaps the problem statement is different. Maybe each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total number of toasts is t, and for each toast, each friend has one. So the total drink required is t * n * nl. However, the note says that the drink is 20, and the calculation is 20 / 3 = 6. So 20 = t * n * nl → t = 20/(n * nl) = 20/(3 * 3) = 20/9 = 2.222, which would be 2. Which is the answer given in the example. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the min is 6, divided by 3 gives 2. Which suggests that the 6 is the total number of toasts that can be made by the group, and then divided by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend. But that doesn't make sense. Because if the group can make 6 toasts, then each friend makes 6 toasts. But that would require that the resources are sufficient for 6 toasts.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which suggests that the total drink is sufficient for 6 toasts. So what is the correct way to compute that?\n\nLet me think again. Let's suppose that the answer is t, which is the number of toasts each friend can make. So for each friend, they make t toasts. So total for all friends is n * t toasts. Wait, no. Each toast is made by all friends. Like, for example, if they make one toast, all friends participate. So the number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So for the total drink, it's t * n * nl.\n\nSo the total drink available is k*l. So we have t * n * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl).\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: each toast requires n slices (one per friend), so total slices needed is t * n. So t * n ≤ c*d → t ≤ (c*d)/n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires n * np grams. So t * n * np ≤ p → t ≤ p/(n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values, floored.\n\nSo in the first example:\n\nk*l = 4*5 = 20.\n\nn * nl = 3 * 3 =9. So 20 /9 is 2.222 → floor 2.\n\nc*d is 10 *8=80. n is 3. So 80/3 = 26.666 → floor 26.\n\np/(n * np) is 100/(3*1)= 33.333 → floor 33.\n\nThe minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which is the correct answer. So why does the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nBecause the note is probably mistaken. Or perhaps the note is referring to something else. Or maybe the note is explaining the calculation incorrectly. But according to this logic, the correct answer is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. But according to our calculation, the drink allows for 20/(3 *3) = 2.222 toasts. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is calculating the number of toasts per friend. Wait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the 6 comes from somewhere. Let's see.\n\nIf the drink is 20 ml, and each toast per friend requires 3 ml, then for each friend, the number of toasts they can make is 20 / (3 * 3) = 2.222. But that's not what the note is saying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is considering that the total drink is enough for 6 toasts for all friends. So each toast requires 3 ml per friend, but for one toast, the total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. For 6 toasts, it's 6 * 9 = 54 ml, which is more than 20. That's not possible.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which suggests that the note is wrong. But that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\nSo the question is about the number of toasts per friend. Let's call this t. So each friend makes t toasts. For each toast, they need nl ml. So for each friend, total drink needed is t * nl. For all friends, it's n * t * nl.\n\nSimilarly, for the lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So for t toasts, each friend needs t slices. Total slices needed is n * t.\n\nSalt: each toast requires np grams per friend. For t toasts, each friend needs t * np grams. Total for all friends is n * t * np.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nn * t * nl ≤ k * l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nn * t ≤ c * d → t ≤ (c *d) / n\n\nn * t * np ≤ p → t ≤ p/(n * np)\n\nSo the answer is the minimum of these three values, floored.\n\nSo for the first example:\n\nk*l = 20, n * nl = 3*3=9 → 20/9 = 2.222 → floor 2.\n\nc*d=80, divided by n=3 → 26.666 → 26.\n\np/(n * np) = 100/(3*1) = 33.333 → 33.\n\nMinimum is 2 → answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if the constraint was t * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l)/nl. Which would be 20/3 = 6.666, floor 6. Then, the minimum of 6, 80, 100 is 6. Then divided by n=3, gives 2. Which is the answer.\n\nAh! So the note is taking the total drink divided by nl, which gives the maximum number of toasts per friend, assuming that each toast per friend requires nl ml. But that's not the case. Because for each toast, each friend requires nl ml. So for t toasts per friend, the total drink is n * t * nl. So the total drink must be >= n * t * nl.\n\nBut the note seems to be thinking that the total drink is >= t * nl, which would be the case if the total drink is for one friend. So the note is possibly wrong, but the sample output is correct with the approach I outlined earlier.\n\nBut how to reconcile the note's explanation with the correct approach?\n\nThe note says:\n\nthe answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nWhich suggests that the 6 is the maximum number of toasts that can be made for all friends (i.e., total toasts), and then divided by the number of friends to get per friend.\n\nBut that would be the case if the constraints were:\n\ntotal toasts T, and each friend makes T / n toasts. But that's not the case. The problem says that all friends make the same number of toasts. So if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is t. Each toast involves all friends. So for example, if each friend makes 2 toasts, then there are 2 toasts made in total. Each toast is made by all friends.\n\nSo the note's explanation is wrong, but the sample output is correct with our approach.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate for each resource the maximum t that satisfies the constraints, and take the minimum of those.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nanswer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nYes. So for the first sample:\n\ndrink_toasts = 20 // (3 * 3) = 20//9=2.\n\nlime_toasts = 80//3=26.\n\nsalt_toasts=100//(3*1)=33. So min is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThe note's explanation seems to have an error, but the sample output is correct with this approach.\n\nAnother example: the third input is ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'].\n\nSo n=10, k=1000, l=1000. So total drink is 1e6 ml.\n\nnl is 50. So drink_toasts is (1e6) / (10 *50) = 1e6 /500 = 2000.\n\nlime_toasts: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575. Divided by n=10 → 57.5 → 57.\n\nsalt_toasts: p=1, divided by (10 *1) = 10 → 0. So the min is 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code needs to compute these three values and take the minimum.\n\nSo the plan for the code is:\n\nRead the input line as integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntotal_salt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(total_drink_toasts, total_lime_toasts, total_salt_toasts)\n\nPrint result.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this with the second example in the input:\n\nSample input line 2: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000.\n\nnl is 4. So drink_toasts is 1000/(5*4) = 1000/20=50.\n\nlime: c=1, d=19 → total slices 19. divided by n=5 → 3 (since 19//5=3).\n\nsalt: p=90, divided by (5*3)=15 → 90//15=6. So min(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of '3'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers. For example, the first line is split into 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, then convert to integers.\n\nThen compute the three values as above.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead from stdin. The input is a single line, but the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is the first and only line contains positive integers... So the code should read a single line.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is a list of three examples. But that's probably part of the test cases. For the actual code, the input is a single line.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlimes = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nans = min(drink, limes, salt)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the first sample input:\n\nInput line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\ndrink = (4*5) // (3*3) → 20//9=2.\n\nlimes: (10*8) //3 → 80//3=26.\n\nsalt: 100 // (3*1) → 33. min(2, 26, 33) → 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → drink is 100*10/(5*4)= 1000/20=50. limes: 1*19//5 = 3. salt: 90/(5*3) = 90/15=6 → min is 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → drink: 1000*1000/(10*50) = 1,000,000 / 500 = 2000. limes: 25*23=575 //10 → 57. salt: 1/(10*1) = 0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the line, split into the variables, compute the three values, take min, print.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if any of the denominators is zero? But the problem says all inputs are positive integers. So no division by zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when the division results in zero. For example, if p is less than n * np, then salt_toasts is zero. So the answer is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires `nl` milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and `np` grams of salt per friend. For `t` toasts, each friend will need `t * nl` milliliters of drink, `t` slices of lime, and `t * np` grams of salt.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total available resources:\n   - Total drink available: `k * l` milliliters.\n   - Total lime slices available: `c * d`.\n   - Total salt available: `p` grams.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: Calculate the maximum number of toasts possible for each resource:\n   - Drink: `(k * l) // (n * nl)`\n   - Lime slices: `(c * d) // n`\n   - Salt: `p // (n * np)`\n4. **Result**: The answer is the minimum of the three values calculated above, as it represents the limiting resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())\n    total_drink = k * l\n    drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n    \n    salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n    \n    result = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into individual integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n- **Resource Calculation**: The total amount of each resource is calculated, and the maximum number of toasts each resource can support is determined by integer division.\n- **Determine Limiting Resource**: The minimum value among the calculated maximum toasts from each resource is taken as the result, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limits.",
