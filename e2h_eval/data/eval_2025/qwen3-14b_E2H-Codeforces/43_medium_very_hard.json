He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a string is formed in a specific way. Let me break down the steps:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all a's, and there's at least one 'a'.\n2. B appends some number of 'b's to the end. So after this step, the string has a's followed by b's. And there's at least one 'b' here too. Because the problem says that after B's step, there's at least one a and one b.\n3. Then C appends some number of 'c's. The number of c's added must be equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string at that point (before adding the c's). Also, it's possible that the number of c's equals both a and b counts.\n\nSo the final string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters in the string must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. For example, if there's a 'c' before some 'b's, that's not allowed.\n\nSo first thing to check: the string must consist of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. If the string doesn't follow this order, then it's automatically invalid.\n\nFor example, the sample input 'bbacc' is invalid because after the a's and b's, there's a c, but the order of the letters isn't correct. Wait, let me check the second example. The input is 'bbacc'. Let's see:\n\nThe string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. So the order is b's followed by a, which is invalid. Because the original steps are A adds a's, B adds b's. So the initial string after B's step is a's followed by b's. So any valid string must have all a's first, then b's, then c's. So if the string has a 'b' followed by an 'a', that's invalid. So the first check is to make sure that the string is in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo how do I check that? Well, the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So the characters must be in non-decreasing order according to their positions. For example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b' or 'a', etc.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is in the form a's followed by b's followed by c's. How to do that?\n\nI can check the order of characters. For example, iterate through the string and ensure that once a 'b' is encountered, there are no more 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there are no more 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nAlternatively, split the string into three parts: the a part, the b part, and the c part. For example, the string can be divided into a section of a's, then a section of b's, then a section of c's. So the entire string must consist of these three parts, and each part can be empty except that the first two parts can't be empty? No, wait. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n- A's string has at least one a. So after step 1, the string has some a's (count >=1).\n- Then B appends some b's. The problem says that after this step, there's at least one a and one b. So the number of b's added is at least 1. So after step 2, the string has a's (count >=1) followed by b's (count >=1).\n- Then C appends some c's. The number of c's is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string before adding the c's. So the count of c's can be equal to the count of a's (which is the original count from step 1), or equal to the count of b's (from step 2). Also, the count of c's can be zero? No, because C appends some number of c's. But the problem says that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. So since in step 2, there are at least one a and one b, then the count of c's must be at least 1. Because the number of a's is at least 1, and the number of b's is at least 1. So when C appends, the number of c's is either equal to the number of a's (which is >=1) or to the number of b's (>=1). So the count of c's is at least 1.\n\nTherefore, the final string must have:\n\n- At least one a, at least one b, at least one c.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the initial string from A has some number of a's (so at least one). Then B appends some number of b's (so at least one). Then C appends some number of c's (so at least one). Therefore, the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. So if the input string has zero a's, or zero b's, or zero c's, it's automatically invalid.\n\nSo first, check that the string contains at least one a, one b, and one c. But wait, for example, if the string is \"aabbcc\", then the counts are a=2, b=2, c=2. Then the c's count is equal to the number of a's (2) and also to the number of b's (2). So that would be acceptable.\n\nBut if the string is \"aabcc\", then the counts are a=2, b=1, c=2. Then the number of c's (2) is equal to the number of a's (2). So that's acceptable.\n\nBut for the string to be valid, the order must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. Also, the counts must satisfy that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's (original a's) or the number of b's (original b's).\n\nSo the steps for checking the string:\n\n1. Check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, the order must be correct. For example, no 'a's after 'b's, no 'b's after 'c's, etc.\n\n2. Check that there's at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\n3. Then, check that the count of c's equals either the count of a's (original a's) or the count of b's (original b's).\n\nBut how do we find the original counts of a's and b's? Because in the final string, the count of a's is the same as the original a's (since B only added b's). Similarly, the count of b's is the same as the original b's (since C only added c's). The count of c's is the number added by C, which must be equal to the original a's count or original b's count.\n\nSo, for the final string, the count of a's is original_a, the count of b's is original_b, and count of c's is original_c = original_a or original_b.\n\nSo, in the final string, the count of c's must be equal to the count of a's (original_a) or the count of b's (original_b).\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nCheck the order (a's then b's then c's), and that there's at least one of each. Then check that the count of c's is equal to the count of a's or the count of b's.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input: 'aaabccc' → counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. The c count is 3, which equals the a count (3). So yes.\n\nIn the third example: 'aabc' → counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. The c count is 1, which equals the b count (1). So yes.\n\nBut for the second example: 'bbacc' → the order is b, then a, which is invalid. So even though the counts may be okay, the order is wrong, so output is no.\n\nSo, the first thing is to check the order. How to check that?\n\nWe can check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the letters. For example, 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So the entire string must be a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. So the characters must not decrease. For example, the string can be checked by ensuring that each character is not less than the previous one.\n\nWait, but 'a' < 'b' < 'c', so the string should be such that each character is >= the previous one. So for example, 'aabbc' is okay. But 'abba' is not, because after the first 'b', there's an 'a'.\n\nSo, the first check is that the string is in non-decreasing order. But how to check that?\n\nWe can loop through the string and check that for each i from 1 to len(s)-1, s[i] >= s[i-1]. If this is true for all, then the order is correct.\n\nBut also, the string must consist of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, for example, the string could be all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So the code for checking the order is:\n\ndef is_valid_order(s):\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nYes, that would work. Because if the string is in non-decreasing order, then the letters are grouped as a's, then b's, then c's. Because once a 'b' appears, all subsequent characters must be >= 'b', so they can't be 'a's. Similarly, once a 'c' appears, all subsequent characters must be 'c's.\n\nSo that's the first check.\n\nOnce that's done, check that there is at least one a, one b, and one c. Because if the string is like 'aabbcc', then it's okay. But if it's 'aabb', then it's missing c's. So:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string\ncount_b = number of 'b's\ncount_c = number of 'c's\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0 → invalid.\n\nThen, check whether count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all those conditions are met, then return YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the count_c is equal to count_a and count_b? Like if count_a = count_b = count_c. Then it's allowed.\n\nSo the logic is:\n\nif (count_c == count_a) or (count_c == count_b) → yes.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCheck:\n\n1. The string is in non-decreasing order (so a's followed by b's followed by c's)\n\n2. There's at least one a, one b, one c.\n\n3. count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all three conditions are satisfied, output YES, else NO.\n\nLet me test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3. So count_c equals count_a → yes.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the order is b, b, a, c, c. The third character is a, which is less than previous (b). So the order check fails → returns NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → order is a, a, b, c → correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. count_c equals count_b → yes.\n\nAnother example: 'abcc' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=2. count_c is 2, which is not equal to count_a (1) or count_b (1). So returns NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. count_c is 1, which equals count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns NO.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. So no. But if the string was 'aabbc' → order is correct. But the count_c is 1, which is not equal to a (2) or b (2). So returns no.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So yes.\n\nAnother example: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → count_a=4, count_b=4, count_c=4. So count_c equals both a and b → yes.\n\nNow, what about a string that has a's followed by c's and then b's? Like 'aaccb'? No, because the order is not non-decreasing. The 'c' is followed by 'b', which is smaller. So the order check would fail.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nCheck if the string is in non-decreasing order. If not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if there's at least one a, one b, one c. If not, output NO.\n\nElse, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nCheck if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo now, code in Python.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut how to check the order? Let's code that.\n\nFor example:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nBut wait, in Python, we can loop through the string and check for this condition.\n\nOnce that is done, check the counts.\n\nBut how to count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nThen, check if count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nIf any of them is zero, then return NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf yes, return YES else NO.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the order check. For example, the string 'aabbcc' is okay. The order is non-decreasing. But what about a string like 'aabbaacc'? No, because after the first two b's, there's a 'a' again. So in that case, the order check would fail.\n\nSo the code for the order check is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. counts: a=3, b=1, c=3 → yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order is not correct. So output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → no (no c's).\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → no (no b's).\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 1. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So no.\n\nNow, what about a string that has all a's, then b's, then c's, but the count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCheck for order.\n\nThen check counts.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input string.\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen, check order:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nBut in Python, exit() is not the best way. Maybe, we can use a flag.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\ndef is_valid_order(s):\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nThen, proceed.\n\nOnce that is done, check counts.\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the order is correct, but the counts are not?\n\nLike 'aabbc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1 → no.\n\nBut the code would check that count_c is 1, which is not equal to 2 or 2 → returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2 is 'bbacc' → order check would fail. Because the third character is 'a' which is less than previous 'b'.\n\nSo the code would print NO.\n\nSample Input 3 is 'aabc' → order is correct. counts are 2,1,1. So yes.\n\nSo the code would return YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbcc' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=2, count_c=2. So count_c is 2, which equals count_b → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbccc' → count_c is 3. count_b is 2. count_a is 1. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nBut wait, the code would check count_c (3) against count_a (1) and count_b (2). So no. So returns no.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are 2, 2, 2. So count_c equals both count_a and count_b. So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where the string is 'abc' → yes.\n\nCase where the string is 'abbbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 1, count_b is 3. So count_c equals count_a → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → yes.\n\nWhat about 'abbbc' → the order is correct. counts are 1,3,1. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → order is correct. count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So no.\n\nBut if the string is 'aabbc' → the code would return no.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 1. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the string 'a' → no, because no b or c. But the code checks for count_a, count_b, count_c. So count_b and count_c are zero → returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → no, because count_c is zero.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, what about the string 'ac' → no, because count_b is zero.\n\nNow, what about the string 'abcc' → count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=2. count_c is not equal to 1 or 1. So returns no.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the C appends some number of c's. The number of c's must be equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string before adding the c's. In this case, the original string before adding c's is a's followed by b's. So the count of a's is 1, count of b's is 1. So the number of c's added must be 1 or 1. But the count of c's is 2. So it's invalid. So code returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → count_c is 1. The original a count is 1, original b count is 3. So the c count is 1, which equals a's count. So valid.\n\nSo code returns yes.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the string.\n\nCheck the order.\n\nCheck counts.\n\nSo the code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check order\nvalid_order = True\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n        valid_order = False\n        break\n\nif not valid_order:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are 2,2,2. So count_c is 2, which equals count_a and count_b. So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3. So yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order is invalid. So output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1 → yes.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → count_c=1, count_a=2, count_b=2 → no.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabcc' → count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=2 → yes.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabcc' → the order is correct. count_c is 2, which equals count_a (2). So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbcc' → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=2. So count_c is not equal to 1 or 3. So returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All a's, then one b, then one c. Like 'aaabcc' → count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nBut if the string is 'aaabccc' → count_c=3 equals count_a=3 → yes.\n\nEdge case 2: 'abc' → yes.\n\nEdge case 3: 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nEdge case 4: 'a' → no.\n\nEdge case 5: 'ab' → no.\n\nEdge case 6: 'ac' → no.\n\nEdge case 7: 'bbc' → order is correct. But count_a is 0 → no.\n\nEdge case 8: 'aabcc' → yes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbcc' → count_c is 2. count_a=4, count_b=3. So no.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by following specific steps where characters are appended in a particular order and under certain constraints. The string must be composed of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's, with the number of 'c's being equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before appending the 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Order Check**: Ensure the string is in non-decreasing order of characters, i.e., all 'a's first, followed by 'b's, then 'c's.\n2. **Presence Check**: Verify that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n3. **Count Check**: Confirm that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is in non-decreasing order\nvalid_order = True\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n        valid_order = False\n        break\n\nif not valid_order:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The loop iterates through the string to ensure each character is not less than the previous one.

If any of these characters are missing, the string is invalid.\n3. **Count Check**: After confirming the presence of all three characters, we check if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's. If it does, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions in linear time, ensuring the solution is both optimal and correct.",
