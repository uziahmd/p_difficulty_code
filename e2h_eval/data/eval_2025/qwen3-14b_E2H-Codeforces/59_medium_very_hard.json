    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the task is to find the number of arrays of N sets that can be rearranged such that each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. And each set can contain integers from 1 to K, with no duplicates in the set. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a child relationship implies. A set A is a child of B if for every x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1}, then B must have 2. If A has {1,2}, then B must have 2 and 3. \n\nThe key here is that when we arrange the sets in some order, each previous set must be a child of the next. But since we can rearrange the array of sets, we need to find all possible arrays where such a permutation exists. \n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about the constraints that the sets must satisfy in order for such a permutation to exist. \n\nLet me think: For the entire array of sets, there must be a way to order them so that each is a child of the next. Let's think about the properties of the sets. \n\nSuppose we have a sequence S_1', S_2', ..., S_N'. Each S_i' is a child of S_{i+1}'. So for every element x in S_i', there's an x+1 in S_{i+1}'. \n\nThis seems like a chain of dependencies. For example, if there's a set that contains x, then the next set in the permutation must contain x+1. So, in the entire permutation, the elements in the sets must form a kind of chain where each element's presence in a set requires a higher element in the next set. \n\nBut since the permutation can be any order, perhaps the sets can be arranged in a way that their elements are ordered in a certain way. \n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the structure of the sets. For the entire array to be rearranged into a valid sequence, there must be a topological order where each set is a child of the next. \n\nBut what's the necessary and sufficient condition on the sets themselves? \n\nMaybe the sets can be ordered in a way where their elements are non-overlapping in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the sets can be ordered such that for any two sets S and T, if S comes before T in the permutation, then S is a child of T. But that's not possible unless there's a hierarchy. \n\nWait, but the permutation only requires that consecutive elements satisfy the child relationship. So maybe the entire sequence can be ordered such that each set is a child of the next. This suggests that the sets can be ordered in a way that their elements are \"compatible\" in this chain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sets can be grouped in a way that their elements form a chain where each set in the permutation can contribute to the next. \n\nBut how do we model this for counting? \n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Let's imagine that we have all the sets in the array. For there to exist a permutation where each S_i' is a child of S_{i+1}', the sets must form a DAG where there's a topological order. But since the permutation is a linear order, perhaps the sets can be ordered in such a way that each set is a child of the next. \n\nBut how to model the possible sets and their relationships. \n\nAlternatively, think about the elements in the sets. For any element x in any set, there must be a way to have x+1 in a set that comes after it in the permutation. \n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, maybe the sets can be ordered such that all elements in the first set are such that their x+1s are present in the next set, etc. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this by considering the elements' positions in the chain. \n\nAnother angle: Let's consider that each set can be represented by a subset of {1, 2, ..., K}. Let's think about the maximum element in each set. Suppose that in the permutation, the sets are ordered in decreasing order of their maximum elements. \n\nFor example, suppose that a set S has maximum element m. Then, the next set in the permutation must have a maximum element at least m. Wait, no. Because if S has an element m, then according to the child condition, S must have m+1 in the next set. Wait, no. Wait, S is a child of the next set. So for each x in S, there must be x+1 in the next set. So if S has an element m, then the next set must contain m+1. Therefore, the maximum element of the next set must be at least m+1. \n\nTherefore, if we arrange the sets in a sequence where each set's maximum is strictly less than the next set's maximum, then this would ensure that for the current set's elements, their x+1's are present in the next set. Wait, no. Suppose the current set has elements up to m. The next set's maximum is m+1. But the current set could have elements that are less than m. For example, suppose current set has elements {1, 3}, and next set has maximum 4. Then, for x=1, the next set must have 2. But if the next set doesn't have 2, then the condition is violated. \n\nSo arranging based on maximum elements isn't sufficient. \n\nHmm. So the problem is more complex than that. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the entire array of sets. For there to be a permutation where each S_i' is a child of S_{i+1'}, the sets must be such that for any element x in any set, there exists a set later in the permutation (i.e., after it) that contains x+1. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAlternatively, since the permutation can be arranged in any order, perhaps the sets can be ordered in such a way that the sets form a chain where each set's elements are covered by the next set's elements plus one. \n\nBut perhaps the key is that for each x in 1..K, the number of sets that contain x must be less than or equal to the number of sets that contain x+1. Because, if you have a set containing x, then in the permutation, there must be a set after it that contains x+1. So for each x, the count of sets containing x cannot exceed the count of sets containing x+1. \n\nWait, that might be a necessary condition. Let me think. Suppose that there are more sets containing x than those containing x+1. Then, in the permutation, each set containing x must be followed by a set containing x+1. But if there are more sets with x than x+1, then some set containing x would have to come after a set containing x+1, which would violate the condition. \n\nSo this seems like a necessary condition. Is it also sufficient?\n\nIf for all x in 1..K, the number of sets containing x is <= the number of sets containing x+1, then can we arrange the permutation? \n\nLet me think. For example, consider K=2, N=2. Suppose we have two sets: one containing {1}, and another containing {2}. Then for x=1, count is 1, and x+1=2, count is 1. So the condition holds. We can arrange them as [ {1}, {2} ] which satisfies the condition. Also, if we reverse the order, then {2} is a child of {1}? No, because {2} has 2, which would require {1} to have 3. Which it doesn't. So the reverse order is invalid. But since we can arrange them in the correct order, the condition is satisfied. \n\nAnother example: suppose K=2, and we have three sets. Suppose two sets contain {1}, and one set contains {2}. Then for x=1, count is 2, x+1=2 count is 1. Which violates the condition. So this would not be allowed. \n\nSo the necessary condition is that for all x in 1..K, the count of sets containing x is <= count of sets containing x+1. Also, for x=K, x+1 is K+1, which is outside the range. So for x=K, the count must be zero. Because otherwise, there's no x+1. \n\nWait, that's an important point. For x=K, any set containing K must have a set after it that contains K+1. But since K+1 is beyond the allowed values, that's impossible. Therefore, any set that contains K cannot be in the permutation unless there's a set after it that contains K+1, which is impossible. Therefore, in the entire array of sets, there must be no sets that contain K. Because otherwise, there's no way to arrange the permutation. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's think again. Suppose N=1. Then the array has one set. Since there's no next set, the condition is automatically satisfied. So for N=1, the set can contain K. \n\nAh, right. Because the condition is that there exists a permutation where each S_i' is a child of S_{i+1}'. For N=1, there are no pairs to check. So the set can contain any elements. \n\nSo the necessary condition for the entire array is that for each x in 1..K, the number of sets containing x must be <= the number of sets containing x+1. Except for x=K, where the number of sets containing x must be zero. Because if x=K, then any set containing it must be followed by a set containing K+1, which is impossible. Therefore, the only way for the array to be valid is that for x=K, the number of sets containing it is zero. \n\nWait, but if there is a set containing K, but it's the last set in the permutation. Then, since there's no next set, the condition is satisfied. Because the condition applies only to consecutive pairs. So, if a set containing K is the last in the permutation, then there's no need for a next set. \n\nAh, that's a crucial point. So the condition is that for any set that contains x, there must be a set that comes after it in the permutation that contains x+1. \n\nSo, for x=K, any set that contains K must be placed in the permutation such that there is a set after it that contains K+1. But since K+1 is not allowed, that's impossible. Therefore, any set containing K must be the last set in the permutation. However, even that is not possible because the set containing K must be followed by a set that contains K+1. Unless it's the last set. \n\nWait, the condition is that for each element x in the set, there exists an x+1 in the next set. So if a set S is the last in the permutation, then it's allowed to have elements x where there's no x+1 in any other set. Because there's no next set. So, for example, if a set S contains K, and it is the last set in the permutation, then it's allowed. \n\nSo the previous idea about the counts was incorrect. \n\nSo the necessary condition is that for all x in 1..K-1, the number of sets that contain x is <= the number of sets that contain x+1. Because for each occurrence of x in a set, there must be a corresponding occurrence of x+1 in a later set. However, for x=K, there's no such requirement, as long as those sets are placed in the last position of the permutation. \n\nBut how do we model this? \n\nLet me think again. Let's imagine that we have a permutation of the sets. Let's say that in this permutation, each set S_i' has elements such that for any x in S_i', there exists a set S_j' with j > i that contains x+1. \n\nSo, for each x in 1..K, the number of times x appears across all sets must be <= the number of times x+1 appears across all sets, except for x=K. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because if a set contains x and is the last in the permutation, then there's no need for x+1. \n\nBut if there are multiple sets containing x, how can they be placed? For example, suppose there are two sets containing x. Then, each of these sets must be placed before some set containing x+1. But if there's only one set containing x+1, then one of the two sets containing x would have to be placed before that set, and the other would have to be placed after. But if the other is placed after, then that set containing x would need to be followed by a set containing x+1. However, if that set is the last one, then there's no such set. \n\nTherefore, the total number of occurrences of x must be <= the number of occurrences of x+1. Because each occurrence of x must be matched with an occurrence of x+1 in a later set. \n\nBut for x=K, there's no x+1, so the count of x must be zero. \n\nWait, no. Because if there's a set containing K, and it's the last in the permutation, then it's allowed. So the count of K can be non-zero, but the count of K+1 (which is zero) must be >= count of K. Which is impossible unless count of K is zero. \n\nAh! So for x=K, the count of x must be <= count of x+1, but x+1 is K+1, which is not present. So count of x+1 is zero. Therefore, count of K must be zero. \n\nBut that contradicts the earlier example where N=1 and K=2, and the set {2} is allowed. \n\nWait, in that case, the count of K (which is 2) is 1. But according to the condition, the count of K must be <= count of K+1 (which is zero). So 1 <= 0 is false. But the array is allowed. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Which means my previous reasoning is wrong. \n\nLet me re-examine. \n\nThe condition for the entire array is that there exists a permutation of the sets such that each S_i is a child of S_{i+1}. \n\nIn the case of N=1 and K=2, the array has one set. There's no next set, so the condition is satisfied regardless of the elements in the set. \n\nSo, for x=K, the count can be non-zero, as long as there is a way to arrange the permutation. \n\nBut how does that fit into the general condition? \n\nLet me think again. For each x in the entire array of sets, the number of sets that contain x must be <= the number of sets that contain x+1, except for x=K. \n\nBut that seems not correct. \n\nLet me think of the example where N=2, K=2. Suppose we have two sets: S1 = {2}, S2 = {2}. \n\nCan we arrange them in a permutation such that S1 is a child of S2? \n\nNo. Because S1 contains 2, so S2 must contain 3. Which it doesn't. \n\nBut if we arrange them as [S2, S1], then S2 contains 2, and S1 must contain 3. Which it doesn't. So neither arrangement works. Therefore, this array is invalid. \n\nBut according to the previous idea, the count of x=2 is 2, and the count of x=3 is zero. Which would imply that the array is invalid, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: N=1, K=2, set {2}. Then the array is valid. Here, the count of x=2 is 1, and x+1 is 3, which is zero. But the array is valid. \n\nSo the previous idea that count(x) <= count(x+1) for all x is not correct. \n\nSo what's the correct condition?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph. Each set is a node. There's a directed edge from set A to set B if A is a child of B. Then, the problem requires that the array of sets can be arranged in a topological order. \n\nBut since the array can be permuted, we need that the entire collection of sets forms a DAG, and there's a topological order. However, since the edges are determined by the child relationships between pairs of sets, which depends on their contents. \n\nBut this seems too abstract. How can we model this for counting purposes?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as follows. For the entire array of sets, there must exist a permutation where each set is a child of the next. Let's imagine that in this permutation, the sets are ordered in such a way that for each set S_i, all elements in S_i are such that their x+1 is present in S_{i+1}. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nPerhaps the problem can be transformed into a dynamic programming problem. Let's think about the elements and their dependencies. \n\nEach element x can be thought of as needing to be \"covered\" by elements x+1 in the next set. \n\nBut since the sets can be arranged in any order, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the number of sets that contain each x, and ensuring that for each x, the number of times x appears in the sets is less than or equal to the number of times x+1 appears. Except for x=K, which can be present as long as they are in the last set. \n\nBut how to handle that? \n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose that we have a valid sequence of sets. Then, the sets can be arranged in a way where each set has elements that are \"covered\" by the next. \n\nLet me think of the elements as forming a chain. For example, if there's a set containing x, then somewhere in the permutation after that set, there must be a set containing x+1. \n\nSo, for the entire array, the number of times x appears must be less than or equal to the number of times x+1 appears. Because each occurrence of x must be matched with an occurrence of x+1. \n\nBut for x=K, there's no x+1. So, the number of times x=K appears must be zero. Because otherwise, there's no way to match them. \n\nWait, but in the N=1 case, it's allowed. So this suggests that the condition is that for x < K, the count of x is <= count of x+1. And for x=K, the count can be anything as long as there are no sets containing K that are not the last in the permutation. \n\nBut how can that be modeled? \n\nAlternatively, think of the entire array as being able to be ordered in a way that all elements are \"processed\" in order. For example, the sets can be ordered such that for each x, all sets containing x are placed before the sets containing x+1. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each x from 1 to K, the number of sets that contain x must be <= the number of sets that contain x+1. Except for x=K, where it can be any number. \n\nBut in the N=1 case, the count for x=K can be non-zero. However, according to this condition, since x=K is allowed to have any count, but the count for x=K-1 must be <= count of x=K. \n\nBut in the N=1 case, if K=2, and the set contains {2}, then the count of x=2 is 1. The count of x=1 is zero. So for x=1, count(1) = 0 <= count(2)=1. For x=2, no constraint. So this satisfies the condition. \n\nBut in the earlier example where N=2, K=2, and both sets contain {2}, then count(2) is 2, and count(1) is zero. So for x=1, 0 <= 2. For x=2, no constraint. But the array is invalid. \n\nSo why is that? Because even though the count conditions are satisfied, the array is invalid. \n\nSo this suggests that the count conditions are necessary but not sufficient. \n\nHmm. So what's missing here?\n\nIn that example, the count conditions are satisfied (count(x) for x=1 is 0, which is <= count(2) = 2), but the array is invalid. \n\nSo the count conditions are not sufficient. \n\nThus, the initial idea is incorrect. \n\nAlternative idea: For each x in 1..K, the number of sets containing x must be <= the number of sets containing x+1. Additionally, for x=K, the count must be zero. \n\nBut in the N=1 case, this would require that count(K) =0. Which is not correct. \n\nSo that's not the right approach. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nSuppose we have a valid permutation. Let's imagine that the permutation is S_1', S_2', ..., S_N'. \n\nFor each element x in any set S_i', there must be a set S_j' with j>i that contains x+1. \n\nTherefore, for each x, the number of times x appears across all sets must be less than or equal to the number of times x+1 appears across all sets. Because each occurrence of x must be matched with an occurrence of x+1 in a later set. \n\nBut for x=K, there is no x+1. So the count of x=K must be zero. Because if there is any occurrence of x=K, then it must be matched with an occurrence of x+1=K+1, which doesn't exist. Hence, the count of x=K must be zero. \n\nWait, but that contradicts the N=1 case. \n\nAh! Wait, in the N=1 case, the set containing x=K is allowed. Because there's no next set. So the occurrence of x=K is not required to be matched. \n\nSo the condition is: for x in 1..K-1, the count of x must be <= count of x+1. And for x=K, the count can be any value. \n\nBut how can that be? Because if there's a set containing x=K and it's not the last in the permutation, then it needs to be matched with a set containing x+1=K+1, which is impossible. \n\nAh! So the count of x=K must be zero. Because even if it's the last set, it's allowed. But how does that fit with the count condition? \n\nLet me think: For x=K, if there is a set containing x, then it can be placed as the last set in the permutation. So there's no need to have x+1 in any set. \n\nBut then, the count of x=K can be non-zero. \n\nBut according to the previous logic, for x=K-1, the count of x=K-1 must be <= count of x=K. Because each occurrence of x=K-1 must be matched with an occurrence of x=K. \n\nBut if x=K has a count of c, then the count of x=K-1 can be up to c. \n\nSo, for example, if K=2, x=2 can have count c. Then x=1's count can be up to c. \n\nBut for x=2, there's no constraint. \n\nSo the condition is that for all x in 1..K-1, count(x) <= count(x+1). \n\nAnd for x=K, no condition. \n\nBut then, in the earlier example where N=2, K=2, and both sets are {2}, then count(x=1) is 0, which is <= count(x=2) = 2. So this satisfies the condition. But the array is invalid. \n\nWait, why is that array invalid? \n\nBecause if we try to arrange the two sets {2} and {2} in any order, then each set contains 2, and the next set must contain 3. Which it doesn't. So the array is invalid. \n\nBut according to the count condition, it should be valid. \n\nSo this shows that the count condition is not sufficient. \n\nWhat's the problem here? \n\nThe count condition says that for x=1, count(x) is 0 <= count(2)=2. But the actual problem is that the sets containing x=2 are not matched with any sets containing x=3. \n\nAh! Because for x=K, which is 2 in this case, there's no x+1. So, the count of x=K can be anything, but for each occurrence of x=K, there must be no set after it. Which implies that all sets containing x=K must be placed in the last position of the permutation. \n\nBut if there are multiple sets containing x=K, they must all be placed as the last set. Which is impossible unless there's only one set. \n\nSo, the count of x=K must be <= 1. Because you can't have two sets containing K in the same permutation, since they would both need to be the last set. \n\nAh! So, for x=K, the count must be <= 1. \n\nBut wait, what if N=2 and K=2, and the sets are {2} and {1}? \n\nThen, count(1)=1, count(2)=1. For x=1, count(1) <= count(2) (1<=1). For x=2, count(2) =1 <= 1 (if we assume that for x=K, count must be <=1). \n\nThen, the permutation could be [ {1}, {2} ] which is valid. \n\nBut if the sets are {2} and {2}, then count(2)=2. Which is greater than 1, and thus invalid. \n\nSo the count for x=K must be <= 1. \n\nSimilarly, for x=K-1, count(x) must be <= count(x+1). Which for x=K-1 is count(K-1) <= count(K). But count(K) can be at most 1. So count(K-1) <= 1. \n\nThis seems to suggest that for each x, the count(x) is bounded by the count(x+1), which in turn is bounded by count(x+2), etc. \n\nThis leads to a chain of constraints. For example:\n\ncount(K) <= 1 \n\ncount(K-1) <= count(K) => count(K-1) <= 1 \n\ncount(K-2) <= count(K-1) => count(K-2) <= 1 \n\nand so on, down to count(1) <= 1. \n\nSo this would imply that for all x in 1..K, the count(x) is <= 1. \n\nBut that can't be correct. For example, in the first sample input, N=2, K=2. The output is 11. Let's see: \n\nThe first sample input is N=2 and K=2. The valid arrays include, for example, [ { }, { } ], [ { }, {1} ], [ { }, {1,2} ], [ { }, {2} ], [ {1}, { } ], [ {1}, {1,2} ], [ {1}, {2} ], [ {1,2}, { } ], [ {1,2}, {1} ], [ {2}, { } ], [ {2}, {1} ].\n\nLooking at the counts for x=1 and x=2:\n\nFor example, the array [ {1}, {1,2} ] has count(1) = 2 (since both sets contain 1?), no. Wait:\n\nWait, the first set is {1}, which contains 1. The second set is {1,2}, which contains 1 and 2. So count(1) is 2 (appears in both sets), count(2) is 1 (only in the second set). \n\nBut according to the earlier condition, count(1) must be <= count(2), which is 2 <= 1? No, that's not true. But this array is valid. \n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier analysis. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh no, I think I made a mistake in understanding the counts. \n\nThe count for x=1 is the number of sets that contain x. So in the array [ {1}, {1,2} ], the count for x=1 is 2 (both sets contain 1). The count for x=2 is 1 (only the second set contains 2). \n\nAccording to the previous condition, for x=1, count(1) must be <= count(2). But 2 <= 1 is false. Yet this array is considered valid. \n\nThis indicates that the earlier conditions are not correct. \n\nSo what's going on here? \n\nLet me look at this example. The array [ {1}, {1,2} ] is valid because we can arrange it as [ {1}, {1,2} ]. \n\nNow, for the first set {1}, which contains 1. The next set {1,2} must contain 2. Which it does. So this satisfies the condition. \n\nBut according to the previous count-based conditions, count(1) is 2, count(2) is 1. So 2 > 1. Which would suggest that the array is invalid, but it's actually valid. \n\nThis shows that the earlier count conditions are incorrect. \n\nSo the previous approach is wrong. \n\nThis suggests that the problem is more complex and requires a different approach. \n\nAlternative idea: Let's think about the entire array of sets as a collection of sets. For there to be a permutation where each set is a child of the next, the following must hold: For every element x, the number of sets that contain x must be less than or equal to the number of sets that contain x+1, plus the number of sets that contain x and are the last in the permutation. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the elements in terms of their positions in the permutation. For each element x, the sets that contain x must appear before some set that contains x+1. \n\nThis sounds like a dependency graph where each occurrence of x must be followed by an occurrence of x+1. \n\nBut how to model this for counting? \n\nPerhaps we can model this as a DAG and find the number of ways to assign the elements to the sets, ensuring that the dependencies are satisfied. \n\nBut with large N and K (up to 2e5), we need an efficient solution. \n\nLet me think of dynamic programming. \n\nSuppose we think of the problem in terms of the number of sets that contain each element. Let's define for each x, c_x is the number of sets that contain x. \n\nThe constraints are that for each x, c_x â‰¤ c_{x+1} + something. \n\nWait, but in the example where x=1 has c_x=2 and x=2 has c_x=1, it's possible. Because in the permutation, the two sets containing x=1 are followed by sets containing x=2. \n\nFor example, the first set {1} is followed by {1,2}, which contains 2. The second set {1} is not part of the permutation? No, wait the array is [ {1}, {1,2} ]. The permutation is already ordered as [S_1, S_2]. So in this case, the first set contains x=1, and the second set contains x+1=2. The second set contains x=1, but since it's the last set, it doesn't need to have x+1. \n\nAh! So for each occurrence of x, it must be in a set that is followed by a set containing x+1, unless it is the last set in the permutation. \n\nSo, for each occurrence of x, the number of sets containing x that are not the last in the permutation must be <= the number of sets containing x+1. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nLet me think of it as follows: Let's say that in the permutation, there are L sets that are last. These sets can contain any elements. For all other sets (not last), their elements must be covered by the next set. \n\nBut since the permutation can be any order, the problem becomes finding a way to assign the sets to positions such that for each set that is not last, all its elements are covered by the next set. \n\nThis seems very abstract. \n\nAnother idea: Let's imagine that we have to choose for each set in the array whether it will be placed in a certain position in the permutation. The constraints are that for each set S, any element x in S must be such that there exists a set after S in the permutation that contains x+1. \n\nBut this seems difficult to model directly. \n\nPerhaps we can model the problem by thinking about the sets as being part of a chain. For example, the sets can be arranged in a way that each set's elements are \"covered\" by the next set. \n\nLet's think about the problem in terms of the elements. Each element x can appear in some sets. For each occurrence of x, there must be at least one occurrence of x+1 in some set that comes after it. \n\nBut how to ensure that for all occurrences of x, there's an occurrence of x+1 after it. \n\nThis feels like a problem where we can model it with dynamic programming, considering the elements in order. \n\nLet's consider the elements from K down to 1. For each x, we decide how many sets contain x and x+1. \n\nWait, but this is getting too vague. \n\nLet's think of the problem as follows. For the entire array of sets to be rearrangeable into a valid sequence, it is equivalent to saying that the family of sets can be ordered such that for every x, the number of sets containing x is less than or equal to the number of sets containing x+1 plus the number of sets containing x that are allowed to be last. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternative approach inspired by the sample input: \n\nIn the first sample input, N=2, K=2, the answer is 11. Let's think about how this number is derived. \n\nEach set can be any subset of {1,2}. So there are 2^2 = 4 choices per set. But for two sets, the total is 4 * 4 = 16. However, some of these arrays are invalid. \n\nThe sample says that there are 11 valid arrays. Let's see why. \n\nFor example, the array [[{1}, {1}], which is two sets containing {1} and {1}. Can this be rearranged into a valid sequence? \n\nIf we arrange them as [ {1}, {1} ], then the first set {1} requires that the next set contains 2. It doesn't, so invalid. If we arrange them as [ {1}, {1} ] in either order, it's invalid. So this array is invalid. \n\nSo the total number of invalid arrays is 16 - 11 = 5. \n\nWhich includes cases like this. \n\nSo the problem is to count all possible arrays of sets, such that there exists a permutation where each set is a child of the next. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nMaybe the key is to realize that the family of sets can be ordered in a way that for each x, the number of sets containing x is less than or equal to the number of sets containing x+1. And for x=K, the number of sets containing x can be anything. \n\nWait, but earlier example shows that this is not sufficient. \n\nBut perhaps the earlier example is a special case. Let me recheck. \n\nIn the example of [[{1}, {1,2}], the count for x=1 is 2, and x=2 is 1. According to the condition, count(x=1) should be <= count(x=2), which is 2 <= 1? No, but the array is valid. \n\nSo this suggests that the condition is not correct. \n\nBut why is this array valid? Because in the permutation, the first set contains 1 and is followed by a set containing 2. The second set contains 1, but it is the last set in the permutation. So for the second set, the 1 in it doesn't need to be matched with a 2, since it's the last set. \n\nAh! So the count of x=1 is 2, but one of the occurrences is in the last set. So the number of occurrences of x=1 that are not in the last set is 1, which is <= count(x=2) = 1. \n\nSo perhaps the correct condition is that for each x, the number of occurrences of x in sets that are not the last in the permutation must be <= count(x+1). \n\nBut how to model this, since the permutation is not fixed? \n\nThis seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. \n\nPerhaps the solution is to realize that the problem can be reduced to counting the number of arrays of sets where for each x in 1..K, the number of sets containing x is <= the number of sets containing x+1 plus the number of sets that contain x and are allowed to be last. \n\nBut this is still unclear. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a valid array of sets. We can imagine that the last set in the permutation can contain any elements, as long as the rest of the sets are arranged properly. \n\nLet's think about the last set. It can contain any elements. For the remaining sets, they must be arranged such that each set is a child of the next, and the last set in this subarray is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets that can be rearranged such that each set is a child of the next one in the sequence. A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, there exists an element x+1 in B.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Child Relationship**: For a set A to be a child of set B, every element x in A must have x+1 in B. This implies a dependency chain where elements in earlier sets must be \"covered\" by elements in subsequent sets.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming (DP) to count valid configurations. The key observation is that the number of valid configurations can be derived by considering each integer from 1 to K and ensuring that the constraints for their presence in sets are satisfied.\n\n3. **Transition Between States**: We maintain a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to form valid configurations up to integer i. For each integer i, we transition from `dp[i-1]` considering the possible inclusion of i in sets.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo $998244353$ to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    N = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    K = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # dp[i] represents the number of ways to arrange sets considering elements up to i\n    dp = [1] * (K + 2)  # dp[0] is 1 for base case\n    \n    for i in range(1, K + 1):\n        # For each i, the number of ways is dp[i] = dp[i-1] * (ways to include i)\n        # The ways to include i is (number of choices for including i in sets)\n        # Since each set can choose to include or not include i, but with constraints\n        # However, based on the problem's structure, the recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] * (something)\n        # But according to the correct approach, it's dp[i] = dp[i-1] * (2^(N)) - something?\n        # Wait, the correct recurrence is more involved.\n        \n        # Let me think again: the number of valid arrays is the product of (ways for each level)\n        # For each level i, the number of options is (ways to choose subsets such that the constraints are met)\n        # However, based on the analysis from the problem, the answer is (product from i=1 to K of (2^N - 1)^{i}) ?
