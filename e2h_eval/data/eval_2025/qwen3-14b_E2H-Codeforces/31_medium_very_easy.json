Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to add so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need to find the minimal number of such cards required.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. The target is to have the total sum be zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this required value R = -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimum number of cards needed to sum up to R, where each card's value is between -x and x.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to achieve this. For example, if R is zero, then no cards are needed. But if R is non-zero, we need to find the minimal count.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible contribution per card. Each card can contribute up to x (if positive) or down to -x. So, for the minimal number of cards, we want to use as much as possible the maximum possible contribution.\n\nSo, for example, if R is positive, then each card can contribute up to +x. So the minimal number of cards would be ceil(R / x). But wait, if R is exactly divisible by x, then it's R/x. Otherwise, it's (R//x) + 1. Similarly for negative R.\n\nWait, but let's take an example. Suppose R is 3 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute +2. So 3/2 is 1.5, so we need 2 cards. Which would be 2 + 1 (but 1 is allowed since x is 2). Wait, but how? Because each card can be any value between -x and x. So, for R=3, x=2, the minimal number is 2 cards: 2 + 1. Or maybe 2 + 2? No, that would be 4. Oh right, but R is 3. So the sum of the new cards must be exactly R. So for R=3, with x=2, the minimal number of cards is 2. Because 2 + 1 = 3. So each card can contribute up to x, but the sum needs to be exactly R.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal number of cards?\n\nLet me think of the general case. Let R be the required sum. Let's assume R is positive. Then the minimal number of cards is ceil(R / x). Because each card can contribute up to x. For example, R = 5, x = 2. Then 5 / 2 is 2.5, so ceil is 3. Which would be 2 + 2 + 1. But that's 3 cards. Alternatively, 2 + 2 + 1 is 5. So yes, 3 cards. But what if R is 4, x=2. Then 4/2 is 2, so two cards. That's correct.\n\nBut if R is negative, say R = -3, then the same logic applies. Because each card can contribute as low as -x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |R| / x ). Because each card can contribute -x. For example, R=-3, x=2. |R|=3, divided by 2 gives 1.5, so ceil is 2. So two cards: -2 and -1. Sum is -3.\n\nSo in general, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |R| / x ), but with one exception: if R is zero, then zero cards.\n\nWait, but what if R is zero? Then we need zero cards. So the formula would be:\n\nif R == 0: 0\n\nelse:\n\nnumber of cards = ceil( |R| / x )\n\nBut let me check some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nInput is 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. The sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So R is -2. So |R| is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 is 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample input: 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. R is 4. |R| is 4. x is 3. So 4/3 is 1.333..., ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: if R is 5 and x is 3. Then 5 / 3 is 1.666, ceil is 2. So two cards: 3 + 2 = 5. So yes.\n\nAnother example: R is 0. Then zero cards.\n\nBut what if R is 0 but there are some cards? Well, the problem says that the sum of the found cards is S. So if S is already zero, then no cards are needed. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards, S.\n\n2. Compute R = -S.\n\n3. If R is zero, return 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |R| / x )\n\nBut how to compute ceil( |R| / x ) in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, for integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b - 1) // b.\n\nYes. For example, 3 / 2 is 1.5, ceil is 2. (3 + 2 -1) // 2 = 4//2=2. Correct.\n\nSo for |R| divided by x, the formula is (abs(R) + x - 1) // x.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute S = sum of the list.\n\nR = -S.\n\nif R == 0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute (abs(R) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if x is zero? No, the problem says x is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nLet me test some cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSample input 1: 3 2, cards -1,1,2. Sum is 2. R is -2. So abs(R) is 2. (2 + 2-1)//2 = (3)//2=1. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: 2 3, cards -2,-2. sum is -4. R is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x is 5. R is -5. abs(R) is 5. (5 +5-1)/5 = 9//5=1. Which is correct: one card of -5.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x is 4. R is -5. abs(R) is 5. (5 +4-1)/4 = 8/4=2. So two cards. For example, -4 and -1. Sum is -5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x is 1. R is -1. (1 +1-1)/1 = 1/1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x is 2. R is -3. (3 +2-1)/2 = 4/2=2. Which is correct: two cards of -2 and -1.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x from input.\n\nThen read the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_s = sum of the list.\n\nr = -sum_s.\n\nif r == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(r) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nBut wait, what if x is larger than the required? Like, if r is 3 and x is 5. Then (3 +5-1)/5 = 7//5=1. Which is correct. One card of 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nThe input is given as two lines. First line is n and x. Second line is the list of numbers.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of two examples. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's example:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\nBut that's probably for testing purposes. The actual input is two lines: first line is n and x, second line is the list of numbers.\n\nSo for example, in the first case, input is:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nWhich is read as n=3, x=2, and the list is [-1,1,2].\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. So in Python, we can read the first line as input().split(), then the second line as input().split().\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead first line: n, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen read the second line: list_of_numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_s = sum(list_of_numbers)\n\nr = -sum_s\n\nif r == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(r) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nBut wait, what if the list has more than n elements? Well, the problem says that the second line contains n space-separated integers. So the code can safely read them.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2, numbers are -1, 1, 2. sum is 2. r=-2. So abs(r)=2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=2, x=3. numbers are -2, -2. sum is -4. r is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is zero. For example, input is 1 5, and the number is 0. Then sum is 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 5. Output is 1.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 4. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list.\n\nsum_s = sum(list).\n\nr = -sum_s.\n\nif r == 0: print(0)\n\nelse: compute (abs(r) + x -1) // x.\n\nSo the code in Python:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(nums)\nr = -s\nif r == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print( (abs(r) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nThat's the code.\n\nLet me check edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, x=1, nums=[0]. sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nEdge case 2: n=1, x=1, nums=[1]. sum is 1. r=-1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. Correct.\n\nEdge case 3: n=1, x=1, nums=[-1]. sum is -1. r=1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x=1. Need 1 card of -1. So 1.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x=2. r is -3. (3 +2-1)/2 =4/2=2. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Required Sum**: The required sum of the new cards to balance the total sum to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the required sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the minimum number of cards needed using the formula `ceil(|required_sum| / x)`, which can be efficiently calculated using integer arithmetic as `(abs(required_sum) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(nums)\nr = -s\nif r == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print((abs(r) + x - 1) // x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card). The second line contains the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. This helps determine how much more is needed to balance the total sum to zero.\n3. **Required Adjustment**: The required adjustment (negative of the current sum) is calculated. If this value is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, the minimum number of cards required to achieve the required adjustment is determined by considering the maximum possible contribution per card (which is `x`). This ensures the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.",
