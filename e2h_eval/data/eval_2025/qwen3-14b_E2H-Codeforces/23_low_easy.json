In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimum number of tiles required.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible scenarios. For each input case, we have three tiles. We need to check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut how do I check if the current tiles form a mentsu?\n\nFor a triplet (koutsu), all three tiles must be the same. So, for example, if all three are '9m', then it's a triplet. So checking that is straightforward.\n\nFor a sequence (shuntsu), the three tiles must be in the same suit and consecutive numbers. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But they can be in any order, like 3s, 1s, 2s. So I need to check if the three numbers are consecutive and same suit.\n\nSo first, for the given three tiles, check if they already form a triplet or a sequence. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows adding any number of tiles. So the minimal number could be 0 (if already valid), 1, or maybe even 2. But what's the maximum possible?\n\nLet me think: For example, if the three tiles are all different suits and numbers. Like 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add two more tiles of the same as one of them. For example, adding two more 1m's would make a triplet. But that would take 2 draws. Alternatively, maybe forming a sequence requires adding two tiles? Or maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after drawing tiles, the total number of tiles is 3 + number of drawn tiles. But when checking for mentsu, you can select any subset of the tiles (so the mentsu can be formed from any subset of the tiles, including the original ones plus the drawn ones).\n\nWait, no. The problem says that after drawing tiles, she must have at least one mentsu. So the mentsu can be formed from any subset of the tiles (including the original ones and the drawn ones). But the mentsu is exactly three tiles. So, for example, if she has three tiles and adds one, making four tiles, then among those four tiles, there must be a subset of three that forms a mentsu.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that in the collection of original tiles plus added tiles, there exists a mentsu.\n\nBut how to find that minimal number?\n\nLet's consider all possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The original three tiles already form a mentsu. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Not. Then, what's the minimal number of tiles to add?\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of tiles to add such that the new set contains a mentsu.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios where adding 1 tile is sufficient.\n\nFor example, suppose the original three tiles can form a triplet with one more tile. For example, if two of them are same. Like 1m, 1m, 2m. Adding another 1m would make triplet. So that's one tile. Or, if they are 1m, 2m, 3m. Then adding nothing is needed. Wait, but that's already a sequence. So if the original three are already a sequence, answer is zero.\n\nAnother example: original tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, adding one more 1m gives a triplet. Or adding 3m would form a sequence (1m, 2m, 3m). So in that case, adding one tile is sufficient.\n\nSo in this case, the answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: original tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, adding 3m would form a sequence. So answer is 1.\n\nBut what if the original tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Then, adding 2m and 4m would form a sequence. But that would require two tiles. However, maybe there's another way. For example, adding two 1m's would allow a triplet. But that would take two tiles. So the minimal is 2.\n\nWait, but what's the minimal here? For the original tiles 1m",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw in order to form a valid meld (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current set of three tiles.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Check for Existing Melds**:\n   - A **triplet (koutsu)** is formed when all three tiles are identical.\n   - A **sequence (shuntsu)** is formed when the three tiles are of the same suit and their numbers form a consecutive sequence (e.g., `1m`, `2m`, `3m`).\n\n2. **If a Meld Already Exists**:\n   - If the three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence, no additional tiles are needed. Return `0`.\n\n3. **If No Meld Exists**:\n   - We need to determine how many additional tiles are required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n   - For a **triplet**, check if any two of the three tiles are the same.
