In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimum number of tiles required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' is a tile. The output is the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. For each case, check if there's already a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to get either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo for each of the three given tiles, we need to check all possibilities of forming a mentsu, and find the minimal steps required.\n\nBut how do I check if the current tiles already form a mentsu? Let's think.\n\nFor a triplet: all three tiles must be the same. So, if all three are same, then it's a triplet. For example, '9m 9m 9m' would have 0 required.\n\nFor a sequence: the three tiles must be in the same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But they can be in any order, like 3s, 1s, 2s. So, the way to check is: check if all three are same suit, and when sorted, their numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo first, for the initial three tiles, check if they already form a triplet or a sequence. If yes, then answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about how to compute that.\n\nThe problem allows adding any number of tiles. So for example, if the current tiles can form a triplet with one more tile (like two same tiles), then adding one tile would make a triplet. Similarly for sequences.\n\nBut how to approach this? Let's think of all possible ways to form a mentsu with the current tiles plus some added tiles, and find the minimal steps required.\n\nLet me consider each possible case:\n\nCase 1: Form a triplet.\n\nWe can check for each possible triplet. For example, if there are two tiles of the same type, then adding one more would make a triplet. Or if there are one tile, then adding two more. But since we want the minimal steps, perhaps we can check for each possible triplet possibility.\n\nBut maybe the best way is to check for each possible triplet that can be formed with the existing tiles and see how many tiles are missing.\n\nFor example, suppose the existing tiles have two of a certain tile. Then adding one more would make a triplet. So for each possible tile type (like 1m, 2p, etc.), count how many are present in the current hand. Then for each such tile, if the count is 2, then need 1 more. If count is 1, need 2. If count is 3, already a triplet. But since the initial three tiles may not form a triplet, but maybe after adding some tiles, we can get a triplet.\n\nBut considering that the initial tiles may have different suits and numbers. So for example, if the current tiles are 1m, 1p, 2m. Then forming a triplet would require adding two more 1m's (for a triplet of 1m) or two 1p's, etc. But perhaps the minimal steps would be to choose the tile that requires the least additions.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think: for the triplet, the minimal steps would be to find the tile that already has the maximum count. For example, if there are two tiles of the same type, then adding one more would make a triplet. If there are two different types with one each, then adding two tiles of one type would be needed. So for the triplet case, the minimal steps required would be 3 - max_count, where max_count is the maximum number of same tiles in the current hand.\n\nWait, but the current hand has three tiles. So the max_count can be 3 (then 0 steps needed), 2 (then 1 step), or 1 (then 2 steps). So for the triplet case, the minimal steps is 3 - max_count.\n\nBut wait, what if the current hand has two tiles of same type and one of another. Like [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then max_count is 2. So steps needed is 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut if the current hand has three different tiles, like 1m, 2p, 3s. Then max_count is 1. So steps needed is 2. But",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking for existing valid mentsu and calculating the minimal additional tiles required if none exist.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the current three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence. If they do, no additional tiles are needed.\n2. **Triplet Check**: If the current tiles do not form a valid mentsu, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet. This is determined by the maximum count of any tile type in the current hand.\n3. **Sequence Check**: For sequences, consider all possible sequences that can be formed by adding one or two tiles. Check each possible sequence in the same suit as the current tiles and determine the minimum additions required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    tiles = input.split()\n    \n    # Count frequency of each tile\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    for t in tiles:\n        freq[t] += 1\n    \n    # Check if already has a triplet\n    has_triplet = any(v >= 3 for v in freq.values())\n    \n    # Check for sequence\n    # Group by suit\n    suits = defaultdict(list)\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suit = t[1]\n        suits[suit].append(num)\n    \n    has_sequence = False\n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n        if len(nums) < 3:\n            continue\n        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n        # Check if consecutive\n        if sorted_nums[1] == sorted_nums[0] + 1 and sorted_nums[2] == sorted_nums[0] + 2:\n            has_sequence = True\n            break\n    \n    if has_triplet or has_sequence:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # If not, compute minimal steps\n    # First, check for triplet possibility\n    max_count = max(freq.values())\n    triplet_needed = 3 - max_count\n    \n    # Now check for sequence possibilities\n    min_sequence = float('inf')\n    # Try all possible suits\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        # Get all numbers in this suit\n        current_nums = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles if t[1] == suit]\n        # We need to find a sequence of 3 consecutive numbers\n        # We can add up to 2 tiles\n        # Generate all possible sequences that can be formed with current_nums plus some additions\n        # For each possible sequence of length 3 in the same suit\n        # Check what's the minimal tiles to add\n        # Let's collect all unique numbers in current_nums\n        current_set = set(current_nums)\n        # Generate all possible sequences of 3 consecutive numbers in 1-9\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [start, start+1, start+2]\n            missing = 0\n            for num in seq:\n                if num not in current_set:\n                    missing += 1\n            if missing < min_sequence:\n                min_sequence = missing\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum between triplet_needed and min_sequence\n    result = min(triplet_needed, min_sequence)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual tiles.\n2. **Frequency Counting**: We count the occurrences of each tile to check for potential triplets.\n3. **Existing Mentsu Check**: We check if the current tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence.\n4. **Triplet Calculation**: If no valid mentsu exists, we calculate the minimum tiles needed to form a triplet based on the highest frequency of any tile.\n5. **Sequence Calculation**: For each suit, we check all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers and determine how many tiles are needed to complete any such sequence.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The minimum number of tiles required to form either a triplet or a sequence is printed as the result.",
