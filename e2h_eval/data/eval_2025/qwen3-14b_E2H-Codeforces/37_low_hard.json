    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find a permutation of the given array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set and empty), the sum of elements in those positions in array a and array b are different. Wait, no, wait. Wait the problem says that for every non-empty subset S of indices (with size between 1 and n-1), the sum of elements in positions S in a and in b must be different. Wait, no. Wait, the wording says: \"the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different\". Oh right. So for each subset S (non-empty, not all elements), the sum of a's elements at those positions and the sum of b's elements at those positions must be different. Wait, no. Wait, the original statement says that for every subset S, the sum of elements on that positions in a and in b are different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: for every non-empty subset S of indices, the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different. Wait, that's ambiguous. Does it mean that the sum of a's elements in S is different from the sum of b's elements in S? Because that's the only way it makes sense. Because otherwise, if it's the same, then the condition would not hold. So the condition is that for any subset S (non-empty, not the entire array), the sum of a's elements in positions S is not equal to the sum of b's elements in positions S. Wait, but how can that be possible? Because if you permute the array, then the sum of elements in any subset S depends on which elements are placed in those positions. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the array b is a permutation of a. So for example, if the original array a is [1,2], then the permutation b could be [2,1]. Now, for subsets of size 1: the sum for subset {1} in a is 1, in b it's 2. Different. For subset {2}, sum in a is 2, in b it's 1. Different. So that's acceptable. So the example input for n=2 gives output [2,1], which works.\n\nBut for larger n, how can we ensure that for every subset S (non-empty, not the full set), the sum of a's elements in S is different from the sum of b's elements in S?\n\nWait, but this seems impossible unless the permutation is such that for every subset S, the sum of the elements in S in a is not equal to the sum of the elements in S in b. But since b is a permutation of a, the sum of all elements in a is the same as the sum of all elements in b. However, the problem excludes the full subset. So for example, if S is the full subset, it's not considered. So the problem requires that for any subset S with size between 1 and n-1, the sum of elements in S in a is not equal to the sum of elements in S in b.\n\nBut how can this be possible? Let's think about the case where n=3. Suppose a = [1,2,3]. Let's say we permute it to b = [3,2,1]. Now consider subset {1,2} in a: sum is 1+2=3. In b, the sum is 3+2=5. Different. Subset {1,3} in a: 1+3=4. In b, 3+1=4. Oh, same sum. So this permutation would not work. Hence, the problem requires that for all subsets S (non-empty, not full), the sum of a's elements in S is not equal to the sum of b's elements in S. \n\nSo the question is: How to find a permutation of a such that for any subset S (with 1<=k <=n-1), the sum of elements in positions S in a is different from the sum of elements in positions S in b.\n\nBut how can this be achieved? Because for each subset S, the sum in a is fixed. Because the original array is a, and the permutation is b. So for example, if S is a subset of indices, then the sum of a's elements in S is fixed. The sum of b's elements in S is the sum of some elements of a. Since b is a permutation of a, the sum of elements in S in b is the sum of some subset of a's elements. But the problem requires that this sum is not equal to the sum of a's elements in S. \n\nWait, but for each subset S, the sum of a's elements in S is fixed. Let's call this sum_a_S. The sum of b's elements in S is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a permutation of the given array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set), the sum of elements in those positions in the original array and the permuted array are different.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key requirement is that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set), the sum of the elements at those positions in the original array `a` and the permuted array `b` must be different.\n2. **Constraints and Observations**: Given that the size of the array `n` can be up to 22, checking all subsets directly is computationally infeasible due to the exponential number of subsets. However, we can leverage the properties of permutations and sums to find a valid permutation efficiently.\n3. **Permutation Strategy**: We can use a greedy approach where we try different permutations of the array and check if they satisfy the condition. For each permutation, we verify all possible subsets to ensure no sum conflicts exist.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of a\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(a):\n        valid = True\n        # Precompute all subset sums for the original array a\n        # Since subsets are based on indices, not values, we need to check for each subset S\n        # However, the problem requires that for any subset of indices S, the sum of a's elements in S is not equal to sum of b's elements in S.\n        # So for the current permutation perm, which is b, we need to check for all subsets S (non-empty, not full)\n        # That sum_a_S != sum_b_S, where sum_b_S is the sum of perm[i] for i in S\n        # But how do we compute this?
