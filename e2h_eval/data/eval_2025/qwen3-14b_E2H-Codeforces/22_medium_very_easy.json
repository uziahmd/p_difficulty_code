After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where their mark is the maximum for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the first student's marks for 3 subjects.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (column), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if in any of the subjects their mark is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nSo, step 1: Find the maximum for each column. Let's think about how to do that. The data is stored as a list of strings, each string being a row. For each column j (from 0 to m-1), iterate through all rows i and collect the j-th character, convert to integer, then find the max.\n\nOnce I have the max for each column, then for each student (row), check each of their marks. If any of their marks in a column is equal to the max of that column, then the student is successful.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe columns are:\n\nSubject 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2\nSubject 1: 2, 3, 1 → max is 3\nSubject 2: 3, 2, 2 → max is 3\n\nThen for each student:\n\nStudent 0: marks are 2,2,3. For subject 0, 2 is equal to max (so yes). For subject 1, 2 < 3. For subject 2, 3 is max. So this student is successful (has at least one).\n\nStudent 1: 2,3,2. Subject 0: 2 is max. So yes. Also subject 1: 3 is max. So yes. So this student is successful.\n\nStudent 2: 1,1,2. None of these are equal to the max of their columns. So not successful. Hence total is 2.\n\nSo the output is 2.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, read the input. Let's read n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string. Then, for each column j, compute the max.\n\nLet me think about how to process the columns. For each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( int(grades[i][j]) for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student (each row), check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max_marks for that column.\n\nSo for each student, loop through their marks. If any of them is equal to the max for that column, then mark the student as successful.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines, each line is a string. Let's store them as a list of strings.\n\nThen compute for each column the max.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in a column is equal to the max of that column.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead input: first line is n, m. Then next n lines.\n\nBut wait, the input could be given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the example shows two inputs and outputs. But the actual problem says that the input is a single case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is given as per the first line. The sample input shows two examples, but in reality, the code needs to process one input. Wait, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input is given as per the first line. So the code should read from stdin, which for the problem would be one test case.\n\nWait, the sample input shows something like ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], but that's probably the list of test cases. However, the actual code should read from standard input, which for the problem is one test case. So the code should read the first line as n and m, then read n lines of m digits each.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string of m characters.\n\nThen, for each column j (from 0 to m-1), compute the max value.\n\nOnce we have the max for each column, then for each student (each row), check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max of that column.\n\nNow, how to process columns. For example, for the first example:\n\ngrades = [\"223\", \"232\", \"112\"]\n\ncolumns are:\n\ncol 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2\n\ncol 1: 2,3,1 → max 3\n\ncol 2: 3,2,2 → max 3\n\nSo for each column, we can compute the max once.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nInitialize a list max_per_subject, which is length m.\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        current = int(grades[i][j])\n\n        if current > max_val:\n\n            max_val = current\n\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nOnce that is done, for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to max_per_subject[j].\n\nSo for each student in grades:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if int(grades[i][j]) == max_per_subject[j]:\n\n            mark as successful and break\n\nSo, the count is the number of students where at least one of their marks meets this condition.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\ngrades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen compute max_per_subject as discussed.\n\nThen, for each student in grades, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to max_per_subject for that column.\n\nNow, code:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if int(grades[i][j]) == max_per_subject[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if all students have the same marks in all subjects? Then all are successful, since for each subject, the max is that value, and each student has that value.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Both have 5. Then both are successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. One has 5, another 6. Then the second is successful.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the code must read from stdin. Let's think about the code structure.\n\nSample code:\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines.\n\nBut in Python, when you read input, sometimes you have to be careful with leading/trailing spaces, but in this case, each line is exactly m characters, so input().strip() would be okay, but perhaps better to read using input().strip() to avoid any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as n lines each containing m characters. So each line is exactly m characters long. So, for example, if the input is '223', then it's 3 characters, which is correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngrades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen compute max_per_subject.\n\nmax_per_subject = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        current = int(grades[i][j])\n\n        if current > max_val:\n\n            max_val = current\n\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nThen, for each student:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if int(grades[i][j]) == max_per_subject[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngrades is [\"223\", \"232\", \"112\"]\n\nmax_per_subject:\n\nfor j=0:\n\ngrades[0][0] is '2', grades[1][0] is '2', grades[2][0] is '1' → max is 2.\n\nj=1: 2,3,1 → 3.\n\nj=2: 3,2,2 →3.\n\nso max_per_subject is [2,3,3]\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2,2,3. Check each column:\n\nj=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count increases by 1.\n\nstudent 1: 2 (j=0) == 2 → yes.\n\nstudent 2: check j=0 (1 < 2), j=1 (1 <3), j=2 (2 <3). No. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ngrades:\n\n[\"91728\", \"11828\", \"11111\"]\n\nmax_per_subject:\n\nfor each column j:\n\nj=0: 9,1,1 →9\n\nj=1: 1,1,1 →1\n\nj=2:7,8,1 →8\n\nj=3:2,2,1 →2\n\nj=4:8,8,1 →8\n\nso max_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow check each student:\n\nstudent 0: 9,1,7,2,8.\n\nCheck each column:\n\nj=0: 9 ==9 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 1: 1,1,8,2,8.\n\nj=0: 1 <9. j=1: 1 ==1 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 2: 1,1,1,1,1. Check each column:\n\nj=0: 1 <9. j=1: 1 ==1 → yes. So counted. So all three students are counted. Output is 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 followed by 5. Then the max is 5. The student is successful. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1, then 5 and 5. Both are max. So both are successful. Output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Input:\n\n2 2\n\n99\n\n99\n\nmax per subject: 9 and 9. Each student has 9 in both. So each is successful. So output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Input:\n\n2 2\n\n98\n\n89\n\nmax per subject: 9 (col0), 9 (col1). Student 0 has 9 in col0, so successful. Student 1 has 9 in col1. So output is 2.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m, then read n lines. Then compute max per column, then check for each student.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        current = int(grades[i][j])\n        if current > max_val:\n            max_val = current\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if int(grades[i][j]) == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that's the code. It should handle all cases.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nWhat if m is 0? But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. Because the constraints are 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnother possible error: when converting characters to integers. But the input is guaranteed to be digits from 1-9, so no problem.\n\nYes, this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: First, read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of students in different subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), calculate the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        current = int(grades[i][j])\n        if current > max_val:\n            max_val = current\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if int(grades[i][j]) == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is split into integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent `n` lines are read as strings representing the marks of each student.\n2. **Maximum Marks Calculation**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This is stored in a list `max_per_subject` where each index corresponds to a subject.\n3. **Successful Students Check**: For each student, check each of their marks against the maximum marks for the respective subjects. If a student's mark matches the maximum for any subject, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject, ensuring that each student is checked only once per subject, leading to an optimal solution.",
