The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to do this modulo a given number. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the constraints are. The input n can be up to 500, which is quite large. So any brute force approach that generates all permutations is definitely out of the question. For n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is astronomically huge. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the problem. Let's break it down into parts. We need to consider all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p < q lex order, and inv(p) > inv(q). The total number of such pairs is what we need to compute.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where p â‰  q is (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) / 2. But since we are considering ordered pairs where p < q, the total number of such pairs is (total_permutations choose 2), which is (k*(k-1))/2, where k = n!.\n\nBut our problem isn't about all pairs, but those where inv(p) > inv(q). So perhaps there's some symmetry here. Let me think: For each pair of distinct permutations (p, q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds (assuming they are not equal). Wait, but inv(p) could be equal to inv(q). However, the problem counts only those pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. So maybe we can find the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q. Let's denote this as T. Then, among these T pairs, how many have inv(p) > inv(q)? Let's denote this as X. Also, there's another count Y where inv(p) < inv(q), and Z where inv(p) = inv(q). Then T = X + Y + Z. But if we can find X, that's our answer.\n\nBut what's the relationship between X and Y? Because for each pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), there's a corresponding pair (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). However, since we're considering only p < q, perhaps X equals Y? Wait, no. Because when considering all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) equals the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q), assuming that inv(p) is not equal to inv(q) for any pair. But that's not necessarily true. However, if for each pair (p, q) with p != q, inv(p) and inv(q) are different, then the total number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number with inv(p) < inv(q). But in reality, there are some pairs where inv(p) = inv(q). So for the entire set of pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to [total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs] / 2.\n\nBut how does this relate to our problem? Our problem requires that p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's think about all possible pairs (p, q) where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Let's split the pairs into two groups: those where p < q and those where q < p. Now, suppose that for all pairs (p, q) with p != q, inv(p) != inv(q). Then, the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) would be equal to the number of pairs where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). Which would be equal to the total number of such pairs divided by 2. However, if there are some pairs where inv(p) = inv(q), then those would contribute to neither X nor Y.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this. Let me think:\n\nTotal number of unordered pairs of distinct permutations is C = (k * (k - 1)) / 2, where k is n! (since each pair is considered once). For each such unordered pair {p, q},",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. Given the constraints, a brute force approach is infeasible, so we use mathematical insights and dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Inversions**: The number of inversions in a permutation is the count of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and a[i] > a[j]. For permutations of size n, the number of inversions can range from 0 (sorted permutation) to n*(n-1)/2 (reverse sorted permutation).\n\n2. **Symmetry Insight**: For any two distinct permutations p and q, either p is lexicographically smaller than q or vice versa. The total number of such pairs is (k * (k - 1)) / 2 where k = n!.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming for Inversion Counts**: We use dynamic programming to precompute the number of permutations of each possible inversion count. This allows us to efficiently determine how many permutations have a specific number of inversions.\n\n4. **Combining Results**: Using the precomputed inversion counts, we calculate the number of valid pairs (p, q) where p is lexicographically smaller than q and has more inversions than q. This is derived by considering the symmetry of inversion counts and adjusting for pairs with equal inversion counts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7  # Just a placeholder; actual MOD is provided in input\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    mod = int(input[1])\n\n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    # dp[i][j] = number of permutations of length i with j inversions\n    dp = [[0] * (max_inv + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[1][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(max_inv + 1):\n            for k in range(j + 1):\n                if j - k >= 0:\n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - k]\n                    dp[i][j] %= mod\n\n    inv_counts = dp[n]\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(max_inv + 1):\n        for j in range(i + 1, max_inv + 1):\n            total += inv_counts[i] * inv_counts[j]\n            total %= mod\n\n    total_pairs = (math.factorial(n) * (math.factorial(n) - 1)) // 2\n    same_pairs = 0\n    for i in range(max_inv + 1):\n        c = inv_counts[i]\n        same_pairs += c * (c - 1) // 2\n        same_pairs %= mod\n\n    total_valid = (total_pairs - same_pairs) // 2\n    print(total_valid % mod)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: We initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of permutations of length `i` with `j` inversions. This is filled using dynamic programming principles.\n\n2. **Filling DP Table**: For each permutation length from 2 to n, we compute the number of permutations with each possible number of inversions by considering the insertion of the new element into all possible positions.\n\n3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: After computing the inversion counts for permutations of size n, we calculate the total number of pairs (p, q) where p has more inversions than q. We adjust for pairs with equal inversion counts by subtracting them from the total and dividing by 2 to account for symmetry.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result using dynamic programming and mathematical insights, ensuring it handles the constraints effectively.",
