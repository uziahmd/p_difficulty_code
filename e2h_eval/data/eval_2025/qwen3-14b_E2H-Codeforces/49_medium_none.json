They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the task is to determine if there's a valid assignment of mushroom numbers to each lawn such that for every given edge (road), the GCD and LCM of the two connected lawns match the given values. If possible, output one such assignment; else, output NO.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the constraints. For each edge between two nodes u and v, we have that GCD(a_u, a_v) = g and LCM(a_u, a_v) = l. Now, I remember that for any two numbers, GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a*b. So, given g and l, the product of the two numbers must be g*l. Also, since GCD is g, both a and b must be multiples of g. Let me think: Let's say a = g * x, b = g * y. Then GCD(a, b) = g * GCD(x, y). But since the given GCD is g, then GCD(x, y) must be 1. And LCM(a, b) = g * x * y / GCD(x, y) = g * x * y. But the given LCM is l, so g * x * y = l. Therefore, x*y = l/g. Also, since GCD(x, y) is 1, x and y are coprime. So for each edge, we can derive that the two nodes' values must be multiples of g, and their product is g*l, but also that when divided by g, their ratio is coprime.\n\nSo for each edge, the two nodes must have values that are g multiplied by two coprime numbers whose product is l/g. However, l must be divisible by g, otherwise it's impossible. Wait, because if l is not divisible by g, then l/g would not be integer, which would make x*y non-integer, which is impossible. So first check for each edge, whether l is divisible by g. If not, then immediately output NO.\n\nSo that's the first thing to check. For each input edge, if LCM is not divisible by GCD, then it's impossible. Because, for example, if GCD is 2 and LCM is 3, then 2*3=6 must be equal to a*b. But since GCD(a,b)=2, then a and b are multiples of 2, so their product is at least 4. But 2*3=6, which is possible. Wait, but in this case, l/g is 3/2, which is not an integer. So that would imply that x*y is 3/2, which is impossible. Hence, the first check is that l must be divisible by g. So for each edge, if l % g != 0, then answer is NO.\n\nSo that's the first step. So for all edges, check if l is divisible by g. If any isn't, return NO.\n\nOnce that's done, for each edge, we can find that the two nodes must have values of the form g * x and g * y, where x and y are coprime and x*y = (l/g). So for example, if the edge has g=1 and l=3, then x*y=3. Since x and y are coprime, possible pairs are (1,3) or (3,1). So the two nodes would have values 1 and 3, or 3 and 1.\n\nBut how do we assign these values across the entire graph? The problem becomes building a graph where each node has a value, and for each edge, the values of the two nodes satisfy the GCD and LCM constraints.\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each node's value is determined by constraints from its edges. So perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined via some constraints, and we need to assign values such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe using Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure? Or perhaps building equations and solving them?\n\nAlternatively, think of each node's value as a variable. For each edge, we have that a_u and a_v must be multiples of g, and their product is g*l. Also, the ratio between a_u and a_v must be such that when divided by g, they are coprime.\n\nWait, but how do we handle multiple edges connected to the same node? For example, if a node is connected to two different edges with different GCDs and LCMs, then the value of that node must satisfy all those constraints.\n\nThis seems like a system of constraints that must be satisfied. How can we model this?\n\nLet me think of each node's value as being determined by some factors. For example, for each node u, let's say that a_u = g_uv * x_uv, where g_uv is the GCD of u and v for the edge between u and v. Wait, but that's per edge. Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: For each connected component, the values of the nodes must be multiples of some common factors. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a graph where each edge imposes a relation between two nodes. For example, for an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we know that a_u and a_v must be multiples of g, and their product is g*l. Let me denote that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y. Then x and y are coprime, and x*y = (l/g).\n\nSo for each edge, the product x*y is fixed. Also, x and y are coprime.\n\nBut how do we assign x and y for each edge? Well, for each edge, the pair (x, y) can be any pair of coprime integers whose product is k = l/g. So for example, if k is 6, then possible (x,y) pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). However, since x and y must be coprime, their product is k. So for each edge, we can choose x and y as any pair of coprime integers multiplying to k. However, once we choose x for one node, that affects the possible choices for other edges connected to that node.\n\nThis seems similar to building a graph where each node's value is determined by a product of certain factors. But how?\n\nLet me think of the variables as the ratios between nodes. Suppose that for each edge, the product of x and y is fixed. Also, since x and y are coprime, once we fix x for one node, y is determined as k/x. But how does this relate to other edges connected to the same node?\n\nFor example, suppose node u is connected to node v with parameters (g1, l1), leading to x1 and y1 (coprimes), and node u is also connected to node w with parameters (g2, l2), leading to x2 and y2. Then, the value of a_u is g1*x1 and also g2*x2. Therefore, g1*x1 must equal g2*x2. Which implies that x1 and x2 are related through the GCDs.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the value of each node as a product of some base value and factors determined by the edges. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For each connected component, the values of the nodes must be multiples of some common GCD. Wait, but each edge has its own GCD. However, if two nodes are connected through a path, then their values must have a GCD that is compatible with all edges along the path.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire graph as a collection of constraints. For example, if u and v are connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l, then a_u and a_v must be multiples of g, and their product is g*l. Also, for any two nodes connected by a path, their values must satisfy that their GCD is compatible with the path.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a graph where each node has a value, and for each edge, we can express the value of one node in terms of the other. For example, for an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, then a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime and x*y = l/g. Let me call k = l/g. Then x*y = k. Also, since x and y are coprime, each of them must be divisors of k. So for each edge, the possible pairs (x, y) are coprime pairs that multiply to k.\n\nNow, the key is that for each edge, once you assign x and y, the value of a_u and a_v is determined. However, for the same node u connected to multiple edges, the value of a_u must be consistent across all edges.\n\nSo for example, if node u is connected to node v with parameters (g1, l1) and to node w with parameters (g2, l2), then the value of a_u must be compatible with both edges. Let's see:\n\nFor the first edge, a_u = g1 * x, and a_v = g1 * y. For the second edge, a_u = g2 * x', and a_w = g2 * y'.\n\nTherefore, g1 * x must equal g2 * x'. Which implies that x = (g2/gcd(g1, g2)) * something? Not sure.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined by a set of constraints, and we can perform BFS or DFS to assign values to each node based on the constraints from the edges.\n\nLet me think: For each connected component, we can pick a starting node and assign a value to it, then propagate the constraints to adjacent nodes.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose we have a connected component. Let's pick a starting node u. Assign a value to it, then for each edge connected to u, determine the possible value of the adjacent node.\n\nBut how to choose the initial value for u?\n\nWait, but the initial value of u depends on the edges. For example, suppose u is connected to v via an edge with GCD g and LCM l. Then, the value of u must be a multiple of g, and the value of v must be a multiple of g. Also, their product is g*l. So, if I assign a value to u, then v's value is determined as (g*l)/a_u. But since a_u must be a multiple of g, let me write a_u = g * x. Then, a_v = (g*l) / (g*x) ) = l/x. But since a_v must also be a multiple of g, then l/x must be a multiple of g. Which implies that x divides l, and l/x is divisible by g. Wait, but l is equal to g*k, where k = l/g. So substituting, l = g*k. Then, a_v = (g * g *k) / (g x) ) = (g k)/x. For this to be a multiple of g, (g k)/x must be divisible by g → (k/x) must be integer. Therefore, x must divide k. Which makes sense, since earlier we said that x*y = k and x and y are coprime.\n\nSo, given that, for each edge, once we assign a value to one node, the other node's value is determined. However, the problem is that for a given edge, there are multiple possibilities for the values of the nodes. For example, if k is 6, then x could be 1, 2, 3, or 6. But since x and y must be coprime, for x=2, y would be 3 (since 2*3=6 and they are coprime). But for x=3, y would be 2, etc.\n\nBut how to choose the correct x and y for each edge?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each edge, we need to assign a pair of values (a_u, a_v) that satisfy the GCD and LCM constraints, but also ensure consistency across the entire graph.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think again. For each edge, the product a_u * a_v = g * l. Also, GCD(a_u, a_v) = g. Let's take the example where a_u and a_v are known to satisfy these conditions. Then, a_u must be a multiple of g, and a_v must be a multiple of g. Let me denote a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y. Then, as before, GCD(x, y) = 1 and x * y = l/g. So, for each edge, the product x * y is fixed. Also, x and y are coprime.\n\nSo, for each edge, the pair (x, y) must be coprime and multiply to k = l/g. So, the possible pairs (x, y) are coprime pairs with x*y = k.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to assigning to each node a value that is g * x, where for each edge, the x and y of the two nodes are coprime and multiply to k.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's consider that for each edge, the ratio between the two nodes' x values is fixed. Wait, no, because x and y are coprime and multiply to k. So for example, if k is 6, then x can be 1, 2, 3, 6, but paired with y=6, 3, 2, 1 respectively. However, since x and y are coprime, the pairs (x, y) are such that x divides k and y = k/x, and GCD(x, y) = 1.\n\nBut how to ensure consistency across the graph?\n\nSuppose we model this as a graph where each node has a value x_i (the x in a_i = g * x_i for some edge). But since the same node can be part of multiple edges, each with different GCDs and LCMs, the x_i must be compatible with all those edges.\n\nWait, but the problem is that each edge has its own GCD and LCM, which may differ. So, for example, if a node u is connected to v via an edge with GCD g1 and LCM l1, and to w via another edge with GCD g2 and LCM l2, then the value of a_u must be a multiple of both g1 and g2. Which implies that a_u must be a multiple of LCM(g1, g2). But this may not be possible if the constraints from different edges conflict.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the way to approach this is to treat each node's value as a product of a base value and some factors derived from the edges. However, this seems too vague.\n\nAnother idea: For each connected component, we can assign a base value to a starting node, then propagate the constraints through the edges. However, the challenge is choosing the correct values for each node during propagation.\n\nLet's think of this as a graph traversal problem. Let's pick a starting node and assign a value to it. Then, for each edge connected to this node, we can compute the value of the adjacent node. However, the problem is that the value of the adjacent node depends on the choice of x and y for that edge. How can we choose them correctly?\n\nFor example, suppose we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. We assign a value to u (say, a_u = g * x). Then, a_v must be (g * l) / a_u = (g*l)/(g*x) = l/x. But since a_v must be a multiple of g, then l/x must be divisible by g. Which implies that x divides l and l/x is divisible by g. But l = g*k, so l/x = g*k/x. For this to be divisible by g, k/x must be integer. Therefore, x must divide k. Which is already true, since x*y = k and x and y are coprime.\n\nSo, given that, once we assign a value to u, then the value of v is determined as (g*l)/a_u. However, the problem is that this value must also be compatible with other edges connected to v.\n\nSo, this suggests that we can model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined by the value of its neighbors. But how to choose the initial value of the starting node?\n\nThe problem is that the initial value of the starting node is not fixed. For example, if there's a single node with no edges, then any value is acceptable (but according to the input, the first example has n=1 and m=0, which outputs 1. But why? Because there are no constraints. However, the problem says that the numbers on the roads were no less than 1 and no more than 1e6. But for a node with no edges, the number of mushrooms can be any positive integer. However, the problem requires us to output any valid arrangement. So for such cases, we can assign 1 to all nodes.)\n\nBut when there are edges, the values are constrained. So, how to choose the initial value?\n\nWait, but for a connected component, the values of all nodes are determined up to a certain multiple. Let me think: For example, suppose there's a chain of nodes u - v - w. Suppose u and v have an edge with GCD g1 and LCM l1. Then, v and w have an edge with GCD g2 and LCM l2. Then, once we assign a value to u, the value of v is determined, and then the value of w is determined based on v. However, the value of u must be chosen such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to choose that value? For example, suppose that for the first edge, the product of u and v is g1*l1, and for the second edge, the product of v and w is g2*l2. But the value of v is determined by u, and then w is determined by v. However, there's no constraint on u except that it must be compatible with the first edge. So, perhaps the value of u can be any possible value that satisfies the constraints of the first edge, but also that the propagated values for v and w are compatible with their edges.\n\nBut how can we find such a value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the values of all nodes in a connected component are determined up to a multiplicative factor. Let me think. Suppose that for the entire connected component, the values of the nodes are determined by some base value multiplied by certain factors. For example, if all edges in the component have the same GCD and LCM, then the values might be determined in terms of that base.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of an example. Suppose we have two nodes connected by an edge with GCD 1 and LCM 6. Then, the product of the two nodes is 6. Possible pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). So, the values are not uniquely determined. However, if the two nodes are connected to a third node, then the constraints may force specific values.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAnother approach: For each connected component, we can model the relationships between the nodes as equations. For example, for each edge between u and v, we have a_u * a_v = g * l, and GCD(a_u, a_v) = g. But since GCD(a_u, a_v) = g, then a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, with GCD(x, y) = 1 and x*y = l/g. So, for each edge, this gives us a relation between x and y. But how can we model this for the entire component?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's x value (from the equation a_u = g * x) is connected to others. However, the problem is that each edge has its own GCD and LCM, which may vary.\n\nWait, but for a given edge, the x and y are determined by the equation x * y = k (where k = l/g), and GCD(x, y) = 1. So, for the entire component, the x values of the nodes are connected through these relations.\n\nBut how to find such x values?\n\nLet me think of the x values as variables. For each edge between u and v, x_u * x_v = k (for that edge's k). Also, GCD(x_u, x_v) = 1. Wait, but that's not exactly correct. Because for each edge, the x and y are coprime. However, the same node u may be part of multiple edges, each with their own k. So, for example, if u is connected to v with k1 and to w with k2, then x_u * x_v = k1 and x_u * x_w = k2, and GCD(x_u, x_v) = 1, GCD(x_u, x_w) = 1. But this implies that x_u must divide both k1 and k2. So x_u must be a common divisor of k1 and k2, but also that x_u is coprime with x_v and x_w. This seems very restrictive.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems that the x values for each node are connected through multiple equations, and the constraints are that the product of x's for each edge equals the corresponding k, and that the x's are pairwise coprime for each edge.\n\nThis feels like a system of equations that must be solved. However, solving such a system for general graphs is challenging.\n\nAnother thought: For each connected component, the product of the x values of all nodes connected through edges must be compatible. However, this is getting too abstract.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of variables. Suppose that for each node u, I have a value a_u. For each edge (u, v), the following must hold:\n\nGCD(a_u, a_v) = g_uv\n\nLCM(a_u, a_v) = l_uv\n\nWhich implies that a_u * a_v = g_uv * l_uv.\n\nAlso, since GCD(a_u, a_v) = g_uv, then a_u = g_uv * x, a_v = g_uv * y, where x and y are coprime, and x * y = l_uv / g_uv.\n\nSo, for each edge, the product of the a_u and a_v is fixed. But how can we ensure that all edges in the graph are compatible?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model the graph with constraints on the products of pairs of nodes. However, this is similar to a system of equations where the product of pairs is known. But solving such a system is non-trivial.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a bipartition problem. For example, if the graph is bipartite, then we can assign values accordingly. But I don't see how that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a graph where each edge imposes a relation between two variables (the a_u and a_v). For example, for each edge, a_u * a_v = c, where c is fixed. This is a multiplicative constraint. However, solving such constraints for a graph is possible if the graph is bipartite and the product constraints are consistent.\n\nWait, for example, consider a cycle. Suppose that the product of a_u * a_v = c1, a_v * a_w = c2, a_w * a_u = c3. Then, multiplying all three gives (a_u a_v a_w)^2 = c1 c2 c3. So, the product c1 c2 c3 must be a perfect square. Otherwise, there's no solution.\n\nSo, for a cycle, the product of the constraints around the cycle must be a square. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nThis suggests that for the entire graph, the product of the constraints along any cycle must be a square. However, this is only considering the product of a_u * a_v for each edge. But since each edge has its own c = g_uv * l_uv, this must hold for all cycles in the graph.\n\nBut how can we verify this?\n\nBut even if that's the case, how can we assign the values?\n\nThis seems like a promising approach. Let's think of the problem as follows: For each edge, we have a_u * a_v = c_uv (where c_uv = g_uv * l_uv). We need to assign values to the nodes such that for every edge, this equation holds.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a set of values {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n} such that for every edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = c_uv.\n\nBut how can we solve this system of equations?\n\nThis is similar to a system where variables are multiplied together. Such systems can be modeled using a bipartition approach, but only if the graph is bipartite. Alternatively, we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined up to a multiplicative factor, depending on the connected component.\n\nLet me think: For each connected component, pick a root node and assign a value to it. Then, for each adjacent node, the value is determined as c_uv / a_u. However, this may lead to contradictions if during traversal, the value of a node is determined in two different ways.\n\nFor example, consider a triangle of nodes u, v, w. Suppose we assign a_u = x. Then, from the edge u-v, a_v = c_uv / x. From the edge u-w, a_w = c_uw / x. Then, from the edge v-w, we have a_v * a_w = c_vw. Substituting the expressions for a_v and a_w, we get (c_uv / x) * (c_uw / x) = c_vw → c_uv * c_uw = x² * c_vw → x² = (c_uv * c_uw) / c_vw. So, x must be the square root of that value. If this value is not a perfect square, then there's no solution. Otherwise, x can be assigned as sqrt(...), and the rest of the values are determined.\n\nThis suggests that for each connected component, we need to check that the product of the c_uv along any cycle is a perfect square. Otherwise, there is no solution.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to checking for each connected component whether the product of c_uv along any cycle is a perfect square. If not, then no solution exists.\n\nOnce that's checked, we can assign values to the nodes by traversing the graph and setting the values based on the constraints.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each edge, check if l_uv is divisible by g_uv. If not, output NO.\n\n2. For each edge, compute c_uv = g_uv * l_uv.\n\n3. For each connected component in the graph:\n\n   a. Perform a BFS or DFS to assign values to the nodes. Start with a root node, assign it an arbitrary value (but subject to constraints from edges). However, the problem is that the initial value may not be arbitrary. How to choose it?\n\n   b. During traversal, for each node, assign its value based on the value of its parent and the c_uv for the edge between them. However, this may lead to contradictions if the component contains cycles that are not consistent.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have a connected component and perform BFS starting from node u. Assign a_u as some value. Then, for each neighbor v of u, a_v = c_uv / a_u. Then, for each neighbor of v, say w, a_w = c_vw / a_v = c_vw / (c_uv / a_u) ) = (c_vw * a_u) / c_uv. But when we reach a node that has already been visited, we must check whether the assigned value matches the existing one.\n\nFor example, suppose during traversal, we reach a node that was already assigned a value. Then, we must check if the new computed value equals the existing one. If not, then there's a contradiction, and the answer is NO.\n\nBut what value should we assign to the root node? Well, the root node's value can be chosen arbitrarily, but it must be such that all constraints are satisfied. However, the problem is that the root node's value may be constrained by the edges in the component. How can we choose it?\n\nWait, let's think of the root node's value as a variable. Suppose during traversal, we encounter a cycle. Then, the product of the c_uv along the cycle must be a square, as discussed earlier. Let me see:\n\nIn a cycle u1 - u2 - ... - uk - u1, the product of the c_uv for each edge in the cycle must be equal to (a_u1 * a_u2) * (a_u2 * a_u3) * ... * (a_uk * a_u1) ) = (a_u1^2 * a_u2^2 * ... * a_uk^2) ) = (product of a_i)^2. Which is a perfect square. Therefore, the product of the c_uv for the cycle must be a perfect square. Otherwise, there's no solution.\n\nTherefore, during BFS/DFS, whenever we encounter a contradiction (i.e., a node that has already been assigned a value, but the new computed value doesn't match), we can check whether the product of the c_uv along the cycle formed is a perfect square. However, how to track that during traversal?\n\nAlternatively, during traversal, when we reach a node that has already been assigned a value, we can compute the expected value based on the current path and compare it with the stored value. If they are different, then there's no solution.\n\nBut how to choose the initial value of the root node?\n\nAh! Here's the key insight: The initial value of the root node can be set arbitrarily, as long as the constraints are satisfied. However, the constraints are that for each edge, the product of the two nodes' values equals c_uv. So, for example, if during traversal, the value of the root node is set to some value, and the rest are computed accordingly, then the only way for the constraints to be satisfied is that the product of the c_uv along any cycle is a perfect square.\n\nBut how can we choose the initial value of the root node? Well, during the traversal, the initial value can be set to 1, and then check for consistency. However, if during the traversal, we find that the value computed for a previously visited node is not equal to the stored value, then there is a contradiction. But how does this relate to the product of the c_uv along the cycle?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose there's a cycle u-v-w-u. Suppose during traversal, we start at u, assign a_u = x. Then, a_v = c_uv / x. Then, a_w = c_vw / a_v = c_vw * x / c_uv. Then, when we return to u from w, we have a_u must be equal to c_wu / a_w = c_wu / (c_vw * x / c_uv) ) = (c_wu * c_uv) / (c_vw * x). For this to equal x, we have:\n\n(c_wu * c_uv) / (c_vw * x) ) = x → c_wu * c_uv = x² * c_vw → x² = (c_wu * c_uv) / c_vw → x = sqrt( (c_wu * c_uv) / c_vw )\n\nSo, x must be the square root of that value. But how do we choose x?\n\nThe problem is that x must be such that all constraints are satisfied. However, during traversal, if we assign x as 1, and then find that the computed value for u is not equal to the stored value (1), then we need to adjust x. But how?\n\nThis suggests that the initial assignment of the root node's value is not arbitrary. Instead, it must be chosen such that all cycles are satisfied. Which implies that for the connected component, the product of the c_uv along any cycle must be a perfect square, and the root node's value must be set to the square root of the appropriate product.\n\nBut how can we compute this?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps there's another way. Let's think of the product of the c_uv for the edges in the tree. For a connected component, the values of the nodes are determined up to a multiplicative constant. For example, if we have a tree, then once we assign a value to the root node, all other nodes' values are determined. However, if there are cycles, the product of the c_uv along the cycle must be a square, and this allows the assignment to be consistent.\n\nSo, during BFS/DFS, if we assign a value to the root node, and then propagate the values, and when we reach a previously visited node, we check if the computed value matches the stored value. If not, then there's a contradiction. However, this requires that the product of the c_uv along the cycle is a square. But how can we find the correct value for the root node?\n\nAlternatively, during traversal, when we reach a node that has already been assigned a value, we can compute the ratio between the expected value and the stored value. Let me think:\n\nSuppose during traversal, we have a path from the root node u to a node v, and we compute a_v as some value. Then, later, we find another path from u to v, which computes a different value. The ratio between the two values must be a square root of the product of the c_uv along the cycle. However, this is getting too abstract.\n\nMaybe there's a better way. Let's consider that for each connected component, the product of the c_uv along any cycle must be a perfect square. If this is not the case, then no solution exists. Once this is ensured, then we can assign values to the nodes by choosing a root and propagating the values.\n\nBut how to check that the product of c_uv along any cycle is a perfect square?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive for large graphs. However, during BFS/DFS, whenever we detect a back edge (i.e., an edge that connects to an already visited node), we can compute the product of the c_uv along the cycle formed by the back edge and check if it's a perfect square.\n\nBut how to compute this product?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nDuring BFS/DFS, for each node, keep track of the product of c_uv along the path from the root to that node. However, this is not directly useful. Alternatively, for each node, track the value of a_u as determined by the path taken to reach it. When a back edge is encountered, the product of the c_uv along the cycle is equal to (a_u * a_v) * (product of c_uv along the path from v to u). But this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, when we visit a node v that is already visited, and the path from the current node to v forms a cycle, we can compute the product of the c_uv along that cycle and check if it's a perfect square.\n\nBut how to compute this product?\n\nLet me think of the following: during BFS, for each node, we track the product of the c_uv along the path from the root to that node. However, this is not directly helpful. For example, for a cycle u -> v -> w -> u, the product of the c_uv along the cycle is (c_uv * c_vw * c_wu). To compute this, during BFS, when we reach node u from node w, we can compute the product of the edges along the cycle as follows: the product of the edges from the root to u, multiplied by the edges from the root to w, and then divided by the product from the root to the common ancestor. This is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, during BFS, for each node, store the value of a_u as determined by the path taken to reach it. When a back edge is found (connecting to an already visited node), compute the product of the c_uv along the cycle formed by the back edge and check if it's a square. For example, suppose during traversal, we have a node u with value a_u, and we find an edge to node v which was already visited with value a_v. The cycle formed is the path from v to u plus the edge u-v. The product of the c_uv along this cycle is the product of the c_uv along the path from v to u multiplied by the c_uv of the edge u-v. But how to compute the product along the path from v to u?\n\nThis seems complex. Perhaps we need to track for each node the product of the c_uv along the path from the root to it. Let me define for each node u, a value P[u], which is the product of c_uv for all edges along the path from the root to u. However, this might not directly help, but let's see.\n\nFor example, consider a cycle u - v - w - u. Suppose during traversal, we first go from root r to u to v to w, and then find an edge from w back to u. The product of the edges along the cycle would be c_uv * c_vw * c_wu. How can we compute this using the P values?\n\nThe product of the edges along the path from r to u is P[u]. The product of the edges along the path from r to w is P[w]. The product of the edges along the path from r to u via w is P[w] * c_wu. However, the cycle is formed by the path from u to w (which is P[w]/P[u]) and the edge w-u (c_wu). So the product along the cycle is (P[w]/P[u]) * c_wu. But since the cycle is",
