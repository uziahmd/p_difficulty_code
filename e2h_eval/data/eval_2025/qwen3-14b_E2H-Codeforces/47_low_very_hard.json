During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k) is minimized. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The LCM of two numbers x and y is given by (x * y) / GCD(x, y). So, for the two numbers a + k and b + k, their LCM depends on their product and their GCD. But since both numbers are increasing as k increases, there's a balance here. However, the problem is to find the minimal possible LCM.\n\nLet me think: Let's denote x = a + k and y = b + k. Then, since x and y are both increasing with k, but their difference is fixed. Because y - x = (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So, the difference between the two numbers is fixed as d = |a - b|. Wait, but if a and b are different, then the difference is fixed. For example, if a is smaller than b, then x = a +k, y = b +k. So y = x + (b - a). Let me call d = b - a. So, if a < b, then d is positive. If a > b, then d is negative. But since we can swap them, maybe it's better to assume that a ≤ b. Oh right, because the problem is symmetric in a and b. So, perhaps first I should make sure that a ≤ b, and then proceed.\n\nSo, assuming a ≤ b, then the difference between the two numbers is (b - a) = d. Let me denote x = a +k, and y = x + d. Then, the LCM of x and y is LCM(x, x + d). Since d is fixed. Now, the problem reduces to finding x ≥ a (since k ≥ 0 implies x = a +k ≥ a) such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized, and then find the smallest k (which would be x -a) that achieves this.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find x ≥ a such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Then, k = x -a.\n\nBut how do I find this x?\n\nLet me think about the LCM of x and x +d. Since x and x +d differ by d, their GCD must divide d. Let me denote g = GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Therefore, LCM(x, x +d) = (x * (x +d)) / GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, for a given d, which is fixed (since d = b - a), we want to find x ≥ a such that (x * (x +d)) / GCD(x, d) is minimized.\n\nHmm. How to find such x?\n\nLet me consider that d is fixed. Let me denote x as a variable. Let me think about the optimal x. Since x and x +d differ by d, their GCD is GCD(x, d). So, for each possible divisor g of d, perhaps we can find x that is a multiple of g, and then see what's the minimal LCM.\n\nAlternatively, since the LCM is (x*(x+d))/g, where g is GCD(x, d). Let me think about this expression. Let me note that x and x +d are multiples of g. So, x = g * m, and d = g * n, where GCD(m, n) = 1. Because since GCD(x, d) = g, and d = g * n, then x = g * m, and GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\nWait, but d is fixed. So, for example, if I take x = g * m, then since GCD(x, d) = g, then GCD(m, d/g) must be 1. Because d/g is n, and x/g is m. So GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\nBut then, x +d = g*m + g*n = g(m +n). So the LCM of x and x +d is LCM(gm, g(m +n)) = g * LCM(m, m +n). Since m and m +n are consecutive terms, but since n is fixed (as d/g), and m and n are coprime.\n\nBut since m and n are coprime, GCD(m, m +n) = GCD(m, n) = 1. So LCM(m, m +n) = m*(m +n). Therefore, the overall LCM is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The LCM of two numbers $ x $ and $ y $ can be expressed as $ \\text{LCM}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{\\text{GCD}(x, y)} $. Here, $ x = a + k $ and $ y = b + k $, which means their difference is fixed as $ d = |a - b| $.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The LCM of $ x $ and $ x + d $ depends on the GCD of $ x $ and $ d $. By leveraging properties of GCD and LCM, we can minimize the LCM by considering divisors of $ d $.\n\n3. **Optimal Strategy**: For each divisor $ g $ of $ d $, we compute the minimum value of $ k $ such that $ a + k $ is a multiple of $ g $, and then check the corresponding LCM values. This approach ensures we efficiently explore potential values of $ k $ that could minimize the LCM.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where $ a = b $ directly, as the optimal $ k $ in this scenario is 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // compute_gcd(a, b)\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    d = abs(a - b)\n    min_k = None\n    min_lcm = None\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible divisors of d\n    for g in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % g == 0:\n            # Check both g and d//g\n            for candidate_g in [g, d // g]:\n                # Find the minimal x >= a such that x mod candidate_g == 0\n                remainder = a % candidate_g\n                if remainder == 0:\n                    x = a\n                else:\n                    x = a + (candidate_g - remainder)\n                # Compute the corresponding k\n                k = x - a\n                # Compute the LCM of x and x + d\n                y = x + d\n                current_lcm = compute_lcm(x, y)\n                # Update the minimum\n                if (min_lcm is None) or (current_lcm < min_lcm) or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < min_k):\n                    min_lcm = current_lcm\n                    min_k = k\n    \n    # Also check the case when k=0\n    k0 = 0\n    x0 = a + k0\n    y0 = b + k0\n    lcm0 = compute_lcm(x0, y0)\n    if (min_lcm is None) or (lcm0 < min_lcm) or (lcm0 == min_lcm and k0 < min_k):\n        min_k = k0\n    \n    print(min_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **GCD and LCM Calculation**: Helper functions `compute_gcd` and `compute_lcm` are used to compute the greatest common divisor and least common multiple respectively.\n- **Main Logic**: The main function reads input values and handles the case where $ a = b $ directly.
