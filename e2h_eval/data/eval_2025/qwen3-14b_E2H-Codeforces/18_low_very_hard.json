The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem is about a frog that starts at position 0 on a number line. The frog can jump either +a or -b from its current position. However, it can't land on any position outside the interval [0, x], where x is given for each f(x). The function f(x) counts the number of distinct integers the frog can reach under these constraints. Then, given m, I have to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to compute this sum efficiently, especially since m can be up to 1e9, which means that a brute force approach for each i up to m is impossible. So we need a mathematical formula or pattern that can be computed quickly.\n\nFirst, let's think about what positions the frog can reach without any constraints. Since the frog can jump forward a steps or backward b steps, the positions reachable are those that can be expressed as some combination of a and -b. But since the frog starts at 0, the reachable positions are all numbers of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, with the constraints that during the jumps, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. So even if a position is theoretically reachable, if the path to get there requires stepping outside [0, x], then it's not counted.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model the reachable positions under the constraint that all intermediate steps are within [0, x]. However, considering that x can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to find for each x, the count of reachable positions.\n\nLet me look at the example given. For the first input, m=7, a=5, b=3. The output is 19. According to the note, f(0) to f(7) are 1,1,1,1,1,3,3,8. Let's think why that is.\n\nFor x=5, the frog can reach 0 (start), 5 (jump +a once). Also, maybe other positions? Wait, but when x=5, the frog can't jump beyond 5. So from 0, the frog can jump to 5 (since 5 is within [0,5]). Then from 5, can it jump back? Let's see: 5 - b = 5 -3 = 2, which is within [0,5]. So 2 is reachable. From 2, can it jump again? Adding a would take it to 2+5=7, which is outside of x=5. So that's not allowed. Or subtracting b would take it to 2-3=-1, which is outside. So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0,5,2. Hence f(5)=3. Similarly for x=6, maybe the same positions plus others?\n\nBut how do we model this in general?\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's think of the frog's movement as being able to reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod gcd(a,b). Because the frog can add multiples of a and subtract multiples of b. So the set of reachable positions (without constraints) is the set of integers that are multiples of d, where d is the greatest common divisor of a and b. Let me confirm that. For example, if a and b are coprime, then the frog can reach any integer that is a linear combination of a and -b. But since the frog starts at 0, and can add a or subtract b, the positions it can reach are all integers that are multiples of d, where d is gcd(a,b). So yes, the positions reachable are those that are multiples of d. But with the constraints of not stepping outside [0,x].\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all multiples of d that are reachable under the constraints. However, even if a position is a multiple of d, it might not be reachable if the frog can't reach it without stepping outside [0,x].\n\nWait, but maybe the constraints on the path are such that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is between 0 and x, provided that x is sufficiently large. For example, if x is large enough, then the frog can reach any multiple of d between 0 and x.\n\nBut how to determine for each x, the number of such positions that are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions under the constraints are exactly those positions that are multiples of d, and are in [0, x], and also satisfy some other condition. Let's think about the movement.\n\nLet me consider that the frog can move forward by a steps (but only if the new position doesn't exceed x) or backward by b steps (but only if the new position",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line, given constraints that it cannot jump outside a certain interval $[0, x]$. The solution involves leveraging number theory concepts and mathematical patterns to avoid brute-force computation for large values of $m$.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n1. **Reachable Positions**:\n   - The frog starts at position 0.\n   - It can jump forward by $a$ or backward by $b$.\n   - The set of all reachable positions (without any constraint) are those that are linear combinations of $a$ and $-b$, i.e., numbers of the form $ka - lb$, where $k, l \\geq 0$.\n   - This implies that the reachable positions are multiples of $\\gcd(a, b)$.\n\n2. **Constraint on Jumps**:\n   - The frog must never land on a position outside the interval $[0, x]$.\n   - Even if a position is a multiple of $\\gcd(a, b)$, it may not be reachable due to these constraints.\n\n3. **Pattern for Reachable Positions**:\n   - For sufficiently large $x$, the frog can reach all multiples of $\\gcd(a, b)$ between 0 and $x$.\n   - For small $x$, some positions may not be reachable due to the constraints on the path.\n\n---\n\n### Efficient Computation Strategy\n\nGiven that $m$ can be as large as $10^9$, we need an efficient way to compute the sum $\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$, where $f(i)$ is the number of reachable positions under the interval constraint $[0, i]$.\n\nWe can break the problem into three cases:\n\n1. **Case 1: $a = b$**  \n   - The frog can only move forward and backward in steps of $a$.\n   - The reachable positions are just 0 (since moving forward then backward brings the frog back to 0).\n   - So, $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$, and the sum becomes $m + 1$.\n\n2. **Case 2: $a > b$**  \n   - The frog can move forward by $a$ and backward by $b$.\n   - The reachable positions are all multiples of $\\gcd(a, b)$ that are less than or equal to $x$ and greater than or equal to 0.\n   - However, we need to consider the constraint that the frog must stay within $[0, x]$ during its jumps.\n   - The minimum value of $x$ for which all such positions become reachable is $(a + b)$. Below that, some positions might be unreachable.\n\n3. **Case 3: $a < b$**  \n   - Similar logic applies, but the frog may have difficulty reaching positions when moving backward.\n   - Again, the reachable positions are all multiples of $\\gcd(a, b)$ that are in the range $[0, x]$, and the minimum $x$ for full coverage is $a + b$.\n\n---\n\n### Final Formula\n\nBased on the above, the number of reachable positions $f(x)$ is the number of multiples of $d = \\gcd(a, b)$ in the range $[0, x]$, provided that $x \\geq a + b$. If $x < a + b$, the count is smaller.\n\nSo, the formula for the total sum becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total Sum} = \n\\begin{cases}\nm + 1 & \\text{if } a = b \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{d} \\right\\rfloor (m + 1) + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{d} \\right\\rfloor (m + 1 - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{d} \\right\\rfloor) & \\text{if } a \\neq b \\text{ and } m \\geq a + b \\\\\n\\text{Handle small } m \\text{ manually} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    m = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    b = int(data[2])\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    if a == b:\n        print(m + 1)\n        return\n\n    if a < b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    # The frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x] if x >= a + b\n    # Otherwise, we need to compute manually\n\n    if m < a + b:\n        # We simulate up to m\n        reachable = set()\n        from collections import deque\n        q = deque()\n        q.append(0)\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add(0)\n        while q:\n            pos = q.popleft()\n            if pos > m:\n                continue\n            if pos + a <= m and (pos + a) not in visited:\n                visited.add(pos + a)\n                q.append(pos + a)\n            if pos - b >= 0 and (pos - b) not in visited:\n                visited.add(pos - b)\n                q.append(pos - b)\n        res = sum(1 for _ in visited)\n        print(res)\n        return\n\n    # Now compute the total sum using formula\n    total = 0\n    max_multiple = m // d\n    total += max_multiple * (max_multiple + 1) // 2 * d\n    total += max_multiple * (m + 1 - max_multiple * d)\n    print(total)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n- The code first handles the case where $a = b$ directly, as the frog can only reach 0.\n- If $m$ is small (less than $a + b$), it uses BFS to simulate all reachable positions.\n- For large $m$, it uses a formula based on the number of multiples of $\\gcd(a, b)$ in the range $[0, m]$.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient even for very large values of $m$ (up to $10^9$).",
