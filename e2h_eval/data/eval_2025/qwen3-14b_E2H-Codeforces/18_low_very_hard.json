The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints. We need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't go beyond 0 or x. So for each x, we need to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute f(x) for each x individually. We need a mathematical formula or pattern to calculate the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Let's consider the general case where the frog can move forward by a and backward by b. The key here is to find all positions reachable by some combination of these jumps, but constrained within [0, x].\n\nBut since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the movement is limited. However, for large x, perhaps there's a pattern once x is large enough.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when a and b are such that the frog can reach any position beyond a certain point. For example, if a and b are coprime, then by the coin problem, the maximum unattainable number is ab - a - b. But this is for the case where you can add any number of a and b. However, in our problem, the frog can only add a steps forward or subtract b steps. So perhaps the problem is different.\n\nWait, but the frog can make any number of jumps. So for example, the frog can reach positions that are linear combinations of a and b. However, since the frog can only add a or subtract b, the positions must be of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But the frog can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut considering that the frog starts at 0, which is a valid position. Then, each time, it can jump forward by a (so adding a) or backward by b (subtracting b). But the problem is that the frog can't go beyond 0 or x. So even if a position is reachable via some combination, if during the journey it steps outside [0, x], then it's not allowed.\n\nThis seems complicated. However, maybe for large x, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod gcd(a, b), and within some range. Because the movement is similar to the classic problem of steps with a and b. Let me think about this.\n\nLet me first find the greatest common divisor of a and b, say d = gcd(a, b). Then, any reachable position must be a multiple of d. Because each jump adds or subtracts multiples of d. So the positions reachable are those that are multiples of d. \n\nBut even that might not be sufficient. For example, if the frog can only move forward by a and backward by b, then the reachable positions would be those that can be expressed as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers. But this is equivalent to positions that are multiples of d. However, the question is whether all multiples of d beyond a certain value can be reached.\n\nBut considering that a and b are fixed, perhaps once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x], except for some initial exceptions. For example, if a and b are coprime, then after some value, all numbers can be reached. However, in our case, the frog can only add a or subtract b. So perhaps the reachable positions are those that are congruent to 0 mod d and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that the path doesn't go out of bounds.\n\nBut this seems tricky. However, maybe for large enough x, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and between 0 and x. So the number of reachable positions would be floor(x/d) + 1 (if x is large enough). But how do we determine when x is \"large enough\"?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be split into two parts: for small x, where the frog can't reach all possible positions, and for larger x where it can. But how to find that threshold?\n\nLet me consider the example given in the problem statement. For instance, the first example input is 7 5 3. The output for f(5) is 3. Let's see:\n\nAt x=5, the frog can reach positions 0, 5 (jump +5), and 5-3=2 (since from 5, jump -3 to 2). But wait,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on the number line given constraints on its jumps and then compute the sum of these counts for all values from 0 to a large integer `m`.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n1. **Reachable Positions**:\n   - The frog starts at position `0` and can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`.\n   - It can only land on positions within the range `[0, x]` for any given `x`.\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**:\n   - The positions reachable by the frog are those that are linear combinations of `a` and `b` (i.e., `k*a - l*b` where `k, l ≥ 0`) and must be non-negative.\n   - Since the frog can only add `a` or subtract `b`, the set of reachable positions is limited to those that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `a` and `b`. Let `d = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable positions must be divisible by `d`.\n\n3. **Threshold Behavior**:\n   - For sufficiently large `x`, the number of reachable positions is approximately `floor(x / d) + 1`, provided that all such multiples of `d` in `[0, x]` are reachable.\n   - However, there's a \"threshold\" value `T` below which not all such multiples may be reachable.\n\n---\n\n### **Efficient Strategy**\n\n1. **Compute `d = gcd(a, b)`**:\n   - Only positions divisible by `d` can be reached.\n\n2. **Find Threshold `T`**:\n   - Determine the smallest `x` such that all multiples of `d` from `0` to `x` are reachable.\n\n3. **Break the Summation into Two Parts**:\n   - For `x < T`, compute `f(x)` directly using BFS or dynamic programming.\n   - For `x ≥ T`, use the formula `f(x) = floor(x / d) + 1`.\n\n4. **Summation Over Range**:\n   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series for the large part of the range.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Details**\n\n- **BFS/DFS for Small Values**:\n  - We simulate the frog's movement up to the threshold `T` to find `f(x)` for small `x`.\n\n- **Threshold Detection**:\n  - The threshold `T` is determined based on the maximum of `a` and `b`.\n\n- **Handling Large `m`**:\n  - Use mathematical formulas instead of iterating through all values from `0` to `m`.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    m = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    b = int(data[2])\n    \n    # Edge case: if a == 0 or b == 0 (not possible as per input constraints)\n    # But since a and b are positive, no need to handle that here\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    # If a == b, then the frog can only jump forward and backward by same amount\n    if a == b:\n        # Then it can only reach 0, since any forward jump is canceled by backward\n        print(m + 1)\n        return\n\n    # Find threshold T\n    # We'll simulate up to max(a, b) * 2 to find f(x) for small x\n    T = max(a, b) * 2\n\n    # Precompute f(x) for x < T\n    max_x_for_bfs = T\n    reachable = [False] * (max_x_for_bfs + 1)\n    queue = deque()\n    queue.append(0)\n    reachable[0] = True\n\n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        for next_pos in [current + a, current -
