He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b can be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, handling the case when b is 'R' which means Roman numerals.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has a and b (or R), second line has c as a string in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n3. Then, convert that decimal integer to base b. If b is R, then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as usual, using letters for digits above 9 (like A for 10, etc.)\n\nSo the main steps are converting from base a to decimal, then converting from decimal to base b or Roman.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, if a is 10 and c is '001', that's 1 in decimal.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion? For each character in the string, we need to convert it to its value, then compute the total. For example, for a base 10 number, each digit is multiplied by a^position. But since the input can be up to 10^3 characters long, and a can be up to 25, the decimal value could be very large. However, the problem says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is <= 3000 in decimal, otherwise it's up to 1e15. So for the conversion to decimal, we need to handle very large numbers, but Python can handle big integers.\n\nSo, for converting c to decimal:\n\nInitialize a variable, say num = 0.\n\nFor each digit in the string c:\n\nnum = num * a + digit_value\n\nBut how to get the digit_value? For example, if the digit is 'A', it's 10, 'B' is 11, etc. But the input c is in base a, so each digit must be valid for base a. However, the problem says that the input is correct, so we don't need to handle invalid digits.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input c is a valid number in base a. So for example, if a is 10, then the digits are 0-9. If a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the input may have letters in lowercase? Wait, the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but the length doesn't exceed 10^3. But the problem says that for the case where Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But the input c is given as a string in base a, which may have letters? For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). But the input c is given as a string. So for example, if a is 12, the input c could be 'A' which is 10 in decimal.\n\nBut how to parse the input c? Each character in c is a digit in base a. For example, if the input is 'A', then it's 10 in decimal. So for each character in the string, we need to convert it to its value. For example, '0'-'9' are 0-9, 'A'-'Z' are 10-35? But the problem says that a is between 2 and 25. So for base a, the digits can be 0 to a-1. So for example, if a is 16, the digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase). But the input may have lowercase letters? The problem statement says that in the input, the c is given as a string. But the sample input includes 'A' in one of the cases. For example, the sample input has '12 13\\nA' which is converted to 'A' in base 13. So in this case, the input c is 'A' which represents 10 in base 12. Then converting to base 13 would be 10 in decimal, which is 'A' in base 13.\n\nSo, the code needs to process each character in the input string c as a digit in base a. So for each character, we need to convert it to its numerical value. For example, '0' is 0, '1' is 1, ..., '9' is 9, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So the function to convert a character to its value would be: if the character is a digit, then int(c), else ord(c) - ord('A') + 10. But what about lowercase letters? The problem says that in the input, the c may have letters? Well, looking at the sample input, the input for the third example is '5 R\\n4', which outputs 'IV'. So the input c is '4' in base 5. Which is 4 in decimal, which is IV in Roman. So the input c is given with digits in uppercase? Or maybe the problem allows lowercase letters? Well, the problem says that in the input, the c may contain leading zeros, but it's guaranteed that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But the problem says that the input is correct, so the code can assume that the input c is valid for base a.\n\nSo, for the code, the input c is a string, and each character is a digit in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9, A-F (uppercase?), but the input may have lowercase letters? The problem statement does not specify, but looking at the sample input, the input 'A' is given as part of the input. So perhaps the input uses uppercase letters. So the code should process the input as uppercase letters. However, perhaps the input is case-insensitive? But the problem says nothing about that. So perhaps the code should process the input as uppercase, and assume that the input is given in uppercase. So in the code, for each character in c, we can convert it to uppercase, then process.\n\nSo, for the code, the first step is to convert the input c into a decimal integer. Let's write a helper function for that.\n\nOnce that is done, the next step is to convert the decimal number to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b, using letters for digits >=10.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Parse a and b. If b is 'R', then we need to convert to Roman numerals. Else, it's a base between 2 and 25.\n\nNow, for the conversion from decimal to base b (non-Roman case):\n\nWe need to take the decimal number and convert it to base b. For example, if the number is 10 and base is 16, then it's 'A'. For numbers larger than 9, we need to use letters. So for digits 10-35, we use letters A-Z (assuming base up to 36). But since the problem says that b is up to 25, the maximum digit is 24, which is 'Y'.\n\nSo, for the conversion, the code can generate the digits in base b, then map each digit to its corresponding character. For example, 10 becomes 'A', 11 'B', etc.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion. Let's think.\n\nFor example, to convert decimal number N to base b:\n\nIf N is 0, output is '0'? But according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the input c may be zero? Wait, the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer. However, in the case where Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But for other cases, it can be zero?\n\nBut the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. Also, in the note, it says that in any other case (when Roman is not involved), the number won't be greater than 1e15. So for the case when the input is zero, the code should output zero in base b. However, the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So in the code, when converting to base b (non-Roman), we need to handle zero.\n\nBut the problem says that the input c may be zero? For example, if a is 10, and c is '0', then converting to base b would be '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that in the input, if Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So the code can assume that when converting to Roman, the number is non-zero.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nFirst, convert c to decimal. Let's call this value num.\n\nThen, if b is 'R', then convert num to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert num to base b, using letters for digits >=10.\n\nNow, let's think about converting from decimal to base b (non-Roman case).\n\nThe standard approach is to repeatedly divide the number by the base and collect the remainders. However, for zero, we need to handle it specially.\n\nFor example, if num is zero, then output is '0'.\n\nElse, we collect the digits in reverse order.\n\nBut for the code, here's a way to do it:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    # Now reverse the digits and convert to characters\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    result = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            result += str(d)\n        else:\n            # For example, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc.\n            result += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return result\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the output must omit leading zeros. However, in this code, when the input is zero, the code returns '0'. For other cases, the code will not have leading zeros because the conversion process starts with the highest digit. For example, if the number is 10 in base 16, the code returns 'A'.\n\nBut what about when the number is zero? The problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is not zero. So for other cases, the code can output '0' as required.\n\nNow, the other part is converting to Roman numerals.\n\nRoman numerals conversion is a bit more complex. The standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many times as possible and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, the standard list is:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value in the list, while the number is >= value, append the symbol and subtract the value.\n\nSo, for example, 4 is IV, 5 is V, 6 is VI, etc.\n\nSo the code for converting a decimal number to Roman numerals would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut the problem says that the input number for Roman is <= 3000. So this code will handle numbers up to 3000.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe steps for the code:\n\nRead the input lines. Wait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is a and b (with possible R), the second line is c.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a.\n\nSo for each test case, there are two lines. However, looking at the sample input, the input is given as a list of multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich seems to be a list of test cases. But in reality, the actual input for the program is multiple lines. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is given as per the first line and the next line. But in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the sample input is showing multiple test cases, but the actual program is supposed to process a single test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. The sample input shows multiple test cases, but perhaps that's for the purpose of showing examples. For example, the sample input shows that for the first input line '10 2' and second line '1', the output is '1'.\n\nBut the code needs to process a single test case. So the code should read two lines: first line is a and b, second line is c.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead a and b from the first line. Then read c from the second line.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich outputs '1'.\n\nSo, the code must process one test case.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the first line. Split into a and b. But b can be 'R'.\n\nThen read the second line as c.\n\nNow, convert c from base a to decimal.\n\nThen, convert the decimal to base b (if b is not R) or to Roman numerals.\n\nNow, the first step is to convert c from base a to decimal.\n\nImplementing that:\n\nFor example, if c is '1111001' in base 2, then the decimal is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + ... etc. Which is 121.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion. For each character in the string, we need to get its value.\n\nSo, for each character in c:\n\ndigit = char_to_value(char)\n\nThen, num = num * a + digit.\n\nSo, for example, the code:\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\nBut the input c may have letters in lowercase? Well, the problem says that the input is correct, but the code should handle uppercase or lowercase? For example, in the sample input, the fifth test case is '12 13\\nA', which is converted to 'A' in base 13. So the code must process the input as uppercase.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify, but the sample input uses uppercase letters. So the code should process the input as uppercase, so perhaps converting the input to uppercase first.\n\nSo, in the code, for each character in c, we can convert it to uppercase, then process.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nc_str = input().strip().upper()\n\nThen, for each character in c_str, process as per the function.\n\nNow, the code for converting c to decimal:\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        val = char_to_value(c)\n        num = num * a + val\n    return num\n\nBut what about when a is 1? Wait, no, the problem says that a is between 2 and 25. So no problem.\n\nBut what about when the input is '0'? For example, if c is '0', then the code returns 0.\n\nNow, once we have the decimal value, we need to process based on b.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nAfter reading a, b, and c_str:\n\nif b is 'R':\n\n   convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nelse:\n\n   convert the decimal number to base b, using letters for digits >=10.\n\nBut first, need to process the decimal number.\n\nNow, the code for the conversion from base a to decimal.\n\nBut what if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, the input c is a non-negative integer. So the input c is non-empty. Also, the problem says that the input c may have leading zeros but the length is up to 10^3.\n\nNow, the code for the conversion from base a to decimal.\n\nBut for very long strings (like 10^3 characters), the code may take time. But since Python can handle big integers, it's okay.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nThe decimal value is 1. Convert to base 2: 1 → output '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5 → which is 5 in base 16, which is 5 in decimal. Convert to Roman: V.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → 4 in base 5 is 4 decimal → IV.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → which is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Convert to base 2: 121 in decimal is 1111001 in binary. So output is same as input, which is '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → A is 10 in base 12. So decimal is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A'.\n\nSo the output is 'A'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nNow, implementing the functions.\n\nFirst, the function to convert a character to its value. Let's write that.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\nBut for example, 'A' → 10, 'B' → 11, etc.\n\nNow, the code for converting the string c to decimal.\n\nBut what about if the input c is '0'? Then the decimal is 0. Which is handled correctly.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead a and b:\n\nThe first line is split into two parts. For example, '10 2' → a=10, b='2'. Or '16 R' → a=16, b='R'.\n\nSo:\n\nfirst_line = input().strip().split()\n\na = int(first_line[0])\n\nb_part = first_line[1]\n\nif b_part == 'R':\n\n   b_is_roman = True\n\nelse:\n\n   b = int(b_part)\n\nThen, read the second line:\n\nc_str = input().strip().upper()\n\nThen, convert c_str to decimal:\n\nnum = 0\n\nfor c in c_str:\n\n   val = char_to_value(c)\n\n   num = num * a + val\n\nBut wait, for example, if a is 10, and c_str is '123', then num is 123.\n\nBut for a=2, c_str is '1111001', which is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + ... etc.\n\nOnce we have num, then proceed.\n\nNow, for the case when b is R:\n\nconvert num to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert num to base b.\n\nBut what if num is zero? For example, if the input is '2 10\\n0', then the output is '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So in that case, the code can assume that when converting to Roman, num is non-zero.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nif b_is_roman:\n\n   roman = decimal_to_roman(num)\n\n   print(roman)\n\nelse:\n\n   converted = decimal_to_base(num, b)\n\n   print(converted)\n\nNow, the decimal_to_base function.\n\nBut what if num is zero? For example, if the input is '10 2\\n0', then the output is '0'.\n\nBut in the code for decimal_to_base, the code returns '0' if n is zero.\n\nNow, implement that.\n\nNow, the code for decimal_to_base.\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        remainder = n % base\n\n        digits.append(remainder)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for d in digits:\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            res += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    return res\n\nBut what about leading zeros? For example, if the input is zero, returns '0', which is correct. For other cases, the digits are generated correctly.\n\nNow, the code for Roman numerals:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut what about numbers like 0? But according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the input is zero and b is not R. For example, if the input is '10 10\\n0', then the output is '0'.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nRead first line: a and b_part.\n\nRead second line: c_str.\n\nConvert c_str to decimal.\n\nThen, process based on b_part.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut code must read from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\nBut perhaps not needed. Let's proceed.\n\nBut in code:\n\nRead first line:\n\na, b_part = input().split()\n\nBut wait, the first line can be split into two parts. For example, '10 2' → a is '10', b_part is '2'.\n\nBut in code:\n\nfirst_line = input().split()\n\na = int(first_line[0])\n\nb_part = first_line[1]\n\nThen, read c_str = input().strip().upper()\n\nThen, process the conversion.\n\nBut code for converting c_str to decimal.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n\n    if c.isdigit():\n\n        return int(c)\n\n    else:\n\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for c in s:\n\n        val = char_to_value(c)\n\n        num = num * a + val\n\n    return num\n\nBut what about when the input is '0'? It will return 0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nnum = base_a_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nThen, check if b_part is 'R'.\n\nif b_part == 'R':\n\n    roman = decimal_to_roman(num)\n\n    print(roman)\n\nelse:\n\n    base = int(b_part)\n\n    converted = decimal_to_base(num, base)\n\n    print(converted)\n\nBut need to implement decimal_to_base and decimal_to_roman.\n\nNow, code for decimal_to_base:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        remainder = n % base\n\n        digits.append(remainder)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for d in digits:\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            res += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    return res\n\nBut what about when the input is zero? For example, n=0, returns '0'.\n\nNow, code for decimal_to_roman:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nNow, considering all possible edge cases.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nCase 1: c is zero. For example, input a=10, b=10, c=0 → output 0.\n\nBut when b is R, the input c is not zero.\n\nCase 2: Converting to base 1? No, since the problem says that b is between 2 and 25, except for R.\n\nAnother case: converting to base 16, with digits up to F.\n\nAnother case: when the decimal number is zero and base is not R.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1 → decimal is 1 → converted to base 2 → 1 → output '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5 → decimal is 5 → Roman is 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → decimal is 4 → Roman is 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001 → output is same.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nAll sample outputs match.\n\nAnother test case: input a=2, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c=255 → decimal is 255 → converted to hex is 'FF'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=R, c=3000 → output 'MMMX'.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut code must be written as a single script. Now, putting all functions into the code.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be defined inside the code.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the first line, then the second line.\n\nBut code:\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        val = char_to_value(c)\n        num = num * a + val\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    first_line = input().split()\n    a = int(first_line[0])\n    b_part = first_line[1]\n    c_str = input().strip().upper()\n    \n    # Convert c_str from base a to decimal\n    num = base_a_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n    \n    # Process based on b_part\n    if b_part == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(num))\n    else:\n        base = int(b_part)\n        converted = decimal_to_base(num, base)\n        print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what about when the input c is zero and the base is not R? For example, input a=10, b=10, c=0 → output is '0'.\n\nYes, the code returns '0' in that case.\n\nAnother test case: input a=2, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: input a=10, b=16, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nNow, what about when the input is zero and the base is R? According to the problem statement, the input for Roman is guaranteed to not be zero. So the code can assume that in that case, num is not zero.\n\nBut in code, if somehow the input is zero and b is R, the code would call decimal_to_roman(0), which would return empty string? Let's see.\n\nIn decimal_to_roman function, for n=0, the loop would not run. So res is empty string. But according to the problem statement, this case is not present.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So the code can safely assume that.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst line: '10 2'\n\nSecond line: '1'\n\nnum = 1 → converted to base 2 → '1'.\n\nSample Output: '1'.\n\nSample Input 2: '16 R' and '5' → num is 5 → 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3: '5 R' and '4' → num is 4 → 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4: '2 2' and '1111001' → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nSample Input 5: '12 13' and 'A' → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nAll samples pass.\n\nNow, what about when the input is '2 10\\n10' → which is 2 in base 2, which is 2 in decimal → converted to base 10 is '2'.\n\nAnother case: input a=10, b=16, c=255 → output is 'FF'.\n\nAnother case: a=16, b=10, c='FF' → decimal is 255 → output is '255'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=2, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the decimal is 0, output is '0'. For other cases, the code produces no leading zeros. For example, if the decimal is 10 and base is 16 → 'A', which is correct. For decimal 10 in base 10 → '10'.\n\nNow, what about when the input c is '0' and base is 2 → output is '0'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the input is '5 R\\n4' → which is 4 in base 5 → 4 → IV.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n1. The code for converting c_str to decimal. What if the input has letters beyond the base a? For example, a=10, and c is 'A'? But according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so this case will not happen.\n\n2. The code for converting to base b: when the number is zero, returns '0'. But what if the base is 1? But the problem says that the base is between 2 and 25.\n\n3. The code for Roman numerals. For example, 4 is IV, 9 is IX, etc. Which is handled by the code.\n\nAnother possible issue: the code for converting to base b may have leading zeros if the input is zero. But the code returns '0' in that case, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when the decimal number is zero and base is 10, output is '0'.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the Python code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, where `b` can either be a standard base (2-25) or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer, and then converting this decimal integer to the target base `b` or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number, given in base `a`, is converted to a decimal integer. This is done by iterating through each digit of the input string and computing its value in base 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is Roman numerals or another base:\n   - **For Standard Bases**: Convert the decimal number to the specified base using division and modulus operations, handling digits greater than 9 with letters (A-Z).\n   - **For Roman Numerals**: Use a predefined list of Roman numeral values and symbols to construct the Roman numeral representation of the decimal number.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        val = char_to_value(c)\n        num = num * a + val\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    first_line = input().split()\n    a = int(first_line[0])\n    b_part = first_line[1]\n    c_str = input().strip().upper()\n    \n    num = base_a_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n    \n    if b_part == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(num))\n    else:\n        base = int(b_part)\n        converted = decimal_to_base(num, base)\n        print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character to Value Conversion**: The function `char_to_value` converts each character of the input string to its corresponding numerical value, handling both digits and letters (A-Z).\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The function `base_a_to_decimal` converts the input string from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and accumulating the value.\n3. **Decimal to Target Base Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal number to a specified base, using letters for digits greater than 9. If the target base is Roman numerals, `decimal_to_roman` constructs the Roman numeral representation using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs.\n4. **Main Function**: Reads input, processes the conversion from base `a` to decimal, and then converts the decimal result to the target base or Roman numerals, ensuring correct output formatting.",
