The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nThe input is n, then the two sequences A and B. The output is two numbers: the number of losses for Nikephoros (the first one) and Polycarpus (the second).\n\nFirst, let's think about how to model the rounds. Since n can be up to 2e9, we can't simulate each round one by one. That would take way too long. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about the sequences. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check who wins. The problem is to compute for all rounds from 0 to n-1, how many times each loses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't iterate through each round. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, and compute the total based on that.\n\nLet me think: The sequences A and B are cyclic. So the combination of their moves will repeat after LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after that many rounds, both sequences will have cycled back to their starting points.\n\nSo the idea is to compute the number of losses in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, then multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, we need to compute LCM(m, k). To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need to compute GCD.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it T. So T is the period after which the sequence of moves between A and B repeats.\n\n2. For each round in the first T rounds, compute whether Nikephoros or Polycarpus loses. Then, count the total number of losses for each in this T-length period.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is q = n // T. The remaining rounds are r = n % T.\n\n4. So total losses would be q * (losses per period) plus the losses in the first r rounds of the next period.\n\nBut how do I compute the losses per period?\n\nBut wait, T could be very large. For example, if m and k are 1000 each, then LCM could be up to 1e6. But since m and k are up to 1000, LCM(m,k) is up to 1e6. So even for that, processing T rounds is manageable, because 1e6 is acceptable for a loop.\n\nYes. Because 1e6 iterations are okay for Python, even if multiplied by some small factors.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k). Then, for each of the T rounds, compute the moves of A and B, determine who loses, and accumulate counts. Then, multiply by q and add the counts from the first r rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round in the T rounds?\n\nFor each i in 0..T-1:\n\nA's move is A[i % m], B's move is B[i % k].\n\nBut since T is LCM(m, k), then for i from 0 to T-1, the i mod m and i mod k will cycle through all possible combinations. So for each i in 0..T-1, we can compute the moves and check who wins.\n\nSo, for each of the T rounds, we can compute the outcome once. Then, the total number of losses for each player in one full cycle is known.\n\nThen, the total number of full cycles is q = n // T, and the remainder is r = n % T.\n\nSo the total losses would be:\n\ntotal_nik = q * nik_per_cycle + nik_in_r\ntotal_poly = q * poly_per_cycle + poly_in_r\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n- Precompute for each of the T rounds, the outcome.\n- Sum up the counts for the full cycles and the remainder.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute for each round in 0 to T-1, what is the outcome.\n\nBut how to compute the outcome between two moves?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes two characters (a and b) and returns who wins. For example:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\n- Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n- Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n- Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\nSo for a and b:\n\nif a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss (so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Polycarpus's is +1)\nif b beats a: then Nikephoros loses, so Nikephoros's count is +1, Polycarpus's is 0.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we can determine which player loses (if any).\n\nSo the helper function can return (nik_loss, poly_loss) which is (0, 1), (1, 0), or (0, 0) depending on the outcome.\n\nSo for each i in 0..T-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen compute the result, and add to the counts for the cycle.\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, multiply by q and then add the counts for the first r rounds.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute T, which is LCM(m, k). So how to compute GCD?\n\nIn Python, we can use math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, that's fine. Also, for LCM, we can compute as (m * k) // gcd(m, k). But need to handle cases where m or k is zero? Well, the problem says m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the T rounds, the outcome.\n\nThen, compute q = n // T, r = n % T.\n\nCompute total_nik = q * nik_cycle + nik_remainder (from first r rounds)\n\nSame for poly.\n\nBut how to compute the nik_cycle and poly_cycle?\n\nWe can precompute for the T rounds, the nik_loss and poly_loss per round, and sum them up.\n\nSo:\n\nsum_nik_cycle = sum of nik_loss for each round in 0..T-1\n\nsum_poly_cycle = same for poly.\n\nSimilarly, for the remainder r, we need to compute the sum of the first r rounds.\n\nSo, for the remainder part, we can loop from 0 to r-1, compute the outcome for each round, and sum.\n\nBut for T up to 1e6, and r up to 1e6, this is acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about the worst case. If m and k are 1000, then T is 1e6. For each of the T rounds, we process once. Then, for the remainder, up to 1e6 rounds. So total processing is O(2e6) which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_loss(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    # determine who wins\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        # Nikephoros loses, so he gets a spot\n        return (1, 0)\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to T-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nAdd to the cycle counts.\n\nOnce we have the cycle counts, then multiply by q.\n\nThen, for the remainder r, process the first r rounds, same way.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nBut for the code, let's think about how to read the input.\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is sequence A.\n\nThird line is sequence B.\n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nSample input:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is the string A.\n\nThird line is the string B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input line is '7' then 'RPS' then 'RSPP'.\n\nBut in the code, the input is read from stdin. So in Python, the code would read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut the sample input shows that for example, the first input is 7, then A is RPS, then B is RSPP.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for the T rounds:\n\nsum_nik_cycle = 0\n\nsum_poly_cycle = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to T-1:\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    nik, poly = compute_loss(a, b)\n\n    sum_nik_cycle += nik\n\n    sum_poly_cycle += poly\n\nThen, q = n // T\n\nr = n % T\n\nThen, compute the sum for the first r rounds:\n\nsum_nik_remain = 0\n\nsum_poly_remain = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to r-1:\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    nik, poly = compute_loss(a, b)\n\n    sum_nik_remain += nik\n\n    sum_poly_remain += poly\n\nThen, total_nik = q * sum_nik_cycle + sum_nik_remain\n\ntotal_poly = q * sum_poly_cycle + sum_poly_remain\n\nPrint total_nik and total_poly.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo m = 3, k = 4.\n\nLCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nThen for T=12 rounds, compute the sum for each.\n\nBut let's check the sample.\n\nSample input n=7.\n\nSo q = 7 // 12 = 0, r=7.\n\nSo the sum_nik_cycle is for 12 rounds. But since q is 0, the total is sum_nik_remain (the first 7 rounds).\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nIn the example, the output is 3 and 2.\n\nSo according to the code, the code would compute for the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nLet me compute the first 7 rounds.\n\nRound 0: i=0\n\nA[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nB[0%4] = B[0] = R → draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1: i=1 → A[1%3=1] = P; B[1%4=1] = S. P vs S. S beats P? Wait, the compute_loss function:\n\na is P, b is S. So the condition is:\n\nif (a == R and b == S) → no. Or (a == S and b == P) → no. Or (a == P and b == R) → no. So else case. So Nikephoros loses. So (1, 0). So Nikephoros gets a spot. So in the sample explanation, the first round is R-R (draw), then P vs S (Nikephoros loses). So in the first sample, the first round is round 0 (i=0) is draw. Round 1 (i=1) is P vs S. So Nikephoros loses, adding 1 to his count.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R-R (draw). Then round 2: P vs S (Nikephoros loses). But maybe the rounds are 0-based or 1-based?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nIn the first sample the game went like this:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses.\n\nBut the input is n=7 rounds. So the code's i runs from 0 to 6 (for 7 rounds). So the code's rounds are 0-based.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the rounds are numbered as 1 to 7. So the code's first round (i=0) is the first round of the game.\n\nSo for the sample input, the code's first 7 rounds (i=0 to 6):\n\nLet me compute each round:\n\nA is RPS (m=3). So for i=0,1,2,3,4,5,6:\n\ni mod 3: 0,1,2,0,1,2,0 → A's moves are R, P, S, R, P, S, R.\n\nB is RSPP (k=4). So for i mod 4:\n\ni=0: 0 → R\n\ni=1: 1 → S\n\ni=2: 2 → P\n\ni=3: 3 → P\n\ni=4: 0 → R\n\ni=5: 1 → S\n\ni=6: 2 → P.\n\nSo the rounds:\n\nRound 0 (i=0): R vs R → draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1 (i=1): P vs S → S beats P. So Nikephoros (P) loses? Wait, the compute_loss function:\n\na is P (Nikephoros's move), b is S (Polycarpus's move). So the code checks if a beats b.\n\na is P, b is S. The condition is:\n\nif (a == R and b == S) → no. Or (a == S and b == P) → no. Or (a == P and b == R) → no. So else case. Which means that b beats a. So Nikephoros loses. So (1,0). So Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the first round (probably the first round of the game) it's R-R (draw). Then the second round is P vs S. Nikephoros loses. So that's the second round. So for the code's i=1, which is the second round (since i starts at 0), that's correct.\n\nSo the sample's explanation says that Nikephoros has 3 losses and Polycarpus 2.\n\nLet me compute for the 7 rounds (i=0 to 6):\n\nRound 0:\n\nA: R, B: R → draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1: A: P, B: S → Nikephoros loses (1,0)\n\nRound 2: A: S, B: P → S beats P. So Nikephoros wins. So (0,1) → Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nRound 3: A: R, B: P → B's move is P. R vs P: P beats R. So Nikephoros loses. (1,0)\n\nRound 4: A: P, B: R → P beats R. Nikephoros wins. (0,1)\n\nRound 5: A: S, B: S → draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 6: A: R, B: P → R vs P. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. (1,0)\n\nSo for these 7 rounds, the counts:\n\nNikephoros's losses: rounds 1,3,6 → 3.\n\nPolycarpus's losses: rounds 2,4 → 2. Which matches the sample output of 3 2. So the code would correctly compute that.\n\nThus, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the problem is to compute LCM.\n\nImplementing that in Python:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to import math.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut for very large T (like 1e6), the code may take some time, but it's manageable.\n\nBut let's think about when T is 1e6. For each of the T rounds, we process two characters and compute the loss. That's acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_loss(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    # Check if a beats b\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    # Compute sum for one cycle\n    sum_nik_cycle = 0\n    sum_poly_cycle = 0\n    for i in range(T):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = compute_loss(a, b)\n        sum_nik_cycle += nik\n        sum_poly_cycle += poly\n    # Now compute how many full cycles and remainder\n    q = n // T\n    r = n % T\n    # Compute sum for the remainder\n    sum_nik_remain = 0\n    sum_poly_remain = 0\n    for i in range(r):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = compute_loss(a, b)\n        sum_nik_remain += nik\n        sum_poly_remain += poly\n    total_nik = q * sum_nik_cycle + sum_nik_remain\n    total_poly = q * sum_poly_cycle + sum_poly_remain\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, the input reading part is problematic. Because when using input().split(), if the input is read via sys.stdin.read().split(), it's possible that the input is split into tokens. But the problem is that the input for A and B may contain spaces? No, according to the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters, and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters. So the input is:\n\nFirst line is n.\n\nSecond line is the string A (without any spaces).\n\nThird line is the string B (without any spaces).\n\nSo when reading via sys.stdin.read().split(), the input will be split into tokens based on whitespace. For example, if the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen sys.stdin.read().split() would return ['7', 'RPS', 'RSPP'].\n\nBut if the input is read as:\n\ninput = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\nn = int(input[0])\n\nA = input[1]\n\nB = input[2]\n\nBut what if the input is given with multiple lines? For example, the first line is n, then the second line is A, then third line is B. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake in the way the sample input is presented. Because in the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nBut in the sample input description, it's written as ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'] — perhaps that's a mistake. But regardless, the code should read the first line as n, the second as A, the third as B.\n\nBut when using sys.stdin.read().split(), the input is split into tokens, and the first token is n, the second is A, the third is B. So that's correct.\n\nBut if the input is read via input() in Python, then for example, the code would read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nWhich is better, perhaps. Because for cases where the input lines may have leading/trailing whitespaces (but according to the problem statement, the input strings A and B are given as strings of R, S, P, so no whitespaces).\n\nSo perhaps the code should be written as:\n\nRead n via input(), then read A via input().strip(), then read B via input().strip().\n\nBut in some cases, the code may have to read from standard input, which may have multiple lines. So in Python, the code can be:\n\nimport sys, math\n\ndef compute_loss(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    # compute LCM\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    sum_nik_cycle = 0\n    sum_poly_cycle = 0\n    for i in range(T):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = compute_loss(a, b)\n        sum_nik_cycle += nik\n        sum_poly_cycle += poly\n    q = n // T\n    r = n % T\n    sum_nik_remain = 0\n    sum_poly_remain = 0\n    for i in range(r):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = compute_loss(a, b)\n        sum_nik_remain += nik\n        sum_poly_remain += poly\n    total_nik = q * sum_nik_cycle + sum_nik_remain\n    total_poly = q * sum_poly_cycle + sum_poly_remain\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut why not use sys.stdin.readline()? Because sometimes, after reading n, the next lines may have leading or trailing whitespaces. But the problem says that the input is given correctly.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is 7, then the second line is RPS, third is RSPP. So the code should read correctly.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen, the code would read n=7, A='RPS', B='RSPP'.\n\nThen m=3, k=4. T = 12.\n\nsum_nik_cycle and sum_poly_cycle for T=12 rounds.\n\nBut for the code, that would be processed correctly.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nThe second example in the problem's note is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nSo n=5, A is 'RRRRRRRR' (length 8), B is 'R' (length 1). LCM(8,1) is 8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds:\n\nA's moves are R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R.\n\nB's moves are R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R.\n\nAll rounds are draws. So sum_nik_cycle is 0, sum_poly_cycle is 0. So for n=5, which is 5 rounds. q=5//8=0, r=5. So sum_remain is 0. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where n is 0? No, according to the input constraints, n ≥1.\n\nAnother case: when m and k are 1. Then T=1. So for each round, same as the first round. So for n rounds, the same as the first round.\n\nAnother case: when A and B are same sequences. Then all rounds are draws.\n\nAnother case: when A is \"R\" and B is \"S\". Then for each round, Nikephoros wins. So for n rounds, Nikephoros has 0 losses, Polycarpus has n.\n\nBut the code would compute T = 1, sum_nik_cycle is 0, sum_poly_cycle is 1. So for n=5, total is 0 and 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nBut what about when T is larger than n? For example, n=5, T=10. Then q=0, r=5. So the code processes the first 5 rounds.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code for Python.\n\nBut in Python, for very large T (up to 1e6), the code may take some time. However, given that m and k are up to 1000, T can be up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, the code would compute q and r correctly.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nThe code must be written in Python, read from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_loss(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    sum_nik_cycle = 0\n    sum_poly_cycle = 0\n    for i in range(T):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = compute_loss(a, b)\n        sum_nik_cycle += nik\n        sum_poly_cycle += poly\n    q = n // T\n    r = n % T\n    sum_nik_remain = 0\n    sum_poly_remain = 0\n    for i in range(r):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = compute_loss(a, b)\n        sum_nik_remain += nik\n        sum_poly_remain += poly\n    total_nik = q * sum_nik_cycle + sum_nik_remain\n    total_poly = q * sum_poly_cycle + sum_poly_remain\n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the code may read the input incorrectly. For example, if the input lines have leading or trailing whitespaces. However, the problem states that the input sequences are given as strings of R, S, P. So the code uses strip() to remove any leading/trailing whitespaces, which is correct.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen:\n\nA is 'RPS', B is 'RSPP'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n is 0. But the problem says n ≥1.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player (Nikephoros and Polycarpus) loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds. Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves, and we need an efficient approach given the potentially large number of rounds (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Game Rules**: Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same item, it's a draw.\n2. **Cyclic Sequences**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The challenge is to efficiently determine the outcomes over a large number of rounds without simulating each round individually.\n3. **Cycle Detection**: The outcomes of the rounds repeat every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of the two sequences. This allows us to compute the results for one full cycle and then scale it up for the total number of rounds.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By leveraging the periodicity of the sequences, we can compute the results for one full cycle and then use this to determine the results for the entire number of rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_loss(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    sum_nik_cycle = 0\n    sum_poly_cycle = 0\n    for i in range(T):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = compute_loss(a, b)\n        sum_nik_cycle += nik\n        sum_poly_cycle += poly\n    q = n // T\n    r = n % T\n    sum_nik_remain = 0\n    sum_poly_remain = 0\n    for i in range(r):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = compute_loss(a, b)\n        sum_nik_remain += nik\n        sum_poly_remain += poly\n    total_nik = q * sum_nik_cycle + sum_nik_remain\n    total_poly = q * sum_poly_cycle + sum_poly_remain\n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is computed to determine the period after which the sequence of moves repeats.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round within one full cycle (determined by the LCM), we calculate the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Scaling Up**: Using the results from one full cycle, we compute the total losses for the entire number of rounds by considering the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds after these cycles.\n5. **Output**: The results are printed as the number of losses for each player.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the potentially very large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, thus avoiding the need to simulate each round individually.",
