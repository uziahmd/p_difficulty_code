The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then compare them and see who loses. The challenge is that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round step by step is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, the key is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, so that we can compute the number of losses in each cycle and then multiply by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think: Nikephoros's sequence A has length m, and Polycarpus's sequence B has length k. The moves for each player repeat every m and k rounds respectively. So the combined pattern of their moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because LCM is the least common multiple of m and k. So after LCM(m, k) rounds, the same pair of moves will be repeated again.\n\nTherefore, the idea is to compute for one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, how many times each player loses. Then, calculate how many full cycles there are in n rounds, multiply by the counts per cycle, and then add the results from the remaining rounds (if any).\n\nBut first, let's figure out how to compute the moves for each round. For round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k]. Then compare them.\n\nSo, for each round in the cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, we can compute the outcome once. Then, since n can be very large, we can calculate how many full cycles there are and multiply by the per-cycle counts, then handle the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how do I compute LCM(m, k)? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need to compute GCD first. Python has math.gcd, but it returns the absolute value, and since m and k are positive, that's fine.\n\nBut first, let's think about the steps:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n\n2. For each of the period rounds, compute the moves of A and B, compare them, and count how many times each player loses in this period.\n\n3. Then, total number of full periods is n // period, and the remainder is n % period.\n\n4. So total losses for each player would be (full_periods * losses_in_period) + losses_in_remainder_rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the losses_in_period and losses_in_remainder_rounds?\n\nYes. But for the remainder rounds, we need to process each of the first 'remainder' rounds of the period.\n\nBut for the period, since it's LCM(m, k), which could be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000 each, LCM could be up to 1e6). Wait, 1000 * 1000 is 1e6. So for each period, processing each of the LCM rounds is feasible. Because even if LCM is 1e6, and for each round, we check the moves and count the losses, that's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each possible round in the period (from 0 to period-1) what the outcome is. Then, for the full periods, multiply by the number of full periods. Then process the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the outcome for a given round i (where i is 0-based in the overall rounds)?\n\nFor each round i in the total n rounds:\n\nNikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nSo for each i from 0 to period-1, we can compute the moves and determine who loses (if anyone).\n\nSo for the entire period, we can calculate the total number of times each player loses in that period. Then, multiply by the number of full periods.\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds (remainder = n % period), we need to process each of the first 'remainder' rounds in the period and accumulate the losses.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute the outcome between two moves.\n\nLet's think about the rules. For two moves, a and b:\n\nIf a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\n- Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n- Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n- Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\nSo, if a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a pinch (so Nikephoros's loss count increases by 0, and Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1? Or wait, no. Wait, the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so he gets a pinch. So Nikephoros's red spots (losses) are when he loses. So for each round, if Nikephoros loses, his count increases by 1, and similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo, for each round, we have to check if Nikephoros's move beats Polycarpus's move. If so, then Polycarpus loses (so his count increases by 1). If Polycarpus's move beats Nikephoros's, then Nikephoros loses (his count increases by 1). Else, nothing.\n\nSo for a given pair (a, b), how to determine who loses?\n\nLet me write a helper function:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes. So for each pair of moves, this function returns (n_loss, p_loss) for that round.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute the period as LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the period rounds, the (n_loss, p_loss) per round. Sum all these over the period to get total_period_n, total_period_p.\n\nThen, full_cycles = n // period\n\nremaining_rounds = n % period\n\nSo, total_n = full_cycles * total_period_n + sum of first remaining_rounds rounds' n_loss.\n\nSame for total_p.\n\nSo the problem becomes how to compute for each of the first 'remaining_rounds' rounds in the period, their contribution.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for the first 'remaining_rounds' rounds?\n\nWell, for that, we can precompute an array of cumulative sums for the period. For example, for each i in 0..period-1, we can have a list of (n_loss, p_loss) for that round, and then have a prefix sum array. Then, for the first r rounds, the total is prefix[r].\n\nBut for the period, which can be up to 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n, A, B.\n\n2. Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n3. Compute period = LCM(m, k).\n\n4. For each i in 0 to period-1:\n\n   a. Get a_move = A[i % m]\n\n   b. Get b_move = B[i % k]\n\n   c. Compute (n_loss, p_loss) for this round.\n\n   d. Add to total_period_n and total_period_p.\n\n5. Compute full_cycles = n // period\n\n6. remaining_rounds = n % period\n\n7. Now, compute the sum for the first remaining_rounds rounds in the period.\n\nBut how to compute that? Well, during step 4, we can also build a list of per_round_n and per_round_p, and then compute prefix sums.\n\nSo for example, create a list called per_round_n, where per_round_n[i] is the number of times Nikephoros loses in the i-th round of the period. Similarly per_round_p for Polycarpus. Then, create prefix_n and prefix_p arrays, where prefix_n[i] is the sum of per_round_n[0..i-1], and similarly for prefix_p.\n\nThen, the sum for the first r rounds is prefix_n[r] and prefix_p[r].\n\nSo for the remaining_rounds, we take the first 'remaining_rounds' rounds, which is prefix_n[remaining_rounds] and prefix_p[remaining_rounds].\n\nThus, the total for Nikephoros is full_cycles * total_period_n + prefix_n[remaining_rounds], and similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nBut how to compute the per_round_n and per_round_p?\n\nYes. So during step 4, for each i in 0 to period-1, compute the (n_loss, p_loss) for that round, and store them in per_round_n and per_round_p. Then compute the prefix sums.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nCompute m, k, period.\n\nprecompute per_round_n and per_round_p for each of the period rounds.\n\nCompute prefix_n and prefix_p.\n\nThen, total_n = full_cycles * total_period_n + prefix_n[remaining_rounds]\n\nSimilarly for total_p.\n\nBut let's think about the case when n is less than period. Then, full_cycles is 0, and remaining_rounds is n. So the code handles that.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute LCM.\n\nIn Python, math.gcd is available. So LCM can be computed as m * k // gcd(m, k). But note that for Python versions before 3.9, math.lcm is not available, but since the problem says to use Python, perhaps assuming that it's allowed. However, perhaps better to compute it ourselves.\n\nBut since m and k are up to 1000, their product is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo code for LCM:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to import math.\n\nNow, for the example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (length 3), B is \"RSPP\" (length 4). LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nThen for each of the 12 rounds, compute the moves and the losses.\n\nBut the sample has 7 rounds. So full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, remaining_rounds =7.\n\nSo we need to compute the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the example explanation, the first round is R vs R (draw), then P vs S (Nikephoros loses?), etc. Let me check.\n\nWait, the sample input says:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\nn=7\n\nA is RPS (so m=3)\n\nB is RSPP (k=4)\n\nSo for each round i from 0 to 6 (since n=7):\n\nRound 0: i=0. A[0%3] = A[0] = R. B[0%4] = B[0] = R. Draw. No loss.\n\nRound 1: i=1. A[1%3]=A[1]=P. B[1%4]=B[1]=S. P vs S. S beats P? Wait, S is scissors, P is paper. Scissors beats paper. So B's move (S) beats A's move (P). So Nikephoros (A) loses. So Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, the first round is R-R (draw), then P vs S. According to the example explanation, Nikephoros loses here. Which would be the case if the move is P vs S. Because S beats P. So Nikephoros's move is P, which is paper, and B's move is S (scissors). So B wins, Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros's count increases by 1. So for that round, the per_round_n is 1, per_round_p is 0.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the first round is round 1 (maybe the rounds are 1-based?), but the example shows the first round as R-R. So perhaps the rounds are 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the sample explanation.\n\nIn the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R - R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P - S (Nikephoros loses)\n\nRound 3: S - P (Polycarpus loses)\n\nRound 4: R - P (Nikephoros loses)\n\nRound 5: P - R (Polycarpus loses)\n\nRound 6: S - S (draw)\n\nRound 7: R - P (Nikephoros loses)\n\nSo total 7 rounds. So the rounds are numbered from 1 to 7. So for the code, when i is 0 to 6 (for 7 rounds), the code's calculation would be for each round.\n\nBut in code, for the first round (i=0), the moves are A[0%3] = R and B[0%4] = R. So that's correct.\n\nSo for the first sample, the per_round_n and per_round_p for the first 7 rounds would be:\n\nLet's compute each of the 7 rounds:\n\nRound 0 (i=0):\n\nA: R, B: R → draw → (0, 0)\n\nRound 1 (i=1):\n\nA: P, B: S → B wins → Nikephoros loses → (1, 0)\n\nRound 2 (i=2):\n\nA: S, B: P → A's S beats B's P → B loses → (0, 1)\n\nRound 3 (i=3):\n\nA: R (since 3 mod 3 is 0 → A[0] = R), B: 3 mod 4 is 3 → B[3] = P. R vs P → P beats R → Nikephoros loses → (1, 0)\n\nRound 4 (i=4):\n\nA: 4 mod 3 is 1 → A[1] = P. B: 4 mod 4 is 0 → B[0] = R. P vs R → P beats R → B loses. So Nikephoros wins. So (0, 1).\n\nWait, no. Wait, A's move is P (paper), B's move is R (rock). Paper beats rock. So A wins. So B loses. So Nikephoros (A) doesn't lose. So Nikephoros's loss is 0, and Polycarpus's loss is 1. So (0, 1).\n\nRound 5 (i=5):\n\nA: 5 mod 3 is 2 → A[2] = S. B: 5 mod 4 is 1 → B[1] = S. S vs S → draw. (0,0).\n\nRound 6 (i=6):\n\nA: 6 mod 3 is 0 → R. B: 6 mod 4 is 2 → B[2] = P. R vs P → P beats R. Nikephoros loses. (1, 0).\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds, the per_round_n is:\n\n[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] → sum is 0+1+0+1+0+0+1 = 3 → which matches the sample's output of 3 for Nikephoros's loss.\n\nAnd per_round_p is [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0] → sum is 0+0+1+0+1+0+0 = 2 → which matches sample's 2 for Polycarpus's loss.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing all that.\n\nNow, handling the prefix sums.\n\nSo, for the period, we can generate a list of per_round_n and per_round_p. Then, compute prefix sums for each.\n\nBut for the code, the steps would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each i in 0 to period-1:\n\n   a = A[i % m]\n\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n   compute (n_loss, p_loss) for this round.\n\nsum all the n_loss and p_loss for the period.\n\nThen compute full_cycles = n // period.\n\nremaining_rounds = n % period.\n\nThen, compute the sum for the first remaining_rounds rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for the first remaining_rounds rounds? We can precompute prefix sums for the per_round_n and per_round_p.\n\nSo, for example, create a list called prefix_n where prefix_n[i] is the sum of the first i rounds (i.e., rounds 0 to i-1). Similarly for prefix_p.\n\nThen, the sum for the first r rounds is prefix_n[r], prefix_p[r].\n\nSo for the code:\n\nWe can generate a list of per_round_n and per_round_p for each of the period rounds. Then compute prefix sums.\n\nFor example:\n\nper_n = []\nper_p = []\n\nfor i in range(period):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    # compute n_loss and p_loss\n    # append to per_n and per_p\n\nThen, compute prefix_n and prefix_p:\n\nprefix_n = [0]*(period + 1)\nprefix_p = [0]*(period + 1)\n\nfor i in range(period):\n    prefix_n[i+1] = prefix_n[i] + per_n[i]\n    prefix_p[i+1] = prefix_p[i] + per_p[i]\n\nThen, for the remaining_rounds, we take prefix_n[remaining_rounds], and same for p.\n\nSo, the total_n = full_cycles * total_period_n + prefix_n[remaining_rounds]\n\nSame for total_p.\n\nNow, the code structure is clear.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle very large n (up to 2e9), but with period up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the code in Python.\n\nBut first, the helper function for the result of a round.\n\nLet me write a helper function:\n\ndef get_loss(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nperiod = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nper_n = []\nper_p = []\n\nfor i in range(period):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    res = get_loss(a, b)\n    per_n.append(res[0])\n    per_p.append(res[1])\n\ntotal_period_n = sum(per_n)\ntotal_period_p = sum(per_p)\n\nfull_cycles = n // period\nremaining_rounds = n % period\n\n# compute prefix sums\nprefix_n = [0] * (period + 1)\nprefix_p = [0] * (period + 1)\n\nfor i in range(period):\n    prefix_n[i+1] = prefix_n[i] + per_n[i]\n    prefix_p[i+1] = prefix_p[i] + per_p[i]\n\ntotal_n = full_cycles * total_period_n + prefix_n[remaining_rounds]\ntotal_p = full_cycles * total_period_p + prefix_p[remaining_rounds]\n\nprint(total_n, total_p)\n\nWait, but the sample input in the first example:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich gives output 3 2.\n\nBut according to the code:\n\nperiod is LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nfull_cycles = 7//12 = 0.\n\nremaining_rounds =7.\n\nprefix_n[7] is the sum of the first 7 rounds, which is 3. Similarly for prefix_p[7] = 2. So output is 3 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nFor each of 8 rounds, the moves are:\n\nA's move is R for all rounds (since i%8 is 0,1,...7, but A is all R).\n\nB's move is R for all rounds (since i%1 is 0, and B is \"R\").\n\nSo all rounds are draws. So per_n and per_p are all 0. So total_period_n and total_period_p are 0. So for n=5, full_cycles is 5//8=0, remaining_rounds=5. So the sum is 0 and 0. Hence output 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase when n is zero? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nOther edge cases:\n\n- All rounds are draws. So output 0 0.\n\n- One of the sequences is longer than the other.\n\nBut the code should handle all.\n\nAnother test case: when m=1, k=1. So period is 1. For each round, compare A[0] and B[0]. So for n=1e9, it's full_cycles = 1e9, and each cycle contributes the same as the single round.\n\nSo code would compute per_n and per_p for 1 round, multiply by 1e9, and add 0 for remaining_rounds (since 1e9 % 1 is 0).\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when the period is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, LCM is at least 1.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, like 2e9, the code is efficient. Because the period is up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1e3, LCM is up to 1e6). So for each period, the code loops 1e6 times. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, coding that in Python.\n\nBut note that in the input, the first line is n, then the second line is A, third is B. But in the sample input, the first input is given as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut in actual input, the user would input three lines: first line is n, second is A, third is B.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A.\n\nThe third line contains sequence B.\n\nSo, in the code, the input is read as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is given as a list of two elements, but that's probably a formatting error. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich would be read as n=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_loss(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nperiod = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nper_n = []\nper_p = []\n\nfor i in range(period):\n    a_char = A[i % m]\n    b_char = B[i % k]\n    n_loss, p_loss = get_loss(a_char, b_char)\n    per_n.append(n_loss)\n    per_p.append(p_loss)\n\ntotal_period_n = sum(per_n)\ntotal_period_p = sum(per_p)\n\nfull_cycles = n // period\nremaining_rounds = n % period\n\nprefix_n = [0] * (period + 1)\nprefix_p = [0] * (period + 1)\n\nfor i in range(period):\n    prefix_n[i+1] = prefix_n[i] + per_n[i]\n    prefix_p[i+1] = prefix_p[i] + per_p[i]\n\ntotal_n = full_cycles * total_period_n + prefix_n[remaining_rounds]\ntotal_p = full_cycles * total_period_p + prefix_p[remaining_rounds]\n\nprint(total_n, total_p)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting it against the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nOutput: 3 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly equal to period.\n\nLike n = period. Then remaining_rounds is 0. So the code adds full_cycles * total_period, and prefix_n[0] = 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when A is \"R\" and B is \"S\". So m=1, k=1. period is 1. Each round, R vs S: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So per_n is 0, per_p is 1. For n=2, full_cycles is 2, total_period_n is 0, total_period_p is 1. So total_n is 0*2 + 0 (since remaining_rounds is 0) = 0. total_p is 2*1 + 0 = 2. So output is 0 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use a more efficient approach based on cycles and prefix sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cycles**: Each player's move sequence repeats cyclically. The combined cycle length for both players is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their respective sequences.\n2. **Cycle Analysis**: Calculate the number of losses for each player over one full cycle of LCM length. This allows us to determine how many times this cycle repeats within the total number of rounds.\n3. **Prefix Sums**: Use prefix sums to efficiently compute the number of losses for any number of rounds within a cycle, which helps in handling the remaining rounds after accounting for full cycles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_loss(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nperiod = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nper_n = []\nper_p = []\n\nfor i in range(period):\n    a_char = A[i % m]\n    b_char = B[i % k]\n    n_loss, p_loss = get_loss(a_char, b_char)\n    per_n.append(n_loss)\n    per_p.append(p_loss)\n\ntotal_period_n = sum(per_n)\ntotal_period_p = sum(per_p)\n\nfull_cycles = n // period\nremaining_rounds = n % period\n\nprefix_n = [0] * (period + 1)\nprefix_p = [0] * (period + 1)\n\nfor i in range(period):\n    prefix_n[i+1] = prefix_n[i] + per_n[i]\n    prefix_p[i+1] = prefix_p[i] + per_p[i]\n\ntotal_n = full_cycles * total_period_n + prefix_n[remaining_rounds]\ntotal_p = full_cycles * total_period_p + prefix_p[remaining_rounds]\n\nprint(total_n, total_p)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the period after which both sequences repeat their moves simultaneously.\n2. **Loss Calculation**: For each round within one period, determine the outcome and accumulate the number of losses for each player.\n3. **Full Cycles and Remainders**: Calculate the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds. Use prefix sums to quickly compute the losses for the remaining rounds.\n4. **Efficient Summation**: By leveraging prefix sums, we avoid recalculating losses for each round repeatedly, ensuring the solution handles large input sizes efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle up to 2 billion rounds efficiently by reducing the problem size using cycle detection and prefix sums, making the solution both optimal and scalable.",
