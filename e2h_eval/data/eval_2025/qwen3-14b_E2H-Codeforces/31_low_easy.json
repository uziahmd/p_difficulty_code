Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any number of cards from the infinite set of -x to x.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards needed to sum up to T, where each card's value is between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers in that range, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think. For example, if T is 0, then no cards are needed. Otherwise, what's the minimal number of cards required?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible contribution per card. Each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, to reach T, the minimal number of cards would be determined by the maximum possible per card.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose T is 5, and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to +2. So 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2*2=4, which is less than 5. So 3 cards: 2+2+1. But wait, but the maximum per card is 2. So 2+2+1 is allowed. But how do I find the minimal number of cards?\n\nWait, the problem is that the sum of the new cards must be exactly T. So for any T, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if T is not zero. Wait, but maybe there's a case where T is divisible by x. For example, if T is 4 and x is 2, then two cards of 2 each. So 4/2 = 2. So yes, that's the minimal.\n\nBut if T is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so ceiling is 3. So that's correct. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is negative? Well, since the cards can be negative. So for example, T is -5. Then we can take 3 cards of -2, -2, -1. So same as 5, but with negatives. So the absolute value is the key here.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards needed is ceil( |T| / x ), but only when T is not zero. If T is zero, then zero cards are needed.\n\nBut wait, let me check some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nInput is 3 2, with numbers -1, 1, 2. The sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So |T| is 2. Divided by x (2) is 1. So the minimal is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nIn the second example: input is 2 3, numbers -2, -2. Sum is -4. So T is 4. |T| is 4. Divided by x (3) is 1.333..., so ceiling is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems to work. So the formula is:\n\nCompute the sum of the found cards. Let T be the negative of that sum. If T is zero, answer is 0. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, how to compute that in Python?\n\nBut wait, how to compute the ceiling of division. Let me think. For integers a and b, the ceiling of a / b can be computed as (a + b - 1) // b. For example, 5 / 2 is 2.5. (5 + 2 -1) // 2 = 6//2=3. Which is correct. Similarly, 4/2 is 2. (4 + 2-1) //2 =5//2=2. Correct.\n\nSo in code, for T != 0, the minimal number is (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n\n2. Read the list of numbers.\n\n3. Compute the sum S of the list.\n\n4. Compute T = -S.\n\n5. If T is 0, output 0.\n\n6. Else, compute (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x",
