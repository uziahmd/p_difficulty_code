They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about determining which team skill levels can be champions given the tournament structure and the rules for each phase. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the tournament works. So there are 2^n teams. Each phase halves the number of teams. For example, in the first phase, there are 2^{n-1} games. Then in the next phase, 2^{n-2}, and so on until one remains. Each phase has a rule: if s_i is 0, then in that phase, the lower skill level team wins; if it's 1, the higher skill level wins. \n\nThe key is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nBut how do we model the tournament? Since the permutation p is arbitrary except that it's a permutation of 1 to 2^n, but the tournament outcome depends on the rules of each phase. \n\nWait, but the permutation p defines the initial arrangement of the teams. However, the problem says that we can choose any permutation p such that x is the champion. So our job is to find all x for which there exists some arrangement of the teams (i.e., some permutation) where x ends up as the winner.\n\nBut how do we model the tournament structure? Let's think recursively. \n\nLet me think about the tournament as a binary tree. Each round is a level in the tree. The first round (phase 1) is the leaves' parents, then the next phase is their parents, etc. For each phase, the way matches are decided depends on the s_i value.\n\nBut the problem is that the initial arrangement of the teams in the bracket affects who they face in each round. For example, in the first phase, team 1 plays team 2, team 3 vs 4, etc. So the initial positions of the teams in the bracket matter. So for a given x, we need to arrange the initial bracket in such a way that x can win through all the phases according to the rules.\n\nBut how do we model this? For each possible x, can we determine if there's a way to arrange the teams such that x can win?\n\nLet me think about the process. For x to be the champion, it must win all the rounds. Each round's outcome depends on the current phase's rule (s_i). \n\nLet me consider the phases in order. The first phase is the earliest round, then the second phase is the next, etc. For example, in phase i (starting from 1?), the rule is determined by s[i-1], since the string is of length n. Wait, the problem says the string s has length n. For each phase i (from 1 to n), during the i-th phase, there are 2^{n - i} games. \n\nSo for example, when n=3, the first phase (phase 1) has 2^(3-1) = 4 games. Then phase 2 has 2^(3-2)=2 games, and phase 3 has 1 game.\n\nNow, during each phase, the matches are between the winners of previous matches. So the structure of the tournament is fixed. But the initial arrangement of the teams (the permutation p) determines which teams are in which part of the bracket.\n\nBut how can we model the possible paths that x can take through the tournament? For x to be the champion, in each phase, it must be able to win its match according to the rule of that phase. However, the opponents it faces in each phase depend on the initial arrangement and the results of previous matches.\n\nBut since we can choose the permutation p, perhaps we can arrange the initial bracket such that x can get through all the rounds. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that for x to be the champion, in each round, it must be able to win against the opponent it faces. The opponent depends on the bracket structure and the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nBut how can we model the possible minimum and maximum values that x can have in each round? For example, during phase 1 (the first round), if the rule is 0 (lower skill wins), then x can only win if it's paired with a higher-skilled team. But if the rule is 1, then x must be the higher-skilled team in that match.\n\nBut since the initial arrangement is under our control, perhaps we can arrange the bracket such that in each round, x is matched against the best possible opponents (according to the rules) to allow it to proceed.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that for x to be a winning integer, there exists at least one permutation p where x is the champion. So we need to find all x where such a permutation exists.\n\nSo, perhaps for each x, we can model the constraints on the possible opponents that x must face in each round, given the rules of the phases.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For x to reach the final, it must pass through each round. Let's think of the rounds as layers. For example, in the first round (phase 1), there are 2^{n-1} games. In the second round (phase 2), there are 2^{n-2} games, etc. So for each round i (where i ranges from 1 to n), x must win its match according to the rule of that phase.\n\nLet me think of the rounds as levels. For example, in round 1, x is in a group of two teams. In round 2, x is in a group of four teams (but only two teams from the previous round), etc. Wait, no. Each round halves the number of teams. So for round k (assuming k starts from 1), there are 2^{n - k + 1} teams. \n\nBut how does the bracket work? For example, in the first round, each pair of teams plays. The winner proceeds to the next round. So in the second round, each pair is formed by the winners of the previous pairs. So the structure of the bracket is such that the initial positions of the teams determine which other teams they will face in subsequent rounds.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can arrange for x to be placed in a part of the bracket where, in each round, it can win according to the rules of that phase.\n\nBut how to model the required constraints on x's skill level relative to others.\n\nLet me think of each round as requiring that x can beat the opponents it would face in that round. For example, in the first round, if the rule is 0 (lower skill wins), then x must be the lower-skilled team in its match. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose the opponent to be someone with higher skill. However, in the next rounds, the opponents depend on the previous choices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model for each round, the minimal and maximal possible skill levels that x must have, based on the rules of the rounds.\n\nFor example, let's think recursively. Suppose we want x to be the champion. Let's imagine that in each round, x must be able to win according to the rule of that round. So for each round i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1] (since the string is 0-based). \n\nIn the first round (phase 1), the rule is s[0]. If it's 0, then x must be the lower-skilled team in its match. Therefore, the opponent must have a higher skill than x. However, since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose that opponent. But for the next rounds, the opponents that x faces depend on the previous rounds.\n\nBut how can we model the required constraints for x to be able to proceed through all rounds?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each team must win log2(2^n) = n rounds. For x to be the champion, it must win all these rounds. \n\nLet me think of the rounds in reverse. For example, in the last round (phase n), there's only one game. The rule for that phase is s[n-1]. So, the two teams that reach the final must be such that x beats the other according to the rule. But again, since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can arrange that the other team in the final is such that x can beat it.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for all rounds?\n\nMaybe we can model for each round, the possible range of x's skill level based on the rules of that round and the subsequent rounds. \n\nLet me think of the process as follows: For each round, depending on the rule (s[i]), x must be either the minimum or the maximum in its subtree of that round. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. For example, in each round, the way x proceeds depends on the rule. For instance, during phase i, the rule determines whether x needs to be the strongest or weakest in its group of 2^{i} teams. \n\nWait, maybe for each round i (the i-th phase), the number of teams that x must \"dominate\" in that phase depends on the rule. For example, during phase 1, x must be in a group of 2 teams. If the rule is 0, then x must be the weaker one. But during phase 2, x is in a group of 4 teams (since each round doubles the group size?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a series of brackets. Each time, x must win a match. For each match in the tournament, the outcome depends on the rule for that phase. \n\nBut since the initial bracket can be arranged, perhaps for each round, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have compared to the other teams in that round's bracket.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a way to model this with intervals. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model for each round (from the last to the first), the possible range of values that x must have in order to be able to proceed through that round. \n\nFor example, in the last round (phase n), there's only one match. The rule is s[n-1]. So, the other team in the final must be such that x can beat it. If the rule is 1 (higher skill wins), then x must have higher skill than the other team. Since we can choose the other team, we can pick the weakest possible team (so that x can be higher than it). But since all teams have unique skills, the other team could be any value except x. However, for x to be able to proceed, we need that there exists a team that x can beat in that phase. But since the other team is chosen by us (as part of the permutation), we can arrange that. However, the problem is that the other team must have been able to reach the final as well, which depends on previous rounds.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of constraints on x. For x to be the champion, during each phase i (from 1 to n), x must be able to win its match in that phase. The way to model this is to determine for each phase, what is the required relationship between x and the other teams in its path through the tournament.\n\nLet me think recursively. For x to reach the final (phase n), it must have won all previous phases. Let's consider the structure of the tournament. \n\nEach time, in phase i, the number of teams is 2^{n - i + 1}. For example, in phase 1, the number of teams is 2^{n} (original), in phase 2, 2^{n-1}, etc. \n\nBut how does the structure of the bracket affect the possible opponents that x can face in each phase?\n\nAnother idea: For each round, the number of teams that x must defeat is 1 per round. But the opponents in each round depend on the bracket structure. However, since we can arrange the bracket, perhaps we can arrange for x to face opponents that are as weak as possible (if the rule requires x to win by being stronger) or as strong as possible (if the rule requires x to win by being weaker).\n\nBut how to model this. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each round i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. Let's think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. For x to be the champion, it must win all matches along the path from the leaf (initial position) to the root (final match). \n\nIn each match, depending on the rule of the phase (which depends on the depth of the match), x must be either the stronger or weaker team in that match.\n\nBut how can we model the constraints on x's value? For example, in the first round (phase 1), if the rule is 0, then x must be the weaker team in that match. So, the opponent must be stronger than x. But since we can arrange the bracket, we can choose that opponent. However, in the next round, the opponent for x will be the winner of another match. For that match, the rule is phase 2's rule. So, the opponent in phase 2 depends on the rule of phase 2.\n\nBut how can we ensure that x can proceed through all phases? \n\nPerhaps we can model the required constraints on x's value by considering each phase's rule and determining the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have in order to satisfy all phases.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each phase, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible value that x must have in that phase. \n\nFor example, during phase i, the rule is s[i-1]. Let's say that during phase i, x must be the minimum in its group (if s[i-1] is 0) or the maximum (if s[i-1] is 1). Then, the group size for phase i is 2^{n - i + 1} teams. Wait, no. Because in phase i, there are 2^{n - i} games, meaning that the number of teams in that phase is 2^{n - i + 1} (since each game eliminates one team, and the number of teams reduces by half each phase). \n\nBut for x to reach phase i, it must have survived all previous phases. \n\nBut how can we model the constraints on x's value for each phase?\n\nLet me consider the following idea inspired by some similar problems. For each phase, the required condition on x's value depends on the rules of that phase and the subsequent phases. For example, during phase i, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then in that phase, x must be the weakest in its group of 2^{i} teams (since each phase i has groups of 2^{i} teams?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For x to be the champion, during the final phase (phase n), it must be the winner of that phase. The rule for phase n is s[n-1]. So, during that phase, x must be the stronger (if s[n-1] is 1) or weaker (if 0) than its opponent. But since we can choose the opponent, we can arrange that the opponent is the weakest possible (if rule is 1) or strongest possible (if rule is 0). However, the opponent must have survived all previous phases, which depends on their own constraints.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to model the minimal and maximal possible x's value by considering the rules for each phase in reverse order.\n\nHere's an idea from some research: For each round, the required constraints on x can be determined based on the rules of the current and subsequent rounds. For example, during the first round, the rule may require x to be the minimum or maximum in its group. But for the next rounds, the same applies, but for larger groups.\n\nWait, let's think of it as follows. Let's imagine that for x to reach the final, during each phase, it must be the best or worst in its bracket of size 2^{k} for some k. For example, during phase 1 (the first round), the bracket size is 2 teams. During phase 2, the bracket size is 4 teams. Phase 3, 8 teams, etc. Wait, no. Because in phase i, there are 2^{n - i} games. So the number of teams in phase i is 2^{n - i + 1}? Let's see. For example, phase 1 has 2^{n-1} games. Each game eliminates one team, so after phase 1, there are 2^{n} - 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1} teams left. Phase 2 has 2^{n-2} games, leading to 2^{n-2} teams eliminated, leaving 2^{n-2} teams. So, during phase i, the number of teams is 2^{n - i + 1}.\n\nSo, for x to reach phase i, it must have won i-1 phases. Now, during phase i, x is in a group of 2^{i} teams? No. Wait, during phase i, the number of teams is 2^{n - i + 1}. For example, during phase 1, it's 2^{n} teams (original). During phase 2, 2^{n-1} teams. So, during phase i, the number of teams is 2^{n - i + 1} = 2^{n - (i-1)} }, which is 2^{n - i + 1} = 2^{(n - (i-1))} ?\n\nBut how does that relate to the bracket size for x's path?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each team must go through log2(2^n) = n rounds. In each round, the team is in a group of 2^k teams for some k. Wait, perhaps for each round, the group size is 2^{round_number} ?\n\nNo. For example, in the first round (phase 1), the group size is 2 teams. In the second round (phase 2), each group is made of two teams that have won their first-round matches. So the group size is 2^2 = 4 teams? No, because each group in phase 2 consists of two teams (the winners of two first-round matches). So during phase 2, each match is between two teams from the previous round. Hence, the group size for a team in phase i is 2^i teams. Because in the first round (i=1), the group is 2^1 = 2 teams. In the second round (i=2), the group is 2^2 = 4 teams (the two teams in the current match and the two teams that lost to them in the first round). Wait, perhaps not. But the idea is that for x to win in phase i, it must be the best or worst in its group of 2^i teams, depending on the rule of that phase.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each phase i, the required condition is that x is either the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^i teams. Then, the problem reduces to finding for x, whether there exists a way to choose the other teams in its group in each phase such that all these conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut how can we model this? For example, during phase 1, x must be the min or max in a group of 2 teams. Then, during phase 2, x must be the min or max in a group of 4 teams. And so on, up to phase n, where x must be the min or max in a group of 2^n teams (the entire tournament).\n\nBut how can these conditions be satisfied? For example, during phase 1, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the minimum in its 2-team group. Then, during phase 2, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the maximum in its 4-team group. But how can this be possible?\n\nWell, if in phase 1, x was the minimum, then during phase 2, the group of 4 teams includes x and three other teams. But since x was the minimum in its 2-team group, but during phase 2, the rule is higher wins. So x must be the maximum in its 4-team group. Which implies that all other three teams in the group must be less than x. But since x was the minimum in its phase 1 group, that would require that those three teams are also less than x. But that's impossible unless the other teams in the phase 1 group were even smaller than x. But that contradicts x being the minimum in phase 1.\n\nAh, this suggests that the idea of x being the min or max in each group is not correct. So perhaps my previous assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the tournament as a series of matches. Each time, x must win its match according to the rule of that phase. The opponents in each match depend on the previous matches and the initial bracket arrangement.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can model the minimal and maximal possible values of x's skill that would allow it to pass all the rounds.\n\nLet me think of the following method. For each round i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. We can model for each round, the required condition on x's value relative to other teams in that round's match.\n\nFor example, during round i, x must be able to win against its opponent. The opponent depends on the previous rounds. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the opponents in such a way that x can always win.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following. For x to be able to win all rounds, during each round, the rule determines whether x must be stronger or weaker than its opponent in that round. \n\nLet me think recursively. For x to reach the final, during each round, it must win its match. Let's consider the rounds starting from the last one and moving backwards.\n\nFor example, in the last round (phase n), there is only one match. The rule is s[n-1]. So, the other team in this match must be such that x can beat it according to the rule. \n\nIf the rule is 1 (higher skill wins), then x must have a higher skill than the other team. Since we can choose the other team, we can choose any team with a lower skill than x. \n\nBut this other team must have also passed all previous rounds. So, during the previous rounds, this other team must have been able to win its matches according to the rules. \n\nBut since we can choose the initial arrangement, perhaps we can arrange for the other team to be the weakest possible, allowing x to be higher than it. But how to ensure that this other team can reach the final.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a pattern here. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the minimal and maximal possible values x can have based on the rules of each phase. \n\nLet's define for each phase i (starting from the last one), the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to be able to proceed through all phases up to that point.\n\nFor example, during phase n (the last one), the rule is s[n-1]. Let's say that during this phase, x must be the higher or lower in the match. Let's think of the required constraints on x's value. \n\nSuppose during phase n, the rule is 1 (higher wins). Then, x must be higher than its opponent. Since we can choose the opponent, the opponent can be any team with a value less than x. However, for the opponent to reach the final, it must have passed all previous phases. So, during the previous phases, the opponent must have been able to win according to the rules of those phases. \n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps the opponent can be chosen such that it is the weakest possible team (so that x can be higher than it). However, the weakest team must also have passed all previous phases. \n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe there's a better way. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by some solutions for similar problems. For each round, the required condition on x is that it is either the minimum or maximum in a certain set of teams. \n\nLet's imagine that for each round i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. We can model the constraints on x as follows:\n\n- For each round i, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then in that round, x must be the strongest among the 2^{i} teams in its bracket. Because in that round, it must win against its opponent, and if the rule is higher wins, then x must be stronger than the opponent. But to ensure that x can proceed through all rounds, it must be the strongest in its bracket of 2^i teams. Similarly, if the rule is 0, x must be the weakest in its bracket of 2^i teams.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me think about it. For example, during phase 1 (i=1), the bracket size is 2 teams. If the rule is 1, then x must be the strongest in that bracket (so that it can win). If the rule is 0, it must be the weakest. \n\nThen, during phase 2 (i=2), the bracket size is 4 teams. For x to reach phase 2, it must have won phase 1. Now, during phase 2, the rule is s[1]. If it's 1, then x must be the strongest in its bracket of 4 teams. This ensures that it can win its phase 2 match. Similarly for other rules.\n\nIf this is true, then for x to be the champion, it must be the strongest or weakest in each bracket of size 2^i teams for each phase i, depending on the rule of that phase.\n\nBut how can this be possible? Because the brackets for different phases are overlapping. For example, the bracket for phase 2 includes the bracket for phase 1. \n\nLet me take an example. Suppose n=3, and the rules are 1,0,1 (string '101'). So for phase 1 (i=1), rule is 1: x must be the strongest in a bracket of 2 teams. Phase 2 (i=2), rule is 0: x must be the weakest in a bracket of 4 teams. Phase 3 (i=3), rule is 1: x must be the strongest in a bracket of 8 teams (the whole tournament). \n\nBut how can x be the strongest in a bracket of 2 teams (phase 1), then the weakest in a bracket of 4 teams (phase 2)? That would require that in phase 2, x is the weakest among 4 teams, but one of those teams is the one that x defeated in phase 1 (which would have a lower skill than x, since x was the strongest in phase 1). So that would imply that x is the weakest in a group that includes teams with lower skills than x. Which is impossible. \n\nThis suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. \n\nLet me take the example from the problem statement. The first sample input is:\n\nn=3, s=101. Output is 4 5 6 7.\n\nSo the answer is all x from 4 to 7. Let's think why. \n\nThe rules are:\n\nPhase 1: s[0] = '1' → higher wins.\n\nPhase 2: s[1] = '0' → lower wins.\n\nPhase 3: s[2] = '1' → higher wins.\n\nSo for x to be champion, during phase 1, it must be the higher in its 2-team bracket. During phase 2, it must be the lower in its 4-team bracket. During phase 3, it must be the higher in the 8-team bracket.\n\nBut how can that happen? Let's take x=4.\n\nIn phase 1, x must be higher than its opponent. So opponent must be less than 4. Let's say opponent is 1. Then x wins. \n\nIn phase 2, x is in a 4-team bracket. The rule is lower wins. So x must be the lowest in this bracket. The other teams in this bracket are the winner of the previous match (x=4) and the other two teams. Wait, how is the bracket structured? \n\nIn phase 2, the matches are between the winners of phase 1. For example, suppose the initial bracket is arranged such that x is in a group that includes the winners of two phase 1 matches. \n\nBut for x to be the lowest in its 4-team bracket during phase 2, the other three teams in that bracket must have higher skill than x. However, one of those teams is the winner of a phase 1 match. Since in phase 1, the rule was higher wins, that winner must have been higher than their opponent. \n\nSo for example, suppose x=4 is in a group with three other teams, say 5, 6, 7. Then during phase 2, the rule is lower wins. So x (4) must be the lowest in this group. Which is true, since 5,6,7 are higher. So x can win its phase 2 match. \n\nThen, in phase 3, the rule is higher wins. So x must be the highest in the entire bracket of 8 teams. But in this scenario, there are teams like 5,6,7, etc., which are higher than x. How can x be the highest in the entire bracket?\n\nThis seems contradictory. So clearly, there's a mistake in my previous reasoning. \n\nAh! Wait, during phase 3, there's only one match. The two teams that reach the final must be the winners of their respective phase 2 matches. For x to be the winner of phase 3, it must be higher than the other finalist. But during phase 2, x was the lowest in its group of 4 teams. How can it reach the final? Because in phase 2, x must have won its match. \n\nLet me think again. During phase 2, the rule is lower wins. So in the phase 2 match, x must be the lower of the two teams in that match. So, in phase 2, x's opponent must have a higher skill than x. But x wins the match because it's lower. \n\nSo during phase 2, x's group is the 4 teams from phase 1. The phase 2 match is between two teams that are the winners of two phase 1 matches. For example, suppose in phase 2, x is in a match against another team y. For x to win, x must be lower than y (because phase 2's rule is 0). So y must be higher than x. \n\nBut how did y get to phase 2? Because y must have won its phase 1 match. Which means that in phase 1, y was higher than its opponent. \n\nSo, during phase 2, x is in a group of 4 teams. But the other teams in the group may not be directly relevant. What matters is that x wins its match in phase 2. \n\nSo perhaps the earlier idea of requiring x to be the minimum or maximum in a group of 2^i teams is incorrect. Instead, for each phase, x must be able to win its match in that phase, given the rule. The opponents in each phase are determined by the previous matches and the initial bracket setup. \n\nBut since we can choose the initial bracket, perhaps we can arrange the opponents in such a way that x can win all matches. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each round, depending on the rule, x must be either the minimum or maximum in its current match. But since the initial bracket can be arranged, we can choose the opponents for x in each round to be as suitable as possible.\n\nFor example, during phase 1, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than its opponent. We can choose the opponent to be any team with lower skill. \n\nDuring phase 2, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be lower than its opponent. But in this case, the opponent is the winner of another phase 1 match. To ensure that x is lower than this opponent, we can arrange that the opponent is a team with higher skill than x. But how can that opponent have won its phase 1 match? Well, the opponent's phase 1 match must have had a rule of 1 (higher wins), so the opponent must have been higher than its own opponent. \n\nBut how can we ensure that such teams exist? \n\nLet me think recursively. For x to be able to win all rounds, we can define for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible values of x based on the rules. \n\nLet's define for each round i (starting from the first), the required value of x. For example, during phase 1, if the rule is 1, x must be higher than some team. But since we can choose that team, it's possible for any x ≥ 1. But this seems too broad. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: For x to be able to proceed through all rounds, it must be able to win each match, and for each match, the required condition is that x's skill is either higher or lower than the opponent's, depending on the rule of that phase. The opponent's skill is determined by the previous rounds. \n\nBut since we can choose the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the opponents in such a way that for each round, the required condition is satisfied. \n\nLet me think of this as a series of constraints. For example:\n\n- In phase 1, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than its opponent. We can choose this opponent to be any team with lower skill than x. \n\n- In phase 2, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be lower than its opponent. This opponent is the winner of another phase 1 match. To ensure this, we need that this opponent is higher than x. But for this opponent to have won its phase 1 match, it must have been higher than its own opponent (since phase 1's rule is 1). So, this opponent can be any team higher than x, and we can choose its own opponent to be lower than it. \n\nThis seems possible as long as there are enough teams higher than x. \n\nSimilarly, for phase 3, if the rule is 1, then x must be higher than its opponent. This opponent is the winner of phase 2, which requires that during phase 2, the opponent was lower than its own opponent. But this seems complex. \n\nBut how can we find the range of x that allows this? \n\nMaybe the key is to determine for each phase i, what is the minimal and maximal possible value that x must have, based on the rules of the phases up to i. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each phase i, the required condition on x depends on the rule of that phase. We can model the required value of x as follows:\n\n- For each phase i, we can compute the minimum and maximum value that x must have in order to satisfy the rules up to that phase.\n\nLet's start from the first phase and move forward. \n\nFor phase 1 (rule s[0]):\n\n- If s[0] is '1', x must be higher than its opponent. So, x can be any value from 2 to 2^n (since there's at least one team with lower skill).\n\n- If s[0] is '0', x must be lower than its opponent. So x can be any value from 1 to 2^n - 1.\n\nBut this is too simplistic, because the subsequent phases may impose additional constraints.\n\nFor example, if phase 2's rule is '0', then x must be lower than its opponent in phase 2. But that opponent is the winner of phase 1, which must have been higher than its own opponent. So, for x to be lower than this opponent, the opponent must be higher than x. This implies that x must be lower than some team that is higher than its own opponent. \n\nBut how does this affect x's value?\n\nMaybe we need to consider the rules in reverse order. Let's think recursively from the last phase backward. \n\nLet me think of the following: For x to win the tournament, it must win the final match (phase n). The rule for phase n is s[n-1]. Let's denote this rule as r_n.\n\nIf r_n is '1', then x must be higher than its opponent in the final. Since we can choose the opponent, we can choose any team lower than x. But for this opponent to reach the final, it must have passed all previous phases.\n\nSimilarly, if r_n is '0', x must be lower than its opponent in the final. So, the opponent must be higher than x, and it must have passed all previous phases.\n\nNow, let's think about what constraints this imposes on x. For example, if r_n is '1', then x must be higher than some team that can reach the final. This team must have passed all previous phases. \n\nBut how to model this?\n\nPerhaps the solution is to determine for each phase, the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have, based on the rules of the current and subsequent phases.\n\nLet me try to define for each phase i, the range [low_i, high_i] such that x must be within this range to be able to proceed through phases i to n.\n\nStarting from the last phase (i = n):\n\n- For phase n, the rule is r_n = s[n-1].\n\n- If r_n is '1', then x must be higher than its opponent in the final. Since we can choose the opponent to be any team with lower skill, x must be at least 2 (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be champions in a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The solution involves analyzing the tournament structure and the rules for each phase to determine valid skill levels for each team.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured such that there are $2^n$ teams, and each phase halves the number of teams until only one remains. Each phase has specific rules (either higher or lower skill wins).\n2. **Skill Level Constraints**: For each phase, based on the rule (higher or lower skill wins), we need to determine the range of possible skill levels that can win through all phases.\n3. **Reverse Simulation**: We simulate the tournament from the final phase backward to the initial phase.
