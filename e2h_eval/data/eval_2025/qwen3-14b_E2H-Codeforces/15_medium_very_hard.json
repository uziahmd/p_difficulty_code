They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. Each team has a unique skill level from 1 to 2^n. The tournament proceeds in phases, and each phase's matches are determined by the string s. For each phase i (starting from 1?), the matches are decided based on whether s[i-1] is 0 or 1. In each match of phase i, the lower or higher skill level team wins, depending on the character.\n\nOur task is to find all integers x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. So the key is to model the tournament structure and determine for each possible x whether it can be the winner given the rules of the phases.\n\nFirst, let's think about how the tournament works. Each round halves the number of teams. For example, with n=3 (8 teams), there are 3 phases. Phase 1: 4 games, phase 2: 2 games, phase 3: 1 game.\n\nEach phase's matches are structured such that the winners of previous matches face each other. For example, in phase 1, the first two teams play, then the next two, etc. Then in phase 2, the winners of those pairs are grouped into new pairs, and so on.\n\nThe challenge is to find which x can be the final winner, given the rules of the phases.\n\nBut since the permutation p is arbitrary (as long as it's a permutation of 1..2^n), we need to find for each x, can we arrange the permutation such that x wins all its matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\nWait, but the permutation defines the initial arrangement of teams. So the initial positions of the teams in the bracket matter. For example, the way the teams are paired in each round depends on their initial positions.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because the initial arrangement of the teams determines the path they take through the tournament. So for a given x, we need to find an arrangement where x is placed in a position such that, through each phase, it can win the matches according to the rules of that phase.\n\nBut how to model the possible paths?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's think about the tournament as a binary tree. Each match in a phase corresponds to a node in the tree, and the winner proceeds to the next round.\n\nBut perhaps we can model the possible ranges of skill levels that can reach the final round, considering each phase's rules.\n\nAlternatively, for each phase, we can determine what conditions must hold for a team to proceed to the next phase.\n\nLet me consider the phases in order. Let's say the tournament has n phases. The first phase is the first round, then the second phase is the quarterfinals (if n is 3), etc. Wait, the phases are numbered from 1 to n. For example, in the first phase (i=1), there are 2^{n-1} games. Then phase i=2 has 2^{n-2} games, etc. So phase i has 2^{n-i} games.\n\nBut during phase i, each match is between two teams that have advanced from the previous rounds. For example, phase 1 is the first round, phase 2 is the second round, etc.\n\nNow, for each phase, the rule is that in each match, the lower or higher skill team wins, depending on the character in s[i-1].\n\nSo, for a team to reach the final, it must have won all matches in each phase. But the problem is that the initial arrangement of the teams affects which teams they face in each round.\n\nBut since we can choose any permutation p, we can arrange the initial positions of the teams in such a way that x can win all required matches.\n\nSo the question is: For a given x, can we arrange the initial bracket such that, during each phase, when x plays in that phase, it wins according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think about the tournament as a series of rounds. For example, in the first round (phase 1), the teams are grouped into pairs. The winner of each pair proceeds to the next round (phase 2). In phase 2, the winners are grouped again into pairs, and so on.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must win in each of the n rounds. Each round's match depends on the rule for that phase.\n\nBut how do the rules affect which teams x can face in each round?\n\nFor example, in phase 1, if the rule is 0 (lower skill wins), then x can only win if it's in a pair where the other team has higher skill. But if the rule is 1, then x must have higher skill than the opponent.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, we can arrange the initial bracket such that in each round, x faces opponents that allow it to win according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut how do we model the constraints for each round?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we want x to be the champion. Let's think about the tournament as a binary tree. Each time, the team must win in each round. For each round, the team must be able to win against the opponent, based on the phase's rule.\n\nBut the opponents in each round depend on the path taken. However, since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can find for each round, the minimal and maximal possible skill levels that x must have in order to proceed through that round.\n\nWait, maybe we can model for each round i (starting from 1 to n) the range of possible values that x must be in, considering the rules up to that round.\n\nLet me think of it as follows:\n\nIn the first phase (phase 1), x must be in a group of two teams. Depending on the rule (s[0]), x must either be the lower or higher skill in that group. For example, if s[0] is '0', then in phase 1, x must be the lower one. So, the other team in the group must have a higher skill than x. But since we can choose the permutation, we can arrange that x is paired with someone higher. But in that case, x will proceed to the next round.\n\nThen, in phase 2, x is in a group of two teams (the winners of two groups from phase 1). Again, depending on the rule for phase 2, x must be the lower or higher in that group. But for that, the other team in phase 2 must be such that x can beat them according to the rule.\n\nBut how do we model the constraints on x's value?\n\nPerhaps for each round, we can track the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to proceed through that round. For example, in the first round, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the lower of the two. Therefore, in that group, there must be at least one team with higher skill. Since we can arrange the initial bracket, x can be placed in a group where there is a higher team. However, the other teams in the bracket must be arranged so that x can proceed.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows:\n\nAt each round i, the team x must be able to win against the opponent in that round, based on the rule of that phase. The opponent's skill depends on the previous rounds' rules.\n\nBut how can we model the possible opponents?\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a series of brackets. For x to be the champion, in each round i (from 1 to n), x must be able to win against the opponent in that round. The opponent in round i is determined by the previous rounds' matches. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose for each round the minimal constraints on x's value.\n\nLet me think of the process for each round. Let's say we are in round k (phase k). The rule for this phase is s[k-1]. For x to proceed through this round, it must be that in this round's match, x's skill is either higher or lower than the opponent's, depending on the rule.\n\nBut the opponent in this round depends on the previous rounds. However, since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose the opponents that x will face in each round. But how?\n\nFor example, in round 1, x is in a group of two teams. We can arrange that the other team in the group has a skill that allows x to win. For example, if the rule is 0, then x must have a lower skill than the other team. So, in this case, x can be any value except the maximum possible (since there must be a higher team in the group). However, since the permutation includes all numbers, we can always find such a team.\n\nBut for the next rounds, the opponent in round 2 depends on the other group that x's group was paired with in round 2. So, for x to proceed through round 2, the opponent in that round must be such that x's skill meets the rule for that phase.\n\nBut how can we model the possible opponents that x could face in each round, given that we can arrange the initial bracket?\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe we can model for each round, the possible range of x's skill that allows it to proceed through that round, given the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the possible range of x's skill that can reach each round. For example, for round 1, the possible x's can be anything. But for round 2, x must have passed round 1, and then also pass round 2.\n\nBut how does the rule of each round affect this?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each round i, the number of teams that x must beat is i. Wait, no. For each round, x must win once. So for n rounds, x must win n times.\n\nBut the key is that in each round, the opponent's skill level is determined by the way the bracket is set up, and the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nAn alternative idea comes to mind: For x to be the winner, in each round i, the rule s[i-1] determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in the group of 2^{i} teams that x is part of in that round.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Each round is a phase where the teams are grouped into pairs. For example, in the first round, each pair of teams is matched. The winner proceeds to the next round. Then, in the second round, the winners are grouped into pairs again, and so on.\n\nSo, in round i, the number of teams is 2^{n - (i-1)} }, and the number of matches is 2^{n - i} }.\n\nBut for x to reach round i, it must have won i-1 matches. Now, in round i, x must win against another team that has also reached round i. The way x's opponent is determined depends on the bracket structure.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can arrange that in each round, x's opponent is the weakest possible or strongest possible, depending on the rule of that round.\n\nFor example, in phase i, if the rule is 0 (lower skill wins), then x must be the lower-skilled team in its match. So, x must have a lower skill than the opponent. However, since we can arrange the bracket, we can choose that x's opponent in this round is the strongest possible team that hasn't been eliminated yet, but that would require that x's skill is lower than that. Alternatively, maybe the opposite.\n\nBut how can we model the minimal and maximal constraints on x's skill?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have to survive that round, given the rules up to that point.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nFor each round i (from 1 to n), we can define a lower bound L_i and an upper bound U_i. These bounds represent the range of x's skill that allows it to survive up to round i.\n\nInitially, for round 1, the bounds are L_1 = 1 and U_1 = 2^n. But this might not be correct. Wait, no. For round 1, x must be able to win against its opponent. Depending on the rule for phase 1, the opponent must be either higher or lower than x.\n\nSo for phase 1, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the lower-skilled team. Therefore, there must be at least one team in the bracket that has a higher skill than x. Since the permutation includes all numbers, this is possible unless x is the maximum. So, for x to survive round 1, when the rule is 0, x must be less than some value. But since we can arrange the bracket, x can be placed in a pair with a higher team. Therefore, the only constraint is that x is not the maximum. But wait, no. Because the maximum can't be in a pair where it loses. But if the rule is 0, then the maximum can't lose. Because in any pair, the maximum will be higher than the other team, so the lower team (the other) would win. Wait, no. If the rule is 0, the lower skill team wins. So if x is the maximum, then in its pair, it would have to lose to the other team (since the other team has lower skill). Wait, no. Wait, if x is the maximum, then in its pair, the other team has a lower skill. So according to rule 0 (lower skill wins), the other team would win. Thus, x would be eliminated. Therefore, for x to survive phase 1 when the rule is 0, x cannot be the maximum. Similarly, if the rule is 1, then x must be the higher-skilled team in the pair. Therefore, x cannot be the minimum (since the other team would be lower, and x would win).\n\nSo for phase 1, if the rule is 0, then x must be less than some value. But since the other team can be chosen to be higher, x can be any value except the maximum. Wait, but how do we ensure that in the bracket, there's a team higher than x. Well, since the permutation includes all numbers, as long as x is not the maximum, there exists a higher team. So for phase 1, the rule being 0 implies that x can be any value except the maximum. Similarly, for rule 1, x can be any value except the minimum.\n\nBut how does this generalize to subsequent rounds?\n\nLet me think of the process for each round. For each round i, the rule s[i-1] tells us whether the team must be the lower or higher in the match. Let's consider that for each round, the team x must be either the minimum or maximum in the group of 2^{i} teams that it's part of in that round. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but maybe something similar.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that in round i, the rule is 0 (lower wins). Then, in that round, x must be the lower-skilled team among the two that face each other. But to get to that round, x must have survived the previous rounds. How does that affect the possible opponents?\n\nLet me think about the first two rounds. Suppose n is 3, and s is \"101\". Let's take x=4.\n\nIn phase 1 (rule 1, higher wins), x must be higher than its opponent. So in the first round, x's opponent must be a team with lower skill. Since x is 4, the opponent could be any of 1, 2, 3. Then, x proceeds to the next round.\n\nIn phase 2 (rule 0, lower wins). Now, x is in a group of two teams (winners of two first-round matches). To win this round, x must be the lower-skilled team. Therefore, the other team in this match must have a higher skill than x. So, the other team must be higher than 4. But how can we arrange this? Well, during the first round, the other team (which will face x in phase 2) must have been the winner of its first-round match. For that, during phase 1, the other team must have been higher than its opponent. So, for example, if the other team is 5, then during phase 1, it could have beaten someone lower than 5.\n\nSo, in phase 2, x (4) needs to face someone higher than 4. But how do we arrange that in the bracket? Well, during the initial bracket setup, we can arrange that x's path in the tournament leads to facing a team that is higher than x in phase 2.\n\nBut how can we model this for general cases?\n\nAn alternative idea comes from the concept of the \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" constraints that x must satisfy at each round. For example, during each round, depending on the rule, x must be either the minimum or maximum in a certain group of teams.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the constraints for x as follows. For each round i (starting from 1 to n), we can determine the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to survive that round, given the rules up to that round.\n\nLet me define for each round i, two values: low_i and high_i. These represent the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have to survive up to round i.\n\nFor example, in round 1:\n\nIf the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the lower-skilled in its first-round match. Therefore, in order for x to proceed, there must be a team with higher skill in its group. Since we can arrange the bracket, x can be any value except the maximum. Therefore, the maximum possible value x can have is (2^n - 1). Wait, but if x is the maximum, then in its first-round match, it can't win. So, for rule 0 in round 1, x must be <= (max value - 1). So the upper bound for x is (2^n - 1). Similarly, the lower bound is 1 (since there is no lower bound except that there must be a team with lower skill. But since x can be 1, but then it would have to lose if the rule is 0. Wait no. Wait, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then the lower-skilled team wins. So if x is 1, then in its match, it would be the lower-skilled team. So it would win. So for rule 0 in round 1, x can be any value except the maximum. So the upper bound is 2^n - 1, and lower bound is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the rule is 1 in round 1, then x must be higher than its opponent. So x can't be the minimum (value 1). So the lower bound is 2, upper bound is 2^n.\n\nSo for round 1, depending on the rule, the constraints are:\n\nif rule is 0: low_1 = 1, high_1 = 2^n - 1\n\nif rule is 1: low_1 = 2, high_1 = 2^n.\n\nThen, for round 2, the rule is s[1]. Now, during round 2, x must be in a match against another team that has also survived round 1. The outcome depends on the rule of round 2.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for round 2?\n\nLet's think recursively. Suppose after round 1, x is allowed to be in the range [low_1, high_1]. Now, in round 2, the rule is s[1]. Let's consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: s[1] is 0 (lower wins). So in round 2, x must be the lower-skilled team. Therefore, the other team in the match must have higher skill than x. However, this other team must have survived round 1. What are the possible values of that other team?\n\nTo ensure that x can find such a team, the other team must have a skill higher than x, and also must have survived round 1. But since we can arrange the bracket, we can arrange that x is paired with a team that has higher skill and has survived round 1.\n\nBut what constraints does that place on x's value?\n\nWell, during round 1, the other team must have survived. So, for that team, during round 1, the rule was s[0], and it must have been able to survive. So, depending on the rule of round 1, the other team's skill must be in a certain range.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose that other team to be the minimal possible or maximal possible that satisfies the constraints. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: For x to survive round 2, given that it has survived round 1, and the rule for round 2 is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the lower-skilled team in round 2. Therefore, there must exist a team that is higher than x, and that team must have survived round 1. The existence of such a team depends on the range of possible values that x can have.\n\nFor example, suppose that during round 1, the rule was 1 (higher wins). Then, the other team in round 2 must have been higher than its own opponent in round 1. Therefore, the other team's skill is in the range [2, 2^n], but since it survived round 1, which requires that it was higher than its opponent. However, for x to have a higher team in round 2, x must be such that there exists a team in the range [x+1, 2^n] that has survived round 1.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose the other team to be any team that satisfies the survival condition. Therefore, for x to survive round 2, the maximum value that x can take is such that there exists at least one team higher than x that can survive round 1.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nMaybe we can think of the constraints for each round as follows:\n\nAt round i, the rule is r_i (0 or 1). For x to survive this round, it must be the min or max in the group of 2^{i} teams that it is part of in this round. However, the other teams in this group must have survived the previous rounds.\n\nBut since we can arrange the bracket, perhaps the constraints for x's value can be determined by considering that in each round, the required condition is that x is either the min or max of a certain number of teams.\n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by some similar problems:\n\nWe can model the constraints on x for each round as follows. For each round i, the number of teams that x must be compared against in that round is 2^{i} - 1. Wait, no. For example, in round 1, each team is in a group of 2 teams. In round 2, each team is in a group of 2 teams again. But the total number of teams in the bracket is halved each round.\n\nAlternatively, for each round i, x must be able to win against the other team in that round. To ensure that, depending on the rule, x must be either the minimum or maximum of a certain subset of teams.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for each round i, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have, considering the rules up to that round.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nFor each round i, we have a lower bound L_i and an upper bound U_i. These represent the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have to survive up to round i.\n\nInitially, for round 0 (before any rounds), L_0 = 1, U_0 = 2^n.\n\nFor each round i from 1 to n:\n\n- The rule is r = s[i-1].\n\n- If r is 0 (lower wins), then in this round, x must be the lower-skilled team. Therefore, there must be another team in this round's match that has a higher skill than x. But this other team must have survived all previous rounds (i.e., up to round i-1).\n\n- To ensure that such a team exists, x's value must be such that there are enough teams with higher values that can survive up to this round.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAssume that during the previous rounds, the constraints have allowed x to be in a certain range. Now, for this round, we need to adjust the constraints based on the rule.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of the possible range of x's value after round i.\n\nFor example, suppose that in round i, the rule is 0 (lower wins). Then, x must be the lower-skilled team. Therefore, x must be less than the other team in the match. But that other team must have survived up to round i. So, the other team's value must be in the range [L_prev, U_prev], where L_prev and U_prev are the constraints from the previous rounds. However, since we can arrange the bracket, we can choose the other team to be the minimal possible or maximal possible that allows x to win.\n\nBut this feels too vague. Perhaps we need to find for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible values of x that can survive up to that round.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nAt each round i, the number of teams that x must have beaten is i. But the way the rules are applied in each round determines the constraints.\n\nAnother idea: For each round, the required condition for x to proceed is that it is either the minimum or maximum of a group of size 2^{i} teams. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nIn the first round (i=1), x is in a group of 2 teams. To proceed, x must be the min or max of that group, depending on the rule. Then, in the second round (i=2), x is in a group of 2 teams again, but these teams are winners from the first round. So, the group for round 2 consists of two teams that each have survived the first round. For x to proceed in round 2, it must be the min or max of this group of two.\n\nBut since the group is formed by the winners of two groups from the first round, the possible values of the other team in round 2's match depends on the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nBut again, since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can model the constraints on x's value for each round based on the rules.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern for the constraints. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose n=1, s is '1'. Then there's only one round (phase 1). The rule is 1 (higher wins). So x must be higher than its opponent. Since there are two teams, the only way to win is to be the higher of the two. So x must be 2. Hence, output is '2'.\n\nAnother example: n=2, s is '01'. So two rounds. Round 1: rule 0 (lower wins). Round 2: rule 1 (higher wins).\n\nWhat is the possible x?\n\nFor x to survive round 1, it must be the lower of two teams. So x can be any value except the maximum (which is 4). So x can be 1, 2, 3.\n\nIn round 2, the rule is 1 (higher wins). So x must be higher than its opponent. The opponent in round 2 is another team that has survived round 1. That means that opponent was the lower of two teams in round 1. So for example, if x is 3, then in round 2, it must be higher than its opponent. The opponent could be any team that survived round 1, which are teams that were lower in their round 1 matches.\n\nBut how to ensure that there exists such an opponent?\n\nSince the opponent in round 2 is a team that survived round 1 (rule 0). So for that opponent, it must have been the lower of its two teams in round 1. So its value must be less than the value of its round 1 opponent.\n\nBut for x to be higher than this opponent, x must be higher than that value. So during round 2, x must be higher than some value that is less than the value of the opponent in round 1.\n\nBut how to model this for the constraints?\n\nLet me think of the worst case. For x to be able to find such an opponent, there must be at least one team that has survived round 1 and is less than x.\n\nBut since we can arrange the bracket, we can choose the opponent to be the minimal possible.\n\nSo for x to be able to survive round 2, there must be at least one team that is less than x and has survived round 1. How many teams are there that have survived round 1?\n\nIn round 1, there are 2^(n-1) = 2 teams (since n=2). So after round 1, there are 2 teams left. So for x to be able to find an opponent in round 2 that is less than x, there must be at least one team in the survivors of round 1 that is less than x.\n\nBut what are the survivors of round 1?\n\nSurvivors are those who were the lower-skilled in their round 1 matches. So their values are such that they are less than their opponents in round 1.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose which teams are in which matches. For example, if x is 3, then during round 1, it must be the lower-skilled in its match. So its opponent must be higher than 3. Let's say the opponent is 4. Then, x survives round 1. Now, in round 2, the other survivor must be someone who was the lower-skilled in their round 1 match. Let's say that person is 1 or 2. Then, in round 2, x (3) is higher than them, and thus wins.\n\nThus, for x=3, it's possible.\n\nSimilarly, for x=2: during round 1, it must be the lower-skilled in its match. So its opponent is higher than 2. Let's say 3 or 4. Survives round 1. In round 2, the other survivor could be 1. Then, x=2 is higher than 1, and wins.\n\nSo for x=2, it's possible.\n\nWhat about x=1? During round 1, it must be the lower-skilled in its match. Its opponent is higher. Survives. In round 2, the other survivor could be someone else who was the lower-skilled in their match. But for x=1 to win round 2, the other survivor must be less than x. But x is 1, which is the minimum. There's no such team. So x=1 cannot survive round 2. Hence, it's not a valid x.\n\nSo in this case, the valid x are 2, 3.\n\nBut according to the sample input given in the problem description, when input is '2\\n01', the output is '2 3'. Which matches this.\n\nSo how to model this for general cases?\n\nLet me think again. For each round i, the rule determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in its current group. And for each round, the constraints on x's value depend on the previous rounds' rules.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern for the constraints. Let's think for each round i, what is the minimal and maximal value x can have.\n\nFor the first round (i=1):\n\nIf rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the minimum in its group of two. So x can be any value except the maximum (since the maximum can't be the minimum in its group). So the upper bound is 2^n - 1, lower is 1.\n\nIf rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the maximum in its group. So x can't be the minimum. So lower bound is 2, upper is 2^n.\n\nNow, for the second round (i=2), the rule is r_2 (s[1]).\n\nLet me think of the case where for round 2, the rule is 1 (higher wins). So in this round, x must be the maximum in its group of two teams. Those two teams are survivors from round 1.\n\nNow, what is the range of possible values for x?\n\nTo have x be the maximum in its group, there must be another team in the group that is less than x. But that other team must have survived round 1.\n\nThe other team must have survived round 1, which depends on the rule of round 1.\n\nIf round 1's rule was 0 (lower wins), then the other team must have been the minimum in its group. So its value is less than the value of its opponent in round 1.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose that other team to be any value that is less than x.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for x?\n\nIn this scenario, for x to survive round 2, there must be at least one team in the survivors of round 1 that is less than x. The survivors of round 1 are those that were the minimum in their groups (if round 1's rule was 0).\n\nThe number of survivors from round 1 is 2^{n-1} = 2^{2-1} = 2 (for n=2). So there are two teams. For x to be able to find one of them that is less than x, x must be at least the second smallest value in the survivors.\n\nBut what is the range of possible values for the survivors?\n\nWell, if round 1's rule is 0, then the survivors are the minimum of each pair. So their values are all less than their respective opponents. But since the opponents could be any higher values, the survivors can be any values except the maximum.\n\nBut how to find the minimal and maximal possible values that x can take to ensure that there is at least one survivor less than x?\n\nIn this case, since the survivors include all values except the maximum (assuming that the maximum was paired with someone else and lost), but that's not necessarily true. For example, if the maximum is paired with someone else, it would lose in round 1 (because rule is 0), so it's not a survivor. So the survivors are the minimum of each pair. So the survivors can be any value except the maximum.\n\nBut for x to be able to find a survivor less than x, x must be greater than at least one survivor. Since the survivors include all values except the maximum, which is 4 in our example. So for x to be able to find such a survivor, x must be at least 2 (since 1 is a survivor). Because if x is 2, then 1 is a survivor and less than x. If x is 3, then 1 and 2 are survivors and less than x. If x is 4, it can't be a survivor of round 1, so it's not even in the survivors. Hence, for x to be able to survive round 2, it must be in the survivors of round 1 (so x is in [1, 3]) and also have at least one survivor less than x.\n\nBut since the survivors include all values except the maximum, x can be 2 or 3. For x=1, there is no survivor less than it (since 1 is the minimum). So x=1 cannot proceed to round 2.\n\nHence, for round 2 with rule 1, the constraints are that x is in [2, 3].\n\nSo combining with the previous round's constraints (round 1 with rule 0: x is in [1, 3]), the new constraints after round 2 are [2, 3].\n\nSo the overall process is:\n\nFor each round, based on the rule, we adjust the previous constraints to compute new constraints.\n\nSo, for general cases, the idea is to maintain a range of possible x values that can survive up to round i. For each round, based on the rule, we adjust this range.\n\nHow to compute this adjustment?\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nLet’s denote that after processing rounds 1 to i-1, the possible x values are in the interval [L, R].\n\nNow, for round i, the rule is r (0 or 1).\n\nIf r is 0 (lower wins), then in this round, x must be the lower-skilled team. Therefore, there must be another team in the match that is higher than x. This other team must have survived up to round i-1. So, the other team must be in the range [L, R] (from previous rounds). But since we can choose the other team, we need to ensure that there exists at least one value in [L, R] that is higher than x.\n\nTo ensure this, x must be less than the maximum value in [L, R]. So the new upper bound after this round is R_prev (the previous upper bound). The new lower bound is L_prev, but we also need to ensure that there exists a higher team. However, since the previous range [L_prev, R_prev] contains values up to R_prev, x can be as low as L_prev, as long as there exists at least one value in [L_prev, R_prev] that is higher than x.\n\nThe minimal x that allows this is L_prev, provided that R_prev > L_prev. If R_prev == L_prev, then there is no higher value, so x cannot proceed.\n\nSo, for rule 0, the new range becomes [L_prev, R_prev - 1], because x must be less than R_prev (so that there exists a value higher than x in the previous range).\n\nWait, no. Because if the previous range is [L_prev, R_prev], and we want x to be less than some value",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure and rules are such that each phase determines the winner based on whether the team with the lower or higher skill level wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of `2^n` teams and `n` phases. Each phase halves the number of teams until one champion remains.\n2. **Skill Level Rules**: Each phase has a rule (0 or 1) indicating whether the lower or higher skill team wins.\n3. **Range Constraints**: For each phase, we maintain a range of possible skill levels that a team can have to proceed through that phase. This range is adjusted based on the rules of the current and previous phases.\n4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Starting from the first phase, we adjust the range of possible skill levels iteratively for each subsequent phase based on the current rule (lower or higher skill wins).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    \n    # Initialize the range of possible x values\n    low = 1\n    high = total_teams\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        rule = s[i]\n        if rule == '0':\n            # In this round, x must be the lower one, so it must be less than some value in [low, high]\n            # So, high becomes high - 1, because x must be less than the max possible value in the previous range\n            high = high - 1\n        else:\n            # In this round, x must be the higher one, so it must be greater than some value in [low, high]\n            # So, low becomes low + 1\n            low = low + 1\n    \n    result = []\n    for x in range(low, high + 1):\n        result.append(str(x))\n    \n    print(' '.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the full range of possible skill levels (from 1 to `2^n`).\n2. **Iterating Through Phases**: For each phase, we adjust the range based on the rule:\n   - If the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), the upper bound of the range is reduced by 1 to ensure there exists a higher skill team in the current range.\n   - If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), the lower bound of the range is increased by 1 to ensure there exists a lower skill team in the current range.\n3. **Result Construction**: After processing all phases, the remaining range `[low, high]` contains all possible skill levels that can win the tournament under the given rules.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible skill levels using range adjustments, ensuring that we consider the constraints imposed by each phase's rule. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of phases, making it efficient even for large values of `n` up to 18.",
