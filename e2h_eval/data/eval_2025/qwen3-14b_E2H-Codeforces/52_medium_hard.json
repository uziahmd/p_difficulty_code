Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones into new ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the input is two integers, a and b. Initially, he has a candles. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take b of them to make a new one. And this new one can be used again. The question is to find the total number of hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down. \n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned candles are used to make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are burned out. So he can make 2 / 2 = 1 new candle. Use that for 1 hour. Now, he has 1 burned candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Oh right, and then after that, there's 1 left, but not enough. So the total is 7.\n\nAnother example: 6 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Use those, 2 hours. Now, 2 burned. Not enough for 3. Wait, but wait. Wait, after using 2, we have 2 burned. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. So total is 6 + 2 = 8. Which matches the sample. But wait, what if there's some way to collect more? Like maybe after some steps?\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\nStart with a candles. Each time you burn a candle, you get one burned candle. Then, whenever you have enough burned candles (>=b), you can make new ones. Each time you make a new candle, you subtract b burned ones and add 1 new candle. And that new candle will be burned again, adding to the total hours and producing another burned candle.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburned_candles = 0\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Maybe the process is:\n\nEach time you use a candle, it's burned, so you have one burned candle. So the process is:\n\nInitially, you have 'a' candles. You can burn them all, adding 'a' hours. Then, you have 'a' burned candles. Then, you can make new candles from them.\n\nBut each time you make a new candle, you take 'b' burned ones, and get 1 new candle. Then, that new candle is burned, adding 1 hour, and becomes another burned candle.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nburned = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nBut maybe it's better to model it as:\n\nInitially, you have a candles. Each time you burn them, you add to the total hours. Then, collect the burned ones and make new ones.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\ntotal = 0\n\nburned = 0\n\nwhile current_candles > 0:\n\n    burn all current_candles. So total += current_candles\n\n    burned += current_candles\n\n    current_candles = 0\n\n    then, make new candles from burned ones.\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    current_candles = new_candles\n\n    burned = burned % b\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Because after burning the current_candles, you have burned += current_candles, and then you can make new_candles from that. Then, the new_candles become the current_candles for the next iteration. But in that case, the process would repeat until you can't make any more new candles.\n\nBut let's test this with the first example.\n\nExample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial current_candles =4, burned=0.\n\nFirst loop:\n\ntotal +=4 (total=4). burned becomes 4. current_candles is set to 0.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 = 2. current_candles =2. burned is 4%2=0.\n\nNext loop:\n\nburn 2, total becomes 4+2=6. burned becomes 0 +2 =2. current_candles is 0 again.\n\nnew_candles = 2//2=1. current_candles=1. burned is 0.\n\nNext loop:\n\nburn 1, total becomes 6+1=7. burned becomes 1. current_candles is 0.\n\nnew_candles =1//2=0. So loop ends.\n\nTotal is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\nFirst loop: current_candles=6. total +=6 (total=6). burned=6. new_candles=6//3=2. current_candles=2. burned=0.\n\nSecond loop: burn 2, total=6+2=8. burned=2. new_candles=2//3=0. So loop ends. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. burned=5. new_candles=1. Then burn 1, total 6. burned=1. Now, new_candles=0. So total is 6.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nFirst step: total +=5 (5). burned=5. new_candles=5//2=2, remainder 1. current_candles=2. burned=1.\n\nSecond step: burn 2, total=5+2=7. burned=1+2=3. new_candles=3//2=1, remainder 1. current_candles=1. burned=1.\n\nThird step: burn 1, total=7+1=8. burned=1+1=2. new_candles=2//2=1, remainder 0. current_candles=1. burned=0.\n\nFourth step: burn 1, total=8+1=9. burned=1. new_candles=0. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually. Initial 5 candles: 5 hours. Burned 5. Make 2 new (5//2=2, 2*2=4, but 5-2*2=1 left). Then burn 2, total 7. Now, 2 burned added to previous 1? Wait, no. After burning the 2 new candles, you have 2 burned. Then, you have 1 (from before) + 2 (from burning the new ones) = 3. Then, you make 3//2=1 new, with remainder 1. So burn that 1, total 8. Then, you have 1 burned (from that) plus 1 (previous remainder) = 2. Make 1 new. Burn it, total 9. Then you have 1 burned. No more. So yes, total is 9. So the algorithm works.\n\nSo the approach is to:\n\n- Keep track of the current number of candles (current_candles) and the number of burned candles (burned).\n\nBut perhaps, the code can be written as:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\ncurrent = a\n\nburned = 0\n\nwhile current > 0:\n\n    total += current\n\n    burned += current\n\n    current = burned // b\n\n    burned = burned % b\n\nWait, no. Because when you burn the current candles, you add them to the burned count. Then, you can make new candles from the burned ones. But the new candles are added to current, and the burned is updated to the remainder.\n\nWait, let me think. For example, in the first step, you have current = a. You burn all of them, adding to total. Then, the burned is increased by current. Then, you can make new candles from the burned ones. So the new current is burned // b. And the new burned is burned % b. Because after making as many new candles as possible, the remaining burned candles are the remainder.\n\nBut then, in the next iteration, you burn the current candles again. So this seems correct.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first example.\n\nExample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\ncurrent =4, burned=0.\n\nLoop:\n\ntotal +=4 → total=4.\n\nburned +=4 → burned=4.\n\ncurrent =4//2=2. burned is 4%2=0.\n\nNow, current is 2. Loop again.\n\ntotal +=2 → 6. burned +=2 → 0+2=2.\n\ncurrent = 2//2=1. burned=2%2=0.\n\nLoop again: current is 1.\n\ntotal +=1 →7. burned +=1 → 0+1=1.\n\ncurrent =1//2=0. burned=1%2=1.\n\nNow current is 0. Loop ends.\n\nYes, total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncurrent=5, burned=0.\n\ntotal +=5 →5. burned=5. current=5//2=2, burned=5%2=1.\n\nLoop: current=2.\n\ntotal +=2 →7. burned=1+2=3. current=3//2=1, burned=3%2=1.\n\nLoop: current=1.\n\ntotal +=1 →8. burned=1+1=2. current=2//2=1, burned=0.\n\nLoop: current=1.\n\ntotal +=1 →9. burned=0+1=1. current=1//2=0. burned=1.\n\nLoop ends. Total is 9. Which is correct.\n\nSo this logic seems to work.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total =0, current =a, burned=0.\n\nWhile current>0:\n\n   total += current\n\n   burned += current\n\n   current = burned // b\n\n   burned = burned % b\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, but in the code, the 'current' is being set to the number of new candles made from the burned ones. And the burned is the remainder. So this seems to capture the process correctly.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when a=0? Well, according to the input constraints, a is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother example: a=1, b=2. Then:\n\ncurrent=1, burned=0.\n\ntotal +=1 →1. burned=1. current = 1//2=0. burned=1%2=1. Loop ends. So total is 1.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=3. Then initial current is 2. Burned is 0.\n\ntotal +=2 →2. burned becomes 2. current =2//3=0. So loop ends. Total is 2.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. Then:\n\ntotal +=3 →3. burned=3. current=3//3=1. burned=0. Then loop again: current is 1. total +=1 →4. burned=1. current=0. So total is 4.\n\nYes. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input. Then compute as per the above steps.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the input line as two integers. For example, in the sample input, it's ['4 2', '6 3'], but the code needs to read from stdin. Wait, the problem says that the input is a single line with two integers. So the code should read a line, split into two integers.\n\nSo code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen initialize total =0, current =a, burned=0.\n\nThen loop while current>0:\n\ntotal += current\n\nburned += current\n\ncurrent = burned // b\n\nburned = burned % b\n\nThen print(total)\n\nWait, but let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input 4 2:\n\ntotal starts at 0.\n\ncurrent=4, burned=0.\n\nLoop:\n\ntotal +=4 →4. burned=4. current=4//2=2, burned=0.\n\nLoop again: current=2.\n\ntotal +=2 →6. burned=0+2=2. current=2//2=1. burned=0.\n\nLoop again: current=1.\n\ntotal +=1 →7. burned=0+1=1. current=1//2=0. burned=1.\n\nLoop ends. Print 7. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input 6 3:\n\ncurrent=6, burned=0.\n\ntotal +=6 →6. burned=6. current=6//3=2. burned=0.\n\nLoop again: current=2. total +=2 →8. burned=0+2=2. current=2//3=0. burned=2. loop ends. print 8. Correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me code that.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead a and b, then compute as per the steps.\n\nSo the code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\ncurrent = a\n\nburned = 0\n\nwhile current > 0:\n\n    total += current\n\n    burned += current\n\n    current = burned // b\n\n    burned = burned % b\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when the initial a is zero? But according to the constraints, a is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where a=1, b=2. Output is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5. Then:\n\ntotal starts as 5. burned is 5. current =5//5=1. burned is 0.\n\nLoop again: current is 1. total becomes 5+1=6. burned is 0 +1=1. current =1//5=0. loop ends. So total 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial current=5. total +=5 →5. burned=5. current=5//3=1 (since 5//3 is 1, remainder 2). So burned is 5%3=2.\n\nLoop again: current=1. total +=1 →6. burned=2+1=3. current=3//3=1. burned=0.\n\nLoop again: current=1. total +=1 →7. burned=0+1=1. current=1//3=0. loop ends. Total is 7.\n\nYes. Let's check manually:\n\nStart with 5 candles. Burn them all (5h). 5 burned. Make 1 new (5//3=1), 2 left. Burn 1 (total 6h). Now, burned is 1+2=3. Make 1 new. Burn it (total 7h). Now, 1 burned. No more. So total 7. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, this should be the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using candles, considering he can recycle burned-out candles into new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and recycling the burned ones optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, and the recycling ratio, `b`.\n2. **Burning Candles**: Each candle burns for one hour. After burning, the candle becomes a \"burned\" candle.\n3. **Recycling Burned Candles**: Whenever there are enough burned candles (at least `b`), they can be recycled into new candles. This process continues until there are not enough burned candles left to form a new one.\n4. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Repeat the process of burning all available candles and recycling the burned ones until no more new candles can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\ncurrent = a\nburned = 0\nwhile current > 0:\n    total += current\n    burned += current\n    current = burned // b\n    burned = burned % b\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with `a` candles and initialize `total` to keep track of the total hours the room is illuminated. `current` holds the number of candles available to burn in each iteration, and `burned` keeps track of the number of burned candles that can be recycled.\n2. **Burning Process**: In each iteration, all available candles (`current`) are burned, contributing to the total hours. These burned candles are then added to the `burned` count.\n3. **Recycling Process**: From the `burned` count, we determine how many new candles can be made by integer division by `b`. The remainder after this division is stored back in `burned` for the next iteration.\n4. **Termination**: The loop continues until there are no more candles left to burn (`current` becomes zero).\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of resources and correctly calculating the total illumination time.",
