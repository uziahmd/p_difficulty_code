He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. And the final string is what we're checking.\n\nSo, the steps for validation are:\n\nFirst, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Because A and B ensure that there's at least one 'a' and 'b' before C adds the 'c's. And C adds at least one 'c' (since the count of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's, which are at least 1 each). Wait, but if C adds 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. Suppose the original string after B's step has 1 'a' and 1 'b'. Then C can add 1 'c' (equal to a's count) or 1 'c' (equal to b's count). So the final string must have at least one 'c'.\n\nSo first check: the string must contain at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these are missing, return NO.\n\nThen, the order of characters must be correct. The string must start with some 'a's, followed by some 'b's, then some 'c's. Because A adds 'a's, then B adds 'b's, then C adds 'c's. So the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So if there's any 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', or any 'b' after a 'c', then it's invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem says that B appends 'b's to the end of the string. So after A's string (all a's), B adds some b's. Then C adds c's. So the final string should be a sequence of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the order must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So if the string has a mix like 'abba', that's invalid. So the first step is to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo, how to check that? For example, the string should not have any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b's after a 'c'.\n\nSo, the steps for checking the order:\n\nCheck that all 'a's come before any 'b's, and all 'b's come before any 'c's. So the string must be in the order a's, then b's, then c's. So, for example, the string 'aabbc' is okay, but 'abac' is not.\n\nSo, first, check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. How to do that?\n\nWe can check the order by looking for the first occurrence of 'b' and 'c'. For example, the first 'b' must come after all 'a's, and the first 'c' must come after all 'b's. Alternatively, we can check that the string is in the form of a's, then b's, then c's. So, for example, the string can be split into three parts: a_part, b_part, c_part. So, the entire string should be a_part + b_part + c_part, where a_part is all a's, b_part is all b's, c_part is all c's.\n\nSo, to check this, perhaps we can iterate through the string and ensure that once a 'b' is encountered, there are no more 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there are no more 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the letters. Since 'a' comes before 'b' which comes before 'c'. So, the string must be such that each character is not less than the previous one. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because the string can have a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, each character is >= the previous one. So, for example, 'aaabbbccc' is okay. But 'aabac' would have a 'a' after a 'b' (the third character is 'a' after a 'b'?), no. Wait, the string 'aabac' would have the order a, a, b, a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific process where characters are appended in a certain order and under specific constraints. The process involves appending 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's, with the number of 'c's being equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Presence of Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must be in the form of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. This ensures that the characters were appended in the correct order as described.\n3. **Check Count Constraints**: After ensuring the correct order, we check if the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check if all required characters are present\n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Check the order: all a's first, then b's, then c's\n    # Find the first occurrence of 'b' and 'c'\n    first_b = s.find('b')\n    first_c = s.find('c')\n    \n    # All characters before first_b should be 'a's\n    if first_b != -1:\n        for ch in s[:first_b]:\n            if ch != 'a':\n                return \"NO\"\n    \n    # All characters between first_b and first_c should be 'b's\n    if first_c != -1:\n        for ch in s[first_b:first_c]:\n            if ch != 'b':\n                return \"NO\"\n    \n    # All characters after first_c should be 'c's\n    if first_c != -1:\n        for ch in s[first_c:]:\n            if ch != 'c':\n                return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Now check the counts\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    print(is_valid_string(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Presence Check**: The function first checks if the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these are missing, it returns \"NO\".\n2. **Order Check**: The function then checks the order of characters. It ensures that all 'a's come before any 'b's, and all 'b's come before any 'c's. This is done by checking the segments of the string before the first 'b', between the first 'b' and the first 'c', and after the first 'c'.\n3. **Count Check**: Finally, the function checks if the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is met, it returns \"YES\"; otherwise, it returns \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints of the problem are checked efficiently and correctly.",
