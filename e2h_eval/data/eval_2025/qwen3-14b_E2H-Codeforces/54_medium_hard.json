Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me think. In a regular polygon, each central angle is 360/n degrees. But when you pick three vertices, the angle at the middle vertex depends on how many steps apart the other two vertices are from it.\n\nWait, for example, in a regular polygon, if we have a vertex v2, and then two other vertices v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between v2 and v1, and m steps between v2 and v3 (but in the other direction?), then the angle at v2 would depend on the number of sides between them. Wait, maybe there's a formula here.\n\nLet me recall. For a regular polygon with n sides, the measure of each interior angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But that's the angle for each internal angle when you connect adjacent vertices. However, when you choose three vertices that are not adjacent, the angle at the middle vertex changes.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the formula for the angle formed by three vertices in a regular polygon. Let me think about this.\n\nLet me consider a regular polygon inscribed in a unit circle. Suppose we have a vertex v2, and two other vertices v1 and v3. Let's say that between v2 and v1 there are k edges along the perimeter, and between v2 and v3 there are m edges. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon.\n\nWait, maybe the angle depends on the number of sides between v1 and v3 when going through the polygon. For example, if you pick v2, and then v1 is one step away clockwise, and v3 is one step away counter-clockwise, then the angle at v2 is the same as the internal angle of the polygon. But if they are further apart, the angle changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the angle. Let me think about the central angles. Suppose that between v1 and v2 there are k steps, and between v2 and v3 there are m steps. But since the polygon is regular, the positions of these points on the circle can be used to compute the angle.\n\nWait, but for the angle at v2, the angle formed by v1-v2-v3. Let me think in terms of the arc lengths. The angle at v2 would be related to the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended at the circumference is half the measure of the arc it subtends. Wait, but in this case, the angle at v2 would be formed by two chords, v2v1 and v2v3. So, the angle at v2 would be equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Wait, no, because the inscribed angle theorem states that an angle formed by two chords in a circle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. But in this case, the angle is at v2, so the intercepted arc would be the arc opposite to the angle. For example, if you have points A, B, C on a circle, then angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't contain B. Wait, no. Wait, if B is on the circumference, then angle ABC is half the measure of the arc AC that is opposite to B. So yes, the angle at B is half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B.\n\nSo, in our case, the angle at v2 (the vertex) would be half of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Now, in a regular polygon, the arc between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. Let's suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps (edges) along the perimeter. Then the arc length is k*(360/n) degrees. But since the polygon is convex and regular, the arc that does not contain v2 must be such that k steps are between v1 and v3. However, since the polygon has n vertices, the arc that contains v2 would be (n - k) steps. But since we're looking for the arc that does not contain v2, the value of k must be such that the arc between v1 and v3 is less than 180 degrees? Or maybe not. Wait, but the angle at v2 is determined by the arc that is opposite to it. So, if the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is m steps, then the angle is (m * 360 / n) / 2 degrees. But m can be calculated based on how far apart v1 and v3 are.\n\nBut how do we relate this to the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2?\n\nLet me think: for a given v2, suppose that between v2 and v1 there are k steps in one direction, and between v2 and v3 there are l steps in the other direction. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be k + l steps. Because moving from v1 to v2 is k steps, and from v2 to v3 is l steps in the other direction. So the total arc between v1 and v3 that passes through v2 is k + l steps. Therefore, the arc that does not pass through v2 would be n - (k + l) steps. Wait, but that's only if k + l is less than n. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be the shorter arc. But in any case, for the angle at v2, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. So the measure of that arc is (number of steps between v1 and v3 not passing through v2) multiplied by 360/n degrees.\n\nBut since the angle at v2 is half of that. So the angle is (steps * 360 / n) / 2 = steps * 180 / n degrees.\n\nWait, but steps is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2. But how do we find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given v2, the angle formed by selecting v1 and v3 such that there are exactly m steps between them (along the arc that does not contain v2), then the angle is m * 180 / n degrees. Wait, but m can be from 1 to n-2. Because if m is 1, the angle is 180/n degrees. If m is 2, 360/n degrees, etc. Wait, but that seems to contradict some examples.\n\nTake the square (n=4). For example, in the sample input where n=4 and a=67. The possible angles are 45 and 90. Let's see. For example, choosing vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But according to the formula, what would m be? The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Let's see, for v1=1, v2=2, v3=3. The arc between 1 and 3 not containing 2 is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 to 3. That's 2 steps (1 to 4 is one step, 4 to 3 another). So m=2 steps. Then the angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which matches. Another example: for the square, if we take vertices 1, 2, 4. Then the angle at 2. The arc between 1 and 4 not containing 2 is 1 step (from 1 to 4 is one step in the other direction). So m=1. Then angle is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. Which matches the sample. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the formula for the angle at v2 is (m * 180)/n degrees, where m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2.\n\nBut how to find m? Well, for any three distinct vertices, m is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't include v2. However, since the polygon is regular and convex, the arc that doesn't include v2 must be the smaller arc. Wait, no. Because if the arc between v1 and v3 is more than half the polygon, then the arc that doesn't contain v2 would be longer than half. But according to the formula, the angle depends on the number of steps in that arc. However, in that case, the angle would be larger than 180 degrees, but the problem says that the angle is formed by the sides of the angle, which is supposed to be a convex angle. Wait, but the problem says that the polygon is convex, and the angle is formed by three distinct vertices. So the angle must be less than 180 degrees. Because if the arc is larger than half the polygon, then the angle would be larger than 180 degrees, which is not allowed. So perhaps m must be such that the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is less than half the polygon. Therefore, m must be in the range 1 <= m <= (n-2)/2. Wait, but for even n, (n-2)/2 is (n-2)/2. For example, n=4: m can be up to 1 (since (4-2)/2=1). Which makes sense, because for m=2 steps, the arc would be 2 steps (which is half the polygon) and the angle would be 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is okay. But if n is 5, then (n-2)/2 is 1.5, so m can be 1 or 2 steps? Wait, but for m=2 steps, the arc is 2 steps, which is less than half of 5 steps (half is 2.5 steps). So that's okay.\n\nWait, perhaps m can be from 1 to (n-2) steps. But the angle will be determined by that. However, the problem requires that the angle is formed such that v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the angle. So the angle must be less than 180 degrees. Because if the arc is more than half the polygon, then the angle would be more than 180 degrees, which is not possible. Therefore, m must be such that m < n/2. Because if m >= n/2, then the arc would be more than half the circle, and the angle would be more than 180 degrees. Therefore, for each valid configuration, m must be in the range 1 <= m <= floor( (n-1)/2 ). Because if m is larger than that, then the angle would be more than 180 degrees, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, but in the case of n=4, m can be up to 2 steps, which is exactly half. But 2 steps for n=4 would be 2 * 180 /4 = 90 degrees, which is okay. So perhaps m can be up to (n-2) steps, but the angle is always less than 180 degrees. Wait, for example, n=5. If m=2 steps, then the angle is 2*180/5=72 degrees. If m=3 steps, then 3*180/5=108 degrees. Which is still less than 180. Wait, but 3 steps is more than half of 5 steps (half is 2.5 steps). So why is the angle still less than 180? Because the formula is based on the arc that does not contain v2. But if m is 3 steps, that's the longer arc. But according to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle is half the arc. So for example, if the arc is 3 steps (each step is 72 degrees for n=5), then the arc is 3*72 = 216 degrees. Half of that is 108 degrees, which is the angle. Which is indeed less than 180. So that's okay. So perhaps m can be up to (n-2) steps. Because for any m steps, the angle is (m * 180)/n degrees. And since m can be up to (n-2) steps, then for example, when m = n-2 steps, the angle is ((n-2) * 180)/n = 180 - 360/n degrees. Which is less than 180. So yes, that's valid.\n\nSo the key insight here is that for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2. Let's call this number m. Then the angle is (m * 180)/n degrees. And m can be any integer between 1 and (n-2). However, for different values of m, the same angle can be achieved. For example, in a square (n=4), m=1 gives 45 degrees, m=2 gives 90 degrees. But for m=3 steps, the angle would be 3*180/4 = 135 degrees. But wait, that's not possible. Because in a square, the maximum possible angle would be 90 degrees. Wait, what's happening here?\n\nAh, no. Wait, m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. So for m=3 steps in a square, the arc would be 3 steps. But the square has 4 vertices. So the arc between v1 and v3 is 3 steps. Which is equivalent to going the other way around the circle. Because the arc that doesn't contain v2 would be 3 steps. But that's actually the same as the arc that contains v2, but in the opposite direction. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, for example, take n=4. Let's say v2 is vertex 1. Then, suppose v1 is vertex 2 and v3 is vertex 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) would be from 2 to 3 to 4. That's two steps. So m=2. Which gives angle 2*180/4=90 degrees. But if I choose v1 as vertex 2 and v3 as vertex 3. Then the arc between them that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) is one step (from 2 to 3), so m=1. Which gives 45 degrees. But if I choose v1 as vertex 4 and v3 as vertex 2, then the arc that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) is from 4 to 3 to 2. That's two steps again. So m=2. So the angle is 90 degrees again.\n\nBut how can m be 3 steps in this scenario? For example, if v1 is 2, and v3 is 3. Then the arc that does not contain v2 (say, v2 is vertex 1). Then the arc between 2 and 3 that does not contain 1 is 1 step. So m=1. But if I have v2 as vertex 2. Suppose v1 is 1, and v3 is 4. The arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain 2 would be 1 to 4 (steps: 1 to 4 is one step in the other direction). So m=1. So the angle is 1*180/4=45 degrees. If I have v1 as 1 and v3 as 3, then the arc that does not contain v2 (vertex 2) is 1 to 4 to 3. That's two steps. So m=2. Angle is 90 degrees. So for n=4, m can be 1 or 2 steps. But m can't be 3 steps because that would require the arc between v1 and v3 to be 3 steps, which would imply that the arc that contains v2 is 1 step. Which is possible? Let me think. Suppose v2 is vertex 1. Then, v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 2 steps (as before). But if I take v1 as vertex 3 and v3 as vertex 4. Then the arc between them that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) would be 1 step (from 3 to 4). So m=1. Hmm.\n\nSo for n=4, the possible m values are 1 and 2. For m=3 steps, that would require that the arc between v1 and v3 is 3 steps. Which would imply that the arc that contains v2 is 1 step. But that's not possible because the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be the longer arc. Wait, but in that case, the angle would be (3*180)/4 = 135 degrees, which is more than 90. How is that possible? Because in a square, the maximum angle possible is 90 degrees. So clearly, there's a mistake in my reasoning here.\n\nAh! Oh right! Because the arc that does not contain v2 must be the arc that is opposite to v2. But if the arc between v1 and v3 is longer than half the polygon, then the angle would be computed as half of that arc. However, in reality, the angle formed would be the reflex angle (greater than 180 degrees) if the arc is longer than half the polygon. But the problem says that the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 on the sides. Which implies that the angle is a convex angle (less than 180 degrees). Therefore, when considering m, we must ensure that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is less than half the polygon. Otherwise, the angle would be reflex and not allowed.\n\nTherefore, m must satisfy m < n/2. Because if m >= n/2, then the arc is longer than half the polygon, and the angle would be greater than 180 degrees. Which is not allowed. Therefore, for each possible m, it must be between 1 and floor((n-1)/2).\n\nFor example, in n=4, floor((4-1)/2) is 1. So m can be 1. But earlier examples show that m=2 gives 90 degrees, which is allowed. Wait, but for n=4, n/2 is 2. So m must be less than 2. So m can be 1. But then how do we get 90 degrees?\n\nThis suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect. So I need to re-examine the formula.\n\nLet me think again. The angle at v2 is determined by the arc that does not contain v2. But if that arc is larger than half the circle, then the angle would be larger than 180 degrees. However, in reality, when you have three points on a circle, the angle formed depends on which arc you take. But the angle at v2 is the angle between two chords, which is always the smaller angle (i.e., less than 180 degrees). Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle, the angle can be obtuse. But in that case, the arc is more than 180 degrees. Wait, no. The inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. So if the arc is more than 180 degrees, the angle would be more than 90 degrees. But the angle itself can be up to 180 degrees (if the arc is 360 degrees, but that's impossible since the three points are distinct). Wait, no. For three distinct points on a circle, the arc that is subtended by the angle must be less than 360 degrees. But the angle can be up to 180 degrees. For example, if the arc is 180 degrees, the angle is 90 degrees. If the arc is 270 degrees, the angle would be 135 degrees, which is less than 180. Wait, but how can the arc be 270 degrees? Because that would mean that the three points are arranged such that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 270 degrees. Which would imply that the arc that contains v2 is 90 degrees. So the angle at v2 would be 270/2 = 135 degrees. Which is allowed, as it's less than 180. So in that case, m (the number of steps) would be 270/(360/n) steps. For example, for n=4, 360/4=90 per step. So 270 degrees is 3 steps. So m=3 steps. Which would give angle 3*180/4= 135 degrees. Which is allowed. But in that case, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 3 steps (which is 270 degrees), which is larger than half of the circle (180 degrees). But the angle is 135 degrees, which is less than 180. So why is that allowed?\n\nAh, because the formula is based on the arc that is subtended by the angle. So regardless of whether the arc is larger than half the circle, the angle is half the measure of that arc. But the angle itself will be less than 180 degrees. Because the arc can be up to 360 - 2*step (but I'm getting confused here). Wait, for any three distinct points on the circle, the arc that is subtended by the angle can be up to 360 - 2*epsilon degrees, but the angle itself is half of that, so up to 180 - epsilon degrees. So the angle is always less than 180 degrees. Therefore, m can be any value from 1 to n-2 steps. Because the angle is always less than 180 degrees.\n\nBut how does that reconcile with the earlier example of n=4 and m=3 steps?\n\nLet's compute for n=4 and m=3 steps. The angle would be 3*180/4 = 135 degrees. Which is allowed. But how can that happen? Let's imagine a square with vertices labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 in clockwise order. Suppose we choose v2 as vertex 2, and v1 as vertex 1, and v3 as vertex 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc from 1 to 4, which is one step (since going clockwise from 1 to 4 is one step through 4, but that's not passing through 2). Wait, no. Wait, if v2 is vertex 2, then the arc between v1 (1) and v3 (4) that does not contain v2 would be the arc that goes from 1 to 4 via vertex 3, which is two steps (1->4 is directly adjacent, but if you go the other way around, it's 1->4 is one step, but that's the arc that contains v2? No. Wait, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. If v2 is 2, then the arc that does not contain 2 would be the arc from 1 to 4 that goes through 3. That's two steps (1 to 3 is two steps, but 1 to 4 is one step). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. So for example, if v2 is vertex 2, and v1 is vertex 1, v3 is vertex 4. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be the arc that goes from 1 to 4 in the direction that doesn't pass through 2. Since the polygon is a square, the two arcs between 1 and 4 are: clockwise (1-2-3-4, which passes through 2) and counter-clockwise (1-4, which does not pass through 2). So the arc that does not contain v2 is just one step (from 1 to 4). So m=1. So the angle is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. Which is correct. But how do I get m=3 steps? That would require that between v1 and v3, there are three steps along the arc that does not contain v2. But in a square, that's not possible. Because the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 can be at most one step (for adjacent vertices) or two steps (for vertices opposite each other). Wait, for example, if v1 is 1, v3 is 3. Then the arc between them that does not contain v2 (say, v2 is 2) is the arc from 1 to 3 via 4. That's two steps (1-4-3). So m=2. Which gives angle 2*180/4=90 degrees. So in that case, m=2 steps. So for n=4, the maximum m is 2 steps, which gives 90 degrees.\n\nSo perhaps my earlier assumption that m can be up to (n-2) steps is incorrect. Because in reality, for a given v2, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is determined by how far apart they are. So for a given v2, the possible m is determined by the positions of v1 and v3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the direction that doesn't include v2. For example, if there are k vertices between v1 and v3 along that arc, then m = k + 1. Because the number of steps between them is the number of edges between them, which is k+1. For example, between v1 and v3 with one vertex in between (like v1 and v3 are two steps apart), m would be 2 steps. So the angle is m * 180 /n.\n\nBut how to find all possible m for a given n?\n\nLet me think of the general case. For any regular n-gon, the possible angles that can be formed at a vertex v2 are determined by the possible values of m, which is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2. Since v1 and v3 must be distinct from v2 and from each other, the minimum m is 1 (when v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other along the arc not containing v2), and the maximum m is (n-2) steps (when v1 and v3 are as far apart as possible without including v2). Wait, but how?\n\nFor example, in a pentagon (n=5), for a given v2, the maximum m is 2 steps. Because if you have v2, then the arc that doesn't contain v2 can have at most 2 steps between v1 and v3. Because if you take v1 as vertex 1, and v3 as vertex 4 (assuming v2 is vertex 2), then the arc between them that doesn't contain v2 is 1-3-4, which is two steps. If you take v1 as vertex 1 and v3 as vertex 5, then the arc that doesn't contain v2 (vertex 2) is 1-5 (one step), or 1-4-5 (two steps)? Wait, depends on the direction. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given n, the possible angles are determined by m ranging from 1 to (n-2), and for each m, the angle is (m * 180)/n degrees. However, for a given n, there are multiple ways to achieve the same angle. For example, for n=5, m=2 gives 72 degrees, m=3 gives 108 degrees, etc. But for each m, the angle is fixed.\n\nBut how do I find the best m that makes the angle closest to a given a?\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the m (between 1 and n-2) such that the angle (m * 180 / n) is as close as possible to a. Once we find the optimal m, we can construct any triplet of vertices that corresponds to this m.\n\nOnce we find the optimal m, we need to output three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 there are m steps.\n\nNow, the question is: how to find the optimal m.\n\nLet me think. For each possible m in 1..n-2, compute the absolute difference between (m * 180 /n ) and a. Find the m with the minimal difference. If there are multiple m's with the same difference, any of them can be chosen.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e5, iterating over all possible m's is feasible. Because n-2 is up to 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nOnce the optimal m is found, the next step is to find any triplet of vertices that satisfies the condition for that m.\n\nSo first, let's find the optimal m.\n\nLet me think about how to compute m.\n\nThe target angle is a. We want to find m such that |(m * 180 /n ) - a| is minimized.\n\nWe can compute this for all m in 1..n-2, but that's O(n) time. However, since n can be up to 1e5, this is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mathematical way to find the optimal m. Let's think:\n\nLet's denote the desired angle as a. We want to find m such that m is approximately (a * n)/180.\n\nBut m must be an integer between 1 and n-2.\n\nSo the optimal m is the integer closest to (a * n)/180. However, we need to check the floor and ceiling of this value to find the closest.\n\nFor example, suppose (a * n)/180 is 2.3. Then m could be 2 or 3. We need to compare which of these gives a closer value.\n\nBut there's also the possibility that the optimal m is either floor or ceil of that value, or maybe even outside that range if the value is near the boundaries.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nCompute m_candidate = round( (a * n) / 180 )\n\nBut need to clamp m_candidate between 1 and n-2.\n\nBut also check m_candidate -1, m_candidate, m_candidate +1 to find the best.\n\nBut since n can be large, but the possible candidates are limited, this approach would work.\n\nOnce the optimal m is found, then we need to construct any triplet of vertices that satisfies the condition.\n\nNow, how to construct the triplet once m is known.\n\nLet me think. Let's choose v2 as any vertex, say vertex 1. Then, we need to find two vertices v1 and v3 such that between them along the arc not containing v2, there are m steps.\n\nFor example, in the case of n=4 and m=1, we can choose v2=1, then v1=2, v3=4 (arc between 2 and 4 not containing 1 is one step (from 2 to 4 via 3? No. Wait, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. So for v2=1, v1=2, v3=4. The arc between 2 and 4 that does not contain 1 would be the arc from 2 to 4 via 3, which is one step (since 2 to 3 to 4 is two steps? Or is it one step? Wait, the number of steps between two vertices is the number of edges between them along the arc. So between 2 and 4, if you go via 3, that's two steps. So m would be 2 steps, leading to angle 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is not m=1. So perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me think again. For a given m, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is m. So for example, if m=1, then v1 and v3 are adjacent along that arc.\n\nSo, to construct such a triplet, we can choose v2 as any vertex, say vertex 1. Then, v1 is vertex 2 (next to v2), and v3 is vertex (v2 + m + 1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think of a way to generate v1 and v3 for a given m and v2.\n\nAssume that v2 is vertex 1. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) must have m steps. So, for example, if m=1, then v1 and v3 are adjacent along the arc not containing v2. So, for example, v1 could be vertex 2, and v3 could be vertex 3. The arc between 2 and 3 not containing 1 is one step (they are adjacent). So the angle is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=2 for n=4. v2 is 1, then v1 is 2, v3 is 4. The arc between 2 and 4 not containing 1 is two steps (2-3-4). So m=2 steps. Which gives 90 degrees.\n\nSo the way to construct this is: for v2, choose v1 as v2 + 1 (mod n?), and v3 as v2 + m + 1 (mod n?), but ensuring that the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 has m steps.\n\nAlternatively, for a given v2, v1 is v2 + 1, and v3 is v2 + m + 1. But we have to make sure that the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is m steps.\n\nWait, let's think of the positions as arranged in a circle. For example, if v2 is at position 1, then the arc that does not contain v2 is the arc going clockwise from v1 to v3. To have m steps between them, v1 is at position 2, and v3 is at position 2 + m. But since the polygon is circular, we need to handle wrapping around.\n\nBut for simplicity, perhaps choosing v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as (m + 2). But if m + 2 exceeds n, then wrap around. However, since m can be up to n-2, adding m+2 would be up to (n-2)+2 = n. So for example, m= n-2, then v3 is 2 + (n-2) = n. Which is valid.\n\nSo for example, for n=5, m=2, v2=1, v1=2, v3=2+2=4. The arc between 2 and 4 that does not contain 1 is 2 steps (2-3-4), which is correct. The angle is 2*180/5 = 72 degrees.\n\nYes, this seems to work. So the general approach is: choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + m. However, since the vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order, adding m steps to v1 (which is 2) would give v3 as 2 + m. But if 2 + m exceeds n, then it wraps around. However, since m can be up to n-2, 2 + m can be up to 2 + (n-2) = n, which is valid. So no wrapping needed. Thus, for example, when m= n-2, v3 is 2 + m = 2 + n-2 = n, which is valid.\n\nThus, the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + m. But wait, the problem requires that v1, v2, v3 are distinct. Since v2 is 1, v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + m. As long as m >= 1, v3 is at least ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently determining the optimal vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of steps between those vertices along the arc that does not contain the middle vertex. This angle can be calculated using the formula: `(m * 180) / n` degrees, where `m` is the number of steps between the two outer vertices.\n\n2. **Finding Optimal m**: For a given angle `a`, we need to determine the integer value of `m` such that the angle `(m * 180) / n` is closest to `a`. This involves checking values of `m` around the calculated candidate value derived from `a`.\n\n3. **Constructing the Triplet**: Once the optimal `m` is found, we can construct the triplet of vertices. We choose the middle vertex as the first vertex (e.g., vertex 1), and then determine the other two vertices based on the calculated `m`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n    \n    # Calculate the optimal m\n    # The angle for m steps is (m * 180) / n\n    # We want to find m in [1, n-2] that minimizes |(m*180/n) - a|\n    \n    # Compute the ideal m\n    ideal_m = (a * n) / 180.0\n    candidates = []\n    for m in [int(ideal_m) - 1, int(ideal_m), int(ideal_m) + 1]:\n        if 1 <= m <= n - 2:\n            candidates.append(m)\n    # Also check boundaries\n    if ideal_m < 1:\n        candidates.append(1)\n    elif ideal_m > n - 2:\n        candidates.append(n - 2)\n    \n    # Now find the best m among the candidates\n    best_m = None\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for m in set(candidates):\n        angle = (m * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_m = m\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            if best_m is None or m < best_m:\n                best_m = m\n    \n    # Now, construct the triplet\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_m\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (the target angle).\n\n2. **Optimal m Calculation**: We compute the ideal value of `m` using the formula derived from the angle formula.
