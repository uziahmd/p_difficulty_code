And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day period, I have to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those averages.\n\nWait, right. So the problem says that for each of the (n - k + 1) weeks, we take the sum of the k days and divide by k. Then, we take the average of all those values. But wait, the example shows that in the third case, they sum all the weeks' sums and divide by the number of weeks. Oh right, because the average of averages is equivalent to the total sum divided by the number of weeks. Because each average is sum_week / k, and then the average of those is (sum of all sum_week) / (number_of_weeks * k). Wait no, the average of all the averages would be (sum of (sum_week /k )) / (number_of_weeks). Which is equal to (total_sum_of_all_weeks) / (k * number_of_weeks). But the number of weeks is (n -k +1). So perhaps there's a way to compute the total sum of all the weeks' sums, then divide by (k * (n -k +1)) ?\n\nBut how do I compute the sum of all the weeks' sums efficiently?\n\nBecause if I do it naively, for each window of k days, sum them, then add to total. But with n up to 2e5, that would be O(nk) time which would be 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient approach. Oh right, sliding window technique. Let's think about it.\n\nThe sum of the first window (days 1..k) is sum_1. Then the next window is days 2..k+1, which is sum_1 - a[1] + a[k+1]. So using a sliding window approach, we can compute each sum in O(1) time after the initial sum. So the total time would be O(n) for computing all the window sums.\n\nOnce I have the total sum of all the window sums, then the average is (total_sum) / ( (n -k +1) * k ). Because each window's sum is divided by k, then averaged over (n -k +1) weeks. So the overall average is (sum of all window sums) / (k * (n -k +1)).\n\nWait, let me check with the example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11. The average of the two averages is (7/2 + 11/2)/2 = ( (7 + 11)/2 ) / 2 = (18/2)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? But the sample output is 9.000... Wait, no. Wait the sample output says for that input, the output is 9.000... Wait what's going on here?\n\nWait the sample input says the first input is '3 2\\n3 4 7', and the output is '9.0000000000'. Wait according to the note, the result is (sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks). Wait in that example, the sum of the two weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. Then divide by 2 (number of weeks) gives 9. So that's the answer. Oh! So the problem says that the average is the average of the averages. But the average of the averages is (sum of the averages) / number of weeks. Which equals (sum of all window sums) / (k * number of weeks). Because each average is sum_week / k. So the average of all averages is (sum of sum_week /k ) / (number of weeks) = sum of sum_week / (k * number of weeks).\n\nBut in the first sample, sum of sum_week is 18. Number of weeks is 2. So 18/(2*2) = 4.5? But the sample output is 9.0. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample says that the output is 9.0. So according to the note, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which would be 18 / 2 = 9. So that's the answer. Wait but why? Because the problem says that the average is the average of the averages. But that would be (7/2 + 11/2)/2 = ( (7 + 11)/2 ) / 2 = 18/(2*2) = 4.5. But the sample says that the output is 9.0. So there's a contradiction here. So what's the correct way?\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement. The problem says: \"the average sleep time over all weeks\". The note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So that suggests that the average is the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the average. Wait, but that's conflicting with the problem description.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is ...\".\n\nThe example output for that case is 9.0. Let's compute that.\n\nThe weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. The average for each week is 3.5 and 5.5. The average of these two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output says 9.0. So this is conflicting. But according to the note, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which would be (7 + 11)/2 = 9. So that's the answer.\n\nWait this suggests that the problem is not asking for the average of the averages, but the average of the sum of each week. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the example is not given, but according to the sample input and output, the first input is 3 2 and the output is 9.0. So the sample output is 9.0. Which is (7+11)/2 = 9. So that's the average of the sum of the weeks. But the problem says that the average is the average of the averages. So this is confusing.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is ...\".\n\nThe problem says that the result is the average of the averages. But according to the sample input, the output is 9.0. Which is the average of the sum of each week. So what's the correct approach here?\n\nLooking at the sample explanation:\n\nIn the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So that suggests that the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the average. But that's conflicting with the problem statement.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"You should write a program which will calculate average sleeping time of Polycarp over all weeks.\"\n\nThe average sleeping time per week is the average of the sum of each week divided by k. So the average over all weeks would be the average of (sum_week /k) for each week. Which is (sum of sum_week) / (k * number_of_weeks). But in the sample input, the first example gives (sum of sum_week) = 18, number of weeks is 2. So 18/(2*2) = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. So that's a contradiction.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the output is 9.0. So why is that?\n\nAh! Wait the problem says that the answer is the average of the average of each week. But perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, and the actual required value is the average of the sum of each week. Because according to the sample, that's what's happening.\n\nLet me look back at the problem statement's example. Let's recheck the first sample input and output.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 2, then 3 4 7. Output is 9.000000...\n\nIf the answer is the average of the sum of each week, then (7 + 11) / 2 = 9. Which matches the sample. But if the answer is the average of the average of each week, then (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 4.5. Which does not match the sample. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the average of the sum of each week. But that's not what the problem says. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nBut looking at the note in the problem statement:\n\n\"In the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\nSo that's exactly the average of the sum of each week. Which suggests that the problem is asking for the average of the sum of each week. Not the average of the average. So why does the problem say \"average sleep time per week\"?\n\nAh, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nThe note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7 (in third example). So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the average of the sum of each week. Which would make sense for the sample input. So the problem statement might have a mistake in the wording. Or perhaps the problem is to compute the average of the average of each week. But that seems to not fit with the sample.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the average of the average of each week. But in that case, the first sample would have 9.0 as the sum of the averages. Wait, the sum of the averages is 3.5 + 5.5 = 9.0, and then divided by the number of weeks (2) gives 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's look at the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output: 9.0000000000\n\nSo according to the sample, the output is 9.0. Which is the sum of the two weeks (7 + 11 = 18) divided by 2 (the number of weeks) equals 9. So that's the average of the sum of each week. Which would be the average of the sum of each week. But the problem says that the average sleep time per week is the average of the average of each week.\n\nBut that's conflicting. So perhaps the problem statement has an error. However, the sample indicates that the correct answer is the average of the sum of each week. So the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which would be the sum of all the window sums divided by the number of weeks.\n\nBut why is that called the average sleep time?\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"the average amount of hours of sleep per week.\"\n\nSo the average per week would be the average of the average of each week. But that's not what the sample says.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which would be the total hours across all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which is the same as the average sum per week. But that's not the average per week. Because each week's average is sum_week / k.\n\nSo the problem's wording is confusing, but the samples indicate that the correct approach is to compute the average of the sum of each week. So the answer is (sum of all window sums) / (number of weeks).\n\nIn that case, the first sample's answer is 9.0, which is (7+11)/2 = 9.0. Which matches.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which is the sum of all the window sums divided by the number of weeks. So the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of all possible k-day windows.\n\n2. Divide that total by the number of weeks (n -k +1).\n\nSo how to compute the sum of all the window sums?\n\nUsing the sliding window approach.\n\nLet me think. For example, for the array [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], the sum of all windows of size k is:\n\nsum_{i=1 to m} (sum of a_i ... a_{i+k-1}) }, where m = n -k +1.\n\nSo the sum can be calculated efficiently with a sliding window approach.\n\nYes. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute the sum of each window of size k, and accumulate the total sum.\n\n- Then divide by the number of windows (m) to get the average.\n\nSo the problem is to compute that.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute the sum of all window sums efficiently.\n\nFor example, for n=2e5 and k=1e5, the sliding window approach would take O(n) time.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\n- Add that to the total.\n\n- Then, for each next window, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new element entering. Add to the total.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCompute the initial sum.\n\ntotal_sum = 0\n\ncurrent_sum = sum of a[0...k-1]\n\ntotal_sum += current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n\n    current_sum += a[i] - a[i -k]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\nThen, the average is total_sum / (number_of_weeks), where number_of_weeks = n -k +1.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, that would be:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\ninitial sum is 3+4=7. total_sum is 7.\n\nthen i=2 (since k=2, the loop starts from i=2 to n-1 (which is 2). So:\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 + a[2] - a[0] = 7 +7 -3 = 11. total_sum becomes 7+11=18. number_of_weeks is 2. 18/2=9. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So that's the correct approach.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the sum of all the window sums, then divide by the number of windows.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to compute that.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut for large n (up to 2e5), the code must be efficient.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\nThen, compute the total_sum as described.\n\nThen, divide by (n -k +1) and output with sufficient decimal precision.\n\nBut what about when k=0? No, the constraints say 1<=k<=n.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase when k =n: only one week, sum is sum of all elements, divided by 1. So output is sum of all elements.\n\nAnother case when k=1: each week is a single day, so the sum is sum of all elements, divided by n (number of weeks is n -1 +1 =n).\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, implementing in Python.\n\nBut for the sum of the first k elements, we can use a loop or use sum(a[0:k]).\n\nBut for large k (like 2e5), sum(a[0:k]) is O(k) time, which is acceptable since the total time is O(n) for the entire code.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n, k.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nif n ==0: but n >=k >=1, so no.\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal_sum = initial_sum\n\nthen for i in range(k, n):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum + a[i] - a[i -k]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\nthen, average = total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nprint average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, how to handle the division and floating points?\n\nYes.\n\nBut for large numbers, the sum could be very big, but Python handles big integers.\n\nSo for example, in the third sample input:\n\nInput is 8 2\n\narray is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nn=8, k=2. So number of weeks is 8-2+1=7.\n\nEach window sum is:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3 +6 +100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 +790 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 +6 =9; +100004 = 100013; +100123 = 200,136; +579 = 200715; +1245 = 201,960; +790 = 202,750.\n\nThen average is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, in Python, for the input, the code needs to read multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input examples show multiple test cases. Wait, the input given in the problem is:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. So perhaps the problem is to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Wait the original problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, it's given as three different test cases. So perhaps the problem is to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. But the original problem says that the input is given as per the first line (n and k) and second line (the array). But in the sample input, there are three separate test cases. But the problem's original input may have multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is written as a list of inputs, but the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input section says:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, in the sample input provided, there are three test cases. So perhaps the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, it's unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is the corresponding outputs for each. So the actual problem may require processing multiple test cases.\n\nWait the original problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nBut the input format for each test case is:\n\nFirst line: n and k.\n\nSecond line: n integers.\n\nSo the code should read multiple test cases. But how many?\n\nBut looking at the sample input, it's given as three separate test cases. But the problem statement says nothing about multiple test cases. However, looking at the sample input, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of input strings, but the actual input for the problem is a single test case. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich would produce the output 9.0000000000.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem includes three test cases. However, in the problem's input description, it's not mentioned that there are multiple test cases. So this is a contradiction. But perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases for illustration, but the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nOutput:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nBut this is probably just showing that the code should process multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement, it's unclear. However, looking back at the problem statement's input description, it says:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nWhich implies that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is a contradiction. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking at the problem's original source, perhaps it's from Codeforces. Let me think. The problem title is \"Average Sleep Time\", which resembles a Codeforces problem.\n\nLooking up similar problems, perhaps this is Codeforces problem 702B, but I'm not sure. However, in any case, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? Well, the code should read all lines from stdin. For example, the input could be multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut in Python, the standard way to read input is to read all lines at once. So for example, the code can read all lines, split them into groups of two lines (each test case is two lines), and process each group.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nBut the problem's original input may not have multiple test cases. However, the sample input shows three test cases, but the problem statement may not specify that. This is a problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input and output sections:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nOutput:\n\nOutput average sleeping time ... \n\nSo this implies that the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But perhaps the sample input is written as a list of input examples, but the actual code should process one test case. But that's not clear.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output provided in the problem:\n\nThe sample input is given as three separate inputs, and the outputs are three separate outputs. So the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? Because in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem statement may not mention it, but the sample input shows it.\n\nThis is a critical point. If the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, then the code must read all of them. Otherwise, if it's one, then the code reads one.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, I think that the problem requires handling multiple test cases. However, the problem's original statement may not mention this. So perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, it says that the first line contains n and k. So perhaps the code is to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the first sample input, the output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nIn the second sample input, it's '10.0000000000'.\n\nThird sample input is '28964.2857142857'.\n\nSo the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nThe code can read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs of two lines (each test case is two lines), and process each pair.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, the input could be read as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n    process lines[i] and lines[i+1]\n\nBut what if the number of lines is odd? Well, the problem's input is correct, so each test case has two lines.\n\nSo, for example, the sample input has three test cases, which would be 3*2=6 lines.\n\nSo the code would process each pair.\n\nThus, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead n and k from the first line.\n\nRead the array from the second line.\n\nCompute the sum of the window sums, then divide by the number of weeks.\n\nPrint the result with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut for the case where n and k are read from the first line, and the array is read from the second line.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nBut in Python, for each test case, the code would:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and k.\n\nRead the second line, split into list of integers.\n\nThen compute the sum of the window sums.\n\nBut for the case where n is up to 2e5, and multiple test cases, the code must be efficient.\n\nBut with Python, even for 2e5 elements, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the code.\n\nSample code outline:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # read first line\n\n        line1 = lines[idx]\n\n        n, k = map(int, line1.split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        line2 = lines[idx]\n\n        a = list(map(int, line2.split()))\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        # process this test case\n\n        # compute sum of all window sums\n\n        # compute initial sum\n\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n        total_sum = current_sum\n\n        # iterate from k to n-1\n\n        for i in range(k, n):\n\n            current_sum += a[i] - a[i -k]\n\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n        # compute average\n\n        num_weeks = n -k +1\n\n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n\n        # print with 10 decimal digits\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the third test case's output is '28964.2857142857', which is 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714...\n\nWhich when printed with 10 decimal digits is 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut in Python, formatting with .10f will round correctly.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error is <=1e-6. So printing with 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 2\\n3 4 7.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_sum = 3 +4 =7. total_sum =7.\n\ni=2 (k=2, n=3, so i ranges from 2 to 2 (since n=3, range(k, n) is range(2,3), which is [2].\n\ncurrent_sum += a[2] -a[0] = 7 -3 =4. current_sum becomes 7 +4 = 11. total_sum +=11 → 7+11=18.\n\nnum_weeks= 3-2+1=2. average is 18/2=9.0 → printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nSample Input 2: 1 1\\n10.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum([10]) → 10. total_sum =10.\n\nnum_weeks =1-1+1=1. average is 10/1=10.0 → printed as 10.0000000000.\n\nSample Input 3: 8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the average is 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714..., which when printed with 10 decimals is 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nTest case where k =n. Then, the number of weeks is 1. The sum is sum of all elements, divided by 1. So the average is sum(a).\n\nAnother case: k=1. Then the average is sum of all elements divided by n (since number of weeks is n -1 +1 =n). Which is the average of all elements.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for the code, when k=1, the initial sum is a[0]. Then for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum + a[i] - a[i-1] → which is a[i]. So total_sum is sum of all a[i], since each step adds a[i]. Because for k=1, each window is a single element. So the total_sum is sum of all elements. Then divided by n → average of the elements.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for very large n (like 2e5), the code must be efficient. The sum(a[:k]) is O(k) time. Which for k=2e5 is acceptable.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, each with O(n) processing, it's acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of k days from a given list of n days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of each k-day window and then determining the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: This technique allows us to compute the sum of each k-day window in linear time, which is crucial for efficiency given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the first k elements to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Iterate Through Remaining Elements**: Adjust the window sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window. Accumulate these sums.\n4. **Compute Average**: Divide the total sum of all window sums by the number of valid weeks (n - k + 1) to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and k from the first line\n        line1 = lines[idx]\n        n, k = map(int, line1.split())\n        idx += 1\n        # Read the array from the second line\n        line2 = lines[idx]\n        a = list(map(int, line2.split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        # Compute the sum of all window sums\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        \n        for i in range(k, n):\n            current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        \n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n        \n        # Print with 10 decimal places\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n2. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the first k elements is computed. For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by removing the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters.\n3. **Total Sum Accumulation**: As we slide the window across the array, we keep a running total of all window sums.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of valid weeks to get the final average, which is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.",
