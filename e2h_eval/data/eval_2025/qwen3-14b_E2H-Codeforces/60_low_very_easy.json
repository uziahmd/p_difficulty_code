Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to track the number of valid Morse code substrings after each character is added to the string S. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem statement correctly. So, each time a character (0 or 1) is appended to S, I have to compute how many non-empty sequences of English letters are represented by some substring of S. But the catch is that certain Morse code strings are invalid. The four invalid ones are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". All other Morse code strings of length 1-4 are valid and correspond to a unique letter. \n\nSo, for each step, after adding a new character to S, I need to check all possible substrings of S and count those that are valid Morse codes. However, since the length of S can be up to m (which is 3000), checking all substrings each time might be O(n^2) per step, leading to O(m^3) total operations. But with m up to 3000, that would be around 3000^3 = 27 billion operations, which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a dynamic programming way to approach this. Let's think about it. For each position in the string, we can track the number of valid Morse code sequences ending at that position. Then, for each new character added, we can look back and see how many new sequences are formed.\n\nBut how do we track that? Let's think about possible Morse code lengths. Since Morse codes are of length 1-4, when adding a new character, we can check for possible substrings ending at this new character of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4. However, we need to make sure that the substring is not one of the four invalid ones.\n\nSo, for each new character added, let's consider the current string S. Let's say after adding the new character, the length of S is len_S. For each possible end position (the current end), we can look back 1, 2, 3, 4 steps (but not beyond the start of the string). For each possible substring of length l (1-4) ending at the current position, check if it's valid. If it is, then add 1 to the total count. But also, these substrings can be part of longer sequences. Wait, but the problem is counting all possible non-empty sequences of letters. Each such sequence corresponds to a unique way of splitting the string into Morse code representations. However, the problem says that any substring that is a valid Morse code represents a single letter. So the question is not about splitting the entire string into letters, but counting all possible substrings that are valid Morse codes. Because each such substring represents exactly one letter, and any sequence of letters is just a collection of such substrings. Wait, no. Wait the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. For example, if the string S is \"111\", then the substrings are:\n\n\"1\" (positions 1), \"1\" (position 2), \"1\" (position 3), \"11\" (positions 1-2), \"11\" (positions 2-3), \"111\" (positions 1-3). Each of these substrings is a valid Morse code (assuming they are not in the invalid list). Each of these substrings represents a letter, so each counts as a single sequence (a single letter). But sequences of letters would be combinations of these substrings. Wait, no. The problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Wait, perhaps the wording is confusing. Let me re-read the note given in the example.\n\nIn the first sample, S is \"111\". The valid substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", and their various positions. Each of these substrings is a valid Morse code (since none of them are in the invalid list). Each of these substrings corresponds to exactly one letter. So the number of sequences is the number of valid substrings. Because each valid substring is a single-letter sequence. For example, \"TT\" would be two letters, but that would correspond to the substring \"11\" (since each T is \"1\"). But how does that fit into the problem?\n\nWait the note says that for the first sample, the answer after three 1s is 7. The explanation lists seven different sequences. Let me check:\n\nThe note says:\n\n\"T\" (1), \"M\" (11), \"O\"",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to track the number of valid Morse code substrings after each character is appended to a string. The valid Morse code strings are those of length 1 to 4, excluding four specific invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: For each new character added to the string, we check all possible substrings ending at this character that have lengths between 1 and 4. This allows us to efficiently count valid Morse code substrings without rechecking all substrings from scratch each time.\n2. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, we use modulo $10^9 + 7$ to keep numbers manageable.\n3. **Efficient Checking**: By maintaining the current string and checking substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at each new character, we ensure that we only consider relevant substrings and avoid redundant checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    ops = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    S = []\n    total = 0\n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    for op in ops:\n        S.append(op)\n        current_len = len(S)\n        # Check all possible substrings ending at current_len\n        # with lengths 1 to 4\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if current_len - l >= 0:\n                substring = ''.join(S[current_len - l:current_len])\n                if substring not in invalid:\n                    total += 1\n        print(total % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations and the sequence of operations (either '0' or '1').\n2. **Maintaining String**: The string `S` is built incrementally by appending each operation.\n3. **Checking Valid Substrings**: After each append operation, we check all possible substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at the current position. If a substring is valid (i.e., not in the set of invalid Morse codes), it is counted.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: The result after each operation is printed modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid Morse code substrings in linear time relative to the number of operations, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
