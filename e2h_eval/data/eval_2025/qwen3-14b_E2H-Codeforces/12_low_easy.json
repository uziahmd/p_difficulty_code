The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. The key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks have to be done in order (each task must be done after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's consider each task in order. For each task, we need to calculate the time taken to get from the previous position to the current task's house. But since the ringroad is circular, moving clockwise, the distance between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nFor example, if she's currently at position prev and needs to go to position curr, how much time does that take?\n\nWell, if prev is less than curr, then moving clockwise would be curr - prev steps. But if prev is greater than curr, then she has to go all the way around the ring. For example, if n is 4, moving from 3 to 2 would take 3 steps: 3→4→1→2. Wait, no. Wait, moving clockwise, from 3 to 4 is one step, then 4 to 1 is another, then 1 to 2 is another. So total of 3 steps. Which is (curr + n - prev) % n? Wait, let me think. The distance between prev and curr in a clockwise direction is (curr - prev) mod n. But since moving clockwise, when prev is 3 and curr is 2, the distance is (2 - 3 + n) mod n. Which would be (n-1) steps. Wait, for n=4, that's 3 steps. Which matches the example.\n\nBut in the first example given, let's check:\n\nIn the first example input, the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. Let's see:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise steps. 1→2→3: 2 steps. Then, the second task is at 2. So from 3 to 2: moving clockwise. That's 3 →4 →1 →2: 3 steps. Then third task is at 3 again. From 2 to 3: 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is to track the current position, and for each task, compute the distance from current position to the task's house, add that to the total time, and update the current position.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two positions?\n\nThe formula for the distance from prev to curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Wait, no. Because for example, if prev is 3 and curr is 2, then (curr - prev) is -1. Adding n (4) gives 3, which is correct. So the formula is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev else (curr - prev + n). Alternatively, (curr - prev) % n? Wait, but if curr is 2 and prev is 3, (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4, which is 3. So yes, (curr - prev) mod n gives the correct number of steps. However, since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values if the numerator is negative, but perhaps we can compute it as (curr - prev) % n. Wait, for example, (2-3) is -1. -1 mod 4 is 3. So yes. So the distance between prev and curr is (curr - prev) % n. But wait, what if prev is 1 and curr is 1? Then the distance is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each task, the time taken to move from the previous position to the current task's position is (current_position - previous_position) mod n. But wait, no. Because the movement is clockwise. So if prev is 1 and curr is 3, the steps are 2. Which is (3-1) mod 4 = 2. Correct. If prev is 3, curr is 2, then (2-3) mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the formula is (curr -",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. Each task must be completed in sequence, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Movement**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise from one house to another can be calculated using modular arithmetic. The distance from house `prev` to house `curr` is given by `(curr - prev) % n` if moving clockwise. This accounts for both direct and wrap-around movements around the circle.\n2. **Tracking Position**: Start from house 1 and track Xenia's current position as she moves to each subsequent task location.\n3. **Accumulating Time**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current position to the task's house and accumulate this time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    diff = (a - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `current` set to 1 and `total_time` initialized to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location `a` in the list of tasks:\n  - Calculate the distance from the current position to the task's house using `(a - current) % n`. This ensures correct handling of both direct and wrap-around movements.\n  - Add this distance to `total_time`.\n  - Update `current` to the current task's house location.\n- **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time with a linear pass through the tasks, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(m), which is suitable given the problem constraints.",
