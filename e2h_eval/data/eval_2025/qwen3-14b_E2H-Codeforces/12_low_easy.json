The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise. How many steps? Well, since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Then she does task 1. Then task 2 is at 2. But she's currently at 3. So moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Then task 2 is done. Then task 3 is at 3 again. She's at 2, so moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach here is to track Xenia's current position and accumulate the time taken to move from her current position to the next task's house, considering the clockwise direction.\n\nBut how to compute the steps between two positions?\n\nLet's think: For two positions current and next, the number of steps needed to move clockwise from current to next is (next - current) mod n if next >= current? Wait, no. Because if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - current + next) steps. For example, n=4, current=3, next=2: steps are 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) mod 4? Let's see: (2 -3) = -1, mod 4 is 3. So yes. So the formula for steps between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). But that's equivalent to (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is less than current, then (next - current) is negative, and mod n would give the correct positive value. For example, (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 which is 3. So yes, the number of steps is (next - current) % n. But wait, if next is equal to current, then the steps are zero.\n\nWait, but in the case where current is 3 and next is 3, the steps are zero. So the formula (next - current) mod n would be zero. Correct.\n\nSo the steps between current and next is (next - current) mod n. But wait, no. Because when next is greater than current, (next - current) is positive, and mod n would be same as that. But when next is less than current, (next - current) is negative. So mod n gives the correct steps. For example, current is 3, next is 2, n=4. (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the steps between current and next is (next - current) % n. But wait, in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So yes. So for each consecutive pair of tasks, we can compute the steps between them, and sum them all up.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is 1. So for the first task, the steps are (a1 - 1) mod n? Or wait, the initial position is 1, and the first task is a1. So the steps from 1 to a1 is (a1 - 1) mod n? Let's see. For example, if a1 is 3 and n is 4: 3-1=2 steps. Which is correct. If a1 is 2, then steps are 1. If a1 is 1,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time taken to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1. Each task must be completed in the given order, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time. The movement is clockwise.\n2. **Circular Calculation**: The number of steps required to move from the current house to the next task's house can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. For two positions `current` and `next`, the steps needed are `(next - current) % n` if moving clockwise. This formula handles both cases where the next house is ahead or behind the current position in the clockwise direction.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, iterate through each task, compute the steps needed to reach the next task's house from the current position, and accumulate the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    diff = (target - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n2. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the number of steps needed to move from the current house to the target house using `(target - current) % n`. This ensures that the movement is calculated correctly in a circular manner.\n3. **Update Position**: After each task, update the current position to the target house.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the steps for each move to get the total time required to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time in linear time, O(m), which is optimal given the constraints.",
