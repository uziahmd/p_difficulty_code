For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to compute this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. For each binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n. The maximum size of such a multiset is what we're concerned with.\n\nThe question is about choosing all c_s values (each between 0 and k inclusive) such that when you choose them, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Then, count how many such c_s configurations exist.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The key is to find for each possible configuration of c_s, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset, and then count those configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum? Well, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset would be determined by some constraints based on the c_s values. Let's think about this.\n\nFor example, consider that each string in the multiset contributes to the counts of all its prefixes. So, if we have a string of length n, say 's', then all its prefixes (from length 1 up to n) are incremented by 1 in their counts. Therefore, the problem is similar to a tree structure where each node (binary string) has children (strings formed by adding a 0 or 1). The constraints are that for each node, the total number of times it's a prefix in the multiset can't exceed c_s.\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model it using the inclusion-exclusion principle or some kind of tree-based dynamic programming. But since the maximum size of the multiset is the maximum number of elements we can select without violating any of the constraints, perhaps we need to model this as a flow problem or find the minimal constraints that limit the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to maximize the number of strings in the multiset, given the constraints. The maximum possible size would be the minimum over certain values. Wait, maybe the maximum possible size is determined by the constraints along the paths from the root (the empty string?) to the leaves (the full-length strings). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For the multiset to be as large as possible, each string in the multiset contributes to the count of all its prefixes. So, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is limited by the constraints on the prefixes. For example, if a particular prefix s has a c_s value of x, then the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix cannot exceed x. However, since longer prefixes are subsets of shorter ones, there's a hierarchy here.\n\nThis sounds similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements in a set where each element is a binary string of length n, and for each prefix s of any length, the count of elements with s as a prefix is <= c_s. The maximum such count is the answer for the given c_s configuration.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum? It seems like a problem that can be modeled with a trie structure. Each node represents a binary string. The number of elements that pass through a node (i.e., have it as a prefix) is limited by c_s. The maximum number of elements in the multiset is the maximum number of elements that can be placed in the trie without violating any of these constraints.\n\nThis reminds me of the problem of finding the maximum number of elements that can be placed in a trie, given that each node has a capacity. The maximum number of elements would be the sum of the capacities of the leaves, but that's probably not correct. Wait, no. Because each element is a path from the root to a leaf. Each such element contributes +1 to every node along its path. Therefore, the constraints are that for each node, the sum of the number of elements passing through it is <= c_s.\n\nBut how do we find the maximum number of elements possible under these constraints?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using the concept of the minimum capacity cut in a graph. Alternatively, think of it as a flow problem where each node has a capacity constraint. But perhaps there's a more straightforward way.\n\nAnother approach is to think recursively. For each node, the number of elements that can pass through it is limited by c_s. However, the elements passing through it are those that go through its children. For example, the root",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values $ c_s $ for all binary strings $ s $ of lengths from 1 to $ n $ such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $. The solution involves dynamic programming and combinatorial counting with modular arithmetic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string $ s $ of length from 1 to $ n $ has a constraint $ c_s $ between 0 and $ k $. The goal is to ensure that the maximum number of strings in a beautiful multiset (of length $ n $) is exactly $ f $.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Use dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations. We define `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to assign values to all binary strings of length $ i $ such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset up to length $ i $ is at most $ j $.\n\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each length $ i $, transition from the previous length $ i-1 $ by considering all possible values of $ c_s $ and ensuring the constraints are respected.\n\n4. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: Calculate the number of valid configurations where the maximum size is exactly $ f $ using the difference between configurations where the maximum size is at most $ f $ and those where it is at most $ f-1 $.\n\n5. **Modular Arithmetic**: Use modulo $ 998244353 $ to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n        idx += 3\n    \n    for n, k, f in cases:\n        # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial for combinations\n        max_len = n\n        # dp[i][j]: number of ways for strings up to length i, max size <= j\n        # We can precompute dp for all possible i and j up to f\n        # But since n is small (<=15), and f can be up to 2e5, we need an efficient way\n        \n        # Let's use a 2D array, but given that n is small, it's manageable\n        # However, with n up to 15 and f up to 2e5, it's better to use a 1D DP and update it\n        # Because for each level i, we only need the previous level's data\n        \n        # Initialize dp[0][j] = 1 for all j >=0? Well, for i=0 (no strings), the max size is 0\n        # So for our problem, we start from i=1 to i=n\n        \n        # For each length i from 1 to n, we need to compute the number of ways to assign c_s for all strings of length i, \n        # considering the constraints from previous levels.\n        \n        # But how?\n        # Let's think recursively. For each level i, the number of ways depends on the previous level's dp.\n        \n        # Let's consider that for each node (binary string of length l), the value c_s must be chosen such that the constraints are satisfied.\n        # The total number of nodes for length l is 2^l.\n        \n        # However, the problem is to count the number of c_s assignments such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n        # To compute this, we need to find for each possible assignment of c_s, the maximum size of the multiset, and count those where it is exactly f.\n        \n        # But directly computing this for all possible assignments is impossible due to the exponential number of possibilities.\n        \n        # Instead, we can use inclusion-exclusion. Let’s define for each possible assignment of c_s, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is m.\n        # We need the number of assignments where m == f.\n        \n        # To find this, we can compute the number of assignments where m <= f and subtract those where m <= f-1.\n        \n        # Now, the key is to compute for a given target value t, the number of assignments of c_s such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is <= t.\n        \n        # How to compute this number? It's equivalent to the number of assignments where for every binary string s, the constraints are such that the maximum possible multiset size is <= t.\n        \n        # This is similar to the problem of assigning capacities to nodes in a trie such that the maximum number of paths through the trie (each path being a string of length n) is <= t.\n        \n        # The maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum of the capacities along all paths from root to leaves. However, this seems complex.\n        \n        # Another approach is to model this with dynamic programming. For each length i, and for each possible capacity limit, compute the number of ways to assign c_s values.\n        \n        # Let’s think about the number of nodes at each level. For level i, there are 2^i nodes. Each node's capacity c_s must be chosen between 0 and k.\n        \n        # The maximum size of the multiset is constrained by the capacities. For example, if we have a node s of length l, then the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is limited by c_s. Since each such string contributes to all prefixes of s, the constraints form a hierarchy.\n        \n        # The maximum number of strings in the multiset is equal to the minimum of the sum of capacities along all paths. Wait, perhaps not. However, there's a known result that the maximum number of elements is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}), but I'm not sure.\n        \n        # Alternatively, for the maximum size of the multiset, it is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}). Wait, this might be the case because each node s can be extended to 2^{n - len(s)} different full-length strings. Thus, the capacity c_s limits the number of full-length strings that can have s as a prefix. Therefore, the maximum number of such strings is min_{s} (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        \n        # If this is correct, then the maximum possible size of the multiset is the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} over all s. Therefore, for each assignment of c_s, the maximum size is the minimum of these values across all s.\n        \n        # However, this would be true if we could freely choose the c_s values. But the problem requires that for each s, the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix does not exceed c_s. However, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the tightest constraint. Hence, the maximum possible size is the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) for all s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem reduces to choosing c_s values such that the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s is exactly f.\n        \n        # Wait, but that seems too simplistic. Let me think again.\n        \n        # Suppose we have a binary string s of length l. The number of full-length strings (length n) that have s as a prefix is 2^{n-l}. For each such string, s is a prefix. Therefore, the number of times s appears as a prefix in the multiset is equal to the number of full-length strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. This number must be <= c_s. Thus, the maximum number of full-length strings in the multiset is the minimum over all s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        \n        # That makes sense. For example, if you have a string s of length l, then the number of full-length strings that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. Therefore, the total number of such strings cannot exceed c_s * 2^{n - l}, because each of the 2^{n - l} extensions of s to full length contributes to the count. However, this is not necessarily the case because multiple s may impose different constraints.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum possible size of the multiset is the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s.\n        \n        # Thus, for the problem, we need to count the number of assignments of c_s values such that the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s is exactly f.\n        \n        # However, this seems to be a crucial insight. Let's formalize it:\n        \n        # For each binary string s of length l (1 <= l <= n), let m_s = c_s * 2^{n - l}. The maximum size of the multiset is the minimum m_s over all s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem becomes: count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the minimum of m_s is exactly f.\n        \n        # Now, the problem is to count the number of assignments where min(m_s) = f. This can be done using inclusion-exclusion: compute the number of assignments where min(m_s) >= f, minus those where min(m_s) >= f+1.\n        \n        # So, the answer is (number of assignments with min(m_s) >= f) - (number of assignments with min(m_s) >= f+1).\n        \n        # Therefore, our task reduces to computing for a given value t, the number of assignments where for all s, m_s >= t. Then, the answer for the original problem is (count(t=f) - count(t=f+1)).\n        \n        # Now, how to compute count(t)? For each s, m_s = c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= t. So, for each s of length l, c_s >= ceil(t / 2^{n - l}).\n        \n        # But since c_s must be an integer between 0 and k, we can compute for each s the lower bound on c_s.\n        \n        # For each s of length l, the required lower bound is ceil(t / 2^{n - l}) = ceil(t / (2^{n - l})). However, since 2^{n - l} is a power of two, this can be rewritten as (t + (2^{n - l} - 1)) // (2^{n - l}).\n        \n        # For example, if t=5 and 2^{n-l}=2, then 5/2=2.5, so ceil(5/2)=3.\n        \n        # However, note that for a given s of length l, the value of 2^{n - l} is fixed. For example, for all s of length l, the same exponent applies.\n        \n        # So, for each length l (from 1 to n), we can compute the minimal required value of c_s for that l.\n        \n        # Let's denote for a given t, the minimal required c_s for strings of length l is low_l = ceil(t / (2^{n - l})). But we need to ensure that low_l <= k, otherwise there are no valid assignments for this t.\n        \n        # Thus, for a given t, we can compute for each length l the minimal required c_s for strings of that length. Then, for each such l, the number of choices for c_s for all strings of length l is (k - low_l + 1)^{number_of_strings_of_length_l}.\n        \n        # The number of strings of length l is 2^l. So, for each l, we calculate the number of valid choices for all c_s of that length, and multiply them together for all l.\n        \n        # However, if for any l, the required low_l exceeds k, then there are zero valid assignments for that t.\n        \n        # Therefore, the function count(t) is the product over all l from 1 to n of [ (k - low_l + 1) ^ (2^l) ] if all low_l <= k, else 0.\n        \n        # Now, the problem is to compute for t = f and t = f+1, and subtract the counts.\n        \n        # But wait, what if f is larger than the maximum possible value of the minimum m_s? In that case, the count for t = f would be zero, and similarly for f+1. So, we need to handle that.\n        \n        # Now, the plan is:\n        \n        # 1. For the given n, k, f, compute count(f) and count(f+1), then subtract.\n        \n        # 2.

It's equivalent to the number of assignments where for every binary string s, the constraints are such that the maximum possible multiset size is <= t.\n        \n        # This is similar to the problem of assigning capacities to nodes in a trie such that the maximum number of paths through the trie (each path being a string of length n) is <= t.\n        \n        # The maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum of the capacities along all paths from root to leaves. However, this seems complex.\n        \n        # Another approach is to model this with dynamic programming. For each length i, and for each possible capacity limit, compute the number of ways to assign c_s values.\n        \n        # Let’s think about the number of nodes at each level. For level i, there are 2^i nodes. Each node's capacity c_s must be chosen between 0 and k.\n        \n        # The maximum size of the multiset is constrained by the capacities. For example, if we have a node s of length l, then the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is limited by c_s. Since each such string contributes to all prefixes of s, the constraints form a hierarchy.\n        \n        # The maximum number of strings in the multiset is equal to the minimum of the sum of capacities along all paths. Wait, perhaps not. However, there's a known result that the maximum number of elements is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}), but I'm not sure.\n        \n        # Alternatively, for the maximum size of the multiset, it is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}). Wait, this might be the case because each node s can be extended to 2^{n - len(s)} different full-length strings. Thus, the capacity c_s limits the number of full-length strings that can have s as a prefix. Therefore, the maximum number of such strings is min_{s} (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        \n        # If this is correct, then the maximum possible size of the multiset is the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} over all s. Therefore, for each assignment of c_s, the maximum size is the minimum of these values across all s.\n        \n        # However, this would be true if we could freely choose the c_s values. But the problem requires that for each s, the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix does not exceed c_s. However, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the tightest constraint. Hence, the maximum possible size is the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) for all s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem reduces to choosing c_s values such that the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s is exactly f.\n        \n        # Wait, but that seems too simplistic. Let me think again.\n        \n        # Suppose we have a binary string s of length l. The number of full-length strings (length n) that have s as a prefix is 2^{n-l}. For each such string, s is a prefix. Therefore, the number of times s appears as a prefix in the multiset is equal to the number of full-length strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. This number must be <= c_s. Thus, the maximum number of full-length strings in the multiset is the minimum over all s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        \n        # That makes sense. For example, if you have a string s of length l, then the number of full-length strings that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. Therefore, the total number of such strings cannot exceed c_s * 2^{n - l}, because each of the 2^{n - l} extensions of s to full length contributes to the count. However, this is not necessarily the case because multiple s may impose different constraints.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum possible size of the multiset is the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s.\n        \n        # Thus, for the problem, we need to count the number of assignments of c_s values such that the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s is exactly f.\n        \n        # However, this seems to be a crucial insight. Let's formalize it:\n        \n        # For each binary string s of length l (1 <= l <= n), let m_s = c_s * 2^{n - l}. The maximum size of the multiset is the minimum m_s over all s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem becomes: count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the minimum of m_s is exactly f.\n        \n        # Now, the problem is to count the number of assignments where min(m_s) = f. This can be done using inclusion-exclusion: compute the number of assignments where min(m_s) >= f, minus those where min(m_s) >= f+1.\n        \n        # So, the answer is (number of assignments with min(m_s) >= f) - (number of assignments with min(m_s) >= f+1).\n        \n        # Therefore, our task reduces to computing for a given value t, the number of assignments where for all s, m_s >= t. Then, the answer for the original problem is (count(t=f) - count(t=f+1)).\n        \n        # Now, how to compute count(t)? For each s, m_s = c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= t. So, for each s of length l, c_s >= ceil(t / 2^{n - l}).\n        \n        # But since c_s must be an integer between 0 and k, we can compute for each s the lower bound on c_s.\n        \n        # For each s of length l, the required lower bound is ceil(t / 2^{n - l}) = ceil(t / (2^{n - l})). However, since 2^{n - l} is a power of two, this can be rewritten as (t + (2^{n - l} - 1)) // (2^{n - l}).\n        \n        # For example, if t=5 and 2^{n-l}=2, then 5/2=2.5, so ceil(5/2)=3.\n        \n        # However, note that for a given s of length l, the value of 2^{n - l} is fixed. For example, for all s of length l, the same exponent applies.\n        \n        # So, for each length l (from 1 to n), we can compute the minimal required value of c_s for that l.\n        \n        # Let's denote for a given t, the minimal required c_s for strings of length l is low_l = ceil(t / (2^{n - l})). But we need to ensure that low_l <= k, otherwise there are no valid assignments for this t.\n        \n        # Thus, for a given t, we can compute for each length l the minimal required c_s for strings of that length. Then, for each such l, the number of choices for c_s for all strings of length l is (k - low_l + 1)^{number_of_strings_of_length_l}.\n        \n        # The number of strings of length l is 2^l. So, for each l, we calculate the number of valid choices for all c_s of that length, and multiply them together for all l.\n        \n        # However, if for any l, the required low_l exceeds k, then there are zero valid assignments for that t.\n        \n        # Therefore, the function count(t) is the product over all l from 1 to n of [ (k - low_l + 1) ^ (2^l) ] if all low_l <= k, else 0.\n        \n        # Now, the problem is to compute for t = f and t = f+1, and subtract the counts.\n        \n        # But wait, what if f is larger than the maximum possible value of the minimum m_s? In that case, the count for t = f would be zero, and similarly for f+1. So, we need to handle that.\n        \n        # Now, the plan is:\n        \n        # 1. For the given n, k, f, compute count(f) and count(f+1), then subtract.\n        \n        # 2.
