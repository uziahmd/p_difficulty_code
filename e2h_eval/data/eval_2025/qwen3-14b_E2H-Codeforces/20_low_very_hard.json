For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So the task is to count the number of ways to assign values c_s to each binary string s (of lengths from 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem statement again. The beautiful multiset has to satisfy that for every binary string s of length up to n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. And the maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. Our job is to count the number of c assignments that make this true.\n\nHmm. So, the key is to find all possible c assignments where the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. But how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about what determines the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. For each possible multiset, the constraints are that for every prefix s, the count of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. The maximum possible size of such a multiset would be determined by some constraints based on the c_s values.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible size is the maximum number of strings we can put into the multiset without violating any of the constraints. So for each c assignment, there is a maximum size M. We need to count the number of c assignments where M equals exactly f.\n\nSo the problem reduces to two parts:\n\n1. For a given set of c_s values, determine the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset (call this M).\n2. Count the number of c assignments where M is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute M for a given c assignment?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the constraints. Each string in the multiset contributes to multiple prefixes. For example, a string of length n contributes to all its prefixes of lengths 1 to n. So, when building the multiset, adding a string increases the count for all its prefixes.\n\nThe constraints are that for each prefix s, the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. So, the problem is similar to a constraint satisfaction problem where each string's addition affects multiple constraints.\n\nBut how do we find the maximum M possible? It seems like this is a problem of finding the maximum number of elements that can be placed in the multiset under these constraints.\n\nThis sounds like a flow problem or something similar, but perhaps there's a more efficient way. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to model this using the inclusion-exclusion of prefixes.\n\nAnother approach: think of the constraints as a hierarchy. For example, the root is the empty string (but maybe not considered here). Each string of length l has prefixes of length 1 to l. For the maximum M, perhaps the constraints are such that for each node (binary string), the sum of the counts of strings that have it as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. However, since longer prefixes are subsets of shorter ones, there's a dependency here.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum M is determined by the minimum of certain values. Let's think recursively. For example, consider the constraints for all prefixes. If we have a tree structure where each node is a binary string, and children are obtained by appending a 0 or 1. Then, each node's c_s is a capacity. The problem is similar to finding the maximum number of leaves (the full-length strings) that can be chosen such that for each node, the number of paths passing through it (i.e., the number of leaves in its subtree) is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, that might be a good way to model it. Because each string in the multiset is a full-length string of length n. For each such string, all its prefixes are counted. So the problem is equivalent to choosing a collection of full-length strings (the multiset) such that for every prefix s, the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. The maximum size of such a collection is M.\n\nSo, how to compute M given the c_s values?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of nodes (strings of length n) that can be selected, such that for each node s (prefix), the number of selected strings that pass through s is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is similar to a problem where each node has a capacity, and we want to select as many leaves as possible (each leaf corresponds to a full-length string) such that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree does not exceed the capacity.\n\nIn such a case, the maximum M is the minimum over all nodes of (the capacity of the node multiplied by the number of possible extensions from that node). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nFor example, take a node s of length l. The number of full-length strings",

Each such string contributes to s and all its prefixes.\n\n        # The maximum number of full-length strings that can be chosen without violating any constraints is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).

Because for a node s of length l, the maximum number of full-length strings that can pass through it is c_s, and since each such string has 2^{n - l} possible extensions, the total is c_s * 2^{n - l}.\n\n        # Therefore, the maximum M is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n\n        # So, our task is to count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the minimal value of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) is exactly f.\n\n        # Let's denote for each node s of length l, the value is v_s = c_s * 2^{n - l}.\n\n        # The minimal v_s across all nodes must be exactly f.\n\n        # So, for each node s, v_s >= f, and there exists at least one node s with v_s = f.\n\n        # Now, the problem becomes: count the number of ways to choose c_s for each node s (with 0 <= c_s <=k) such that:\n\n        # 1.

But since c_s must be integer, we can compute:\n\n        # For each node s of length l, the minimal c_s_min is ceil(f / (2^{n - l})).

Compute the total number of assignments where for all nodes, c_s >= m_l (for their respective l), and at least one node has c_s * 2^{n - l} = f.\n\n        # To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion. Let's compute the total number of valid assignments (all nodes have c_s >= m_l) minus the number of assignments where all nodes have c_s >= m_l and for all nodes, c_s * 2^{n - l} > f (i.e., no node has v_s = f).\n\n        # So, the answer is total_valid - total_strictly_greater.\n\n        # Now, how to compute total_valid?\n\n        # For each node of length l, the number of choices for c_s is (k - m_l + 1), provided that m_l <=k.

Which implies that c_s >= floor(f / d) + 1. Because c_s must be an integer.\n\n        # Let me compute for each l, d = 2^{n - l}, then the minimal c_s for this condition is m'_l = floor(f / d) + 1.\n\n        # However, for this to be possible, m'_l must be <=k. Otherwise, total_strictly_greater is 0.\n\n        # So, the steps are:\n\n        # Compute for each l:\n\n        # d = 2^{n - l}\n\n        # Check if d divides f. If yes, then for that l, there exists a c_s that makes v_s = f.\n\n        # Now, for total_valid:\n\n        # For each l, m_l = ceil(f / d). But since d = 2^{n - l}, and f is fixed.\n\n        # For example, if f = 5, d = 2, then ceil(5/2) = 3.

Let me think again.\n\n        # Let's consider that for a node s of length l, the number of full-length strings that pass through s is equal to the number of full-length strings in its subtree. Each such string contributes to s and all its prefixes.\n\n        # The maximum number of full-length strings that can be chosen without violating any constraints is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).

Which implies that c_s >= floor(f / d) + 1. Because c_s must be an integer.\n\n        # Let me compute for each l, d = 2^{n - l}, then the minimal c_s for this condition is m'_l = floor(f / d) + 1.\n\n        # However, for this to be possible, m'_l must be <=k.
