The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, right. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is calculated as 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's border would be 2*(3+3-2) = 8 cells, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1 and output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), I need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the previous. Wait, the first ring is the edge. The second is two cells in, which would mean that the dimensions for the second ring's rectangle would be (original width - 4*(2-1)) = w -4*1, same for height. Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the dimensions decrease by 4 in each dimension. Wait, no. Wait, for the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. Then the next ring is (w-4) x (h-4), because each side is reduced by 2 (so total reduction in width is 2*2=4). So yes, for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\nBut for each such rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(width + height - 2). Because for a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is 2*W + 2*H - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice if you just do 2*W + 2*H). Alternatively, 2*(W + H - 2).\n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, we calculate 2*( (w' + h' - 2) ), where w' is w - 4*(i-1), h' is h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all these values.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that for each i, the dimensions are valid. For example, when i increases, the w' and h' must be at least 1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's possible. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so floor is 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3 plate, you can only have one ring. For a 7x7 plate, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So two rings. So for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions would be valid.\n\nSo the approach is: loop from i=1 to k, compute for each i the current width and height (w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1)), then calculate the perimeter as 2*(w_i + h_i - 2), and sum all these.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So i=1: w_i = 3, h_i=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So i=1: w=7, h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. For i=1: 7x9, perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 28. For i=2: w_i =7 -4*(1) =3, h_i=9-4*(1)=5.",
