    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nHmm, the key here is to find out for each ring, how many cells it contributes. Then sum all those contributions for the k rings.\n\nLet me think about how each ring is structured. The i-th ring (starting from 1) is based on a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells in the ring?\n\nWait, the description says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, maybe I need to think about the perimeter of that rectangle. Because the ring is the border of that rectangle. But how?\n\nFor example, for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Like, top and bottom rows contribute W each, left and right columns contribute (H-2) each. So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Or maybe another way: for a rectangle of size m x n, the perimeter is 2*(m + n) - 4. Because each side has m or n cells, but the four corners are counted twice. So subtract 4. For example, a 3x3 rectangle: perimeter is 3*4 - 4 = 8? Which matches the first example input. The first example input is 3 3 1. The output is 8. Which is exactly that. So yes.\n\nSo for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w' x h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of that rectangle. So for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(w' + h' - 2). Because that's the perimeter formula.\n\nBut wait, let me check with the first example. For i=1, w' is 3, h' is 3. So 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first example. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the third example input is 7 9 2. Let's see:\n\nFirst ring: i=1. w' =7, h'=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Then second ring: i=2. w' =7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. h'=9 -4*(2-1) = 9-4=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the third example's output. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, what if the rectangle becomes too small? For example, when i increases, the w' and h' could become less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. The problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense. So for each i from 1 to k, the w' and h' must be at least 3? Or maybe not. Let's think: for example, if w=3, h=3, and k=1. Then the first ring is 3x3. Then for i=1, w'=3, h'=3. So that's okay. But if k was higher, say 2, then for i=2, w' = 3 -4*(2-1) = 3-4 = -1. Which is invalid. But the input constraints ensure that k is such that this doesn't happen. So the problem says that k is up",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding `k` rings around a rectangular plate. Each ring is placed such that the first ring is along the edge, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Ring Structure**: Each ring `i` (starting from 1) is formed around a rectangle of size `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`. The number of cells in each ring corresponds to the perimeter of this rectangle.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For a rectangle of dimensions `width` and `height`, the perimeter (number of bordering cells) is calculated as `2 * (width + height - 2)`.\n3. **Iterate Over Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The input values for width (`w`), height (`h`), and number of rings (`k`) are read.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, adjust the width and height by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both dimensions to account for the previous rings.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by leveraging the perimeter calculation for each ring, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the given constraints.",
