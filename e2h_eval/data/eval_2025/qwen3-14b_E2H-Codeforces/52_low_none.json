Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every b candles he collects, he can make one new candle. And this new candle can be used again, which in turn will become another burned-out one. So it's like a process that can loop until he can't make any more candles.\n\nThe task is to find the total number of hours. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2: \n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles, so 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burned ones. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. Now, he uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burned ones. Make 2/2 = 1 new. Use that, +1 hour. Now he has 1 burned, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4+2+1=7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see:\n\nStart with 6, so 6 hours. Then 6 burned. 6/3=2 new. Use them, +2 hours. Now 2 burned. Not enough for 3, so done? Wait but the output is 8. Wait 6+2=8. Oh right. But wait, after using the 2, he has 2 burned. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. So total is 6+2=8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours, and the number of burned candles. Then, whenever possible, convert the burned ones into new candles, add to the total, and track the new burned ones.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think. Let's have variables:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburned_candles = 0\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Each time he uses a candle, it's burned and becomes part of the burned pile. So perhaps the process is:\n\nInitially, he has a candles. He uses all of them, which takes a hours. Then, he has a burned candles. Then, he can make a//b new candles. Then, those new ones are used, adding (a//b) hours. Then, the burned candles from that step is (a//b) + (a % b) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you make new candles, you take b burned ones to make one new. So for each new candle made, you subtract b burned ones, and add 1 new candle. But when you use that new candle, it becomes burned again.\n\nSo perhaps the way to model this is:\n\nWe have a variable for the total hours, and a variable for the number of burned candles.\n\nInitially, total_hours is 0. We start with a candles. So we can use all of them. So total_hours += a. Then, the burned_candles is a. Then, while burned_candles >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned_candles // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burned_candles = (burned_candles % b) + new_candles\n\nRepeat this until burned_candles < b.\n\nYes, that seems right. Because each time, we take the burned candles, make as many new ones as possible. Then, the new ones are used, adding to the total hours, and then those new ones become burned again. But the remainder (burned_candles % b) is left over, plus the new ones made.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first example.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 0. Then, initial step: total +=4, burned_candles=4.\n\nNow, burned_candles >=2. So new_candles =4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. burned_candles is 4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2. new_candles=2//2=1. total is 6+1=7. burned_candles is 0 +1=1. Now, 1 <2. So stop. Total is 7. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal starts at 6. burned is 6. 6//3=2. total becomes 6+2=8. burned is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So done. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=",
