Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads. Each road is a line equation. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home's block to university's block. A step is moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. So, adjacent regions via a line segment (not just a point) are considered adjacent.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? It seems like a graph problem where each node represents a block, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent. But since there are infinitely many blocks, I can't represent them all directly. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but maybe I can model the problem using the lines as separators. For each line, the blocks are divided into two parts. So, for each line, a point can be on one side or the other. So, the key is to represent the position of the home and university relative to each line. Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal steps between the two points in terms of their positions across the lines.\n\nBut how to model the adjacency between blocks. Because two blocks are adjacent if they share a common border, which would mean that there's exactly one line that separates them. So, moving between two blocks requires crossing a single line. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of each block as being determined by the sign of each line's equation. For example, for each line i, the block is either on the positive side or negative side of the line. However, with multiple lines, the combination of signs defines the block. But since there are n lines, there are 2^n possible combinations, but some might not be possible (like if the lines are parallel, etc.), but even so, for n up to 300, 2^300 is way too big to handle.\n\nBut wait, that's impossible. So, perhaps there's another approach.\n\nAnother thought: The movement between blocks can be modeled as a graph where each node is a region (block), and edges exist between regions that share a common border. But again, since there are infinitely many regions, we can't model them all. But perhaps, for the purposes of BFS, we can model the regions based on the parity of crossings. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each time you cross a line, you change the sign of that line's equation. So, the minimal steps between the home and university would be the minimal number of lines that you have to cross to get from the home's position to the university's position. But how?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let me think of the problem as a graph where each node is the set of lines that separate the home from the university. But that's vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of each line as a hyperplane. The home and university are points in the plane. The minimal steps required to move from the home's region to the university's region is equal to the minimal number of lines that separate the two points, considering that each step allows crossing a line.\n\nWait, no. Because each step moves between adjacent regions, which requires crossing exactly one line. So, the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of lines that need to be crossed to get from the home to the university. But how to compute that?\n\nBut how do you model the regions? Maybe the problem can be transformed into a BFS where each state is the current position's sign configuration with respect to all lines. But again, for n=300, that's 2^300 states, which is impossible.\n\nSo, there must be a smarter approach. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph where each node represents the parity of the number of lines that separate the home from the current position. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, here's another idea. Since each line divides the plane into two regions. If two points are in the same region with respect to a line, then they are on the same side. If they are on opposite sides, then the line separates them. Now, the minimal number of steps between the two points is the minimal number of lines that separate them, but considering that each step can cross one line. But how?\n\nWait, suppose that the home and university are separated by k lines. Then, the minimal steps would be k, but that's not necessarily correct. Because each step can cross a line. For example, if two lines cross each other, then crossing one line may allow you to reach a region that's adjacent to the university's region via another line. So the minimal steps could be the number of lines that separate the home and university in some way.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a BFS where each node is the current set of lines that the current region is on the positive or negative side. But again, this is not feasible for large n.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is that the minimal steps between the home and university is the minimal number of lines that you need to cross. Which is equivalent to the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each time you cross a line, you can change your position relative to that line. But how to compute the minimal number of lines separating the two points.\n\nWait, let me think of the following example. Suppose that the home and university are separated by exactly one line. Then, you can cross that line once, so the answer is 1. If they are separated by two lines, then perhaps you can cross those two lines, but maybe there's a path that crosses one line, then another line, but that would be two steps. So the answer is the number of lines that separate the two points. But how do I find that number?\n\nBut how to find the number of lines that separate the two points. For each line, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides of that line. If so, then that line is a separator between them. The minimal steps is the number of such lines? No, that's not correct. For example, imagine that two lines cross each other. The home and university are on opposite sides of both lines. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. But if you cross one line, then cross the other line, that's two steps. However, perhaps there's a way to cross both lines in two steps. But the number of separating lines is two. So in that case, the answer is two steps.\n\nBut what if the home and university are separated by three lines? Then, the minimal steps would be three? Or maybe less?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university. Because each step can cross one line. So, if there are k lines separating them, then you need at least k steps. But perhaps there's a way to cross lines in a way that reduces the number of steps. But how?\n\nWait, suppose that two lines are parallel. The home is on one side of both, and the university is on the other side. Then, the two lines separate the home and university. To get from home to university, you need to cross both lines. But since the lines are parallel, each crossing would take one step. So, the minimal steps would be two steps. Which equals the number of separating lines.\n\nBut if there are two lines that cross each other, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both lines. Then, the minimal steps would be two steps. Because you cross one line, then the other. So, again, the number of separating lines.\n\nBut what if there's a scenario where the home and university are separated by two lines, but those two lines are arranged such that there's a path that crosses one line and then another, but that's two steps. So the number of separating lines is two.\n\nBut what if the home and university are separated by three lines, but there's a way to cross two lines to reach the university's block? That would require that the lines are arranged in a way that crossing two lines can get you there. But how?\n\nWait, think of the lines as forming a grid. Suppose the home is in the lower left quadrant, and the university is in the upper right quadrant. There are two lines: x=0 and y=0. The home is (-1,-1), the university is (1,1). They are separated by both lines. So, the minimal steps would be two steps. But if there's a third line, say x + y = 0. Suppose that the home and university are on opposite sides of this line. Then, the total number of separating lines is three. So the minimal steps would be three steps. But is there a way to cross two lines?\n\nNo. Because each step can only cross one line. So, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nWait, but how do we know that the number of lines that separate the home and university is the minimal steps?\n\nBecause each step can cross exactly one line. Therefore, the minimal steps is the minimal number of lines that you need to cross to go from the home's region to the university's region. Which is exactly the number of lines that separate them. Because, for each such line, you have to cross it once. But how to confirm that?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose that the home and university are separated by two lines. But these two lines intersect. So, the home is in one region, and the university is in a region that is separated by both lines. But perhaps there's a path that crosses one line, then crosses the other line. So, two steps. Which is the number of separating lines.\n\nBut if the home and university are separated by three lines, but two of them are redundant in some way. For example, imagine that the three lines are arranged in a triangle. The home is inside the triangle, and the university is outside. Then, the minimal steps would be three steps. Because to get out, you have to cross each of the three lines. But perhaps there's a way to cross two lines? No, because each line is a boundary. So, you have to cross each of them once. So the number of lines that separate the two points is the minimal steps.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting how many lines separate the home and university. Because each such line must be crossed once. Therefore, the answer is the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are 0x +1y +0 =0 (y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0).\n\nFor each line:\n\nCheck if home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nFirst line: y=0. For home (1,1): 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1>0. For university (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1 <0. So they are on opposite sides. So this line contributes 1.\n\nSecond line: x=0. Home: 1>0, university -1<0. Also opposite. So total of 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nCheck for each line:\n\nLine 1: x=0. Home is positive, university negative. Opposite. Count 1.\n\nLine 2: y=0. Same as above. Count 1.\n\nLine 3: x + y -3 = 0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. Both are same side. So not counted. Total is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. Correct.\n\nSo the sample outputs align with this approach.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because in some cases, the minimal steps might be less than that. But according to our previous reasoning, it's not possible. Because each line that separates the two points must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut how to prove this? Let's think of it as a graph where each node is a region, and edges are between regions that share a common border. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home's region and the university's region.\n\nBut how can we model this? Well, the key is that each step crosses exactly one line. So, the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of lines that you need to cross to get from the home to the university. Each crossing changes the sign of that line's equation.\n\nNow, the question is: What's the minimal number of lines that you need to cross to get from the home's position to the university's position. This is equivalent to the number of lines that separate the two points. Because if you cross all lines that separate them, you can reach the university's region.\n\nBut why is that the case?\n\nBecause if two points are separated by k lines, then you need to cross each of those k lines once. Because, each line that separates them is a barrier that must be crossed. For example, imagine that you have two lines that cross each other. The home is in one region, and the university is in the opposite region. Then, you need to cross both lines. But how? Well, the path would cross one line, then cross the other line. Thus, two steps.\n\nBut if there are three lines that separate the two points, then you need to cross each of them once. So, three steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of steps is exactly the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute, for each line, whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the line. Summing the count of such lines gives the answer.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each line, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If their product is negative, then the two points are on opposite sides of the line, so increment the count.\n\nThe answer is the count.\n\nWait, but why is this correct? Let me think of a case where two lines are parallel and separate the two points. For example, home is on one side of both lines, and the university is on the other side. Then, the two lines would contribute 2 to the count. So the answer is 2 steps. Which makes sense: you have to cross both lines.\n\nAnother example: two lines that cross each other. The home and university are on opposite sides of both lines. Then, the answer is 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose there's a line that doesn't separate the two points. Then, it doesn't contribute to the count. So the answer is zero steps. Which is correct, since the home and university are in the same block.\n\nWait, but what if there are no lines that separate them? Then, they are in the same block, and the answer is zero steps.\n\nYes. So, the algorithm is correct.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward. For each line, compute the sign of the home and the sign of the university. If they are different, add 1 to the answer.\n\nBut how to compute the sign?\n\nFor each line equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. For a point (x, y), compute the value of a_i x + b_i y + c_i. If this value is positive, the point is on one side; if negative, on the other. If zero, it's on the line, but the problem says that neither home nor university is on any line.\n\nThus, for each line, compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. If val1 * val2 < 0, then count +=1.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each line:\n\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but the sample input 2 has 3 lines. Let's check:\n\nSample input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Lines are:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0 → line equation x=0.\n\nFor home (1,1): 1*1 + 0*1 +0 = 1 → positive. University: -1 → negative. So product is negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: 0 1 0 → y=0. Same as before. Product negative → count +=1.\n\nThird line: 1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Both negative. So product is positive. So no count. So total is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So the code seems to work.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points. So, the answer is simply the count of such lines.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each step can cross exactly one line. So, to get from home to university, you need to cross each line that separates them once. And since each crossing takes one step, the total steps is the count.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those lines, and no more?\n\nBecause, for example, if you cross all the lines that separate the two points, then you will end up in the university's region. Because each crossing flips the sign of that line. So, after crossing all the separating lines, the home's position will be in the same region as the university.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of it as follows. Suppose that there are k lines that separate the two points. Then, the home and university are in regions that differ in exactly k lines. So, each of these lines must be crossed once. So, the minimal steps is k.\n\nBut how do we know that there's a path that crosses exactly those k lines?\n\nWell, since each line is a hyperplane, the regions are connected in such a way that you can cross each line once. For example, imagine that you have two lines that cross. The home is in one region, and the university is in the opposite region. You can cross one line, then cross the other line. So, two steps.\n\nIn general, for any set of lines that separate the two points, you can cross them one by one. Each crossing takes you into a new region. Thus, the minimal steps is the number of separating lines.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to this simple calculation. The code is straightforward.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input correctly. Let me think about the input format.\n\nThe first line is x1, y1. Second line is x2, y2. Third line is n. Then n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nBut in the example given, the first input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, the first input is split into two test cases. But the code is supposed to process one input at a time. However, the user probably provided two examples, but the actual code should read from stdin.\n\nBut for the code, the input is:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n from third line.\n\nThen read n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. But for the code, perhaps read via input() functions.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition, the code can read via input().split().\n\nBut for handling multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, the code is supposed to process one test case. Because the input is given as per the problem description.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nCompute the count as explained.\n\nPrint the count.\n\nSo, the Python code would be something like:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but why does this work? Because the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So, val1 and val2 can't be zero. So, their product can't be zero. So, the code is safe.\n\nYes. So, the code is as simple as that. And the sample input matches.\n\nBut why did the problem seem so complicated? Because the initial problem description made it look like a complex graph traversal problem, but the actual solution is very simple. So, the key insight was to realize that the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nThis is a classic problem in computational geometry, where the minimal steps between two regions divided by hyperplanes is the number of hyperplanes that separate the two points. But how to arrive at that conclusion?\n\nWell, perhaps through thinking about the parity of the crossings. But in this case, since each line is a separator, the minimal steps is the count.\n\nThus, the code is as above. Let me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nval1 for first line: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2: 0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 =-1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1. product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → x=0. val1 is 1, val2 is -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\n0 1 0 → same as before. count +=1.\n\nThird line: 1 1 -3 → val1 is 1*1 +1*1 -3 = -1. val2 is 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 =-5. product is positive → no count. total 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where home and university are separated by zero lines. So, output is zero.\n\nAnother case where all lines separate them. For example, n=300 lines, each of which separates them. Output is 300.\n\nAnother case where some lines are same. But the problem says that no two roads are same. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: a line that is not separating. For example, home and university are on same side. So, not counted.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block to a destination block in a city divided by infinite line roads. The key insight is that each step involves crossing a road, and the minimum number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate the starting point from the destination point.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each road is defined by a linear equation. The challenge is to determine the minimum number of steps (crossings) needed to move from the starting block to the destination block.\n2. **Key Insight**: A step is allowed between two blocks if they share a common border. This means moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the starting point from the destination point.\n3. **Algorithm**: For each road, check if the starting point and destination point lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, increment the count of separating roads. The count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the starting point (home), destination point (university), and the number of roads are read from the input.\n2. **Checking Separation**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both the starting and destination points. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the road, meaning this road separates them.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads**: The count of such separating roads is incremented each time a road is found to separate the starting and destination points. This count directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the starting block to the destination block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separation of points, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
