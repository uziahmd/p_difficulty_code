Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Hmm. The problem is about moving between blocks divided by roads, and finding the minimum steps to get from home to university. \n\nSo, the key here is to model the blocks as nodes in a graph, where edges exist between blocks that share a common border (so adjacent regions). Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home's block to the university's block. But how do I represent the blocks and determine adjacency?\n\nBut wait, considering that there can be up to 300 roads, the number of blocks could be enormous. So directly representing each block isn't feasible. There must be a smarter way.\n\nWait, another approach: since moving between blocks requires crossing a road. Each time you cross a road, you move to an adjacent block. So perhaps the problem can be modeled using BFS, where each state is determined by the parity of the number of roads crossed. Or maybe using some kind of coordinate system based on the roads.\n\nAlternatively, think about each block being defined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, the block is either on one side or the other. So for each road, the home's position gives a sign (positive or negative) when plugged into the equation. Similarly for the university. The question is then to find how many roads' signs differ between home and university. Because each step can change the sign of exactly one road, but maybe not? Wait, no. Because moving between adjacent blocks requires crossing a single road. So each step changes the sign of exactly one road. Therefore, the minimum number of steps would be the number of roads where the home and university have different signs. Because each differing sign requires crossing that road once. But wait, that might not be the case. Because maybe some roads are redundant in terms of their effect on the regions.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose that each block can be represented by a vector of signs for each road. For example, for each road i, the sign of (a_i x + b_i y + c_i) determines which side of the road the point is on. So the home's position has a certain sign vector, and the university's has another. The problem is to find the minimal number of roads where the signs differ between the two vectors, because each such difference would require crossing that road once. But is that correct?\n\nWait, if two blocks are adjacent, they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because crossing a road changes the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads where the signs of home and university differ. Because each step can flip one sign. So the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. But is this true?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose there are two roads. Home is in a region where both signs are positive. University is in a region where one sign is positive and the other is negative. Then the Hamming distance is 1. So the minimal steps is 1. Which makes sense: cross the second road once.\n\nAnother example: home and university differ in two roads. Then the minimal steps would be 2. But can you cross two roads in two steps? Yes, because each step crosses one road. So the answer is indeed the Hamming distance.\n\nBut wait, what if the home and university are in regions that differ in k roads, but there's a way to get from one to the other with fewer steps? How?\n\nNo, because each step can only cross one road. So to go from one region to another, you need to cross each road where their sign differs. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads where the sign differs between home and university.\n\nWait, but maybe some roads are not in between? Like, suppose that two regions are separated by multiple roads. But no, because each step can cross any road. For example, if two regions differ in two roads, then you can cross one road, then cross another. So the minimal steps is the number of differing roads.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's think about the example given in the problem.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Two roads: 0x+1y+0=0 (which is y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0). \n\nHome (1,1): for first road, y=0. 1 is positive. For second road x=0, 1 is positive. So sign vector is (+,+).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1): for first road, y=-1, which is negative. For second road x=-1, which is negative. So sign vector is (-,-). So differing in two roads. So answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input: home (1,1), univ (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. Let's compute the signs.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → 1>0 → +.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → 1>0 → +.\n\nRoad 3: x+y-3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\n\nSo sign vector is (+,+,-).\n\nFor university (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: x is -1 → -.\n\nRoad 2: y is -1 → -.\n\nRoad 3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → same as home. So sign vector is (-,-,-). \n\nSo differing in two roads (road 1 and 2). So answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to work. Therefore, the problem reduces to: compute for each road, whether the home and university are on the same side of the road. The answer is the number of roads where they are on different sides.\n\nWait, but how to check if two points are on the same side of a line?\n\nFor a line ax + by + c = 0, the sign of ax + by + c for a point (x,y) tells which side of the line it's on. So for each road, compute the value for home and for university. If their signs are different (i.e., the product is negative), then this road contributes 1 to the answer.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that neither home nor university lie on any road. So for each road, the value for home and university is non-zero. So for each road, compute f1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i, and f2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. If f1 and f2 have different signs, then add 1 to the count.\n\nSo the answer is the count of roads where f1 * f2 < 0.\n\nWait, that's it? Then the code is straightforward. For each road, compute f1 and f2. If their product is negative, increment the count. Then output that count.\n\nBut why does this work? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So the minimal steps is the number of roads where the two points are on opposite sides. Because each such road must be crossed once. And since crossing a road changes the sign, the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing roads.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where you cross a road twice, but that's not needed? Well, because the problem says that you can move between blocks if they share a common border. So each step is moving across a road. So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the home and the university. But how does that relate to the number of differing roads?\n\nWait, the home and the university are in two different regions. The regions are separated by some roads. But how do we know that the minimal steps is the number of roads where the signs differ?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where two points are separated by two roads. Suppose there are two roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. Because you can cross one road, then cross another. But maybe there's a way to cross both roads in one step? No, because each step crosses exactly one road. So the steps are equal to the number of roads that separate them.\n\nBut how do we know that the number of differing roads is the minimal steps? Because each step can cross one road. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing roads. Because each step can cross one road, and you need to cross all roads where the signs differ.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The answer is the count of such roads.\n\nWait, but why does this hold? Let me think of a case where there are two roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. But perhaps the regions are connected through some path that requires crossing both roads once. So the steps would be 2, which is the count. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads. The home and university are on opposite sides of one road, but same on others. Then the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Read the home and university coordinates. Then for each road, compute f1 and f2. If f1 * f2 < 0, increment the count. Output the count.\n\nWait, but why does this work? Because the home and university are in two different regions. Each time you cross a road, you change the sign of that road. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them. But how do we know that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads?\n\nBecause the regions are connected in such a way that you can cross each road once. For example, imagine that the home is in a region, and the university is in another region. The minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them. Because each such road must be crossed once. But how to be sure that there's a path that crosses each of those roads once?\n\nWell, the arrangement of roads divides the plane into regions. The regions can be thought of as connected components. The problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to get from home to university. Each road that separates the home and university must be crossed once. And since each crossing can be done in one step, the minimal steps is the number of such roads.\n\nBut how to confirm that there's no overlapping or something? For example, if two roads cross each other, but the home and university are on opposite sides of both. Then you can cross one road, then cross the other. So two steps. Which is the count. So this seems correct.\n\nSo the code is simple. Let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are y=0 and x=0.\n\nFor first road (0x +1y +0=0):\n\nf1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. f2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y +0=0. f1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. f2= 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: home (1,1), univ (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nFirst road: x=0. f1 is 1, f2 is -1 → product negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: y=0. same as first → count +=1.\n\nThird road: x + y -3 =0. For home: 1+1-3 = -1. For univ: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Both negative. Product is positive. So no increment. Total count is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nFor each a, b, c:\n\ncompute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nif val1 * val2 <0 → count +=1.\n\nAt end, print count.\n\nThat's it? That's the solution?\n\nBut why is this the case? Because each road that separates the two points must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is the count. But how to make sure that the steps are possible? Well, since the roads are arranged in a way that allows moving between regions by crossing roads. So the problem is equivalent to the number of roads separating the two points.\n\nBut why isn't there a case where two points are separated by even number of roads, but you can cross them in fewer steps? For example, if there are two roads that cross each other, and the two points are on opposite sides of both roads. Then, the count is 2. But can you cross both roads in one step? No. Because each step crosses exactly one road. So you need two steps. Which is the count.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is straightforward. Now, implement it.\n\nNow, handle the input. The input is read from stdin. Let's see.\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, in Python, read the first two lines, then read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut note that the input may be given as multiple lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, but the input is given as two separate test cases? Or is that part of the example? Wait, the user provided two examples. But in the actual problem, the input is given as per the problem statement.\n\nBut in the code, the input is read from stdin. So, for example, for the first sample input, the input is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSo, the code should read the first two lines as the home and university coordinates, then read n, then read n lines.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nThen compute for each line.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but what about the case when the two points are in the same region? Then the answer is zero. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the home and university are not on any road, but they could be in the same region. But the problem says that the answer is the minimal steps. So if they are in the same region, the answer is zero.\n\nBut according to the code, if for all roads, val1 and val2 have same sign, then the count is zero. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut why is that correct? Because if the two points are in the same region, then you don't need to cross any roads. So steps is zero.\n\nSo this code works.\n\nBut why does this approach work? Because the regions are determined by the signs of each road. So the home and university are in the same region if and only if for all roads, their signs are the same. Thus, the code counts the number of roads that separate them, which is the minimal steps.\n\nThis seems to be the case.\n\nSo this code would solve the problem. Let me check the sample inputs again.\n\nSample 1: output is 2. Which the code returns.\n\nSample 2: output is 2. Which the code returns.\n\nAnother test case: if home and university are in same region. For example, home (1,1), univ (2,2). Roads are x + y + 1 =0. Then for both points, the value is 1+1 +1 =3 and 2+2 +1=5. Both positive. So count is zero. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: home (1,0), univ (2,0). Road is x=0. Then for home, x=1 is positive. For univ, x=2 is positive. So same sign. So count is zero. So steps is zero. Correct.\n\nAnother case: home (1,0), univ (-1,0). Road is x=0. Then val1 is 1, val2 is -1. Product is -1 → count 1. So steps is 1. Which is correct.\n\nYes, this code seems correct.\n\nSo this is the solution. It's surprisingly simple. But why didn't I think of this earlier? Because the problem seems complex but the solution is straightforward once you realize that the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points.\n\nTherefore, the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to an adjacent block through a common border.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each block can be represented by the signs of the values obtained by plugging the coordinates of a point into the equations of the roads. If two points (home and university) are on opposite sides of a road, they must cross that road to move between blocks. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads where the home and university points lie on opposite sides.\n\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective equations.\n2. **Sign Calculation**: For each road, compute the value of the equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Opposite Sides Check**: Check if the values for the home and university points have opposite signs for each road.
