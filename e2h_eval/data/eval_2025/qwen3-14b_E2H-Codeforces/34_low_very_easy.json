And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all those sums.\n\nSo the input gives me n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output should be the average of all the possible k-day consecutive periods. And the answer needs to be precise up to at least 6 decimal places.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the number of weeks is (n - k + 1). For each of these weeks, I need to compute the sum of the k elements. Then, sum all those sums and divide by the number of weeks.\n\nBut if I do this naively, for each week, adding k elements, that would be O(n*k) time. But since n can be up to 2e5, that would be 2e5 * 2e5 = 4e10 operations, which is way too slow. That's not going to work. So I need a more efficient way.\n\nAh right! Sliding window technique. Let's think about it. The sum of the first window (days 1 to k) can be calculated once. Then, for each next window, subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element that's entering. This way, each step takes O(1) time, leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nYes. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this sum to a total.\n3. Then, for each subsequent window (from position 1 to n - k), subtract the element leaving (a[i-1]) and add the new element (a[i + k - 1]). Add this to the total.\n4. Finally, divide the total by the number of weeks (which is n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the initial sum?\n\nLet me think with an example. For example, the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nThe initial sum is 3+4=7. Then the next window is 4+7=11. Total sum is 7+11=18. Number of weeks is 2. Average is 18/2=9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo yes, the sliding window approach works here.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then read the array.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements. Then, iterate from i=1 to (n -k) times. Wait, how many times do we need to slide? Let's see:\n\nThe number of weeks is (n -k +1). The first window is the initial sum. Then, for each of the remaining (n -k) windows, we do the sliding. So the loop runs (n -k) times.\n\nWait, for example, when n=3 and k=2, the number of weeks is 2. So the initial sum is the first window, then we do 1 more step. Which is (n -k) steps. So yes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\ntotal_sum = 0\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0..k-1])\n\ntotal_sum += current_sum\n\nthen for i in 1 to (n -k):\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\ntotal_sum += current_sum\n\nThen, average = total_sum / (number_of_weeks)\n\nSo the code structure would be something like:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute the initial sum.\n\nThen, compute the total.\n\nThen divide by the number of weeks.\n\nBut what about when k equals n? Then there's only one week. So the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nNow, in Python, summing the first k elements can be done with sum(a[:k]).\n\nBut for large k (like 2e5), sum(a[:k]) would take O(k) time. But since the total time is O(n), that's acceptable. Because even if k is 2e5, the sum is O(k) and the rest is O(n -k) steps. So overall O(n) time.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nOnce the total_sum is computed, the average is total_sum / (number_of_weeks).\n\nNow, the output needs to have enough decimal digits. So in Python, when printing, we can format it to have 10 decimal digits, as in the examples.\n\nBut how to handle the division? Since Python uses floating point numbers, but for very large numbers, perhaps using floating points could have",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as k consecutive days from a list of n recorded sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of each consecutive k-day period using the sliding window technique to ensure optimal performance.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: First, read the integers n (number of days) and k (number of days in a week), followed by the list of sleep times.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use this technique to efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive k-day period. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n).\n3. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the first k elements. Then, iteratively adjust this sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n4. **Average Calculation**: Sum all the window sums and divide by the number of valid weeks (n - k + 1) to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        # Read n and k\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        if num_weeks == 0:\n            print(\"0.0000000000\")\n            continue\n        \n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        \n        for i in range(1, num_weeks):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        \n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \n        # Skip any remaining empty lines if needed\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing. Each test case is handled in a loop to accommodate multiple inputs.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first k elements is computed once, which forms the initial window sum.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, adjust the sum by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This adjustment ensures each sum is computed in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of valid weeks to compute the average, which is then formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation with a time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.",
