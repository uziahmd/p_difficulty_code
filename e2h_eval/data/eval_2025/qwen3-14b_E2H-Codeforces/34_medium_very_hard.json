And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day period, I need to calculate the average and then find the overall average of all those averages.\n\nWait, right. So the problem says that for each of the (n - k + 1) weeks, we take the sum of their sleep times, divide by k, and then take the average of all those values. But wait, the example shows that in the third case, they sum all the weeks' sums and divide by the number of weeks multiplied by k? Or wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe average over all weeks is the sum of all the weekly averages divided by the number of weeks. Wait, no. Because each week's average is (sum of k days)/k. Then the overall average is the average of all those weekly averages. Which would be equal to (sum of all weekly sums) / (number of weeks * k). Because each weekly average is (sum_week)/k. So when you average them, you add all (sum_week/k) and divide by the number of weeks. Which is same as (total_sum_of_all_weekly_sums) / (number_of_weeks * k).\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way to compute this. Because the total sum of all weekly sums is equal to the sum of each day multiplied by the number of weeks that it's included in. For example, the first day is part of the first week, then the second day is part of the first and second weeks, etc. Wait, but for each day, how many weeks does it contribute to?\n\nLet me think. For example, if n=3 and k=2, the weeks are [days 1-2], [days 2-3]. So day 1 is in 1 week, day 2 is in 2 weeks, day 3 is in 1 week. So the total sum of all weekly sums is (a1 + a2) + (a2 + a3) = a1 + 2a2 + a3. Then the average would be (a1 + 2a2 + a3) / (2 * 2) ?\n\nWait, because the number of weeks is (n - k + 1) = 2. So the average of the weekly averages would be [(a1+a2)/2 + (a2+a3)/2 ] / 2 = [ (a1 + 2a2 + a3) ] / (2 * 2) ?\n\nYes. So the total sum of all weekly sums is (sum of a_i multiplied by the number of times they appear in any week). So for each a_i, how many weeks does it contribute to?\n\nThe number of weeks that include a_i is equal to the number of positions where the window starts such that the window includes a_i. Let's think about the position of a_i in the array. Let's say the array is 0-based. For a given i (0-based), the earliest week that includes it is when the window starts at i - (k-1) ... wait, no. Let me think again. For a day at position i (assuming 0-based), the earliest window that includes it is when the window starts at max(0, i - (k-1))? No, perhaps another approach. The window starts at position s, and includes days s, s+1, ..., s + k - 1. So for day i, the possible s's are from s = max(0, i - (k-1))? No, wait. For a day i, the earliest possible start of a window that includes it is s = 0, but only if i is within the first k days. Wait, perhaps the number of windows that include a_i is equal to the number of possible starting positions s such that s ≤ i ≤ s + k - 1. Which can be rewritten as s ≤ i and s ≥ i - (k-1). Also, since s has to be ≥0 and s + k -1 ≤ n-1. So the possible s's are from max(0, i - (k-1)) to min(i, n -k). Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, for each day i (0-based), the number of weeks that include it is min(i + 1, n - k + 1) ? No, perhaps not. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake n=3, k=2. The days are 0,1,2. The windows are [0,1] and [1,2]. For day 0: appears in 1 window. Day 1: appears in 2 windows. Day 2: appears in 1 window. So for day i (0-based), the count is min(i + 1, n - k + 1) ? Well for i=0, min(1, 2) is 1. Correct. For i=1, min(2, 2) is 2. Correct. For i=2, min(3, 2) is 2? No, but day 2 is in 1 window. Hmm, that formula isn't correct.\n\nAnother approach: For each day i (0-based), the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of possible starting positions s such that s ≤ i and s + k - 1 ≥ i. Which simplifies to s ≤ i and s ≥ i - (k-1). Also, s must be ≥ 0 and s ≤ n -k. So the number of valid s is the number of integers in the range [max(0, i - (k-1)), min(n -k, i)] ] plus 1? Because the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo for day i, the count is min(n -k, i) - max(0, i - (k-1)) + 1. Let's test this for the example where n=3, k=2. n-k is 1. For i=0: min(1, 0) is 0. max(0, 0 - 1) is 0. So 0 - 0 + 1 = 1. Correct. For i=1: min(1, 1) is 1. max(0, 1 -1) is 0. So 1 -0 +1 = 2. Correct. For i=2: min(1, 2) is 1. max(0, 2 -1) = 1. So 1 -1 +1 = 1. Correct. So that formula works.\n\nBut calculating this for each day might be computationally intensive if done naively, but with n up to 2e5, we need O(n) time. So perhaps we can compute for each day i, how many times it is counted in the total sum.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently? Let's think of the formula again. For each i, the count is:\n\ncount_i = min(n - k, i) - max(0, i - (k - 1)) + 1\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way to compute this. Let's think about the possible ranges.\n\nThe number of weeks that include day i is equal to the number of windows that start at s where s ranges from s_start to s_end, where s_start is max(0, i - k + 1) and s_end is min(i, n -k). Wait, no. Because the window starts at s, and ends at s + k - 1. For day i to be in the window, we need s <= i <= s + k -1. Which can be rearranged as s <= i and s >= i - (k-1). Also, since s must be >=0 and <= n -k.\n\nSo the number of valid s is the number of integers between s_low and s_high, where s_low = max(0, i - (k-1)) and s_high = min(n -k, i). And the count is s_high - s_low + 1, provided that s_high >= s_low. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut for all i, since the window starts can be from 0 to (n -k). So for each i, the count is the number of windows that include it.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern here. For example, for the first (k-1) days, the count increases by 1 each day. Then for the middle days, the count is (n -k +1) days. Then for the last (k-1) days, the count decreases by 1 each day.\n\nWait, for example, when n is large enough. Let's imagine that n is very large, say n=100, and k=5. Then for each day i, the count is the number of windows that include it. For the first day (i=0), the count is 1 (only the window starting at 0). For i=1, the count is 2 (windows starting at 0 and 1). For i=2, 3 (start at 0, 1, 2). For i=3, 4 (start at 0,1,2,3). For i=4, 5 (start at 0,1,2,3,4). Then for i=5, the count is 5 (start at 0,1,2,3,4) ? No, wait. Because the window starts can be from 0 to n -k. Let's say n is 100, k=5. For i=5, the earliest start is 0 (window starts at 0, ends at 4, which is before i=5. Wait no. Wait, i=5 is included in the window starting at s where s <=5 and s +4 >=5. So s can be as low as 5 -4 = 1 (since s >= i - (k-1) = 5 -4 = 1). So s can be from 1 to min(5, n -k). Since n-k is 95, so min(5, 95) is 5. So s ranges from 1 to 5. That's 5 -1 +1 = 5. So for i=5, the count is 5. Then for i=6, the s ranges from 2 to 6. Which is 5 numbers again. So for days from i= (k-1) to (n -k), the count is (n -k +1) ?\n\nNo, wait. For days where i is between (k-1) and (n -k) ?\n\nWait, for example, when i is such that s_low = i - (k-1) = 0, and s_high = i. But when i is large enough that i - (k-1) is >=0 and s_high = min(n -k, i) = n -k. So for days where i is between (k-1) and (n -k), then s_low = i - (k-1) = s_start, and s_high = n -k. So the count is (n -k) - (i - (k-1)) + 1 = (n -k -i +k -1 +1) = n -i. Wait, maybe not. Let me re-calculate:\n\ns_low = i - (k-1) = i -k +1\n\ns_high = min(n -k, i)\n\nBut for i in the middle region, like when i is between (k-1) and (n -k), then min(n -k, i) = i if i <= n -k. Wait, no. If i is less than n -k, then min(n -k, i) is i. But when i is in the middle, say i is such that i + k <= n? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for days that are in the middle of the array, the count is (n -k +1) ?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Let's take an example where n=5, k=2. So n -k +1 is 4 weeks. The days are 0,1,2,3,4. For each day:\n\nDay 0: included in windows [0,1] → count 1.\n\nDay 1: included in [0,1], [1,2] → count 2.\n\nDay 2: included in [1,2], [2,3] → count 2.\n\nDay 3: included in [2,3], [3,4] → count 2.\n\nDay 4: included in [3,4] → count 1.\n\nSo for days 1, 2, 3, the count is 2. Which is (n -k +1) - (k-1) ? No, n -k +1 is 4. So that's not matching. So the count for these days is 2, which is (n -k +1) - (k-1) - something? Not sure.\n\nBut for this example, the count for days 1, 2, 3 is 2. Which is equal to (n -k +1) - (k-1) - ... no. Let me think of the general case.\n\nThe total number of weeks is m = n -k +1.\n\nFor each day i, the number of weeks that include it is equal to the number of possible starting positions s such that s ≤ i and s +k -1 ≥ i. Which is equivalent to s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. Also, s must be ≥0 and ≤ m-1 (since the maximum s is m-1 = n -k).\n\nSo the count for i is the number of s in [max(0, i -k +1), min(m-1, i)].\n\nSo the length of this interval is min(m-1, i) - max(0, i -k +1) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this for all i efficiently?\n\nWell, for each i, the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nIf i < k-1:\n\nThen i -k +1 is negative, so the lower bound is 0. Upper bound is i. So the count is i - 0 + 1 = i +1.\n\nIf i >=k-1 and i <= m-1 (since m = n -k +1, m-1 = n -k):\n\nThen the lower bound is i -k +1, upper bound is i. The count is i - (i -k +1) +1 = k.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because if i is in the range where the lower bound is i -k +1 and upper bound is i, then the count is k.\n\nBut wait, m-1 is n -k. So for i up to n -k, which is m-1.\n\nWait, if i is in the range from k-1 to n -k, then the count is k.\n\nBut when i is larger than n -k, then the upper bound is min(m-1, i) = m-1 = n -k.\n\nSo for i > n -k:\n\nThe lower bound is i -k +1, upper bound is m-1 = n -k.\n\nThe count is (n -k) - (i -k +1) + 1 = n -k -i +k -1 +1 = n -i.\n\nSo putting it all together, the count for each day i is:\n\nif i < k-1 → i + 1\n\nelif i >=k-1 and i <= n -k → k\n\nelse → n - i\n\nSo this is a much simpler way to compute the count for each day. Let me check with previous examples.\n\nFirst example: n=3, k=2. m = 3-2+1=2. So n -k =1.\n\nFor i=0: <k-1 (which is 1). So count is 0+1=1 → correct.\n\nFor i=1: since k-1 is 1, and i=1 is <=n -k (which is 1). So count is k=2 → correct.\n\nFor i=2: i > n -k (since n -k is 1). So count is n -i = 3 -2 =1 → correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, k=2. m=4, n-k=3.\n\ni=0: count 0+1=1 → correct.\n\ni=1: in the middle range (since k-1 is 1, and i=1 is <=3). So count is 2 → correct.\n\ni=2: same, count is 2.\n\ni=3: same, count is 2.\n\ni=4: n -i =5-4=1 → correct.\n\nAnother example: n=8, k=2. So m=7, n-k=6.\n\nFor i=0: count 1.\n\ni=1: count 2.\n\ni=2: count 2 (since 2 is <=6).\n\ni=3: count 2.\n\ni=4: count 2.\n\ni=5: count 2.\n\ni=6: count 2.\n\ni=7: count 8-7=1.\n\nSo for days 1 to 6, count is 2. Which is k=2. So yes.\n\nSo this seems to work. Therefore, the formula for the count is:\n\ncount_i = \n\nif i < (k-1): i + 1\n\nelif i > (n -k): (n - i)\n\nelse: k\n\nSo now, the total sum of all weekly sums is sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i * count_i.\n\nOnce we compute that, the average is (total_sum) / (m * k), where m is the number of weeks (n -k +1).\n\nBecause each weekly average is sum_week / k, and the average of all those is (sum of all sum_week) / (m *k).\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCalculate the total_sum = sum(a_i * count_i for each i), then divide by (m *k).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n\n2. Read the array a.\n\n3. Compute m = n -k +1.\n\n4. For each element a_i (i from 0 to n-1), compute count_i as per the formula above.\n\n5. Sum all a_i * count_i.\n\n6. Divide by (m *k) to get the average.\n\nThis approach is O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this correctly in Python.\n\nLet's think about the code.\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then the array. Then compute m = n -k +1.\n\nThen for each index i (from 0 to n-1):\n\nCompute count_i.\n\nBut in Python, indices are 0-based, so that's straightforward.\n\nSo, for each i in range(n):\n\nif i < k-1:\n\n    count = i +1\n\nelif i > (n -k):\n\n    count = n -i\n\nelse:\n\n    count =k\n\nThen multiply by a[i], accumulate the sum.\n\nOnce we have the total_sum, the answer is total_sum / (m *k).\n\nBut wait, m is (n -k +1). So the denominator is (n -k +1)*k.\n\nBut let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo n=3, k=2, m=2.\n\nFor i=0: i <1 (k-1=1). count is 0+1=1 → 3*1=3.\n\ni=1: since i=1, n -k is 1. So i is not > (n -k). So count is 2 → 4*2=8.\n\ni=2: i=2 > (n -k)=1 → count=3-2=1 →7*1=7.\n\nTotal sum is 3+8+7=18.\n\nDenominator is m*k= 2*2=4. 18/4 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.000... Wait, what's going on here?\n\nWait wait, the sample input says:\n\nIn the first example, input is 3 2 and [3,4,7]. The output is 9.000... Wait, but according to our calculation, the average is 18/(2*2) = 4.5. Which contradicts the sample. So clearly, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, what's the sample output for the first input? The first input's output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nWait, that suggests that my approach is wrong. What's wrong here?\n\nLet me recheck the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output: 9.000000...\n\nWait, according to the note in the problem statement, the first example's result is (sum of all weeks' averages) divided by the number of weeks. Let's compute manually.\n\nThe weeks are:\n\nWeek 1: days 1 and 2 (assuming 1-based?), or days 0 and 1 (0-based)? Let's check the problem statement.\n\nIn the example given in the problem statement:\n\nInput is n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]. The output is 9.0.\n\nThe note says that the result is the sum of all weeks divided by 7 (but that's for the third example). For the first example, there are 3-2+1=2 weeks. The weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their averages are (3+4)/2=3.5 and (4+7)/2=5.5. The average of these two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 =4.5. But the sample output says 9.0. So that's conflicting. Wait, but according to the sample input given in the problem, the first input is:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', ...]\n\nand output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nWait that can't be. There must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the problem says that the result is (sum of all weeks) divided by ... ?\n\nWait the problem says that the answer is the average of all weeks. So the average of the weekly averages.\n\nBut the example in the problem says that for the input given, the output is 9.0. But according to my manual calculation, it should be 4.5. So clearly, I have made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the example in the problem is not fully shown, but looking at the sample input and outputs provided in the problem:\n\nIn the first input line, the sample input is 3 2 followed by 3 4 7. The output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nBut according to the manual calculation, the average of the two weekly averages is 4.5. So why is the sample output 9?\n\nAh! Oh wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nPolycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n -k +1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k=2, n=3 and a = [3,4,7], then the result is ... \n\nWait the problem says that the result is (sum of all weeks divided by something). But what is the correct calculation here?\n\nThe problem says that the output is the average sleeping time over all weeks. The average of the weekly averages.\n\nBut the sample output for this case is 9.0. So let's think again.\n\nWait, what's the sum of the weekly averages? For the two weeks:\n\nWeek 1: 3+4 =7. Average is 3.5.\n\nWeek 2:4+7=11. Average is 5.5.\n\nAverage of these is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. Which is 4.5, but the sample output is 9.0. This suggests that perhaps the problem requires the average of the sum of the weeks, not the average of the averages.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"the average sleep time over all weeks.\"\n\nWhich could mean that the average is the total sum of all the weekly sums divided by the number of weeks. Which would be (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 =9. Which matches the sample output. Oh! So the problem is not asking for the average of the weekly averages, but the average of the total sleep time per week. Which is the sum of all the weekly sums divided by the number of weeks. Which is different from the average of the weekly averages. \n\nWait this is a critical misunderstanding. So the problem says that the average sleep time over all weeks is the average of the sum of the weeks. For example, the first example's output is 9.0, which is (7+11)/2 = 9.0. \n\nBut the problem's note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which would align with this. \n\nSo the original problem is not to take the average of the averages, but the average of the sum of the weeks. Which is the sum of all weekly sums divided by the number of weeks.\n\nSo the initial approach was wrong. Oh no! So my entire reasoning was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. \n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the sum of all weekly sums, then divide by the number of weeks. \n\nSo the average sleep time per week is (sum of all weekly sums) / (number of weeks). \n\nIn that case, for the first sample, the sum of weekly sums is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 weeks gives 9. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo this changes everything. \n\nSo the problem is to compute the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages. \n\nSo the correct formula is (sum of all weekly sums) / (number of weeks). \n\nBut how to compute the sum of all weekly sums?\n\nEarlier, I thought that the sum of all weekly sums is sum (a_i * count_i), which is correct. Because each a_i contributes to count_i weeks. So the sum of all weekly sums is exactly sum (a_i * count_i). \n\nSo for the first sample, sum (a_i * count_i) is 3 * 1 + 4 * 2 + 7 * 1 = 3 + 8 +7 = 18. Number of weeks is 2. 18 / 2 = 9, which matches the sample. \n\nSo the previous approach was correct, except that the final division is by m (number of weeks), not by m *k. \n\nSo the correct formula is total_sum / m, where m is the number of weeks. \n\nSo the mistake was in the previous reasoning, thinking that the average was of the weekly averages, but the problem asks for the average of the weekly sums. \n\nSo the correct steps are:\n\nCalculate the total_sum as sum (a_i * count_i), then divide by m (the number of weeks), which is n -k +1.\n\nSo the denominator is m, not m*k. \n\nThat explains the sample. \n\nSo for the first example, the sum is 18, divided by 2 →9. Correct.\n\nSo the code needs to compute total_sum / m, not divided by m *k. \n\nSo the previous approach was almost correct, but the denominator was wrong. \n\nSo the correct steps are:\n\nCompute total_sum = sum (a_i * count_i) for each i.\n\nThen the answer is total_sum / m, where m is the number of weeks (n -k +1).\n\nThis changes the calculation. \n\nSo for the third example in the sample input:\n\nInput is 8 2, and array [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1].\n\nn=8, k=2. m=8-2+1=7 weeks.\n\nEach week is 2 days. The sum of all weekly sums is sum of each pair. \n\nBut according to the count_i method:\n\nFor each i:\n\ncount_i is:\n\nfor i < 1 (k-1=1) → i+1.\n\ni=0: count is 1.\n\ni=1: since i is >=k-1 (1) and i <=n-k=8-2=6 → count is 2.\n\ni=2: count is 2.\n\ni=3: count is 2.\n\ni=4: count is 2.\n\ni=5: count is 2.\n\ni=6: count is 2.\n\ni=7: i> n-k=6 → count is 8-7=1.\n\nSo sum is:\n\na[0] *1 + a[1]*2 + a[2]*2 + a[3]*2 + a[4]*2 + a[5]*2 + a[6]*2 + a[7]*1.\n\nWhich equals:\n\n1*1 + 2*2 +4*2 + 100000*2 + 123*2 + 456*2 +789*2 + 1*1 \n\n= 1 +4 +8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1 \n\n= Let's compute:\n\n1+4=5; +8=13; +200000=200013; +246=200259; +912=201171; +1578=202749; +1=202750.\n\nThen divide by m=7 → 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the third sample output of 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the formula is correct. \n\nThus, the code needs to calculate total_sum = sum (a_i * count_i) and divide by m = n -k +1.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead list a.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nCompute total_sum as sum of a[i] * count_i for each i.\n\nOutput total_sum / m with sufficient decimal digits.\n\nSo the code in Python:\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, read the inputs. But the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input given in the problem:\n\nThe input is given as a list of inputs, like:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut the problem says that the program should read input from stdin. So the actual input is multiple lines. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. So for example, the first line is n and k, then the second line is the array.\n\nBut looking at the sample input provided in the problem, it seems that the user is providing multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the program should read input from standard input and output the desired outputs. However, the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases, but the problem's input description says that the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers. So perhaps the sample input provided in the problem is a list of test cases, but the actual program is supposed to handle one test case per run. \n\nWait, the original problem's input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the program should process one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But perhaps that's just an example of multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case. Or perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are given. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, etc. So it's possible that the sample input is written in a way that the user provides multiple test cases, but the actual code should process each test case individually.\n\nBut the problem says that the user should write a Python script that reads input from stdin and prints the desired outputs. For example, the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample outputs show three outputs. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of test cases. However, in practice, for competitive programming problems, the input is usually one test case per run, but sometimes multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says nothing about multiple test cases. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is described as:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1...an.\n\nSo this implies that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the sample input is formatted in a way that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. For example, the input may consist of multiple test cases, each with their own lines. But the problem's original input description may be ambiguous. \n\nBut looking at the sample input and output given in the problem:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three outputs. So the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, etc. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. This suggests that perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, and the code should process them all.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in the sample input, the first line is '3 2\\n3 4 7', which represents the first test case. Then the next line is '1 1\\n10', which is the second test case. Then '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1' is the third test case.\n\nSo the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the problem's original statement, perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects only one. However, the user's task is to write a program that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout, which may be multiple test cases. \n\nBut in the problem's input description, the first line is for one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: first line with n and k, second line with the array.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done with input() or sys.stdin. So for multiple test cases, the code should read until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle this? For example, in the sample input, the input is given as three separate test cases. So the code should read each test case, process it, and output the result.\n\nSo the code should read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut how to read the input correctly? For example, each test case consists of two lines. So the code can read lines in pairs.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition problems, sometimes the input is a single test case, but sometimes multiple. However, given the sample input, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description may not mention this. However, the sample input and output indicate that multiple test cases are present. \n\nBut the problem's original description says that the input is as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers.\n\nSo it's possible that the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects only one. However, the sample output shows three outputs, which suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. \n\nBut the problem's original statement may have been translated incorrectly. However, given the sample input and output, it's necessary to assume that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines at once,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of `k` days from a given list of `n` days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for all possible weeks and then determining the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each week of `k` consecutive days, we need to compute the sum of sleep times. The goal is to find the average of these sums across all possible weeks.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each week individually, which would be inefficient, we can use a mathematical approach to determine how many times each day contributes to the total sum of all weeks.\n3. **Contribution Count**: Each day at position `i` contributes to multiple weeks. Specifically:\n   - For days at the beginning of the list (less than `k-1`), the contribution count increases linearly.\n   - For days in the middle of the list, the contribution count remains constant at `k`.\n   - For days towards the end of the list (greater than `n-k`), the contribution count decreases linearly.\n4. **Summing Contributions**: Multiply each day's sleep time by its contribution count and sum these values to get the total sum of all weekly sums.\n5. **Average Calculation**: Divide the total sum by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`) to get the desired average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n        idx += n\n        \n        m = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0.0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            if i < k - 1:\n                count = i + 1\n            elif i > n - k:\n                count = n - i\n            else:\n                count = k\n            total_sum += a[i] * count\n        \n        average = total_sum / m\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into a list for easier processing. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n- **Contribution Calculation**: For each day, based on its position in the list, we determine how many weeks it contributes to. This count is used to multiply the day's sleep time.\n- **Total Sum Calculation**: Summing up the contributions of all days gives the total sum of all weekly sums.\n- **Average Calculation**: The total sum is divided by the number of weeks to get the average sleep time, which is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values using linear time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints.",
