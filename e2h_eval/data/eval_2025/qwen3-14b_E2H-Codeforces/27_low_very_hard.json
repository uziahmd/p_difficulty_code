On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing any subarray [l, r] in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) looks like. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be thought of as the count of 1s followed by the count of 2s. But when we reverse a subarray, it might change the arrangement of 1s and 2s in a way that allows for a longer sequence.\n\nLet me think about the original array. The maximum possible LNDS without any reversal would be the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s (if they are all non-decreasing), but since the array may not be sorted, the original LNDS could be less. However, by reversing a subarray, we can potentially increase this value.\n\nThe key insight here is that reversing a subarray can help us fix some transitions between 1s and 2s. For example, if there's a part of the array where 2s come before 1s, reversing that part would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which is better for the LNDS.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about all possible subarrays to reverse and compute the maximum LNDS. However, trying all possible subarrays would be O(n^2) possibilities, and for each possibility, computing the LNDS would take O(n) time. That's O(n^3) time, which for n=2000 is 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the optimal reversal. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, perhaps the best way to maximize the LNDS is to have as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible. Reversing a subarray that has a dip (like 2 followed by 1) could help merge those regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem by considering how reversing a subarray affects the counts of 1s and 2s in the sequence. Wait, but reversing a subarray doesn't change the total count of 1s and 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements if the entire array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the sum of the number of 1s and the number of 2s, but arranged in a non-decreasing order. However, since the original array may have some 2s followed by 1s, reversing those parts can help.\n\nBut how can we find the best reversal?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the original array's structure. The LNDS is determined by the number of 1s and 2s and how they are arranged. For example, if the original array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). But reversing positions 2-3 gives [1,1,2,2], which gives LNDS of 4.\n\nSo the idea is that the best possible scenario is when the entire array is non-decreasing. If that's possible, then the answer is n. Otherwise, the answer is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1. Because each such transition reduces the LNDS by one. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: For the original array, the LNDS is equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Because each such occurrence is a break in the non-decreasing sequence. For example, if you have a sequence of 1s and 2s with k transitions from 2 to 1, then the maximum LNDS is (number of 1s) + (number of 2s) - k. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of an example. \n\nTake the first example: [1,2,1,2]. The transitions from 2 to 1 occur once (between index 2 and 3). The total number of 1s is 2, 2s is 2. The LNDS is 3. But according to the formula, 2+2 -1 =3. Which matches. If we reverse the subarray [2,3], making [1,1,2,2], then there are zero transitions from 2 to 1, so the LNDS is 4. Which is 2+2 -0=4. So that seems",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help eliminate transitions from 2 to 1, which are problematic for maintaining a non-decreasing sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Transitions**: Identify the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original sequence. Each such transition reduces the potential length of the LNDS.\n2. **Optimize Reversals**: By reversing a subarray that contains these transitions, we can potentially eliminate some of these transitions. The optimal reversal would be one that maximizes the reduction of these transitions.\n3. **Calculate Maximum LNDS**: The maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements minus the minimum number of transitions from 2 to 1 that can be eliminated through an optimal reversal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Count the number of 2->1 transitions in the original array\n    transitions = 0\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if a[i] == 2 and a[i + 1] == 1:\n            transitions += 1\n    \n    # The maximum possible LNDS is total elements minus the number of transitions\n    # But we can reduce transitions by at most 1 by reversing a subarray that contains a 2->1 transition\n    # So the maximum possible is n - max(0, transitions - 1)\n    # However, if transitions is 0, then it's already n\n    max_lnds = n - max(0, transitions - 1)\n    print(max_lnds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the sequence length `n` and the sequence `a`.\n2. **Counting Transitions**: We iterate through the sequence to count how many times a 2 is immediately followed by a 1. These transitions are problematic for the LNDS.\n3. **Adjusting for Optimal Reversal**: The maximum possible LNDS is calculated by subtracting the number of transitions from the total number of elements. However, by reversing a subarray that contains a 2->1 transition, we can reduce the number of such transitions by at most 1, hence the adjustment in the formula.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal result in linear time, ensuring it handles the constraints effectively.",
