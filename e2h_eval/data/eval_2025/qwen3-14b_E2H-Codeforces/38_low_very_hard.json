    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the task is to find two things for a given p: the minimum number of nodes needed in a directed graph that is p-reachable, and then among all such graphs with that minimal node count, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly p-reachable means. The definition says that a directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Wait, but reachability here is mutual? Because if u and v are reachable from each other, then they are in a strongly connected component (SCC). So for each pair of nodes in an SCC, if u < v, they contribute to the count. But since the problem counts ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v, the total for a single SCC of size k is C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2. Because for each pair of nodes in the SCC, both directions are reachable, but since u < v, we only count one per unordered pair.\n\nSo the problem is about constructing a graph where the sum over all SCCs of C(size_of_SCC, 2) equals exactly p. And we need to find the minimal number of nodes possible for that sum, and then maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (which are pairs (u, v) where u can reach v but not vice versa, and u != v).\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The first part is to find the minimal number of nodes n such that there exists some way to partition the nodes into SCCs whose sizes' combinations add up to exactly p. Then, for that minimal n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo the key idea for the first part is to find the minimal n where the sum of C(k_i, 2) for each SCC size k_i equals p. But how to choose the sizes of the SCCs to minimize the total number of nodes?\n\nLet me think: For a given p, the minimal number of nodes would be achieved by using as large as possible components, since larger components contribute more to the sum with fewer nodes. For example, if p is 3, then a component of size 3 contributes C(3, 2) = 3. So that's exactly p, so n is 3. Which matches the first example in the problem statement.\n\nBut for other values, say p=4. Let's see. What's the minimal n? Let's think:\n\nOption 1: One component of size 3 (sum 3) and another component of size 2 (sum 1). Total sum is 3+1=4. Total nodes is 3+2=5. Or maybe a component of size 4 would have C(4,2)=6 which is more than 4. So not allowed. Alternatively, two components of size 2 (each contributes 1) and one component of size 2 (but that would be 3 components of size 2, sum 3*1=3 <4). Not enough. So the best is 3+1=4. So total nodes is 3+2=5. Which matches the second example's input where p=4 gives output 5 and something else.\n\nWait the sample input for p=4 gives output '5 6'. So the first part is correct.\n\nSo the approach for the first part is to find the minimal n such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) across all SCCs is exactly p. To do this, we need to select a set of integers (the sizes of the SCCs) such that their C(k_i, 2) sum to p, and the sum of the k_i's is minimized.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where we want to represent p as a sum of terms of the form C(k, 2), using as few terms as possible, but also choosing the terms in a way that the sum of the k's is minimized. Wait, no. Because for a given sum of C(k_i, 2) = p, the minimal sum of k_i's is achieved by using as large as possible k_i's. Because C(k, 2) increases quadratically with k, but the sum of k_i's increases linearly. So for example, for p=4, using a component of size 3 (C(3,2)=3) and a component of size 2 (C(2,2)=1) gives sum of 3+2=5 nodes. Alternatively, if you use four components of size 2 (each contributing 1), that's 4*2=8 nodes. Which is worse. So the strategy is to take the largest possible components first.\n\nSo the approach for finding the minimal number of nodes is to find the minimal",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to construct a directed graph that is p-reachable, and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachability**: A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and both u and v are mutually reachable. This mutual reachability implies they belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC).\n\n2. **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we should maximize the size of SCCs. The number of ordered pairs in an SCC of size `k` is given by the combination formula C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2. We use this to decompose `p` into sums of these values, choosing the largest possible components first.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once we have the minimal number of nodes, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs. This involves arranging the graph such that as many pairs as possible are one-way reachable while maintaining the required mutual reachability pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    # Find minimal number of nodes\n    nodes = 0\n    remaining_p = p\n    scc_sizes = []\n    \n    # Find the largest possible components\n    k = 2\n    while remaining_p > 0:\n        max_possible = k * (k - 1) // 2\n        if max_possible <= remaining_p:\n            scc_sizes.append(k)\n            remaining_p -= max_possible\n            k += 1\n        else:\n            k += 1\n    \n    # Now, adjust for any remaining p\n    # We might have overstepped, so check from the end\n    # Let's recalculate the scc sizes correctly\n    scc_sizes = []\n    remaining_p = p\n    k = 2\n    while remaining_p > 0:\n        max_k = 0\n        for k_candidate in range(2, 100000):\n            val = k_candidate * (k_candidate - 1) // 2\n            if val <= remaining_p:\n                max_k = k_candidate\n            else:\n                break\n        if max_k == 0:\n            # Need to find the smallest k where C(k, 2) <= remaining_p\n            # Binary search\n            low = 2\n            high = 100000\n            best = 2\n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low + high) // 2\n                val = mid * (mid - 1) // 2\n                if val <= remaining_p:\n                    best = mid\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n            max_k = best\n        scc_sizes.append(max_k)\n        remaining_p -= max_k * (max_k - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Now compute the total nodes\n    n = sum(scc_sizes)\n    \n    # Now compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs\n    # The unidirectional pairs come from between different SCCs.\n    # Each pair of SCCs contributes (size_a * size_b) * 2 (since each direction is possible)\n    # But wait, no.
