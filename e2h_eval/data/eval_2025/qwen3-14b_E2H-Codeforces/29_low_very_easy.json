Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The main challenge is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If I try to process each substitution naively by replacing all occurrences in the string each time, that would be O(n * m) where m is the length of the string, which might be too slow for large inputs. Because for each query, replacing every occurrence of a digit could take O(len(s)) time, and with n queries, it's O(n * len(s)), which could be up to 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a certain digit with another string. But substitutions are applied in order. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', and then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's would become '00' and then each '0' becomes '1', leading to '11'.\n\nBut if I process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe I can track how each digit is transformed. Wait, but the substitutions are applied in the order given. So the first query is applied first, then the next, etc. So the substitutions are cumulative. So the problem is that when a substitution is done, it affects all subsequent substitutions. For example, if I have a substitution for '2' and later a substitution for '0', then the first substitution would replace '2's with some string that may contain '0's, which would then be replaced in the next query.\n\nBut if I model this as a mapping from each digit to its replacement, but considering that once a substitution is done, any future substitutions affect the replacement strings. However, if I process substitutions in reverse order, perhaps I can compute for each digit what it would eventually become. Wait, no. Because substitutions are applied in order. For example, if I have two substitutions: first replace 'a' with 'b', then replace 'b' with 'c'. Then the original 'a's would be replaced with 'b's, which are then replaced with 'c's. So the final result for 'a' is 'c'.\n\nSo the key idea here is that each substitution modifies the replacement rules. Therefore, if we can track for each digit, what is the current replacement string, considering all previous substitutions. But if we process the substitutions in order, and for each substitution, we can update the replacement mappings accordingly.\n\nBut how can we represent this? Let's think of each digit as having a replacement string. Initially, each digit's replacement is itself. But when a substitution is applied, say, replace 'd' with 't', then for any occurrence of 'd' in the current string, it's replaced with 't'. But if 't' contains digits that have their own replacements, those will be handled in subsequent substitutions.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when you perform a substitution, you replace all instances of di in the current string with ti. So the order of processing substitutions is crucial. For example, if you first replace '2' with '3', then replace '3' with '4', then the original '2's would be replaced with '3's, which then become '4's. However, if you first replace '3' with '4', then replace '2' with '3', then the original '2's would be replaced with '3's, which are not replaced again (since the second substitution is for '2's, not '3's). So the order of substitutions is important.\n\nBut directly simulating this would be expensive. Because each substitution requires scanning the entire string and replacing all instances of a particular digit. For example, if the initial string is 1e5 characters and there are 1e5 substitutions, this approach would be O(1e10) time.\n\nSo, we need a way to represent the substitutions in a way that allows us to compute the final string efficiently. Let's think about the following approach:\n\nInstead of modifying the string directly, we can track for each digit, what it would be replaced with after all substitutions. However, since substitutions can override each other, we need to process them in the correct order.\n\nLet me think of this as a tree or a mapping. Suppose we have a mapping for each digit, which tells us what string it should be replaced with. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a substitution comes in, say, d → t, we need to update the mapping for d. But the problem is that when we process a substitution, any existing instances of d in the current string are replaced with t. However, t can contain digits",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly simulating each substitution step by step is inefficient for large input sizes. Instead, we can use a dynamic mapping approach to track the transformations of each digit through all substitutions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Mapping**: Maintain a dictionary where each key is a digit (from '0' to '9') and the value is the string it maps to after considering all substitutions up to that point.\n2. **Reverse Processing**: Process substitutions in reverse order. This allows us to build the final transformation for each digit based on subsequent substitutions, ensuring we correctly propagate replacements.\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Use modular arithmetic to keep the numbers manageable and avoid overflow issues when computing the final result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize mapping: each digit maps to itself\n    mapping = {str(d): str(d) for d in range(10)}\n    \n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1]\n        # Update mapping[d] to be t, but with current mappings applied\n        # We need to replace any digits in t with their current mappings\n        # Wait, no.
