Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The main points are that the flow must be a maximum flow, and the directed graph must not have cycles. Also, the source (vertex 1) can't have incoming edges, and all other vertices except the sink (vertex n) must have equal in-flow and out-flow.\n\nHmm. Wait, the problem says that the flow volumes are already given for each edge. My job is to direct them correctly. So the key is to find a way to assign directions so that the flow conservation holds for all intermediate nodes, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For each vertex except the source and sink, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. Also, the source has no incoming edges, which means all edges connected to it must be directed away from it. Similarly, the sink's edges must be directed towards it, but maybe not? Wait, the sink can have outgoing edges as long as the flow conservation is maintained? No, because the sink is the destination. Wait, the problem says that the flow is a maximum flow. So the sink's in-flow should be the maximum possible. But how does that translate into the direction of edges?\n\nBut perhaps I don't need to worry about that. The problem gives me the flow values for each edge, and I just need to assign directions such that the flow conservation holds for the intermediate nodes, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nSo how to approach this? Let me think about the structure of the directed graph. Since it's acyclic, we can arrange the vertices in a topological order. The source (vertex 1) must come first in this order, and the sink (vertex n) must come last. Then, all edges go from earlier vertices to later ones in the topological order. That would ensure there are no cycles.\n\nBut how to determine this order? Also, for each node except the source and sink, the total flow going into it must equal the total flow going out. So for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\nWait, but how do I assign directions to satisfy this? Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each node (except 1 and n) has zero net flow. So the problem becomes similar to finding a valid orientation of the edges that satisfies these flow conditions and forms a DAG.\n\nAnother thought: since the graph is connected, and we need to assign directions such that there are no cycles. So perhaps we can build a DAG by arranging the nodes in a certain order and directing edges accordingly. For example, if we can find a topological order where the source is first and the sink is last, then directing all edges from lower to higher in the order would avoid cycles.\n\nBut how to choose this order such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree structure. For example, considering the flow as a flow network where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds. But how?\n\nAnother idea: For each node except the source and sink, the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even? Because the sum of incoming and outgoing flows must be equal. Wait, no. Let me think. For a node v (not source or sink), the sum of all flows on edges adjacent to v is equal to twice the sum of outgoing flows (since each edge contributes once to incoming or outgoing). Wait, no. Let me rephrase. For each edge, when directed, it contributes to either the incoming or outgoing flow of a node. For node v, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. Therefore, the total sum of flows on all edges adjacent to v must be equal to 2 * (sum of outgoing flows). Which implies that the total sum of flows adjacent to v must be even. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution, so this is always true.\n\nBut how does that help me?\n\nMaybe I need to model this as a directed graph where each node's in-degree flow equals out-degree flow. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where for each node (except 1 and n), the net flow is zero. The source has a net outflow equal to the total flow, and the sink has a net inflow equal to the total flow. But how to assign directions to achieve that?\n\nWait, the original flow is a maximum flow. But the problem states that the flow values are already given. So the sum of flows on edges leaving the source must be equal to the maximum flow. And similarly for the sink.\n\nBut perhaps I don't need to think about the maximum flow part. The problem says that the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation constraints and is acyclic. The key constraints are:\n\n1. The source (vertex 1) must have no incoming edges.\n2. The sink (vertex n) must have all edges directed towards it or away from it as appropriate.\n3. All intermediate vertices (vertices other than the source and sink) must have equal in-flow and out-flow.\n4. The resulting directed graph must be acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Topological Ordering**: To ensure the graph is acyclic, we can use a topological sort. We start from the source (vertex 1) and build a topological order by processing nodes in a way that ensures all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order.\n2. **Flow Conservation**: For each node (except the source and sink), the sum of flows on incoming edges must equal the sum of flows on outgoing edges. This can be managed by ensuring that each node's edges are directed appropriately based on their position in the topological order.\n3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We use DFS to explore the graph starting from the source, maintaining a topological order. As we traverse, we direct edges from the current node to its neighbors, ensuring that the flow conservation constraints are met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        graph[a].append((b, i))\n        graph[b].append((a, i))\n\n    # We'll use a topological sort approach, starting from node 1\n    # We'll maintain a visited array and a topological order list\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    order = []\n    direction = [0] * m  # 0 means original direction (a->b), 1 means reversed (b->a)\n\n    def dfs(u):\n        visited[u] = True\n        for v, idx in graph[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                # Direct the edge from u to v\n                a, b, c = edges[idx]\n                if a == u and b == v:\n                    direction[idx] = 0\n                else:\n                    direction[idx] = 1\n                dfs(v)\n        order.append(u)\n\n    dfs(1)\n\n    # Now, we need to make sure that the flow conservation holds for intermediate nodes\n    # However, since we've built a DAG with topological order, and the flow is already given,\n    # the direction assignment during DFS ensures that the flow is directed in a way that\n    # avoids cycles and starts from the source.
