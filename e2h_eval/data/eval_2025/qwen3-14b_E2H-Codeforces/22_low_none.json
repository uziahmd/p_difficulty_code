After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character represents a mark. So, the input is like a 2D array. For example, in the first sample input, it's 3 students and 3 subjects. The marks are:\n\nStudent 1: 2, 2, 3\nStudent 2: 2, 3, 2\nStudent 3: 1, 1, 2\n\nFor each subject (columns), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if in any of the columns (subjects) their mark is equal to the maximum of that column. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the next n lines as a list of strings. Then convert each string into a list of integers. So, for each row, we can process each character as an integer.\n3. For each subject (column), find the maximum value. So for column 0, check all rows' first element, find the max. Do this for all columns.\n4. Then, for each student, check each of their marks. If any of their marks in a column is equal to the maximum of that column, then they are successful. So, we can count them once if they have at least one such occurrence.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet me think about the data structure. Let's say we have a 2D list called grades. Each row is a student, each column is a subject.\n\nThen, for each column j in 0 to m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max(grades[i][j] for i in 0..n-1)\n\nOnce we have max_marks for each column, then for each student i, check if any of their grades in column j equals max_marks[j]. If yes, then count that student as successful.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the input into a 2D list of integers.\n- Compute the maximum for each column.\n- For each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max of that column. If yes, increment the count.\n\nEdge cases: What if all students have the same marks in all subjects? Then each student is successful if they have the max in any subject. For example, if all are 5, then all are successful because for each subject, all students are best. Wait, but according to the problem statement, being the best is when there's no student with higher. So if all have same marks, then all are best in all subjects. So each student would be successful. But in that case, the count would be n.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1. Then the single student is successful because they are the best in all subjects.\n\nAnother case: m=1. So all students have one subject. The max is the highest among them. All students who have that max are successful. So if two students have 9, then both are successful.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string of m digits. Convert each to a list of integers. So for example, the first input line '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112' becomes:\n\ngrades = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\nThen compute for each column the max. For columns 0, 1, 2:\n\ncolumn 0: 2,2,1 → max is 2\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max is 3\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max is 3\n\nSo the max_marks array is [2,3,3].\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]. Check each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So this student is successful.\n\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]. column 1: 3 == 3 → yes.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]. None of the columns have max. For column 0, 1 < 2. column1: 1 <3. column2: 2 <3. So not successful. So total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- For each column,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook which is an n x m matrix of integers.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column in the matrix), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as integers for n and m, followed by reading each line of the gradebook and converting it into a list of integers.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark achieved in that subject. This is stored in the `max_marks` array.\n3. **Checking Success**: For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If so, they are counted as successful. This is done using a nested loop where the inner loop checks each subject for the student.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum marks for each subject, resulting in an optimal solution with time complexity O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
