The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nFrom the problem description, the snowflake is built as follows:\n\n1. Start with one vertex.\n2. Connect it to k new vertices (k > 1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices.\n3. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (i.e., the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. \n\nWait, so the process is iterative. Let me think about the structure. Each time we add layers. Let's model the growth of the snowflake.\n\nLet me think of it as layers. The initial vertex is layer 0. Then, layer 1 consists of the k children of the root. Then, each of those nodes in layer 1 must have k children added. But since they are leaves, they get connected to k new nodes. So each time we add a new layer, but each node in the previous layer adds k new nodes.\n\nBut how does this affect the total number of vertices?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's model the number of vertices after m steps.\n\nLet me consider that the construction process has a certain number of steps. Let's say the first step is adding the initial k nodes. Then, each subsequent step adds more layers. For example:\n\n- Step 0: 1 node (root)\n- Step 1: Add k nodes connected to root. Total: 1 + k.\n- Step 2: Each of the k nodes from step 1 gets k new nodes. So adding k * k nodes. Total becomes 1 + k + k².\n- Step 3: Each of the k² nodes from step 2 gets k new nodes. Adding k³. Total: 1 + k + k² + k³.\n- And so on.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the process must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step (adding the first k nodes) is required. Then, the step of adding more layers (each leaf node getting k new nodes) must be done at least once. Wait, the problem says that after the initial step (the first addition), the step of adding new nodes to each leaf must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have two steps: initial step (adding k nodes) and then adding another layer (so that each of those k nodes adds k nodes). So the total would be 1 + k + k^2. For example, when k=4, the minimal snowflake would be 1 +4+16=21? But the example given in the problem says that the minimal for k=4 is shown in the figure. However, the sample input includes n=6 which outputs NO. Let me check the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFor example, the input 6 gives output NO. Let's think why. Let's see possible values of n for some k.\n\nLet me think about possible n values. The snowflake can be constructed in different ways, depending on the number of steps and the value of k.\n\nSo the total number of vertices is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of steps after the initial step. Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nThe initial step (step 1) adds k nodes. Then, each step after that adds a new layer. Let me think of the number of layers. Suppose that the snowflake is built with m layers. Let me clarify:\n\nThe initial vertex is layer 0. Then, step 1 adds layer 1 (k nodes). Then step 2 adds layer 2 (k^2 nodes). Then step 3 adds layer 3 (k^3 nodes), etc. But according to the problem's rules, after the initial step (which creates layer 1), the step of adding new nodes to each leaf must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two layers: layer 0 (1), layer 1 (k), and layer 2 (k^2). So total nodes is 1 + k + k^2. However, maybe the steps can be done multiple times. So for example, if there are m layers, then the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i. But wait, the initial step is adding k nodes (layer 1). Then, the next steps are adding layers 2, 3, etc. However, the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But for the snowflake to be valid, the number of layers must be at",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined in the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific way with layers, where each layer adds more vertices based on a parameter `k > 1`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex (root). Then, it adds `k` new vertices connected to the root. Each subsequent layer adds `k` new vertices for every vertex in the previous layer that has only one connection (i.e., leaves). This process must be done at least once after the initial step.\n2. **Formulating the Problem**: The total number of vertices in such a graph can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`, where `m` is the number of layers after the initial step. This sum can be written as `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each test case, we check all possible values of `k` starting from 2 up to a reasonable limit. For each `k`, we check if there exists an integer `m` such that the sum of the geometric series equals the given `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Check for k >= 2 and possible m >= 1 (since the second step must be done at least once)\n    # So the minimal structure is 1 + k + k^2\n    # So for k=2, minimal is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n    # So for n < 7, return no except n=1 which is handled\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2  # since k^2 <= n => k <= sqrt(n)\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        # We need to find m such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n\n        # Which is (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1) = n\n        # Try different m\n        # Also, note that the minimal m is 1 (so sum is 1 + k + k^2)\n        # So let's check for m >= 1\n        # We can compute the sum incrementally until it exceeds n\n        total = 1  # start with the root\n        m = 0\n        while True:\n            next_term = k ** (m + 1)\n            if total + next_term > n:\n                break\n            total += next_term\n            m += 1\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n    # Also check if n can be expressed as 1 + k, but since the second step must be done at least once, that's not allowed\n    # So for example, n=2 (1+1) is invalid, n=3 (1+2) is invalid, etc.\n    # But also check for cases where m=0?
