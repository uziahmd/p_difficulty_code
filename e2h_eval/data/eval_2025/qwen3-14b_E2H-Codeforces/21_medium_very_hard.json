The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Neko wants to open as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nFirst, I should think about the parity of the numbers. Because adding two numbers gives an odd sum if one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with a_i, if it's even, then the key must be odd. If the chest is odd, the key must be even. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, for the keys, count how many are even and how many are odd. \n\nWait, right. Because each even chest needs an odd key. Each odd chest needs an even key. \n\nBut since each key can be used only once, and each chest can be opened once, the maximum number of chests is determined by the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, yes! Because for even chests, we can pair them with odd keys. But each key can be used once. So the maximum possible for that part is min(number of even chests, number of odd keys). Similarly for the odd chests and even keys. \n\nSo the total is the sum of those two minima. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nLet me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's see their parities:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys = 1 (7), even_keys = 3 (others). \n\nSo min(3, 1) is 1 (for even chests paired with odd keys). Then min(2, 3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example input: chests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0. So min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. The other part is min(0, 4) is 0. Total 0, which matches.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Count the number of even and odd in a_i.\n- Count the number of even and odd in b_j.\n- Compute min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list a, then list b.\n\nCount even_a = number of elements in a where x % 2 == 0.\n\nodd_a = n - even_a.\n\nSimilarly for even_b and odd_b.\n\nThen answer is min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, considering edge cases. For example, when there are zero even or odd in either a or b.\n\nLike, if all chests are even and all keys are even. Then the answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: when there are more even chests than odd keys. So the min is the number of odd keys. And so on.\n\nThis logic should handle all cases.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read a list, then b list.\n\nCompute even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nans = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes. Let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_a is 3 (14,6,2). odd_a is 2.\n\nb is [8,4,7,20]. even_b is 3 (8,4,20), odd_b is 1.\n\nmin(3,1) is 1, min(2,3) is 2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: n=5, m=1. a is all even. even_a=5. b is [5], which is odd. odd_b=1. even_b=0. So min(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0. Total 1.\n\nThird sample: n=1, m=4. a is [10] even. even_a=1. b is all even. even_b=4, odd_b=0. So min(1,0) is 0. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2. a = [1,3], b = [2,4]. even_a is 0, odd_a=2. even_b=2, odd_b=0. So min(0,0) is 0, min(2,2) is 2. Total 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a has 2 even, 3 odd. b has 1 even, 4 odd. So even_a=2, odd_a=3. even_b=1, odd_b=4. min(2,4) is 2. min(3,1) is 1. Total 3.\n\nYes. So the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead input from stdin. The input is given as multiple lines. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So in Python, read the first line as n, m. Then the next line as a list of integers, then the third line as a list of integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n, m from input().split()\n\nThen read a list via list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nSame for b.\n\nThen compute even_a, etc.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nans = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes. That's the code. It's straightforward and efficient, since it's O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for n and m up to 1e5.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20 → even_a is 3, odd_a 2. even_b is 3 (8,4,20), odd_b is 1 (7). So ans is min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10 → even_a=5. odd_a=0.\n\nb is [5], even_b=0, odd_b=1. So min(5,1) + min(0,0) → 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n1 4\n\n10 → even_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\nb is 20,30,40,50 → all even. even_b=4, odd_b=0. So min(1,0) + min(0,4) → 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys, where each chest can be opened if the sum of the chest's number and the key's number is odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Parity Condition**: A chest with an even number can only be opened by a key with an odd number, and vice versa. This is because the sum of an even and an odd number is always odd.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: We count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers. Similarly, we count how many keys have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n3. **Maximize Pairings**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the number of even chests and odd keys, plus the minimum of the number of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nresult = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains the number of chests `n` and keys `m`. The second line contains the numbers on the chests, and the third line contains the numbers on the keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We count the number of even and odd values in both the chests and the keys.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openable Chests**: The result is calculated by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and adding it to the minimum of odd chests and even keys. This ensures that we are optimally pairing available chests with suitable keys based on their parity.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys, ensuring optimal use of available resources with a time complexity of O(n + m), which is suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
