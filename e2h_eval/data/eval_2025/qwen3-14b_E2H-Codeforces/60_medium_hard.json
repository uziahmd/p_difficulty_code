Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of S in Morse code after each modification. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. So, after each character is added to S, we have to find all possible substrings of S that correspond to valid Morse code letters (i.e., not the four forbidden strings), and then count all possible sequences of these letters. But wait, the sequences are non-empty sequences of letters. For example, if a substring corresponds to a letter, then each occurrence of that substring as a standalone is one sequence. Also, if there are multiple ways to split the string into Morse code letters, each such split counts as a different sequence. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe note says that for the first sample input, S is \"111\". The substrings that correspond to valid letters are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\" (each of which is valid). Then, the sequences are all possible concatenations of these letters. For example, \"T\" (from \"1\"), \"M\" (from \"11\"), \"O\" (from \"111\"), \"TT\" (from \"1\"+\"1\"), etc. So the count is the number of ways to split the entire string into valid Morse code letters, but wait, no. Wait the problem says that each substring of S that is a valid Morse code letter contributes to the count. But the sequences are sequences of letters, which are represented by some substrings of S. However, the way the note explains it, each occurrence of a valid Morse code substring is considered as a single letter in a sequence. But how do the sequences come into play?\n\nWait, the problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So, each such sequence is a sequence of letters where each letter is represented by a substring of S. But how does that work? For example, if there are two valid Morse code substrings in S, say \"1\" and \"11\", then sequences could be \"T\" (from \"1\"), \"M\" (from \"11\"), \"T followed by M\" (if there's a way to split the string into \"1\" and \"11\"), etc. Wait, but the problem says that the sequences are represented by some substring of S. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that any substring of S that is a valid Morse code letter contributes to the count as a single-letter sequence. Additionally, any combination of such substrings that form a sequence. But that would be more complicated. However, looking at the note's example, when S is \"111\", the answer is 7. Let's see:\n\nThe note lists 7 possibilities. They are:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\nBut how do these come from substrings? Because each of these sequences is formed by splitting the string into parts. For example, \"TT\" would require that the first '1' is a T and the next '1' is another T. But the entire string is \"111\", so the first '1' is a T, the second '1' is also a T, and the third '1' is a T. So the sequence TT would correspond to the first two characters, which is \"11\" (but that's M), but wait, no. Wait, the note says that \"TT\" translates into \"11\", but that's the same as M. But how is that possible?\n\nAh, no. Wait the note says that \"TT\" translates into \"11\", which is the Morse code for M. But according to the problem statement, each letter is represented by a Morse code string. So the sequence of letters is translated into their Morse code concatenation. However, the problem is asking for the number of sequences of letters whose concatenated Morse code is a substring of S. Wait, no. The problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So, for each such sequence, the concatenation of the Morse code representations of the letters in the sequence must be a substring of S. \n\nWait, that's a different interpretation. For example, the sequence \"TT\" would correspond to the Morse code \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", which is a substring of S (\"111\"). Similarly, \"TM\" would be \"1\"+\"11\" = \"111\", which is a substring of S. So each such sequence corresponds to a substring of S that is formed by concatenating the Morse codes of the letters. Therefore, the problem is to count the number of such sequences, where each sequence's concatenated Morse code is a substring of S. \n\nBut how do we compute that? Because for each substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., not in the forbidden list), we can consider it as a single letter. But also, any concatenation of valid Morse code strings that form a substring of S. \n\nSo for example, if S is \"111\", then the possible substrings that are valid Morse codes are:\n\n- \"1\" (valid)\n- \"11\" (valid)\n- \"111\" (valid)\n- \"1\" (the second character)\n- \"1\" (third character)\n- \"11\" (positions 2-3)\n- \"1\" (positions 2)\n- etc. \n\nBut the problem is not just counting the number of valid Morse code substrings, but the number of sequences of letters whose concatenated Morse code is a substring of S. So for each substring of S, we need to count how many ways it can be split into valid Morse code letters. Each such split represents a sequence. \n\nFor example, the substring \"111\" can be split as:\n\n- \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" → sequence of three letters.\n- \"1\" + \"11\" → sequence of two letters.\n- \"11\" + \"1\" → sequence of two letters.\n- \"111\" → one letter.\n\nSo that's four different sequences for this substring. But since the problem counts all possible sequences, each of these splits would contribute to the total. \n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently for every possible substring of S after each modification?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let's think about the approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem again. After each step, S is built incrementally. For each step, we need to compute the total number of sequences that can be formed by any substring of S. \n\nEach time a new character is added to S, the new possible substrings are those that end at the new position. For example, when adding the i-th character, the new substrings are S[0..i], S[1..i], ..., S[i..i]. For each of these substrings, we need to count the number of ways they can be split into valid Morse code letters. \n\nSo, the total answer is the sum over all substrings of S of the number of valid splits of that substring into valid Morse code letters. \n\nBut considering that for each new character added, we can process all new substrings ending at the current position. \n\nSo, the key is to find for each possible substring (which is a string of length up to 4, since the Morse code letters are up to length 4) whether it is a valid Morse code, and then compute how many ways it can be split into valid letters. \n\nBut how do we compute the number of splits for a given substring? Let's model this with dynamic programming. \n\nLet's define dp[i] as the number of ways to split the first i characters of the current S into valid Morse code letters. Then, for each position i, we can look back 1 to 4 steps (since Morse code letters are 1-4 in length) and check if the substring ending at i of length k (for k=1 to 4) is a valid Morse code. If it is, then we add dp[i - k] to dp[i]. \n\nBut wait, this is similar to the classic word break problem. However, in this case, the problem isn't to find if a split exists, but to count the number of splits for all possible substrings of S. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that for all substrings of S, the number of splits into valid Morse code letters. So the total answer is the sum over all possible substrings of the number of splits for that substring. \n\nHmm, that complicates things. Because for each substring, we need to compute the number of ways to split it into valid letters. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming. Let's think of the entire string S, and for each position i, we can track the number of valid splits for all substrings ending at i. \n\nAlternatively, for each position j in the string, we can compute the number of ways to split the substring S[0..j] into valid Morse code letters. Then, the total answer would be the sum of dp[0..n], where n is the current length of S. Wait, but that's only considering the entire string. However, the problem requires considering all substrings, not just the entire string. \n\nSo, for example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\". For each of these substrings, compute the number of splits. Then sum all those numbers. \n\nThis seems computationally expensive, but given that m is up to 3000, and each S can be up to 3000 characters long, the total number of substrings is O(m^2), which would be 9 million. For each of these substrings, we need to compute the number of splits. But how?\n\nBut even that may be manageable with some optimizations. However, for each substring, we need to check if it's a valid Morse code (i.e., not in the forbidden list), and then compute the number of splits for that substring. \n\nBut how to compute the number of splits for a substring? Let's take a substring s. The number of ways to split it into valid Morse code letters is equal to the number of ways to split it into parts of length 1-4, each part being a valid code. \n\nThis is similar to the problem of counting the number of ways to climb stairs with steps of 1-4, but each step must be valid. \n\nSo for each substring s, we can compute the number of splits recursively. For example, if the substring is of length l, then the number of splits is:\n\nif l == 0: 0\nelse:\nsum over k=1 to 4 (if l >=k, and the first k characters form a valid code, then the number of splits for the remaining l-k characters)\n\nBut this seems like a DP problem for each substring. However, doing this for every possible substring would be too slow for m=3000. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's precompute for each possible string of length up to 4 whether it is valid. Then, for the entire S, we can track for each position i, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i into valid codes. \n\nBut the problem is that we need to sum over all possible substrings. Let's think of it this way: For each position j in S, and for each possible start position i (i <= j), we need to compute the number of splits for the substring S[i..j]. \n\nBut that's O(n^2) for each step, which with n up to 3000 would be O(9e6) operations per step, leading to O(2.7e10) operations overall, which is way too slow. \n\nThis approach is not feasible. So we need a smarter way. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to model the total number of sequences as the sum over all possible positions where a valid code ends, multiplied by the number of ways to split the previous parts. \n\nLet me think again. Let's consider that each time a new character is added to S, we can process all possible substrings ending at the new position. For each such substring, we can compute the number of splits for that substring, and add it to the total. \n\nSo, for example, when S is of length l, after adding the l-th character, we can look at all substrings ending at l. For each of these substrings (of lengths 1 to l), we compute the number of splits for that substring, and add them to the total. \n\nIf we can compute this incrementally, then for each step, we can update the total. \n\nNow, how to compute the number of splits for a substring of length k ending at position l. Let's denote the substring as S[l - k + 1 ... l]. \n\nLet's model this with dynamic programming. Let's define for each position i in S, a dp array where dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the substring S[0..i] into valid codes. Then, the total number of splits for all substrings would be the sum over all possible i and j (where j < i) of the number of splits for S[j+1..i]. But that seems complex. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: each time a new character is added, we can compute for all possible substrings ending at this new position. For each such substring, we can compute the number of splits using dynamic programming. \n\nLet me think of this. Suppose we have a current string S of length len. When we add a new character, making it len+1. For each possible k in 1..4, if len+1 -k >=0, then check if the substring ending at len+1 of length k is a valid code. For each such valid code, the number of ways to split this substring is equal to 1 (if k is the entire substring) plus the sum of the number of ways to split the previous parts. \n\nWait, for example, the substring ending at position i with length k is S[i -k +1 ... i]. Let's call this s. The number of ways to split s is equal to the sum for all possible splits. For example, if k=1, then it's 1 if the code is valid. If k=2, then it's 1 if the code is valid, plus the number of ways to split the first part (if the first part is a valid code and the second part is valid). \n\nBut this seems like the same problem as the original word break problem. So for each possible substring ending at position i, we can compute the number of splits for that substring. \n\nLet me denote for each position i, and for each possible length l (up to 4), the number of ways to split the substring ending at i of length l. \n\nAlternatively, for each position i, we can keep track of the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. Let's define dp[i] as the total number of ways to split the substring ending at i. \n\nWait, but how to compute this. For example, for position i, the substring ending here can be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each possible length k (1 to 4), if the substring S[i -k + 1 ... i] is valid, then we can add the number of ways to split the substring before that. \n\nFor example, for k=1: if the current character is valid (i.e., the substring of length 1 is valid), then the number of ways is 1 (just taking this single character). \n\nFor k=2: if the substring of length 2 is valid, then we can add the number of ways for the substring ending at i-2. Because that would be the number of ways to split the part before, and then take the current 2-length substring as a single letter. \n\nWait, but the substring ending at i of length k is S[i -k +1 ... i]. So for each possible k, if this substring is valid, then the number of ways for this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the part before (i -k) plus 1 (if the entire substring is taken as a single letter). \n\nNo, actually, the number of ways to split the substring S[...i] of length k is equal to the sum of the number of ways to split the substring ending at i -k, then adding the current substring as a single letter. \n\nWait, for example, if the substring of length k is valid, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring before it (i -k) and then append this substring as a single letter. \n\nBut how does that relate to the total? \n\nLet me think of the following: For each position i, we can compute the number of ways to split the entire string up to i into valid codes. This is the standard DP approach. Let's call this total_dp[i]. Then, total_dp[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (if S[i -k +1 ... i] is valid, then total_dp[i -k] else 0) + (if the entire substring is valid, then 1 if i -k is -1, else ...). \n\nWait, the standard approach for the number of ways to split the entire string up to i is:\n\ntotal_dp[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (if the substring ending at i of length k is valid, then total_dp[i -k] else 0) \n\nwith the base case total_dp[0] = 1 (empty string has one way to split, which is nothing). \n\nBut in our problem, we need to count all possible substrings. How can we use this?\n\nWait, the number of ways to split a substring S[a..b] into valid codes is equal to the number of ways to split the entire string up to b, minus the number of ways to split the entire string up to a-1. But that's not exactly correct. Because the standard DP approach counts the number of ways to split the entire string up to position i. So, if we have a substring from a to b, then the number of ways to split that substring would be the same as the number of ways to split the entire string up to b, considering that the first part (before a) is fixed. \n\nBut that's not straightforward. However, perhaps we can use the standard DP approach for the entire string and then find that the total number of sequences across all substrings is the sum for all possible a and b (a <= b) of the number of ways to split S[a..b]. \n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently. \n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have a standard DP array where dp[i] is the number of ways to split the first i characters of S into valid codes. Then, for any substring S[a..b], the number of ways to split it into valid codes is equal to dp[b] - dp[a-1] ? No, that's not correct. Because dp[b] is the number of ways to split the first b characters. But if you want to split S[a..b], you need to subtract the ways that include splits before a. \n\nActually, this is not directly applicable. However, perhaps we can model the problem with a different DP approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: for each position i in the string, we can track for all possible lengths up to 4, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. \n\nLet me define for each i, an array cnt[i][k], which represents the number of ways to split the substring ending at i with length k. Wait, no. Maybe for each i, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i into valid codes. \n\nBut how? \n\nAnother approach: for each position i, and for each possible length l (1-4), check if the substring ending at i with length l is valid. If so, then the number of ways to split that substring is 1 (if l is the entire substring) plus the sum of the number of ways to split the substring that ends at i - l and then add the current l-length substring. \n\nWait, for example, if I have a substring ending at i of length l, which is valid. Then, the number of ways to split that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i - l, and then add this l-length substring as a new letter. \n\nBut the total number of ways for the substring ending at i of length l is equal to the number of ways to split the part before (i - l) and then take the current substring. \n\nSo, for each i, we can compute for all possible l (1-4) the number of ways to split the substring ending at i of length l. \n\nLet me denote this as ways[i][l], which is the number of ways to split the substring of length l ending at i. \n\nThen, for each i, the total number of sequences contributed by substrings ending at i is the sum of ways[i][l] for all l in 1-4 where the substring is valid. \n\nBut how to compute ways[i][l]. \n\nFor example, for l=1, the substring is S[i], which is of length 1. If it's valid, then ways[i][1] = 1 (since there's one way to split it: take the single character). \n\nFor l=2, the substring is S[i-1..i]. If it's valid, then ways[i][2] = ways[i-2][0] (assuming that the part before is empty). Wait, no. The part before is the substring ending at i-2. So, if the current substring is of length 2, then the number of ways is the number of ways to split the part before (i-2) and then add this substring. \n\nBut the part before (i-2) can be any split. So, if the part before is split into some ways, then adding this substring as a new letter. So, the total number of ways for the substring ending at i of length 2 is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i-2 (i.e., the part before the current substring). \n\nBut the ways[i-2][...] would be the number of ways for the substring ending at i-2. However, since we're considering the entire substring of length 2, the previous part is from the beginning up to i-2. Wait, no. The current substring is from i-1 to i, which is length 2. The previous part is from 0 to i-2. So, the total number of ways to split the entire substring from 0 to i is the number of ways to split up to i-2 multiplied by 1 (taking the current substring as a new letter). \n\nBut this suggests that the ways[i][l] is the number of ways to split the entire string up to i, considering that the last part is a substring of length l. \n\nBut how does this help us? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the standard DP approach where dp[i] is the total number of ways to split the first i characters of S. Then, for each i, the number of ways to split the entire first i characters is dp[i]. \n\nNow, the total number of sequences across all substrings is the sum for all possible j (from 1 to i) of dp[j] - dp[j-1] ? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, the dp[i] is the number of ways to split the entire first i characters. But for all substrings of S, each of which is a certain length, we need to compute the number of ways to split that substring. \n\nFor example, for a substring S[a..b], the number of ways to split it is the same as the number of ways to split the entire string S[0..b], but where the first a-1 characters are not split. \n\nBut how can we model this? It seems challenging. \n\nAnother idea: For each position i, and for each possible length l (1-4), if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of ways to split that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the part before (i-l) and then take the current substring. \n\nSo, for example, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i of length l is equal to the number of ways to split the first (i-l) characters. \n\nBecause, the substring ending at i is of length l, which is valid. So, the total ways for this substring is the number of ways to split the part before (i-l) characters, multiplied by 1 (since the current l-length substring is taken as a single letter). \n\nBut the part before (i-l) can be split in any way, and then the current l-length substring is added as a new letter. \n\nTherefore, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i of length l is equal to dp[i-l], where dp[x] is the number of ways to split the first x characters. \n\nBut then, for the substring S[0..i], the number of ways is dp[i], which is the sum over l=1-4 of dp[i-l] if the substring of length l is valid. \n\nSo, if we have this dp array, then for any substring S[a..b], the number of ways to split it would be equal to dp[b] - dp[a-1], but that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, think of the number of ways to split S[a..b] as the same as the number of ways to split the entire string S[0..b], with the condition that the first a-1 characters are not part of any split. \n\nBut this is not directly tracked by the dp array. \n\nHowever, if we can find for each position i and for each possible length l (1-4), the number of ways to split the substring ending at i of length l, then we can accumulate all of these to get the total number of sequences. \n\nSo, for example, for each i, we can look back l steps (for l=1-4), check if the substring of length l ending at i is valid, and if so, add dp[i-l] to the total. \n\nWait, this might be the key. \n\nLet me think: for each i, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i of length l is dp[i-l], assuming that the substring of length l is valid. \n\nSo, the total number of sequences across all substrings is the sum for all i from 1 to len(S) of sum_{l=1 to 4} (if the substring of length l ending at i is valid, then dp[i-l] else 0). \n\nBut why? Because for each i, and for each possible l, if the substring of length l ending at i is valid, then the number of ways to split that substring is dp[i-l], which represents the number of ways to split the part before (i-l) characters. Adding this substring as a new letter. \n\nBut wait, dp[i-l] represents the number of ways to split the first (i-l) characters. Then, the substring of length l is added as a new letter. So, the total ways for that particular substring (from position i-l+1 to i) is dp[i-l] * 1. \n\nBut this counts all possible splits of the substring from 0 to i. However, we are interested in the splits of the substring from (i-l+1) to i. \n\nAh, this seems incorrect. Because dp[i-l] counts the ways to split the first (i-l) characters. But the substring from (i-l+1) to i is a separate part. So, the number of ways to split the substring (i-l+1 to i) is 1 if the entire substring is valid. However, if there are splits within the substring (i-l+1 to i), then it would be more than 1. \n\nSo, this approach is not correct. \n\nHmm, this seems really tricky. Let's go back to the example given in the problem statement. \n\nIn the first sample input, after three '1's, S is \"111\". The answer is 7. \n\nThe total number of sequences is the sum over all substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters. \n\nLet's list all substrings and their counts:\n\nSubstrings of length 1:\n\n\"1\" (positions 0, 1, 2). Each is valid. Each has 1 way (only itself). So 3*1 = 3.\n\nSubstrings of length 2:\n\n\"11\" (positions 0-1, 1-2). Each is valid. For each of these substrings, the number of ways is 1 (split into one letter) + 0 (since for length 2, you can't split into smaller parts unless they are valid. Wait, for \"11\", the number of ways to split is 1 (as a single letter) plus the ways to split into \"1\" and \"1\" (if both are valid). So for a substring of length 2, the number of ways is 1 (as a single letter) + 1 (split into two letters). So total 2 ways. \n\nWait, for the substring \"11\", the possible splits are:\n\n- Take the whole as one letter (counted once).\n\n- Split into two letters (each \"1\"). Since both are valid, that's one way. \n\nSo total 2 ways. \n\nSo for each of the two substrings of length 2, we have 2 ways. So 2*2=4.\n\nSubstrings of length 3:\n\n\"111\" (positions 0-2). The number of ways to split this substring is:\n\n- Take it as a single letter (1 way).\n\n- Split into \"1\" + \"11\" (valid, 1 way).\n\n- Split into \"11\" + \"1\" (another way).\n\n- Split into \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" (another way).\n\nSo total 4 ways. \n\nSo for this substring, 4 ways. \n\nSo total for all substrings:\n\nLength 1: 3\n\nLength 2: 2*2 = 4\n\nLength 3: 4 \n\nTotal sum is 3 + 4 + 4 = 11? But the sample answer is 7. \n\nWait, this contradicts the sample explanation. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the answer is 7. But according to this calculation, it's 3 + 4 + 4 = 11. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nAh! Oh right! The problem says that each sequence of letters is counted once for each occurrence of its Morse code in S as a substring. But wait, the problem says to count the number of non-empty sequences of letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. \n\nWait, this means that if a sequence's Morse code appears multiple times as a substring, it is counted once per occurrence. Or is it counted once for each occurrence? \n\nWait, the sample explanation says that after S is \"111\", the answer is 7. According to the explanation, the sequences are:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". \n\nSo these are 7 distinct sequences. But according to the earlier calculation, the sum of the number of ways to split all substrings would be higher. \n\nThis suggests that my previous understanding is incorrect. So perhaps the problem is not to count all possible splits of all substrings, but to count the number of distinct sequences of letters whose concatenated Morse code is a substring of S. \n\nWait, that's a completely different problem. For example, if a sequence's Morse code appears multiple times as a substring, it should be counted once. \n\nBut the sample explanation shows that the sequences are counted as distinct based on their composition, not their Morse code. \n\nFor example, the sequence \"TT\" is counted once, because its Morse code is \"11\", which appears once in S as a substring (positions 0-1 and 1-2). But the sample explanation counts it once. However, the sample output for the first case is 7, which is the number of distinct sequences. \n\nThis changes everything. So the problem is not about counting the number of splits of all substrings, but about counting the number of distinct sequences of letters whose concatenated Morse code is a substring of S. \n\nBut how to compute this? Because for each substring of S, we need to determine all the possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting that substring into valid Morse code letters. Then, collect all these sequences and count them, ensuring that duplicates are not counted. \n\nBut this is impossible to compute directly, as the number of sequences can be exponential. However, the sample suggests that the answer is not counting the number of splits but the number of unique sequences. \n\nBut the sample explanation for the first case says that the answer is 7. Let's see: \n\nThe sequences are:\n\nT (1), M (11), O (111), TT (1+1=11), TM (1+11=111), MT (11+1=111), TTT (1+1+1=111). \n\nSo, the sequences are T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT. These are 7 distinct sequences. \n\nBut notice that the Morse code for TT is \"11\", which is the same as M. But the sequence is different: TT is two letters, M is one. \n\nSo, the problem is counting the number of distinct sequences of letters, regardless of whether their concatenated Morse code is the same as another sequence. \n\nBut how to compute this? For example, if two different sequences have the same concatenated Morse code, they are considered distinct. \n\nBut the problem states that each sequence is a sequence of letters. So, the sequences are considered distinct if their letters are different, even if their concatenated Morse code is the same. \n\nThus, the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences of letters, where each sequence's concatenated Morse code is a substring of S. \n\nThis is a completely different approach. Now, the problem becomes: for all substrings of S, generate all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting the substring into valid Morse code letters, and count the number of unique sequences. \n\nBut this seems computationally infeasible for large m. For example, for m=3000, the number of substrings is O(m^2), and each substring could have many splits. \n\nBut the sample input suggests that the answer is the number of unique sequences, not the number of splits. \n\nBut how can this be computed efficiently? \n\nLet's think about the first sample again. The total sequences are the ones listed. So for each substring, we generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting it into valid Morse codes. Then, collect all these sequences and count how many unique ones there are. \n\nBut for the first sample, the substrings are:\n\nAll substrings of \"111\":\n\nLength 1:\n\n\"1\" → can be split as [T] → 1 sequence.\n\n\"1\" → same as above.\n\n\"1\" → same as above.\n\nLength 2:\n\n\"11\" → can be split as [M] or [T, T]. So two sequences: M and TT.\n\n\"11\" (positions 1-2) → same as above.\n\nLength 3:\n\n\"111\" → can be split as [O], [T, M], [M, T], [T, T, T]. So four sequences: O, TM, MT, TTT.\n\nSo the total sequences are:\n\nFrom length 1: T (three times, but counted once).\n\nFrom length 2: M, TT (two sequences, each appearing twice, but counted once).\n\nFrom length 3: O, TM, MT, TTT (four sequences).\n\nTotal unique sequences: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences of letters, where each sequence's concatenated Morse code is a substring of S. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nThis seems very challenging. Because for each substring of S, we need to generate all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting it into valid Morse code letters. Then, collect all these sequences and count the unique ones. \n\nBut for m=3000, this would be computationally intensive. However, the constraints are m up to 3000, and for each step, the length of S is up to 3000. So for each step, the number of substrings is O(l^2), where l is the current length of S. \n\nBut for each substring, generating all possible sequences and adding them to a set is not feasible for large l. \n\nAlternative idea: since the Morse code for each letter is unique (except the four forbidden ones), each valid Morse code string corresponds to exactly one letter. So, the sequences of letters are uniquely determined by their Morse code concatenations. However, different sequences can have the same concatenated Morse code. For example, \"TT\" and \"M\" both have Morse code \"11\". But the sequences are different: one is a single letter, the other is two letters. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct sequences of Morse code strings (each of length 1-4, not in the forbidden list) that appear as substrings of S. \n\nBut how to represent these sequences? \n\nWait, no. Because a sequence of Morse code strings is a concatenation of valid Morse code strings. For example, the sequence [T, M] corresponds to the Morse code \"1\"+\"11\" = \"111\", which is a substring of S. But this same \"11",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code. Each modification to `S` appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1'), and after each modification, we must determine how many unique sequences of letters can be formed from substrings of `S`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: First, we identify which Morse code strings (of lengths 1 to 4) are valid. The four invalid strings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Valid Splits**: We use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to split the first `i` characters of `S` into valid Morse code sequences.\n3. **Tracking Substrings**: For each new character added to `S`, we check all possible substrings ending at this character. For each valid substring, we update our DP array to account for new valid splits.\n4. **Set of Sequences**: To efficiently track unique sequences, we use a set that stores the concatenated Morse code representations of valid sequences. This helps avoid counting duplicates.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    operations = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    # Forbidden Morse codes\n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of ways to split the first i characters of S into valid codes\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # empty string has one way\n    \n    # Set to keep track of all unique sequences\n    sequences = set()\n    \n    S = []\n    \n    for step in range(m):\n        c = operations[step]\n        S.append(c)\n        current_len = len(S)\n        \n        # Update dp for the current length\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if current_len -
