Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input. The first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the concatenation of the first two strings (guest + host) has the same character count as the third string (the pile). If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to take the first two strings, combine them into one, then create a frequency dictionary for each character. Then do the same for the third string. Then compare the two dictionaries. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nAlternatively, we can sort all the characters in the combined string and the pile, then check if they are equal. For example, if we have guest + host sorted, and pile sorted, then compare the two sorted strings.\n\nYes, that's a possible approach. Let's think about that.\n\nFor example, guest is \"SANTA\", host is \"CLAUS\". Combined, their letters are \"SANTACLAUS\". The pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" — wait, but in the first sample input, the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". Wait, the first sample input's first case is:\n\nInput lines:\n\nFirst line: SANTACLAUS\n\nSecond line: DEDMOROZ\n\nThird line: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo combining the first two lines gives SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's check the length. Let me count:\n\nFirst line length: len(\"SANTACLAUS\") is 10 letters. Second line \"DEDMOROZ\" is 8 letters. Total 18 letters. Third line is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" — let's count that. Let me see:\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS — maybe 18 letters? Let me check:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → Let's count:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nSANTAMOROZ is 10 letters (S A N T A M O R O Z). Then DEDCLAUS is D E D C L A U S → 8 letters. Total 18. So yes, same length as combined first two lines. But how to check that the letters are same.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nTake the first two strings, combine them, sort the characters, then compare with the sorted third string.\n\nYes. Because if the sorted combined string equals the sorted pile string, then the pile has exactly the same letters as the combined names.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead the three lines. Combine the first two into a single string. Then check if the sorted version of that combined string is equal to the sorted version of the third string.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the combined string has a different length than the pile? For example, if the combined length is 10 and the pile is 11 letters. Then obviously, it's impossible. So in that case, the answer is NO.\n\nBut the problem says that the pile could be a permutation of the combined letters. So the first check is to see if the lengths are equal. If not, immediately return NO. Otherwise, proceed to check the sorted strings.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nguest = 'SANTACLAUS', host = 'DEDMOROZ', pile = 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → let's sort it. Let's think about the letters. The pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' — when sorted, it should be same as the combined sorted.\n\nBut perhaps the code will handle that.\n\nAnother example is the second input:\n\nInput lines:\n\nguest: PAPAINOEL\n\nhost: JOULUPUKKI\n\npile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI' — let's check the length. Let's count:\n\nguest is 9 letters (PAPAINOEL), host is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Length Check**: First, check if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Character Frequency Check**: If the lengths match, sort the characters of both the combined guest-host names and the pile. If the sorted sequences are identical, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the three lines from input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the lengths are equal\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check if sorted combined and sorted pile are the same\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as three separate lines, each representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combined Length Check**: By combining the guest and host names into a single string, we first check if the total length of this combined string matches the length of the pile. If they differ, it's impossible for the pile to be a permutation of the combined names, so we immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Sorting and Comparing Characters**: If the lengths match, we sort the characters of both the combined string and the pile. If the sorted sequences are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names, just in a different order, so we return \"YES\". Otherwise, we return \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the required conditions using sorting, which ensures that we compare the exact character frequencies in O(n log n) time complexity, where n is the length of the strings involved. This is efficient given the problem constraints.",
