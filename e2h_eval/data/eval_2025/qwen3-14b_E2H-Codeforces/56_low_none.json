Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. Hmm. So the problem is about checking if a bipartite graph has a perfect matching where the edges don't cross each other. \n\nFirst, the input gives me R spaceships and B bases. The first thing is that for a perfect matching to exist, R must equal B. Wait, right! Because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and vice versa. So if R != B, then the answer is immediately No. Oh, but the problem says that in the input, R and B can be up to 10. So the first check is whether R equals B. If not, output No.\n\nBut if they are equal, then we need to check if there's a perfect matching where no two edges cross. How do I approach this?\n\nThe main challenge is checking whether any two edges in the matching cross. So for a given matching, we have to check all pairs of edges to see if any two intersect. But how do I generate all possible perfect matchings and check them? Since R and B are up to 10, the number of possible perfect matchings is (R)! which for R=10 is 3.6 million. Wait, 10! is 3,628,800. That's manageable for small sizes. But even for 10, checking each possible permutation might be feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check if R != B. If so, output No.\n2. Else, generate all possible perfect matchings (all permutations of assigning ships to bases).\n3. For each permutation, check if any two edges in the matching cross. If none do, output Yes.\n4. If none of the permutations work, output No.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments intersect? Oh right, the problem says that any two paths (straight lines) from a base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect. So for any two pairs (ship1, base1) and (ship2, base2), their connecting lines must not cross.\n\nWait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So that's helpful. Because if two lines cross, they must form an intersection point that's not one of the original points. So for two line segments AB and CD, they cross if they intersect at a point that's not an endpoint.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments intersect? Well, I need to implement a function that takes four points (A, B, C, D) and returns True if the line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each permutation of the assignment (each possible way to assign ships to bases), check all pairs of edges in that assignment. For each pair of edges (ship1 to base1, ship2 to base2), check if their line segments intersect. If any pair does, this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid. If any permutation is valid, output Yes.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate all permutations of the assignment. Let's think about how to model that.\n\nSuppose the ships are in a list, and the bases are in another list. For a perfect matching, each ship is assigned to exactly one base. So for example, if there are R ships and R bases, the possible assignments are all permutations of the bases. So for each permutation p of the bases, we can assign ship i to base p[i], and check if all the line segments between ship i and base p[i] don't cross each other.\n\nWait, but the permutation is for the bases. Let me think: for example, if we have R ships and R bases, then a perfect matching is a bijection between the ships and the bases. So for each possible bijection, we can check if the edges cross.\n\nSo generating all possible permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of ships to bases). For example, for the first ship, assign it to the first base in the permutation, second ship to the second base, etc. Wait, but the permutation would be of the bases. Alternatively, perhaps the permutation is of the indices of the bases. So for each possible permutation of the bases, we can check if the assignment of ship i to base perm[i] (for each i) results in non-crossing lines.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read the coordinates of the R ships and B bases.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the B bases (but since B=R, it's permutations of length R). For each permutation, check if all pairs of edges in the matching are non-crossing.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Otherwise, output No.\n\nNow, the key parts are:\n\n- Generating all permutations of the bases (which is R! possibilities).\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting paths intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments and verifying if any of them meet the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, ensure the number of spaceships (R) equals the number of bases (B). If not, output \"No\" immediately.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of the bases, consider it as a potential assignment of bases to spaceships.\n3. **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation, check all pairs of connecting paths to ensure they do not intersect. This involves using computational geometry to determine if line segments intersect.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef read_input():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in input if line.strip()]\n    return lines\n\ndef read_points(lines, start_idx, count):\n    points = []\n    for i in range(start_idx, start_idx + count):\n        x, y = map(int, lines[i].split())\n        points.append((x, y))\n    return points\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if line segments AB and CD intersect\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    lines = read_input()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    ships = read_points(lines, idx, R)\n    idx += R\n    bases = read_points(lines, idx, B)\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of bases\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # Check all pairs of segments\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                A = ships[i]\n                B = perm[i]\n                C = ships[j]\n                D = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for spaceships and bases.\n2. **Immediate Check for Equal Numbers**: If the number of spaceships and bases differ, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n3. **Permutations of Bases**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible assignments of bases to spaceships are generated.\n4. **Checking Intersections**: For each permutation, we check every pair of connecting paths (segments) to see if they intersect using the cross product method (`ccw` function), which helps determine if the segments intersect without being colinear.\n\nThis approach ensures that we exhaustively check all possible assignments and efficiently determine if any valid non-intersecting configuration exists.",
