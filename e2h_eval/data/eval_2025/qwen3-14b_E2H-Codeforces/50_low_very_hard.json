Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the task is to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees for a given n. The constraints are quite tight, especially since n can be up to 5e5, which suggests that any O(n) or O(n log n) solution is needed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"good\" tree is. The definition says that for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i is -1. Each edge has weight 1 or -1. So for every vertex, the product of its adjacent edges' weights must be -1.\n\nLet me think about the implications of this condition. For example, take a vertex with degree k. The product of its edges' weights is -1. Since each edge is either 1 or -1, the product being -1 implies that there's an odd number of -1 edges incident to that vertex. Because multiplying an even number of -1s gives 1, and odd gives -1.\n\nSo for every vertex, the number of edges incident to it with weight -1 must be odd. That's a crucial observation.\n\nNow, the problem requires considering all such trees (i.e., all trees where each vertex has an odd number of -1 edges incident to it) and summing d(1,n) for each of them. Then output that sum modulo 998244353.\n\nBut how do we approach this? Let's think about the structure of such trees.\n\nFirst, note that the total number of trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}, but only some of them are good. We need to find those that satisfy the conditions and then compute the sum.\n\nBut directly enumerating all possible trees is impossible for large n. Therefore, we need a mathematical formula or combinatorial approach to compute the required sum.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. Each vertex must have an odd number of edges with weight -1. Let's model this as a system of equations. For each vertex, the sum (mod 2) of the edges' weights (with -1 represented as 1 in mod 2 terms?) Wait, maybe not. Let's think in terms of parity. Since each edge weight is ±1, but the product is -1. Taking logs might not help here. Alternatively, since the product is -1, if we take the product of all edge weights around a vertex, it's -1. But each edge is connected to two vertices. So, perhaps this creates some kind of parity constraints across the entire graph.\n\nAlternatively, think of each edge as contributing to two vertices. For example, if an edge between u and v has weight w, then for u, it contributes a factor of w to the product, and similarly for v. So, the product for u is the product of all w_e for edges e incident to u. Similarly for v.\n\nBut the product for each vertex is -1. So, the product of all these products over all vertices would be (-1)^n. However, each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint). Let's consider the product of all vertex products. Let's denote P as the product of the vertex products. Each edge's weight is multiplied twice (once for each endpoint). Therefore, P = product_{edges} (w_e)^2. Since each w_e is ±1, (w_e)^2 is 1. Therefore, P = 1. On the other hand, the product of all vertex products is (-1)^n. Therefore, (-1)^n must equal 1. Which implies that n must be even. Wait, that's a contradiction unless n is even. But the problem statement allows n to be any positive integer. For example, the first sample input is n=2, which is even. The second sample is n=1, which is odd. Let's check that.\n\nWait, when n=1, there's only one vertex. But in that case, there are no edges. So the product of the edges incident to the vertex is 1 (product over zero elements), but according to the condition, it should be -1. So for n=1, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer for n=1 is 0, which matches the sample input (second case, input is 1, output is 0).\n\nSo this suggests that for n odd, there are no good trees. Because for n odd, (-1)^n is -1, but the product of all vertex products must be 1. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, when n is odd, the answer is 0. That's a key insight.\n\nSo, the answer is 0 when n is odd. For even n, we need to compute the sum.\n\nThis explains why in the sample input for n=1, the output is 0. Similarly",

This is equivalent to saying that the number of -1 edges incident to each vertex is odd.\n\n    # This is similar to a system of equations modulo 2. Each edge is a variable that can be 0 or 1 (representing +1 or -1). The condition is that for each vertex, the sum of the variables (edges incident to it) is 1 mod 2.\n\n    # Let's model this as a system of linear equations over GF(2). The number of variables is the number of edges in the tree, which is n-1. The number of equations is n (one per vertex). However, the sum of all equations is the sum of the degrees of all vertices, which is 2(n-1), which is 0 mod 2. But the sum of the right-hand sides is n * 1 mod 2. For this to be consistent, n must be even. Hence, when n is even, the system is consistent, otherwise, no solution exists. This aligns with our previous observation that for odd n, there are no good trees.\n\n    # Now, for even n, the number of solutions to this system is 2^{m}, where m is the number of free variables in the system. The system has n equations and n-1 variables. However, the rank of the system is n-1 (since the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2, and the right-hand side sum is n mod 2 = 0 when n is even). Hence, the rank is n-1, and the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? No, this doesn't make sense.\n\n    # Let me re-express: The system has n equations, but they are not all independent. The sum of all equations is 0 mod 2, and the sum of the right-hand sides is n mod 2 = 0 (since n is even). Hence, the rank of the system is n-1. The number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - r}, where r is the rank. If r = n-1, then the number of solutions is 2^0 = 1. But this would mean that for a fixed tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights to satisfy the conditions. But this contradicts the sample for n=2, where there is 1 good tree (the single edge with weight -1).\n\n    # Wait, but the tree structure itself is also part of the problem. The total number of good trees is the number of trees (n^{n-2}) multiplied by the number of ways to assign weights to the edges of each tree to satisfy the conditions. For each tree, the number of valid assignments is 1 if n is even, else 0. Because the system of equations has exactly one solution for the edge weights.\n\n    # Hence, for even n, the number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 1. But this contradicts the sample for n=4, where the number of good trees is 16. Let's check:\n\n    # For n=4, the number of trees is 4^{2} = 16. If for each tree, there is exactly one valid assignment of edge weights, then the number of good trees is 16 * 1 = 16, which matches the sample. Hence, this is correct.\n\n    # So, for even n, the number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 1 = n^{n-2}.\n\n    # Now, the problem requires us to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\n    # For each good tree, the sum of d(1,n) is the sum of the weights of the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\n    # Now, the question becomes: for all trees, and for each tree, exactly one way to assign edge weights (since for each tree, the system has exactly one solution), what is the sum of the sum of edge weights on the path from 1 to n?\n\n    # Let's denote this sum as S.\n\n    # To compute S, we can think about the expected value of the sum of edge weights on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the number of good trees (which is n^{n-2}).\n\n    # But how to compute this expected value?\n\n    # Let's consider that for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the conditions. So for each tree, the edge weights are fixed once the tree structure is chosen.\n\n    # However, it's difficult to see how to compute this sum directly.\n\n    # Another idea: For each edge e in the tree, let's determine the probability (or contribution) that it is included in the path from 1 to n and its weight is -1 or +1.\n\n    # But since the edge weights are determined by the conditions, it's not straightforward.\n\n    # However, for a given tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined.

This is equivalent to saying that the number of -1 edges incident to each vertex is odd.\n\n    # This is similar to a system of equations modulo 2. Each edge is a variable that can be 0 or 1 (representing +1 or -1). The condition is that for each vertex, the sum of the variables (edges incident to it) is 1 mod 2.\n\n    # Let's model this as a system of linear equations over GF(2). The number of variables is the number of edges in the tree, which is n-1. The number of equations is n (one per vertex). However, the sum of all equations is the sum of the degrees of all vertices, which is 2(n-1), which is 0 mod 2. But the sum of the right-hand sides is n * 1 mod 2. For this to be consistent, n must be even. Hence, when n is even, the system is consistent, otherwise, no solution exists. This aligns with our previous observation that for odd n, there are no good trees.\n\n    # Now, for even n, the number of solutions to this system is 2^{m}, where m is the number of free variables in the system. The system has n equations and n-1 variables. However, the rank of the system is n-1 (since the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2, and the right-hand side sum is n mod 2 = 0 when n is even). Hence, the rank is n-1, and the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? No, this doesn't make sense.\n\n    # Let me re-express: The system has n equations, but they are not all independent. The sum of all equations is 0 mod 2, and the sum of the right-hand sides is n mod 2 = 0 (since n is even). Hence, the rank of the system is n-1. The number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - r}, where r is the rank. If r = n-1, then the number of solutions is 2^0 = 1. But this would mean that for a fixed tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights to satisfy the conditions. But this contradicts the sample for n=2, where there is 1 good tree (the single edge with weight -1).\n\n    # Wait, but the tree structure itself is also part of the problem. The total number of good trees is the number of trees (n^{n-2}) multiplied by the number of ways to assign weights to the edges of each tree to satisfy the conditions. For each tree, the number of valid assignments is 1 if n is even, else 0. Because the system of equations has exactly one solution for the edge weights.\n\n    # Hence, for even n, the number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 1. But this contradicts the sample for n=4, where the number of good trees is 16. Let's check:\n\n    # For n=4, the number of trees is 4^{2} = 16. If for each tree, there is exactly one valid assignment of edge weights, then the number of good trees is 16 * 1 = 16, which matches the sample. Hence, this is correct.\n\n    # So, for even n, the number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 1 = n^{n-2}.\n\n    # Now, the problem requires us to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\n    # For each good tree, the sum of d(1,n) is the sum of the weights of the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\n    # Now, the question becomes: for all trees, and for each tree, exactly one way to assign edge weights (since for each tree, the system has exactly one solution), what is the sum of the sum of edge weights on the path from 1 to n?\n\n    # Let's denote this sum as S.\n\n    # To compute S, we can think about the expected value of the sum of edge weights on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the number of good trees (which is n^{n-2}).\n\n    # But how to compute this expected value?\n\n    # Let's consider that for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the conditions. So for each tree, the edge weights are fixed once the tree structure is chosen.\n\n    # However, it's difficult to see how to compute this sum directly.\n\n    # Another idea: For each edge e in the tree, let's determine the probability (or contribution) that it is included in the path from 1 to n and its weight is -1 or +1.\n\n    # But since the edge weights are determined by the conditions, it's not straightforward.\n\n    # However, for a given tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined. Let's think about how to compute the sum of the weights of the edges on the path from 1 to n for all trees.\n\n    # Let's denote the sum as S. We can split S into the sum over all trees T of the sum of weights of the edges on the path from 1 to n in T.\n\n    # This is equal to the sum over all edges e of the number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by the weight of e in T.\n\n    # However, the weight of e in T depends on the tree structure and the conditions.\n\n    # This seems complex, but perhaps there's a way to find the expected value of the weight of an edge on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the number of trees where the edge is on the path.\n\n    # Let's consider that for each tree, the edge weights are determined uniquely.
