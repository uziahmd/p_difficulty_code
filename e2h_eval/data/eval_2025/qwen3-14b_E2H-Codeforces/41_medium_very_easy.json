There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the task is to build houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is a squared, where a is the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that the maximum height in the range l_i to r_i must be at most x_i. I need to maximize the total profit under these constraints.\n\nHmm. The constraints are that for each restriction, the maximum in the interval [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. And I need to choose the heights of each house such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nThe input is small: n, h, m up to 50. So maybe a brute-force approach is possible? But even with n=50, trying all possibilities is impossible since each house has up to h+1 options. But 50^50 is way too big. So brute-force isn't feasible here.\n\nAlternative idea: think about constraints. For each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that interval can't exceed x_i. How can we model this?\n\nWait, but each restriction applies to a range. So for each restriction, the maximum height in that range must be <= x_i. So, for example, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then all three houses can be at most 2. But if there's another restriction on [2,3] with x=3, then the max in [2,3] can be up to 3, but the first restriction requires that the max in [1,3] is 2, so the first house must be <=2, and the second and third can be up to 3, but the max of all three is 2. So the second and third can be up to 2 as well? Wait, no. Because the first restriction says that the max in [1,3] is <=2. So even if there's a restriction on [2,3] allowing higher, the first restriction would override it. So the max in [1,3] is the limiting factor here.\n\nSo the problem is to assign heights to each house, such that for every restriction, the maximum in the interval is <= x_i. And we want to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nHow can we model this? It seems like a constraint satisfaction problem, and we need to find the optimal assignment.\n\nBut given that n is small (up to 50), perhaps we can model this with some dynamic programming or backtracking with pruning. However, even with 50 variables, backtracking is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each house, the maximum allowed height is determined by all the restrictions that apply to it. But that's not exactly correct. Because a restriction on a range [l, r] affects the maximum of that entire range. So, for example, if there's a restriction that the max in [1,3] is <=2, then each of the houses 1,2,3 can be up to 2, but also, their maximum must be <=2. So, if you set all three to 2, that's okay. But if one is 2 and another is 3, that would violate the restriction.\n\nSo, how can we model the constraints? For each house, the maximum height it can have is min(h, all x_i where the house is in the interval [l_i, r_i] of some restriction). But that's not sufficient. Because even if a house is not directly covered by any restriction, but is part of a range that has a restriction, then its height may be constrained by that.\n\nWait, no. Suppose there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2. Then, the max in that range must be <=2. So, all three houses can be at most 2. So, even if a house is not directly covered by any restriction, but is part of a range that has a restriction, then its height is constrained.\n\nSo, the problem is that each restriction imposes that the maximum in a certain interval is <= x_i. Therefore, for each interval, the maximum of the houses in that interval must be <= x_i.\n\nBut how do we model this? For example, if there are multiple overlapping restrictions, how do we find the maximum allowed for each house?\n\nAn alternative idea: For each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and all x_i for which the house is in [l_i, r_i] of a restriction. But this is not correct. Because suppose a restriction says that in [1,3], the max is <=2, and another restriction says that in [2,4], the max is <=3. Then, house 2 can be up to 2 (because of the first restriction), but house 3 can be up to 2 (due to first restriction) and 3 (due to second). But the first restriction requires that the max in [1,3] is <=2. So house 3 can't be more than 2. So the maximum allowed for house 3 is 2. So, even though there's a restriction that allows it to be 3, the other restriction restricts it.\n\nTherefore, the maximum allowed for each house is not simply the minimum of all x_i that cover it, but depends on the restrictions that cover ranges that include it. So, this approach is not sufficient.\n\nAnother thought: The problem is similar to interval constraints where for each interval, the maximum in that interval is bounded. How can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the constraints. For each restriction, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. So, for each such interval, all houses in that interval must be <= x_i. Because if any house in the interval is higher than x_i, then the max would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction.\n\nWait! No. If there's a restriction that says the max in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i, then that implies that all houses in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. Because if any house in that interval is higher than x_i, then the max would be higher than x_i. So, the restriction is equivalent to requiring that each house in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. Because if all houses are <=x_i, then the max is <=x_i. Conversely, if the max is <=x_i, then all houses are <=x_i.\n\nWait, yes! So, the restriction can be transformed into individual constraints for each house in the interval. Because if you have a restriction that the maximum in [l, r] is <=x, then each house in [l, r] must be <=x. Because if any house was higher than x, then the max would be higher than x, which violates the restriction. Therefore, each restriction can be converted into a set of constraints: for each position in [l_i, r_i], the height of that position must be <=x_i.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Suppose that there is a restriction that the max in [l, r] is <=x. Then, the maximum of the houses in that interval must be <=x. Which implies that each individual house in the interval is <=x. Therefore, adding constraints that for each position in [l_i, r_i], the height is <=x_i. Because if you do that, then the max will automatically be <=x_i. So, the original problem's constraints can be converted into per-house constraints. \n\nBut then, if that's the case, then the problem reduces to: for each house, there are multiple constraints that may impose an upper limit on its height. The maximum possible height for each house is the minimum of all such constraints (from all restrictions that include that house in their interval) and h. Then, the optimal solution is to set each house to that maximum possible value. Because the sum of squares is maximized when each house is as high as possible.\n\nWait, but why? Because for each house, the square is maximized when the height is as high as possible. So, if there are no constraints, the optimal is to set each house to h. But if there are constraints, then each house's maximum is the minimum of h and all the x_i from the restrictions that cover that house. \n\nBut this seems to contradict the example given. Let me check the first example.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1-1: x=1. So house 1 must be <=1.\n\n2-2: x=3. House 2 <=3.\n\n3-3: x=2. House 3 <=2.\n\nSo according to the approach, each house's maximum is min(h, all x_i that include it). For house 1, it's min(3, 1) = 1. House 2 is min(3, 3) = 3. House 3 is min(3, 2) = 2. So the optimal is [1,3,2], sum is 1 +9 +4 =14. Which matches the example. So that works.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2-3: x=8. So houses 2 and 3 must be <=8.\n\n3-4: x=7. So houses 3 and 4 must be <=7.\n\nSo for house 2: constraints are 8 (from first restriction) and h=10. So max is 8.\n\nHouse 3: constraints are 8 and 7. So min(8,7) =7.\n\nHouse 4: constraint is 7. So 7.\n\nHouse 1: no constraints, so 10.\n\nSo the heights are [10,8,7,7], sum 100+64+49+49 = 262. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for the examples. So why does this approach work?\n\nBecause each restriction is converted into per-house constraints. So for each house, the maximum allowed is the minimum of h and all x_i for which the house is in [l_i, r_i]. Then, setting each house to that maximum gives the maximum possible sum of squares.\n\nBut why is this correct? Because if you set each house to the maximum allowed by all constraints, then all the restrictions are satisfied. Because for any restriction [l_i, r_i], each house in that interval is <=x_i, so the max in the interval is <=x_i.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each house, compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that cover that house. Then, the maximum height for that house is the minimum between h and that x_i. Then, sum the squares.\n\nBut how do we compute for each house, the minimal x_i across all restrictions that include it?\n\nSo for each house i (from 1 to n), we need to collect all restrictions that have l_i <= i <= r_i. Then, take the minimum x_i among those. Then, the maximum allowed height for house i is min( h, that minimum x_i ). If there are no such restrictions, then it's h.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize for each house, the maximum allowed height as h.\n\n2. For each restriction (l, r, x), for each position in l to r, we check if the current maximum allowed for that position is higher than x. If so, we set it to x. Because this restriction imposes that the position's height must be <=x.\n\nWait, but for a restriction (l, r, x), all positions in l to r must be <=x. So for each of those positions, their maximum allowed height is the minimum between their current value and x.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize an array max_heights of size n, with each element h.\n\nFor each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   for i from l to r:\n\n      if max_heights[i-1] > x:\n\n          max_heights[i-1] = x\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, the max_heights array holds the maximum allowed height for each house. Then, the sum of squares is the sum of (max_heights[i]^2) for each i.\n\nBut wait, why is this correct?\n\nBecause for each restriction, we are applying the constraint that in the interval [l, r], all houses are <=x. So for each house in that interval, the maximum allowed is the minimum between its previous value and x. So after processing all restrictions, each house's max_height is the minimal x_i across all restrictions that include it. And since h is the initial value, which is the maximum possible.\n\nYes. So this approach would correctly compute for each house the maximum possible height allowed by all constraints.\n\nThen, the answer is the sum of squares of these max_heights.\n\nThis seems very straightforward. Let me test it against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nInitial max_heights = [3,3,3]\n\nProcessing first restriction (1,1,1):\n\nfor i=1, set max_heights[0] = min(3, 1) = 1.\n\nNow max_heights is [1,3,3].\n\nSecond restriction (2,2,3): for i=2, current value is 3, which is equal to x=3. No change.\n\nThird restriction (3,3,2): for i=3, set to 2. Now [1,3,2]. Sum is 1 +9 +4 =14. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10. Initial max_heights [10,10,10,10].\n\nFirst restriction (2,3,8). For positions 2 and 3:\n\nposition 2: 10 vs 8 → 8.\n\nposition 3: 10 vs 8 → 8.\n\nNow max_heights is [10,8,8,10].\n\nSecond restriction (3,4,7). For positions 3 and 4:\n\nposition 3: 8 vs 7 → 7.\n\nposition 4: 10 vs 7 →7.\n\nFinal max_heights [10,8,7,7]. Sum 10² + 8² +7² +7² = 100+64+49+49= 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if there are overlapping restrictions. For example, suppose two restrictions on the same interval. One with x=5 and another with x=3. Then, the processing would set all positions in that interval to min(5,3)=3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: a restriction on [1,3] with x=5, and another on [2,2] with x=6. Then, for position 2, the maximum is min(5,6) =5. Because the first restriction applies to it. So the code would process the first restriction, setting positions 1-3 to 5. Then the second restriction (on 2-2, x=6) would check if current value (5) is higher than 6? No. So no change. So the max for position 2 is 5. Which is correct, because the first restriction requires that the max in [1,3] is <=5. So even though the second restriction allows position 2 to be 6, the first restriction limits it to 5.\n\nSo the code correctly handles overlapping restrictions.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to processing each restriction, and for each position in the interval, setting the maximum allowed height to the minimum between its current value and x_i.\n\nOnce that is done, the sum of squares is straightforward.\n\nSo the steps to code this are:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize max_heights as a list of h's, length n.\n\nThen for each of m restrictions:\n\n   read l, r, x.\n\n   for i in range l to r (inclusive):\n\n       if max_heights[i-1] > x:\n\n           max_heights[i-1] = x\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute sum of squares.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first line shows that the input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nWhich is two test cases. So the code needs to read multiple test cases. But how is the input provided? The problem says that the input is read from stdin. But in the sample input, the first line is a list of strings. But perhaps the actual input is given as multiple lines, each test case being a group of lines.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then, perhaps another test case? But the problem says that the input is given as per the sample. However, the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. Looking at the sample input, it's given as two separate test cases. But how is that possible?\n\nWait, the sample input is written as a list of two input strings, but in reality, the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input format is not clear. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. But the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the sample input shows two test cases. However, the problem's input format may be that there are multiple test cases. But the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m. But perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each with their own n, h, m.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the first input is a single test case, then another. However, the problem's input description may not mention that. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem's input says:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m (1 ≤ n,h,m ≤ 50) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions. Each of the next m lines contains three integers l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nBut the sample input shows two separate test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases until EOF. But how?\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as two separate test cases. For example, the first test case is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nThe second test case is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo the code should read all test cases, each starting with a line with n, h, m, followed by m lines of restrictions.\n\nBut how to read them? The code should read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input shows two test cases, and the output is two lines. So the code needs to process multiple test cases, each as per the input format.\n\nBut how to read them? Because in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process each test case accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let me think. For example, the code can read all input lines, split into tokens, and process each test case in turn.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to handle a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. However, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as a list of two input strings, and the output is a list of two outputs. So the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each of which is given in the input.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process each test case.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to read from stdin, and for each test case, read n, h, m, then m lines. So for example, in the sample input, there are two test cases. The first test case's input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nThe second test case's input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo the code should read all the input lines, and process each test case.\n\nBut how to know when the input ends? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes multiple test cases are given, and the code must process all of them. So for example, the code can read all lines, and process them as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. Then, for each test case, read the first line (n, h, m), then read m lines for the restrictions. Then process the next test case.\n\nBut in Python, the standard way to read input is via input() or sys.stdin. So perhaps the code can read all lines at once, split into tokens, and process them.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let me think. For example, the code can read all input as a list of tokens. Then, process each test case by taking the first three tokens as n, h, m. Then take next 3*m tokens as the m restrictions.\n\nBut for the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich is 3 + 3*3 = 12 tokens. Then the second test case is 4 10 2 followed by 2*3=6 tokens. So total 12 + 6 = 18 tokens.\n\nBut in practice, the code can read all the input as a list of integers, and process them accordingly.\n\nBut how to read from stdin? Let me think.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all input at once, split into tokens, and process them.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nRead all input as a list of integers. Then, process each test case:\n\nWhile there are tokens left:\n\n   Read n, h, m.\n\n   Then read m*3 integers, which are the m restrictions (each l_i, r_i, x_i).\n\n   Process the test case.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nThe code can use sys.stdin.read().split() to get all tokens as a list of strings, then convert to integers.\n\nSo:\n\nimport sys\n\ndata = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\nThen, process the data as follows:\n\nindex = 0\n\nwhile index < len(data):\n\n   n = data[index]\n\n   h = data[index+1]\n\n   m = data[index+2]\n\n   index +=3\n\n   restrictions = []\n\n   for _ in range(m):\n\n       l = data[index]\n\n       r = data[index+1]\n\n       x = data[index+2]\n\n       restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\n       index +=3\n\n   # process this test case\n\n   # compute the max_heights array\n\n   max_heights = [h]*n\n\n   for l, r, x in restrictions:\n\n       for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n           if max_heights[i-1] > x:\n\n               max_heights[i-1] = x\n\n   total = sum( [a*a for a in max_heights] )\n\n   print(total)\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that the first test case's output is 14, and the second is 262. Let's see:\n\nFor the first test case, the code would process n=3, h=3, m=3. Restrictions are (1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2). So the code processes each restriction. For the first, l=1, r=1, x=1. So i runs from 1 to 1. For i=1, max_heights[0] is 3, which is >1, so set to 1. Then for the second restriction, l=2, r=2, x=3. For i=2, max_heights[1] is 3, which equals x, so no change. Third restriction l=3, r=3, x=2. i=3, max_heights[2] is 3, set to 2. Sum is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2 =14. Correct.\n\nSecond test case: n=4, h=10, m=2. Restrictions (2,3,8) and (3,4,7). So initial max_heights is [10,10,10,10]. Processing first restriction: for i from 2 to 3. For i=2, set to 8. i=3, set to 8. Now max_heights is [10,8,8,10]. Next restriction: l=3, r=4, x=7. For i=3: current is 8>7 → set to 7. i=4: current is 10>7 → set to 7. Now max_heights is [10,8,7,7]. sum is 100+64+49+49= 262. Correct.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple restrictions that affect the same interval? For example, a restriction that says [1,3] x=5 and another [1,3] x=4. Then, the code would process both, and the second one would set all positions to 4, which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when a restriction has x_i larger than h. For example, h=3, and a restriction on [1,1] x=5. Then, the code would set the max_heights[0] to min(3,5) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are no restrictions. Then, all houses are h, sum is n*h².\n\nAnother case: when a restriction is on a range that includes multiple houses, but some have already been restricted by previous restrictions.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases. So the code needs to process all of them.\n\nSo the code structure is as follows.\n\nRead all data as a list of integers.\n\nProcess each test case in turn.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(data):\n\n        n = data[idx]\n\n        h = data[idx+1]\n\n        m = data[idx+2]\n\n        idx +=3\n\n        restrictions = []\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n\n            l = data[idx]\n\n            r = data[idx+1]\n\n            x = data[idx+2]\n\n            restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\n            idx +=3\n\n        # process this test case\n\n        max_heights = [h] * n\n\n        for l, r, x in restrictions:\n\n            for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n                if max_heights[i-1] > x:\n\n                    max_heights[i-1] = x\n\n        total = sum( a*a for a in max_heights )\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that the first input is a single test case. However, in the sample input, the input is given as two test cases, and the code should output two lines.\n\nYes. So the code will process all test cases, and for each, print the result.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, let's test for the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe data list will be [3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,2,4,10,2,2,3,8,3,4,7].\n\nProcessing first test case:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nrestrictions are (1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2). As before.\n\nThen, the code prints 14.\n\nThen, the next test case:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2. Restrictions are (2,3,8) and (3,4,7). Output 262.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=1, restriction (1,1,3). The max_heights is [3]. sum is 9.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, h=5, m=1, restriction (1,2,3). So both houses can be 3. sum is 3² +3² = 18.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo this should be the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height, and each restriction imposes a maximum height constraint on a specific range of houses. The goal is to determine the optimal heights for each house to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by reading all input data and initializing an array to keep track of the maximum allowable height for each house, initially set to the given maximum height.\n2. **Apply Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the maximum allowable height for each house in the specified range to ensure it does not exceed the restriction's limit.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowable heights for each house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(data):\n        n = data[idx]\n        h = data[idx + 1]\n        m = data[idx + 2]\n        idx += 3\n        restrictions = []\n        for _ in range(m):\n            l = data[idx]\n            r = data[idx + 1]\n            x = data[idx + 2]\n            restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n            idx += 3\n        max_heights = [h] * n\n        for l, r, x in restrictions:\n            for i in range(l, r + 1):\n                if max_heights[i - 1] > x:\n                    max_heights[i - 1] = x\n        total = sum(a * a for a in max_heights)\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into a list of integers for easier processing.\n2. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize an array `max_heights` with the maximum height `h` for each house.\n3. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, iterate through the specified range of houses and update their maximum allowable height to be the minimum of their current value and the restriction's limit.\n4. **Profit Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the values in `max_heights`.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by setting each house's height to the highest possible value allowed by the constraints. The algorithm efficiently processes each restriction and updates the heights in linear time relative to the number of restrictions and houses, making it suitable for the given problem constraints.",
