After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject. The count of such students is the answer.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is n students and m subjects. Each student's marks are given as a string of m digits. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's student 1's marks for subjects 1, 2, 3.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the next n lines, each line being a string of m characters. Each character is a digit (so, convert them to integers maybe? Or compare as strings? Well, since comparing digits as numbers would be easier, perhaps convert each row into a list of integers.)\n3. For each subject (columns), find the maximum value. For example, for subject j (0-based?), look at all students' marks in that column and find the max.\n4. Then, for each student, check if in any of the m subjects, their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, then they are successful.\n5. Count how many such students there are.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Process the input into a 2D array (list of lists) where each row is a student's marks as integers.\n- For each column (subject), compute the maximum value.\n- For each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the maximum of that column. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nNow, how to handle the columns?\n\nFor example, let's say the data is stored as a list of lists. For each column j (from 0 to m-1), collect all the values from each row's j-th position, then take the max.\n\nOnce we have the max for each column, then for each student, iterate through their marks and see if any of them is equal to the corresponding column's max.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe data would be:\n\nStudent 0: [2, 2, 3]\nStudent 1: [2, 3, 2]\nStudent 2: [1, 1, 2]\n\nFor each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nColumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2\nColumn 1: 2, 3, 1 → max is 3\nColumn 2: 3, 2, 2 → max is 3\n\nThen, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: check if any of their marks equals the column's max. For column 0, 2 equals max (2). So yes. So this student is successful.\n\nStudent 1: in column 1, 3 equals max (3). So yes.\n\nStudent 2: none of their marks are equal to the column max. For column 0, he has 1 < 2. Column 1: 1 <3. Column 2: 2 <3. So not successful. So total is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string. Then convert each string into a list of integers. For example, for the first line '223', it becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have that, for each column j in 0..m-1, compute the max of the j-th elements across all students.\n\nOnce we have these max values per column, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns equals the max for that column.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. For each line, convert into a list of integers. So, for example, for line in input_lines[1:], we can do something like:\n\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nThen, for each column j, compute the max.\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nOnce that's done, for each student (each row in grades), check if any of their marks in the columns equals the corresponding max_per_subject[j].\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if all students have the same marks in all subjects? Then, for each subject, the max is that value. So every student is successful, because each has at least one subject where they are the best (since all are same). So the count would be n.\n\nAnother case: when multiple students have the same max in a subject. For example, two students have 9 in a subject. Then both are considered as best in that subject. So each of them would be successful.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. Then the single student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=5. All marks are 5. Then the student is successful because for each subject, he is the best.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nIn Python, read the input. But the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the problem says that the input is given via standard input. So, for example, in the first sample input, the first line is '3 3', then three lines for the students.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of strings. But in the actual code, the code must read from stdin. So for the code, the input will be read as follows:\n\nThe first line is n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of strings, but that's probably for the test cases. The actual code needs to read from stdin.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string of m digits.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nThen compute max_per_subject as discussed.\n\nThen, for each student in grades, check if any of their marks equals the max in that column.\n\nNow, code for that:\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > current_max:\n            current_max = grades[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(current_max)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nBut for each j, the code is taking the max of all the students' j-th marks.\n\nOnce that is done, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max_per_subject for that column.\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\ngrades becomes:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: max(2, 2, 1) = 2\n\ncolumn 1: max(2,3,1) = 3\n\ncolumn 2: max(3,2,2) = 3\n\nso max_per_subject is [2,3,3]\n\nThen, for each student:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]. Check:\n\nj=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]. j=1: 3 == 3 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]. j=0: 1 < 2. j=1: 1 <3. j=2: 2 <3. no. so not counted.\n\ntotal is 2 → correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ngrades:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject:\n\ncolumn 0: max(9,1,1) → 9\n\ncolumn 1: max(1,1,1) →1\n\ncolumn 2: max(7,8,1) →8\n\ncolumn 3: max(2,2,1) →2\n\ncolumn4: max(8,8,1) →8\n\nso max_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow check each student:\n\nstudent 0: has 9 in column 0 (max is 9) → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 1: in column 2, 8 equals max (8). So yes.\n\nstudent 2: check each column. column 1: 1 equals max (1). So yes. So all three students are counted. So output is 3 → correct.\n\nSo code works for sample inputs.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, what about if a student has multiple subjects where they are best? Like, in the first sample, student 1 is best in subject 0 and 1. But the code counts him once. Because once any of the subjects is found, we break and count him. So that's correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line converted into a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_per_subject for each column.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max for that column.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in Python, for the first part, when reading the input, what if the input lines have leading or trailing spaces? Well, the problem says that each line is m characters, so the input lines are exactly m characters long. So using strip() may not be correct. Wait, no. For example, if the input line is '223', then input().strip() would be '223', which is correct. But if the line has leading or trailing whitespace, but according to the problem statement, the input is correct. So the problem says that each line has m characters. So perhaps using input().strip() is not necessary. However, in practice, when reading from stdin, the input lines may have leading/trailing whitespace, but according to the problem statement, the input is correct. So perhaps better to read the line as input().strip().\n\nBut for example, if the input line is '223', then input().strip() is '223', which is correct. So the code is okay.\n\nTesting with the sample input.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when n=1 and m=1. Then the student is counted as successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Both have 5. Then both are successful.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, this should be the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark than them in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook data.\n2. **Data Conversion**: Convert each row of the gradebook into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in at least one subject. If so, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is parsed to get the number of students (n) and subjects (m). The subsequent lines are read as strings and converted into lists of integers representing the marks of each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column in the gradebook), we iterate through all students to find the highest mark achieved in that subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, we check if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If it does, the student is counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is suitable given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
