Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The conversion rate is 'b' used candles to make one new one. And this new candle can be used again, so it's a loop.\n\nThe example given is when a=4 and b=2. The output is 7. Let me think through that example. \n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles, so 4 hours. Then, he has 4 used candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So he uses those, adding 2 hours. Now, he has 2 used ones. Again, he can make 2/2 = 1 new. That adds 1 hour. Now he has 1 used candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Right.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3. Output is 8. Let's check. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 used, make 6/3=2 new. Use them, 2 hours. Now 2 used, not enough for 3. Wait, but wait. Wait, 2 is less than 3. So total is 6+2=8. But wait, what if there's a way to collect more? Like, maybe after making the 2 new, you have 2 used ones. Then, maybe you can't make any more. So yes, 8 is correct.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the total hours and the number of used candles. Each time, we can use the used candles to make new ones, and add to the total hours. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStart with total_hours = a, and used_candles = a.\n\nThen, while used_candles >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used_candles // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    used_candles = (used_candles % b) + new_candles\n\nRepeat until used_candles < b.\n\nYes, that seems right. Because each time you take the used candles, convert as many as possible into new ones. The remainder (used_candles % b) plus the new ones (which are now used after burning) becomes the new used_candles for the next iteration.\n\nSo for example, the first case:\n\na=4, b=2. \n\ntotal_hours = 4, used_candles =4.\n\nLoop: 4 >= 2. new_candles = 4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. used_candles is 4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2. new_candles=1. total is 6+1=7. used_candles is 0 +1=1. Now, 1 <2, exit. Total is 7.\n\nYes. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours =6, used=6.\n\nLoop: 6//3=2. total 6+2=8. used = 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. Exit. So total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. used=5. Then 5//5=1. total becomes 6. used is 0 +1=1. Now stop. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 5. used=5.\n\nFirst iteration: 5//3=1. total becomes 5+1=6. used is 5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nSecond iteration: 3//3=1. total becomes 6+1=7. used is 0 +1=1. Now stop. So total is 7.\n\nYes. So the algorithm works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a, used = a.\n\nWhile used >= b:\n\n   new = used // b\n\n   total += new\n\n   used = (used % b) + new\n\nReturn total.\n\nSo the code in Python would be straightforward.\n\nNow, handling input. The input is two integers per line, but the sample shows that the input is given as a list of inputs, like ['4 2', '6 3'], but in the actual problem, the input is a single line. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput is a single line with two integers. Wait, the sample shows that the input is given as two lines? Or perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The single line contains two integers a and b. So for each test case, it's one line. But the sample shows two inputs, like ['4 2', '6 3'] as input, and outputs ['7', '8']. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is a single line. Oh, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads one line of input. Wait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem by writing a Python script that reads input from stdin and prints to stdout. So perhaps the input is multiple lines? Or perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code handles a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers. So for example, in the sample input, the user provided two test cases, but perhaps that's just for the example. But in reality, the code should read a single line of input. So for example, when the input is '4 2', the code outputs 7. Similarly for '6 3' gives 8.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of two lines. But perhaps that's just for the example, but the actual code is supposed to read one line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The single line contains two integers a and b. So the code should read a single line. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case per run.\n\nSo the code should read a line, split into a and b, compute the answer, and print.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nCompute the total as per the algorithm above.\n\nPrint the total.\n\nSo in Python:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = used % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the sample input:\n\nFor 4 2:\n\ntotal starts as 4, used is 4.\n\nLoop: 4//2=2. total becomes 6. used is 0 + 2=2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total 7. used is 0 +1=1. Now stop. Output 7. Correct.\n\nFor 6 3:\n\ntotal is 6, used 6.\n\nLoop: 6//3=2. total 8. used is 0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. Done. Output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 6. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Output is 7. As discussed.\n\nWhat about a=1, b=2. Then total is 1. Because used is 1, which is less than 2. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Then initial total is 2. used is 2. Loop: 2//2=1. total becomes 3. used is 0 +1=1. Now stop. So output 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when a is zero? But according to the problem statement, a is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nEdge cases: a=1, b=2. Output 1. a=1, b=1? But according to the input constraints, b is at least 2. So no. So the code is okay.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out candles to create new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and reusing the remnants optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours initially.\n2. **Track Used Candles**: After burning all initial candles, collect the used ones and convert them into new candles based on the given ratio `b`.\n3. **Iterative Conversion**: Continue converting used candles into new ones as long as there are enough used candles to meet the conversion ratio `b`. Each conversion adds more hours of light and generates new used candles.\n4. **Termination Condition**: Stop when there are not enough used candles left to form a new candle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = used % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the input values `a` (initial candles) and `b` (conversion ratio). Initialize `total` to `a` because each initial candle burns for one hour. Track the number of used candles in `used`.\n2. **Conversion Loop**: While there are enough used candles to convert into new ones (`used >= b`):\n   - Calculate the number of new candles that can be made from the used ones.\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours of light.\n   - Update the count of used candles to include both the leftover used candles (after conversion) and the newly created ones.\n3. **Output Result**: Print the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of reusing candles and ensures optimal use of available resources, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
