The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to set their signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what configurations of towers are valid. For example, in the first sample where n=2, the only valid case is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then each can have power 1, covering their own town and nothing else. But if only one tower is built, say town 1, then it would need to cover town 2, but then town 2 would be covered by town 1's signal (since |2-1| < p. If p is 2, then town 2 is covered. But then town 0 would be at distance 1 from town 1, which is less than p=2, so town 0 would get signal. Which is not allowed. So that's invalid. Hence, only when both towers are present, and set to power 1, which works.\n\nSo the key seems to be that the towers must be arranged in such a way that they can cover exactly the towns between them without overlapping in a way that causes overlaps or coverage of 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, how can we model this? Maybe the valid tower configurations are those where the towers are placed in such a way that they can be partitioned into non-overlapping ranges, each covered by exactly one tower. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the constraints for the signal setup. For each tower, its signal power must be set so that it covers certain towns, but not others. For instance, if there's a tower at position i, then its signal power p must be such that it covers some towns, but not town 0 or n+1. Also, every town must be covered exactly once.\n\nLet me think about the necessary conditions for the tower placements. Suppose there's a tower at position i. The signal power p must be at least 1. But if the tower is at position i, then the maximum possible p that doesn't reach town 0 is p <= i (since |i - 0| = i. So if p is larger than i, then town 0 would be covered. Similarly, for town n+1, the distance from i is (n+1 - i). So p must be <= n+1 - i. Therefore, the maximum possible p for a tower at i is min(i, n+1 - i). But since the signal must not reach 0 or n+1, the p must be at most min(i, n+1 -i). Wait, but if the tower is placed in town i, then to avoid covering town 0, the signal power p must be such that p <= i. Because |0 - i| = i, and the signal reaches cities c where |c - i| < p. So for town 0 to not be covered, we need that i >= p. Similarly for town n+1: (n+1 - i) >= p. So the maximum p for the tower at i is min(i, n+1 -i). But for the tower to cover some towns, p must be at least 1. So for the tower to be useful, it must be possible to choose a p such that it covers some towns, but not 0 or n+1.\n\nBut how does this relate to the arrangement of the towers? For example, if there's a tower at i, then perhaps the optimal way is to set p to exactly the minimal possible to cover certain towns. But maybe the problem reduces to the towers being arranged in a way that they form a partition of the towns 1..n into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. And each tower's coverage is exactly the interval [i - p + 1, i + p - 1], but since p is chosen such that it doesn't reach 0 or n+1.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as requiring that the towers are placed in such a way that there's a way to assign ranges to them, such that each range is covered by exactly one tower, and the ranges don't overlap. Also, the ranges must cover all towns 1..n.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the configuration of towers must be such that they can be partitioned into pairs of towers where each pair is adjacent, or something like that. Or perhaps the towers must be placed in a way that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain spacing.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For the signal setup to work, the towers must be arranged in such a way that there's a way to assign each tower a range that covers exactly some towns, and these ranges don't overlap",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Configurations**: A valid configuration of towers must allow for setting signal powers such that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once, and towns 0 and n+1 are not covered at all. This can be achieved if the towers are placed in such a way that they can be partitioned into intervals where each interval is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The recurrence relation is derived based on whether the i-th town has a tower or not:\n   - If the i-th town has a tower, it can cover itself and possibly some previous towns.\n   - If the i-th town does not have a tower, the configuration up to i-1 must be valid.\n\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently. We also compute modular inverses using Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: place a tower at i, and it covers i and maybe previous ones\n        # To ensure that the previous part is valid up to i-1 - p, but here we consider that\n        # the tower at i can cover i, so the previous part must be valid up to i-1\n        # However, since the tower at i can be set to power 1, which only covers i\n        # So we can add dp[i-1]\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]  # case where there's no tower at i, but this is not correct\n        \n        # Case 2: place a tower at i, and it covers i and possibly some previous\n        # For the tower at i, it can be set to power 1, which only covers i.

The recurrence relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` is used to build up the solution based on the valid configurations of smaller subproblems.\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: We use modular exponentiation to compute the modular inverse of `2^n` efficiently, which is necessary to compute the probability as a fraction modulo 998244353.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution runs in O(n) time and uses O(n) space, which is efficient for the given constraints (n â‰¤ 200000).",
