Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered in those gaps. Because the worst case is the largest gap between two adjacent lanterns. But wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if a lantern is at the start (0), then the first part is covered up to some point. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo here's the plan: \n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the gaps between consecutive ones can't be determined properly. \n2. After sorting, check the gaps between each pair of consecutive lanterns. For each gap, the maximum distance from the middle of that gap to either end would be half the gap's size. Because if you have two lanterns at positions a and b, the area between them is covered by their lights. The maximum distance needed would be (b - a)/2. But wait, no. Wait, suppose the gap between two lanterns is g. Then the maximum distance from the center of the gap to either lantern is g/2. So the required d for that gap is g/2. Because the lanterns' coverage areas must overlap in the middle. But if the gap is larger than 2d, then there's a part not covered. So the minimal d must be the maximum of all these (gap/2) values. \n\nBut also, we need to check the ends. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is some value. Similarly, if the last lantern is not at l, then the distance from the last lantern to l is another value. These would need to be considered as well. Because the first lantern's coverage starts from its position minus d, and the last lantern's coverage ends at its position plus d. So for the entire street to be covered, the first lantern's coverage must reach 0, and the last's must reach l. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the first lantern is at position a1. Then the left end of the street (0) must be within d of some lantern. So if the first lantern is at a1, then 0 must be within d of a1. Which means that a1 - 0 <= d. So d must be at least a1. Similarly, for the last lantern at an, the distance from an to l must be <=d. So l - an <=d. \n\nBut if the lanterns are sorted, then the first lantern is the first in the sorted list. So for example, if the first lantern is at position a[0], then the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. So d needs to be at least that. Similarly for the last lantern. \n\nBut then, the maximum between these two and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance from 0 to the first lantern. That's a[0] - 0. So d must be at least that.\n- Compute the distance from the last lantern to l. That's l - a[-1]. So d must be at least that.\n- Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference between them (current - previous). The maximum of these differences divided by two is the required d for that gap. \n- The overall answer is the maximum between the initial distance, the final distance, and the maximum (gap/2) from the consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, but why is it the maximum between those values?\n\nBecause for the initial part, if the first lantern is at a[0], then the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. So the radius needs to be at least that, otherwise the area from 0 to a[0] -d is not covered. Similarly for the end.\n\nFor the gaps between lanterns, the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns is say, g. Then the minimal d required for that gap is (g)/2. Because if you have two lanterns at positions x and y (x < y), then the middle point between them is (x + y)/2. The distance from x to that point is (y -x)/2. So the d must be at least that. Otherwise, the middle point is not covered by either lantern. \n\nSo the overall minimal d is the maximum among all these three possibilities: initial, final, and max_gap/2.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array of lanterns.\n\nCompute initial = a[",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the minimum light radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street, we need to analyze the gaps between lanterns and their distances from the ends of the street. Here's a breakdown of the approach:\n\n---\n\n### **Approach Overview**\n\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**:\n   - The lanterns' positions are given in an arbitrary order. Sorting them helps identify the largest gap between consecutive lanterns efficiently.\n\n2. **Determine Edge Coverage**:\n   - The first lantern might not be at the start of the street (position `0`). Thus, we need to ensure that its light reaches the start.\n   - Similarly, the last lantern might not be at the end of the street (position `l`), so we must check if its light covers the end.\n\n3. **Evaluate Gaps Between Lanterns**:\n   - For each pair of adjacent lanterns, calculate the distance between them. The worst-case scenario is when the middle of this gap is not covered by either lantern, which requires the light radius to be at least half of the gap size.\n\n4. **Compute the Result**:\n   - The minimal radius required is the maximum of:\n     - Distance from the beginning of the street to the first lantern.\n     - Distance from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n     - Half of the largest gap between two consecutive lanterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code Implementation**\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n\n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, l = map(int, line.split())\n        a = list(map(int, data[data.index(line) + 1].split()))\n        a.sort()\n        max_gap = 0\n        # Check the first lantern's distance from 0\n        first_dist = a[0]\n        # Check the last lantern's distance from l\n        last_dist = l - a[-1]\n        # Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i - 1]\n            if gap > max_gap:\n                max_gap = gap\n        # Compute the required d\n        d = max(first_dist, last_dist, max_gap / 2)\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Key Parts**\n\n- **Sorting**: Ensures that the lanterns are in increasing order, allowing us to find the largest gap between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Edge Checks**: Ensure that the start (`0`) and end (`l`) of the street are covered by the first and last lanterns respectively.\n- **Gap Calculation**: The maximum gap between any two adjacent lanterns determines the worst-case coverage requirement.\n- **Precision**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis solution ensures that all parts of the street are illuminated with the minimal possible light radius `d`, efficiently handling edge cases and ensuring correctness.",
