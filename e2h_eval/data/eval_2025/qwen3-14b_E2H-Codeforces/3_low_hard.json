Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l. \n\nFirst, I think the approach here is to sort the lantern positions. Because if they are sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered. Because the worst case is between two adjacent lanterns. Also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine part of the required d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's my plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance between the start of the street (0) and the first lantern. The required d must be at least half of that distance, because the lantern's light can cover up to d from its position. So if the first lantern is at a1, then the area from 0 to a1 - d must be covered. Wait, no. Wait, the lantern's coverage is from a_i -d to a_i +d. But since the street is from 0 to l, the coverage can't go beyond those. So for the first lantern, the leftmost point is 0. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a1 - 0. The maximum distance that needs to be covered here is (a1 - 0) / 2. Because if the lantern's coverage extends to 0, then d must be at least a1 - 0. But wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the first lantern is at position a. Then the left end of the street is 0. The lantern's coverage can reach from a -d to a +d. To cover 0, we need that a -d ≤ 0. So d ≥ a - 0. But wait, that's not right. Let me think: For the lantern at position a, the leftmost point it can cover is a -d. To cover 0, a -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a. But that's only if the lantern is to the right of 0. But if the lantern is at 0, then d can be zero. But in the case where the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. So the required d for covering 0 is a1, but that's only if there's no other lantern to the left. But since the lanterns are sorted, the first lantern is the leftmost. So the maximum distance between 0 and the first lantern's position is a1. So the required d must be at least a1. But wait, no. Because the lantern's coverage can extend to the left. So if the lantern is at a1, then the coverage starts at a1 -d. To cover 0, a1 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. But that's the case where the lantern's coverage reaches exactly to 0. However, if there's a gap between the left end and the first lantern, then the required d must be at least that distance. Similarly for the right end.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. For example, after sorting the lanterns, the gaps between consecutive ones are important. For each gap between two lanterns, say between a[i] and a[i+1], the maximum distance that needs to be covered is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. Because the optimal placement would be that each lantern covers up to the middle of the gap. For example, if two lanterns are 5 units apart, then the middle is at 2.5 units from each. So the required d would be 2.5. Because each lantern's coverage would reach halfway towards the other. So the maximum of all these gaps divided by two is part of the answer. But also, we need to check the first and last parts.\n\nFor example, the first lantern's position is a[0]. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. The required d must be at least a[0], because the lantern's coverage needs to reach 0. Wait, no. Because if the lantern is at a[0], then the coverage extends from a[0] -d to a[0]+d. To cover 0, a[0] -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a[0]. But that would mean that the left end is covered. However, if there's a lantern at a[0], then the left end is covered if d is at least a[0]. But",
    "response": "To solve the problem of finding the minimum light radius `d` required for all points on a street of length `l` to be illuminated by lanterns placed at positions `a_i`, we can follow this structured approach:\n\n---\n\n### **Approach Overview**\n\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps us efficiently compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Edge Cases**:\n   - The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern.\n   - The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Compute Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each adjacent pair of lanterns, compute the gap and determine the required radius to cover that gap.\n4. **Determine Maximum Required Radius**: The minimum required radius is the maximum among:\n   - Half the distance from the start to the first lantern.\n   - Half the distance from the last lantern to the end.\n   - Half the largest gap between any two adjacent lanterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Details**\n\n- We use Python's built-in sort function to sort the list of lantern positions.\n- We iterate through the sorted list to find the maximum gap between adjacent lanterns.\n- Finally, we compare the three potential maximum radii and return the largest one.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, l = map(int, line.split())\n        a = list(map(int, data[data.index(line) + 1].split()))\n        a.sort()\n        \n        max_d = 0.0\n        \n        # Check the beginning of the street\n        max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n        \n        # Check the end of the street\n        max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n        \n        # Check gaps between lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i - 1]\n            current_d = gap / 2.0\n            max_d = max(max_d, current_d)\n        \n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Example Walkthrough**\n\n#### Input:\n```\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n```\n\nAfter sorting: `[0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]`\n\n- Start to first lantern: 0 → d = 0\n- End to last lantern: 15 → d = 0\n- Largest gap between lanterns is 14 - 9 = 5 → d = 2.5\n\nSo, the answer is `2.5`.\n\n---\n\nThis solution ensures that all parts of the street are covered with the minimal possible radius `d`, using efficient sorting and linear iteration over the lantern positions. It also handles edge cases such as when lanterns are at the ends of the street or when multiple lanterns are at the same position.",
