She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem says that each second she can move left or right, or close tabs on one side. So, the challenge is figuring out the optimal sequence of moves and closes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the initial state is. The browser has n tabs, and the cursor is at position pos. The goal is to have only tabs from l to r open. So any tabs outside this range need to be closed. But how?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. Let's consider the positions of l and r relative to the current pos. For example, if the current pos is already within [l, r], maybe we don't need to do anything if l and r are the entire range. But otherwise, we need to close tabs to the left or right.\n\nWait, but the closing operations can be done once you are at a certain position. For example, to close all tabs to the left of the cursor, you need to be at some position i, and then perform that close. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo the idea is to find the optimal way to reach positions where you can close the necessary tabs with minimal steps.\n\nLet me break down the problem. The tabs that need to be closed are those less than l and those greater than r. So, we need to close all tabs to the left of l (if any) and to the right of r (if any).\n\nBut how do we do that? Let's think about the steps required for each case.\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, maybe we don't need to do anything if l=1 and r=n. Otherwise, we might need to close tabs on either side.\n\nBut even if the current position is inside [l, r], perhaps we need to move to certain positions to close the tabs outside. For example, if l is 2 and r is 4, and the current position is 3. Then, we need to close tabs to the left of 2 (tabs 1) and to the right of 4 (tabs 5, 6, etc). How can we do that?\n\nTo close tabs to the left of l, you need to be at position l and then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, you need to be at position r and close all tabs to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can close them from other positions. Wait, no. Because when you close tabs to the left of the cursor, it closes all tabs from a (the current min) up to i-1. So, for example, if you are at position l, then closing left would close all tabs from a (which is 1, assuming nothing was closed before) up to l-1. Which is exactly what we need. Similarly for closing right.\n\nSo the optimal way would be to first close the left side and then the right, or vice versa. But how do we get to the positions where we can perform these closes?\n\nLet me think about the steps needed:\n\nSuppose we need to close tabs to the left of l. So, we need to reach position l. Then, close all tabs to the left. Similarly, for the right side, reach position r and close all to the right.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range? Let's take an example.\n\nTake the second example input: 6 3 1 3. The output is 1. Because the current position is 3, which is in the [1,3] range. So she can just close all tabs to the right (since r is 3). So moving to position 3 (already there), then close right. That takes 1 second.\n\nSo the steps are: moving to the position where you can close the tabs. So for the left side, you need to reach l, and for the right, reach r.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nIf the current pos is not in [l, r], then we need to move to the correct position (either l or r) and then close. But also, perhaps there's a way to close both sides with fewer steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the steps required for each scenario.\n\nLet me first determine whether we need to close tabs on the left and/or right.\n\nIf l > 1, then there are tabs to the left of l that need to be closed. Similarly, if r < n, then there are tabs to the right of r that need to be closed.\n\nSo, for each of these two possibilities (left and right), we need to find the steps required.\n\nLet me consider the steps required to close the left side. To close the left side, we need to reach l, then perform a close-left operation. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut what if we can close both sides from the same position? Well, no. Because once you close one side, the a and b values change. For example, if you close the left side first, then the a becomes l. Then, to close the right side, you need to be at r, which is in the current a and b (since after closing left, the tabs are from l to n). So, in that case, moving to r would be possible.\n\nBut the order of closing left and right may affect the steps needed.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps is to first close left, then close right, or vice versa. Or maybe there's a way to do it in a smarter way.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps is to compute the time needed to reach the position for closing left, then the time to reach the position for closing right (after closing left), plus the time for the two close operations. Similarly for the reverse order.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think of the steps required.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFor example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nSo, the desired range is 2-4. So, need to close tabs 1 (left of l=2) and 5,6 (right of r=4).\n\nThe optimal steps are:\n\nMove to 2 (from 3, takes 1 step). Close left (tabs 1). Then move to 4 (from 2, takes 2 steps). Close right (tabs 5 and 6). Total steps: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5? Wait, but each close operation is 1 second, and each move is 1 second per step.\n\nWait, the movement steps are per second. So moving from pos 3 to 2 is 1 second. Then closing left is another second. Then moving from 2 to 4 is two steps (to 3, then to 4) which is two seconds. Then closing right is another second. So total 1+1 + 2 +1 = 5 seconds. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nTime to reach l (2) from current position (3): 1 sec.\n\nClose left: 1 sec.\n\nTime to reach r (4) from l (2): 2 sec.\n\nClose right: 1 sec.\n\nTotal 1+1 + 2 +1 = 5.\n\nBut what if we first close the right, then the left?\n\nIn that case, the steps would be:\n\nCurrent pos is 3. Need to reach r=4. That takes 1 sec. Close right (tabs 5,6) in 1 sec. Then need to reach l=2. From 4, moving left to 3, then to 2: 2 steps. Then close left: 1 sec. Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Same as before.\n\nSo the order doesn't matter here. But in some cases, maybe it's better to do one or the other.\n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nIf we need to close both left and right, then the total steps would be:\n\nsteps to reach l (or r) + 1 (for closing) + steps to reach r (or l) from l (or r) + 1 (for closing).\n\nBut how do we calculate the steps to reach l and r?\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if the current position is already in the [l, r] range, then perhaps we can reach l or r in minimal steps.\n\nLet me think about the steps required to reach l and r.\n\nFor example, suppose that the current position is pos, and we need to reach l. The steps required would be |pos - l|.\n\nSimilarly for reaching r: |pos - r|.\n\nBut when you have to close both left and right, you need to reach one of them, then reach the other. But the order may affect the total steps.\n\nFor example, if we have to reach l first, then reach r from l, or reach r first, then reach l from r.\n\nWhich one is shorter?\n\nWell, the total steps for the two movements would be:\n\nOption 1: reach l first, then reach r from l: steps = |pos - l| + |l - r|.\n\nOption 2: reach r first, then reach l from r: steps = |pos - r| + |r - l|.\n\nBut since |l - r| is same as |r - l|, the difference between the two options is |pos - l| vs |pos - r|.\n\nSo, the minimal steps between the two options is min( |pos - l| + |l - r| , |pos - r| + |l - r| ) ?\n\nWait no, because |pos - l| + |l - r| equals |pos - r| + |l - r| if pos is on the same side of l and r. Wait no, that's not true. For example, if l is 2, r is 4, and pos is 3. Then |pos - l| is 1, |pos - r| is 1. So the total steps for option 1 is 1 + 2 (since l-r is 2) = 3. Option 2 is 1 + 2 = 3. So same.\n\nBut if pos is 1, l is 2, r is 4. Then option 1: steps to reach l is 1, then steps to reach r is 2. Total 3. Option 2: steps to reach r is 3, then steps to reach l is 2 (from r=4 to l=2 is 2 steps). So total 3 + 2 = 5. So option 1 is better.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal steps would be to reach l first, then go to r.\n\nSo the minimal steps for the movement part is min( |pos - l| + |l - r|, |pos - r| + |l - r| ) ? No, because the |l - r| is the same in both. So the difference is between |pos - l| and |pos - r|. So the minimal between the two options is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |l - r|.\n\nBut that's the same as |pos - l| + |l - r| if |pos - l| is smaller than |pos - r|, else |pos - r| + |l - r|.\n\nBut in any case, the minimal movement steps would be (distance from pos to l or r) + (distance between l and r).\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, we need to reach l and r, but the order depends on which is closer. So the minimal movement steps would be (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) ) + (distance between l and r).\n\nBut in addition, we have to add 2 seconds for the two closing operations.\n\nSo the total steps for closing both left and right would be:\n\nmovement_steps + 2.\n\nBut wait, movement_steps is the steps to reach one of the ends (l or r) and then the steps to reach the other end. So for example, if we choose to go to l first, then to r, that's |pos - l| steps to reach l, then |l - r| steps to reach r. So movement_steps = |pos - l| + |l - r|. Then, adding 2 for the two closes.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, pos is between l and r. Then, the steps to reach l is (pos - l) steps (if pos is to the right of l). Then, steps to reach r from l is (r - l) steps. So movement steps would be (pos - l) + (r - l) steps. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut perhaps the formula holds regardless of the position.\n\nSo, putting this together, the total steps for the case where both left and right need to be closed is:\n\nmovement_steps + 2.\n\nBut movement_steps is the minimal steps between the two options (reach l first, then r, or reach r first, then l).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, movement_steps can be calculated as:\n\nIf we need to reach l and then reach r, the steps are |pos - l| + |l - r|.\n\nIf we need to reach r and then reach l, the steps are |pos - r| + |r - l|.\n\nBut since |r - l| is same as |l - r|, the total steps is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |l - r|.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if the current position is already in between l and r, then maybe we can reach l and then r, or vice versa, but the steps would be the same.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps is (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) or (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l). Which is the same as the distance between pos and l plus the distance between l and r, or between pos and r plus the same.\n\nBut that's the same as (distance between pos and l) + (r - l) or (distance between pos and r) + (r - l). So the minimal between the two is (min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )) + (r - l).\n\nBut then, the total steps for movement is that value.\n\nSo, the total steps for both closing left and right is:\n\nmin( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut wait, why 2? Because each closing operation is 1 second. So, if we have to close left and right, that's 2 operations, each taking 1 second.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in [l, r]?\n\nLet me take the example where l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) is 1. (r-l) is 2. So movement steps is 1 + 2 = 3. Add 2 for the closes. Total 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: if pos is already at l. So, for example, l=2, r=4, pos=2. Then min(0, 2) is 0. movement steps is 0 + 2 = 2. Add 2: 4. Which would be: close left (but pos is at l, so closing left would close tabs to the left of l (i.e., tabs 1). Then move to r (steps 2 steps from 2 to 4) and close right. So steps would be 0 (move to l) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move to r) + 1 (close right) = 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo that formula seems to work.\n\nNow, what about if we need to close only the left or only the right?\n\nFor example, if l=1 and r=5. Then, no need to close left. Only need to close right. So, steps would be the steps to reach r, then close right. So steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nOr, if the current pos is already at r, then steps is 1.\n\nAnother example: if l=2 and r=5, and the current pos is 3. So, need to close tabs to the left of l (tabs 1). So, steps are steps to reach l (2 steps from 3 to 2), then close left (1 sec). So total 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nBut what if the current pos is already in the [l, r] range and the left is already closed? Like, for example, if l=2 and r=5, and the current pos is 3. Then, to close the left, we need to move to l=2, which is 1 step. Then close left (1 sec). So total 2 steps.\n\nSo, for the case where only left needs to be closed, the steps would be steps to reach l (from current pos) plus 1.\n\nSimilarly, if only right needs to be closed, steps are steps to reach r (from current pos) plus 1.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nCheck whether we need to close left, right, both, or none.\n\nSo, first, check if l > 1: need to close left. Also check if r < n: need to close right.\n\nIf neither, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute the steps accordingly.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nCase 1: No need to close anything (l=1 and r=n). Output 0.\n\nCase 2: Need to close left and right.\n\nThen, steps = min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, but why? Because the movement steps are min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l), and then two closes.\n\nBut let me think again. For example, if you choose to go to l first, then to r. The movement steps are |pos - l| steps to reach l, then (r - l) steps to reach r. Then, two closes. So total steps is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSimilarly, if you choose to go to r first, then to l, it's |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2. But since (r - l) is fixed, the minimal between the two options is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nCase 3: Need to close left only.\n\nThen, steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBut why? Because you need to move to l (steps |pos - l|) and then close left (1 sec). But wait, what if you can close left without moving? Like, if you are already at l, then you can close left immediately. So steps is 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nYes.\n\nCase 4: Need to close right only.\n\nSteps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut what about when you are already at r? Then steps is 1.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ndetermine whether left needs to be closed (left_needed = l > 1) and right_needed = r < n.\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   steps = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n   steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n   steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let's take the sample input 2: input is 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. Since r is 3 < 6 (n=6), so right_needed is True. But l=1, so left_needed is False. So steps is |3 - 3| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: input is 5 2 1 5. Then l=1, r=5. So no need to close anything. Output 0. Which is the third sample.\n\nAnother example: input is 6 3 2 4. So left_needed is True (l=2>1), right_needed is True (r=4 <6). So steps is min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 ) + (4-2=2) + 2. So 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (since l=2>1) and right (r=3 <5). So steps is min( |1-2|=1, |1-3|=2 ) → 1 + (3-2=1) + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Let's see:\n\nMove to l=2 (steps 1). Close left (tabs 1). Then move to r=3 (steps 1). Close right (tabs 4,5). Total steps 1+1 + 2 = 4. Correct.\n\nBut what if the current pos is already in the [l, r] range? Let's say n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3. Then, need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 4,5). So steps: min( |3-2|=1, |3-3|=0 ) → 0. Then (r-l) is 1. So steps is 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. Let's see:\n\nMove to r (3) → 0 steps. Then move to l (2) → 1 step. Then close left (1 sec), then close right (1 sec). Wait, but the movement steps would be 0 (to reach r) + (r - l) = 1. So movement steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Then add 2 for the closes. So total 3. How?\n\nSequence:\n\nAt pos 3. Need to close left and right. So, perhaps first close right? But no. Because to close right, you need to be at r=3. So you can close right (tabs 4 and 5) in 1 step. Then, you need to close left (tabs 1). To do that, you need to be at l=2. So from pos 3, move to 2 (1 step) and close left (1 step). So total steps: 1 (close right) + 1 (move) + 1 (close left) = 3 steps. Which is correct. So the formula works.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) → |3-2|=1, |3-3|=0 → min is 0. Then (r-l) is 1. So 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nAnother case: need to close only left. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=5. So r is 5 which is equal to n. So right_needed is false. left_needed is l=2>1. So steps is |3-2| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Which would be: move to 2 (1 step), close left (1 step). Correct.\n\nAnother case: need to close only right. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=2. So steps is |3 - 2| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Which is: move to 2 (1 step), close right (tabs 3,4,5). Correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at the required position to close? For example, in the case where we need to close left, and pos is l. Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when l is 1 and r is less than n? Then, we need to close right. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut what if the current pos is already at r? Then steps is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needed = l > 1\n    right_needed = r < n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n        steps = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n    elif left_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        # This case is impossible since we checked l==1 and r==n earlier.\n        steps = 0\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r <n? Then, left_needed is false (l=1), right_needed is true. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut let's test the sample input 2:\n\nInput is 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. So left_needed is false (since l=1), right_needed is true (r=3 <6). So steps is |3 - 3| +1 = 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 6 3 2 4. So left_needed is true (2>1), right_needed is true (4<6). So steps is min(1, 1) + 2 + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 5 2 1 5. So l=1, r=5. So the first condition is true (l==1 and r==n). So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=1, l=1, r=3. So left_needed is false (l=1), right_needed is true (3 <5). So steps is |1-3| +1 = 2 +1 =3. Let's see:\n\nWe need to close tabs 4 and 5. To do that, we need to reach r=3. Current pos is 1. Steps to reach 3: 2 steps. Then close right (1 sec). Total 3 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=1, l=3, r=5. So left_needed is true (3>1), right_needed is false (r=5 ==n). So steps is |1-3| +1 = 2 +1 =3. Let's see: need to close tabs 1 and 2. To do that, need to reach l=3, then close left. Steps to reach 3: 2 steps. Close left (1 sec). Total 3 steps. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the current pos is already in the [l, r] range? For example, n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=5. So left_needed is false (l=3>1, but we need to close tabs to the left of l. Wait, no. Because l is 3. So the left_needed is l>1. So yes, l=3>1. So left_needed is true. But the current pos is in [l, r]. So need to close tabs to the left of l (tabs 1 and 2). So steps is |3-3| + 1 = 0 +1 =1. Which would be: at pos 3, close left. Which would close tabs from a (1) to 3-1=2. Correct. So steps is 1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this logic seems to cover all cases. But wait, what about when l=1 and r is less than n. For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. So need to close right. Steps is |pos - r| + 1. Suppose pos is 3. Then steps is 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is to the right of r? Like, n=5, pos=4, l=1, r=3. So need to close right. So steps is |4 - 3| +1 = 1 +1=2. Which would be: move left from 4 to 3 (1 step), close right (1 sec). Correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is to the left of l? Like, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (l=2>1) and right (r=3 <5). So steps is min( |1-2|=1, |1-3|=2 ) + (3-2) + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 =4. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the current pos is at 1, l=2, r=3. So steps:\n\nMove to l (2) → 1 step. Close left (tabs 1) → 1 sec. Then move to r (3) → 1 step. Close right (tabs 4 and 5) → 1 sec. Total 1+1 + 1 +1 =4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut wait, the code is written in Python. So read the input. The input is given as four integers. However, the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is the only line of input. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains four integer numbers... So the code should read a single line with four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code should read from standard input and output the answer. So perhaps the user is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows three test cases. But the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains four integer numbers...\n\nSo that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the sample input is presented as multiple lines for the purpose of the example, but in reality, the code must read one line per test case. Wait, perhaps the problem is in the style of programming competition where the input is multiple test cases, but the problem description says that the input is one line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains four integer numbers...\n\nSo the code must read a single line of input, which contains four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines. Which suggests that perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual code should read one line per test case. However, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the first test case, etc. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output the answer.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nSo the code should read a single line of input (four integers) and output a single integer.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. Which suggests that perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is one line. So perhaps the sample input is written as three separate test cases, but the actual code should read one line per test case. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. Therefore, the code should read one line of input, split into four integers, and output one line of output.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the format where the input is multiple lines. But the problem says \"the only line of input\". So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual code must read one line. But this is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers. The sample input shows three lines, which suggests that perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is a single line. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the input section, the problem says:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers...\n\nSo the code should read a single line of input, which contains four integers, and output a single integer.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. Which probably indicates that the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nSo the code should read four integers from the input, and output the answer for that case.\n\nTherefore, the code will read a single line, split into four integers.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input line: 6 3 2 4 → output 5.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code can be written in Python:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, check if l == 1 and r == n → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute left_needed and right_needed.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is less than n? Then, need to close right. So the code proceeds accordingly.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needed = l > 1\n    right_needed = r < n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    elif left_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        steps = 0\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what if l is 1 and r is less than n? Then, left_needed is false (l=1) and right_needed is true. So steps is abs(pos - r) + 1.\n\nBut what if the current pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 +1 =1. Which is correct.\n\nBut let me test the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. So since r <6, right_needed is true. So steps is |3-3| +1 → 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. So the first condition is true (l==1 and r ==n) → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 2 1 3 → l=1, r=3 <5. So steps is |2-3| +1 =1 +1=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is to the right of r? For example, n=5, pos=4, l=1, r=3. So steps is |4-3| +1 =1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the current pos is to the left of l? For example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So steps is |1-2| +1 =1 +1=2. Which is correct. Because moving to l=2 (1 step), close left (tabs 1) in 1 step. So total 2 steps.\n\nBut what if the current pos is to the left of l, and also need to close right?\n\nLike, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So need to close left and right. So steps is min( |1-2|=1, |1-3|=2 ) + (3-2) + 2 → 1 +1 +2 =4 steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the current pos is in between l and r?\n\nLike, n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=3. So need to close right (r=3 <5). steps is |2-3| +1 =1 +1=2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So need to close left",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified range [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The operations allowed include moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs on either side of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no action is needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Required Actions**: Check if tabs need to be closed on the left (l > 1) and/or on the right (r < n).\n3. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - **Both Left and Right Closures Needed**: Calculate the minimum steps to reach either end of the range [l, r], then move to the other end, and add the time for closing operations.\n   - **Only Left Closure Needed**: Calculate steps to reach the left end (l) and close tabs to the left.\n   - **Only Right Closure Needed**: Calculate steps to reach the right end (r) and close tabs to the right.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needed = l > 1\n    right_needed = r < n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    elif left_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        steps = 0\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] spans all tabs, no operations are needed.\n- **Left and Right Closures**: When both sides need closure, the optimal path involves moving to the nearest end of the range first, then moving to the other end, and performing the closures. This minimizes movement steps.\n- **Single Closure**: If only one side needs closure, the steps involve moving directly to the respective end of the range and performing the closure operation.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps required by leveraging the shortest path to the necessary positions and considering the required closure operations.",
