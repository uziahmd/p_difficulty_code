For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C again. Each consecutive pair is a semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is the number of steps from the first to the second in this order, considering the cyclic nature.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Let me check: C to C# is 1, then D (2), D# (3), E (4). Yes. So the distance from X to Y is calculated as (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if X is before Y, then it's straightforward. But if Y is before X, then the distance would be (Y's index + 12 - X's index)? Wait, no. Let me think. For example, if X is E and Y is C. The distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Because the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (Y - X) steps. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y))? Or maybe it's (Y's index - X's index) mod 12, but since the distance is always positive, maybe we need to compute the difference in positions considering the cyclic order.\n\nAlternatively, the distance between two notes can be calculated as (y - x) % 12, but when considering the direction. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the notes are arranged in a circle. The distance from X to Y along the scale (the number of semitones you move upwards from X to reach Y) is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index + 12 - x_index). For example, if X is C (index 0) and Y is E (index 4), then 4-0=4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8. Which matches the example given in the problem.\n\nSo the way to calculate the distance between X and Y (from X to Y) is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index + 12 - x_index). Alternatively, (y_index - x_index) mod 12, but since the distance is always positive, maybe that's not correct. Wait, mod 12 would give a value between 0 and 11. But for example, if X is C (0) and Y is C (0), the distance is zero. But according to the problem statement, the chord is made of three distinct notes? Wait, the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes. Are they allowed to be the same? Probably not, but the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But for the input, perhaps the three notes are distinct. But the problem says that the input is three notes, but perhaps they could be same? Well, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. But perhaps the code can assume that the three notes are distinct. But maybe not. Anyway, the code should process the input as given.\n\nBut for the problem, the code needs to check all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4, and second to third is 3 (for major). Or first to second is 3, and second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Convert the three notes into their indices (like C is 0, C# is 1, etc.)\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of the three notes. Since the order matters for checking the distances.\n\n3. For each permutation, check if it satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\n4. If any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate the permutations? Since there are three elements, there are 3! = 6 permutations. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 (major), or",
