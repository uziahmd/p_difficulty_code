For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic with 12 notes.\n\nEach consecutive pair is a semitone, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem says that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. For example, C to E is 4 semitones. Let me check that. Let's see:\n\nC to C# is 1 semitone. Then C to D is 2, C to D# is 3, C to E is 4. Yes. So between X and Y, the distance is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if X is lower than Y, then it's the difference. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance would be (Y's position + 12 - X's position) semitones? Or maybe the distance is computed as (Y - X) mod 12, but since the distance is always taken as the smallest number of semitones when moving upwards. Wait, no. The problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because if you go from E up to C, you have to go through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if Y is lower than X, then it's (Y + 12 - X) semitones?\n\nWait, perhaps the way to compute the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper, perhaps the actual distance is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). But in terms of the problem's definition, the distance is calculated as the number of semitones you need to move upwards from X to reach Y. So for example, if X is C and Y is E, then it's 4 semitones. If X is E and Y is C, then the distance is 8 semitones. Because moving up from E to C would require going around the cycle.\n\nSo, the way to calculate the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). But how do I compute that? Alternatively, the distance can be computed as (Y_index - X_index) % 12. Wait, no. Because if X is E (index 4?), and Y is C (index 0?), then (0 - 4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. Because (Y - X) mod 12 gives the correct value. For example, if X is E (index 4) and Y is C (index 0), then Y - X is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. So that's exactly what (Y_index - X_index) mod 12 gives. But since the notes are ordered in a cycle, the mod 12 ensures that we get the correct distance.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its index in the list. Let's create a list of the notes in order. The order is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A",
