    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many numbers n have exactly m trailing zeros in their factorial. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find these n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how to find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's. Let's think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThe key thing is that f(n) is non-decreasing as n increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the number of trailing zeros either stays the same or increases. So for example, when n is a multiple of 5, the count increases. But for numbers not divisible by 5, it's the same as before.\n\nBut how does this help me? Well, for a given m, there could be a range of n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but 5! has one trailing zero. Then 6! is 720, which also has one. Similarly up to 9! because each time you multiply by a number not divisible by 5. But when you reach 10!, you add another 5 (from 10), so the count becomes 2.\n\nSo the idea is that for some m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers n that satisfy the condition. Wait, but why 5? Like in the sample case, there are 5 numbers (5-9) that have exactly 1 trailing zero. But why?\n\nBecause when you hit a multiple of 5, the count increases. So between the numbers that are multiples of 5, the count increases. Let's think: suppose we have a certain m. Let's find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are other numbers after that which also have the same count.\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, given m, I can find the smallest n such that f(n) = m. Then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count.\n\nWait, but how do I know if there are any n's for a given m? For example, if m is 5, what's the possible n's?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for some m, there are no n's. For example, m=5. Let's see: Let's compute f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. f(25) = 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n for which the count is 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists any n such that f(n) = m. And if so, find all such n's.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Find the lower and upper bounds of n that could possibly have f(n) = m.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: For a given m, find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of numbers where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find the range?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I find the first n where f(n) = m. Then the next numbers may have the same count until the next multiple of 5. For example, in the sample case m=1, the first n is 5. Then 5,6,7,8,9 all have f(n)=1. Then 10 adds another 5 (from 10), so f(10)=2.\n\nSo the numbers that have exactly m trailing zeros are from some lower bound to some upper bound. But how to find that?\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, the possible n's must lie between a certain range. Let's think that for each m, the possible n's are in the range [a, b], where a is the first n where f(n) = m, and b is the last n where f(n) = m. How to find a and b?\n\nBut how to find a and b?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, the number of n's that satisfy the condition is either 0, 1, or 5. Wait, why 5? Because when you have a new multiple of 5, say 5k, then adding numbers from 5k to 5k+4 will have the same count of trailing zeros. Because the next multiple of 5 is 5(k+1), which adds another 5. So for example, when you have a number like 25, which contributes two 5s. So maybe the number of n's is 5 in most cases, except when there's a higher power of 5 involved.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think again. For example, let's take m=5. Suppose there is no n with exactly 5 trailing zeros. As discussed earlier, because between 24 (which gives 4) and 25 (which gives 6). So for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nBut if m=6, then the numbers are from 25 to 29. Let's check:\n\nf(25) = 6 (since 25//5 = 5, 25//25=1, total 6). Then 26, 27, 28, 29 will have same count. So 5 numbers. So for m=6, answer is 5 numbers: 25-29.\n\nBut wait, what about when the next multiple of 5 is 5k, but 5k is also a multiple of 25, etc. For example, 25 is 5^2. So when you process 25, the count increases by 2. So the previous numbers (like 24) have count 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). Then 25 adds 5 (count 5) and 25//25=1, so total 5+1=6. So the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there's no solution.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, there may be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, but how can there be 1 number? For example, if m is 24. Let's see:\n\nLet me think of m=24. Let's find the n where f(n) = 24.\n\nLet me calculate for n=99: 99//5=19, 99//25=3, 99//125=0. Total 22. Not enough.\n\nn=100: 100/5=20, 100/25=4, 100/125=0. Total 24. So f(100) =24. Then 101, 102, 103, 104 will also have 24 trailing zeros. Because they are not multiples of 5. But 105 is 5*21, so f(105) = 21 + 4 (from 25) + 1 (from 125?) Wait, no. Let me compute f(105):\n\n105//5 = 21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 21+4=25. So for m=24, the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. So 5 numbers. So again, 5 numbers.\n\nBut when would there be only one number?\n\nWait, let's think of m=3. Let's see:\n\nFind n where f(n)=3.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nFor n=15: 15//5=3, 15//25=0. Total 3. So 15 has 3 zeros. Then 16, 17, 18, 19 will also have 3 zeros. Then 20 adds another 5. So for m=3, there are 5 numbers: 15-19. So again 5 numbers.\n\nHmm, so why in the sample input m=1, there are 5 numbers. So maybe the number of n's is either 0 or 5. But why in the first sample, the output is 5 numbers. So perhaps there are cases where there is 1 number?\n\nWait, maybe when m is such that the count jumps by more than 1. Like when m=5. But then there are no numbers. What about m=4? Let's check:\n\nFor n=20, f(n) is 20//5 + 20//25 = 4 + 0 =4. Then 21,22,23,24 also have 4 zeros. Then 25 adds 2 to the count (since 25//5 is 5, 25//25 is 1, total 6). So for m=4, the numbers are 20,21,22,23,24. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo why would there be only 1 number?\n\nAh, perhaps when m is achieved by a number that is a multiple of higher powers of 5, but not sure. Let me think of m=5 again. Suppose there's no n with exactly 5 zeros. So that's 0. But how about m=6? That's achieved by 25,26,27,28,29. So 5 numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is that for any m, there are either 0 or 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause the count increases by 1 when you hit a multiple of 5, but when you hit a multiple of 25, the count increases by 2, etc. So for example, if m is such that there's a jump of 2, then between the previous and next numbers, there's a gap. But in that case, the numbers that are in between would be 5 numbers. For example, when the count increases by 2, then the previous count was m-2, and the next is m. So there's no numbers with m-1.\n\nBut how does this affect the current problem? Well, for the current problem, when we have a certain m, the possible numbers are 5 consecutive numbers, unless there's no such numbers.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFind the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then check if there exists such an n. If not, output 0. Else, the numbers are from n to n+4, but need to verify that each of them indeed gives m.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n for which f(n) = m?\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think of binary search. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, we can find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, the numbers would be from n to some upper limit where f(n) remains m.\n\nBut how to find the upper limit?\n\nAlternatively, since for the numbers between n and n+4, their f(n) would be the same as f(n) if they are not multiples of 5. So if the minimal n is such that f(n) = m, then the numbers from n to n+4 would all have f(n) = m. Unless n is a multiple of 5, but then the next numbers would have higher counts?\n\nWait, no. For example, n=25. f(25) = 6. Then 26, 27, 28, 29 would have same count. Because they are not multiples of 5. So the numbers from 25 to 29 would have 6 trailing zeros. So for m=6, the answer is 5 numbers. So the upper bound is n+4.\n\nBut how to confirm that?\n\nSo once we find the minimal n where f(n) = m, then the numbers from n to n+4 would all have the same count. But why?\n\nBecause for each of these numbers, when you increment n by 1, you're not adding a multiple of 5. So the count doesn't change. So the next 4 numbers would have same count. Unless the minimal n is such that adding 5 would be the next multiple of 5. So, the numbers from n to n+4 would be 5 numbers, and the next number (n+5) would be a multiple of 5, which increases the count.\n\nSo the idea is that once we find the minimal n where f(n) = m, then the numbers from n to n+4 would all have exactly m trailing zeros. But how to confirm that?\n\nBut what if the minimal n is such that adding 5 would be a multiple of 25, which would add more than one to the count? For example, let's take m=6. The minimal n is 25. Then 25,26,27,28,29 all have f(n) =6. Then 30 would be 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7. So yes, the next number increases the count by 1.\n\nSo the conclusion is that if there exists any n with f(n) = m, then there are exactly 5 numbers. Unless the minimal n is such that adding 4 to it would take us to a multiple of 5. Wait, but that's not possible. Because the minimal n is the first occurrence of m. So for example, if n is a multiple of 5, then the next numbers (n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4) are not multiples of 5, so their counts are same as n. So in that case, the numbers from n to n+4 would have same count.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. If there is no such n (i.e., the minimal n where f(n) >=m is such that f(n) > m), then output 0. Otherwise, output the numbers from n to n+4.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where f(n) = m?\n\nWe can use binary search to find the minimal n such that f(n) >=m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, return 0. Else, check if the numbers n to n+4 have exactly m.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n for which f(n) >=m?\n\nLet me think about the binary search approach. The function f(n) is monotonically increasing. So for example, for m=1, the minimal n where f(n)>=1 is 5. Then check if f(5) is exactly 1. Which it is. Then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut for m=5, the minimal n where f(n)>=5 is 25. Because f(24) is 4, and f(25)=6. So here, the minimal n is 25, but f(n) is 6>5, so no solution.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where f(n) >=m. Let's call this low_n.\n\n2. Check if f(low_n) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n3. Else, check if there are 5 numbers (low_n, low_n+1, ..., low_n+4) that all have f(n) =m. But how to ensure that? Well, since the next multiple of 5 is low_n +5, which would be the next number that increases the count. So adding 5 to low_n would be the next multiple of 5. So for example, if low_n is 25, then adding 5 gives 30. So for numbers from 25 to 29, their f(n) is same as 25.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nFirst, write a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >=5:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThen, perform a binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nOnce found, check if count_zeros(n) ==m. If not, output 0. Else, check if the next 4 numbers (n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4) also have count_zeros equal to m. But according to our earlier reasoning, they should. However, perhaps in some cases, like when n is a multiple of higher powers of 5, but I think that the count_zeros(n) for n+1 to n+4 would be same as n. Because none of them are multiples of 5.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps we need to check that the next numbers are valid. However, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the code can assume that once the minimal n is found and count_zeros(n) ==m, then the numbers from n to n+4 are valid. But how to confirm?\n\nLet me take an example where the minimal n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=6, the numbers 25-29 are valid. So the code would generate 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=24, the minimal n is 100. count_zeros(100) is 24. Then numbers 100-104 are valid.\n\nBut what about when the minimal n is 5. Then 5,6,7,8,9 are valid.\n\nSo the code can generate the list [n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4] and output them. But how to make sure that these numbers are valid?\n\nWell, since for any n, the count_zeros(n) is same as count_zeros(n+1) if n+1 is not a multiple of 5. So for n to n+4, none of them are multiples of 5 (since if n is a multiple of 5, then the next multiple is n+5). So the count_zeros for these numbers would be same as count_zeros(n). Therefore, once we find that count_zeros(n) ==m, then all numbers from n to n+4 would have exactly m trailing zeros. Thus, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if n is such that adding 5 would not be the next multiple of 5? For example, if n is 6, which is not a multiple of 5. Then the next multiple is 10. So the numbers 6,7,8,9,10. But 10 is a multiple of 5. So for n=6, count_zeros(6) = 1. Then numbers 6,7,8,9,10. But count_zeros(10) is 2. So the numbers from 6 to 9 would be 4 numbers. But according to the sample input, for m=1, the answer is 5 numbers (5-9). So when the minimal n is 5, then adding 4 gives 9. So that's 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code needs to generate 5 numbers only if the minimal n is such that the next 4 numbers are not multiples of 5. So the code can safely generate 5 numbers once the minimal n is found and count_zeros(n) is m.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the minimal n is such that n+4 is a multiple of 5? For example, if n is 5, then n+4 is 9, which is not a multiple of 5. So that's okay. Another example: n=10. Then n+4 is 14. Not a multiple of 5. So in that case, the numbers from 10 to 14 would all have same count_zeros as 10. But what if n is 15? Then n+4 is 19. All numbers from 15 to 19 are not multiples of 5. So their count_zeros is same as 15. So the code can proceed.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with the following steps:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m. Let's call this low_n.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(low_n) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, check if count_zeros(low_n + 4) ==m. If yes, then output 5 numbers: low_n, low_n+1, ..., low_n+4.\n\nBut why check low_n +4? Because in some cases, maybe adding 4 would cause the count_zeros to increase. But according to the earlier reasoning, that shouldn't happen. However, perhaps in some cases, like when low_n is a multiple of 25, etc. Let's think:\n\nSuppose m=6. low_n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(29) is also 6. So yes, the code can proceed.\n\nAnother example: m=5. low_n is 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6, which is greater than m. So output 0.\n\nSo the code would need to find the low_n, then check if count_zeros(low_n) is m. If not, output 0. Else, output the five numbers.\n\nBut how to find low_n?\n\nTo find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m, we can use binary search. Let's think about the binary search boundaries.\n\nThe lower bound for n can be 0, and upper bound can be 5*m. Because for example, m trailing zeros requires that n is at least 5*m (but that's not correct). Wait, let's think: the count_zeros(n) is approximately n/5 + n/25 + ... which is roughly n/4. So for m, the n is around 4*m. But to find an upper bound for binary search, perhaps 5*m is sufficient. Because for example, for m=1, 5*1=5, which is the correct n. For m=2, 5*2=10, which gives count_zeros(10)=2. So that works. So the upper bound can be set to 5*m. But perhaps even m*5 is not sufficient? Let's think of m=24. 5*24=120. count_zeros(120) is 120/5=24 + 120/25=4 + 120/125=0 → 28. Which is higher than 24. So the minimal n is 100. So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. So binary search between 0 and 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps for larger m, 5*m is not enough. Let's think: For example, m=100000. Let's compute 5*m = 500000. What is count_zeros(500000)?\n\nIt's 500000//5 + 500000//25 + ... which is 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124,  something. Which is way bigger than m=1e5. So the upper bound can be set to 5*m. Because the minimal n is less than 5*m. Because count_zeros(5*m) is definitely >=m.\n\nSo the binary search can be done between 0 and 5*m.\n\nSo the steps for binary search:\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n      high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n      low = mid +1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nOnce we have this low, we check if count_zeros(low) ==m. If not, output 0. Else, output the 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if there are more than 5 numbers? Like, if for some m, there are 6 numbers. But according to previous reasoning, that's not possible. Because the next multiple of 5 would add to the count.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nbinary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1.\n\nlow starts at 0, high=5*1=5.\n\nmid is (0+5)//2=2. count_zeros(2) is 0 <1 → set low=3.\n\nNext, mid is (3+5)/2=4. count_zeros(4)=0 <1 → low=5.\n\nNow, low=5, high=5. Exit loop. low is 5. count_zeros(5)=1 ==m. So output 5 numbers: 5-9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. Let's see:\n\nbinary search for low where count_zeros(low) >=5.\n\nhigh is 5*5=25.\n\nLet's see. For example, let's simulate the binary search steps.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the minimal n for m=5. For example, count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25, but count_zeros(25)=6>5. So output is 0. Which matches the sample's second case.\n\nSo the code would work for these samples.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nCase 2: m=2. Let's see. The minimal n is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. So the numbers 10,11,12,13,14. So output is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=6. Minimal n is 25. So numbers 25-29.\n\nAnother case: m=28. Let's see. Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) =28.\n\nLet me compute for n=115:\n\ncount_zeros(115) = 115//5 =23, 115//25=4, 115//125=0. Total 27.\n\nn=120: 120//5=24, 120//25=4, 120//125=0 → total 28. So the minimal n is 120. So the numbers are 120-124. So output 5 numbers.\n\nNow, what if m is such that the count_zeros(n) jumps by more than 1. For example, m=5. As before, no solution.\n\nAnother example: m=24. As before, n=100, which gives count_zeros(100) = 24. So numbers 100-104.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code needs to read m from input, perform the binary search, check if count_zeros(low) ==m. If yes, output 5 numbers. Else, output 0.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows.\n\nRead m from input.\n\nIf m is 0, output 0 (but according to problem statement, m is >=1).\n\nElse:\n\n   perform binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\n   check if count_zeros(n) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\n   else, output 5 numbers: n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4.\n\nBut wait, what if there are less than 5 numbers? For example, if n is the maximum possible, but that's not possible. Because for any n that is a multiple of 5, the next 4 numbers are not multiples of 5. So there are 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the n+4 is beyond some limit? For example, if m is such that the minimal n is 5*1e5, but that's handled by the binary search.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the code generates numbers that are beyond the actual possible? For example, if the minimal n is such that n+4 is a multiple of 5. But that's not possible. Because if n is a multiple of 5, then n+5 is the next multiple. So n+4 is not a multiple of 5. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code can proceed with this logic.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, the helper function count_zeros(n) is straightforward.\n\nNow, for the binary search part.\n\nBut for the binary search, the initial high can be set to 5*m. However, for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. For that, the count_zeros(5e5) would be 5e5//5 + 5e5//25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124,  something. Which is way larger than m=1e5. So the binary search would find the correct n.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n >=5:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, perform binary search.\n\nBut in Python, for the binary search:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = 5 * m\n\nwhile low < high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n    if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n        high = mid\n\n    else:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\nOnce we get low, check if count_zeros(low) == m.\n\nIf not, print 0.\n\nElse, collect the numbers from low to low+4. Then print the count (5) followed by the numbers.\n\nBut what if low+4 is not valid? For example, if m is such that the count_zeros(low) is m, but for low+4, the count_zeros is m+1? According to our previous reasoning, that's not possible.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps we can check that count_zeros(low +4) ==m.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn code:\n\nif count_zeros(low) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    # check if low+4 is valid\n\n    # but how?\n\n    # since count_zeros(low) = m, and low+4 is not a multiple of 5, then count_zeros(low+4) = m.\n\n    # thus, the numbers are low, low+1, low+2, low+3, low+4.\n\n    print(5)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, [low, low+1, low+2, low+3, low+4])))\n\nBut why is this correct?\n\nBecause for any number between low and low+4, none of them are multiples of 5. Because low is the first occurrence of m. So, if low is a multiple of 5, then the next multiple is low +5. Thus, low+4 is not a multiple of 5. So for all numbers from low to low+4, their count_zeros is same as low's count_zeros.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test for a case where low is not a multiple of 5.\n\nFor example, m=1. low is 5. Which is a multiple of 5. So numbers 5-9. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=2. low is 10. Which is multiple of 5. numbers 10-14.\n\nAnother example: m=3. low is 15. numbers 15-19.\n\nAnother example: m=24, low is 100. numbers 100-104.\n\nWhat if low is not a multiple of 5? Let's see. Suppose m is 1, and low is 5. Which is a multiple of 5. But what if for some m, the minimal n is not a multiple of 5?\n\nWait, for example, m=1. Suppose someone says that the minimal n is 5, which is a multiple of 5. But what about m=2?\n\nLet me think: for m=2, the minimal n is 10. Which is a multiple of 5.\n\nAnother example: m=24. The minimal n is 100, which is a multiple of 5.\n\nBut what about m=25?\n\nLet me compute count_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. 21+4=25. So for m=25, the minimal n is 105. So the numbers 105, 106, 107, 108, 109. So the code would output these numbers. So low is 105, which is a multiple of 5.\n\nSo in all cases, the minimal n is a multiple of 5?\n\nNo. Let's think of m=1. The minimal n is 5. Which is a multiple of 5. What about m=5? No solution. But what about m=6?\n\nThe minimal n is 25, which is multiple of 5.\n\nBut what about m=3. Let's see, the minimal n is 15. Which is a multiple of 5. So the code seems to generate numbers where the minimal n is a multiple of 5.\n\nBut why is that?\n\nBecause the count_zeros(n) increases when n is a multiple of 5. So the first occurrence of m must be a multiple of 5?\n\nNot necessarily. Let's think. Suppose m=2. The first occurrence is 10, which is a multiple of 5. But what about m=3?\n\nYes, 15 is the first occurrence.\n\nBut what about m=4? First occurrence is 20.\n\nSo in all these cases, the minimal n is a multiple of 5. So why is that?\n\nBecause for numbers that are not multiples of 5, their count_zeros is same as the previous number. So the first occurrence of a new count must be when you hit a multiple of 5.\n\nYes. Because for example, if you have n not divisible by 5, then count_zeros(n) = count_zeros(n-1). So the first occurrence of a new count must be when you hit a multiple of 5. So the minimal n for which count_zeros(n) = m must be a multiple of 5.\n\nTherefore, the code can safely assume that the minimal n is a multiple of 5. Therefore, the numbers from n to n+4 are all valid. Thus, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as described.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nThe input is a single integer m. So the code reads m from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for input ['1', '5'], the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but the actual code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows:\n\nInput: ['1', '5']\n\nOutput: ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the valid values of `n` using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of factors of 5.\n   \n2. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the smallest number `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `m`, we use binary search. This helps us quickly narrow down the range where the required `n` might be.\n\n3. **Validation**: Once we find the smallest `n` where the trailing zeros count is at least `m`, we check if it exactly equals `m`. If not, there are no valid `n` values. If it does, then there will be exactly 5 consecutive numbers starting from `n` that have exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    # Binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    # Now check if count_zeros(low) == m\n    if count_zeros(low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(5)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, [low, low+1, low+2, low+3, low+4])))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: The binary search is performed on the range from 0 to `5*m` to find the smallest `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `m`.\n\n3. **Validation Check**: After finding the smallest `n` using binary search, we check if the count of trailing zeros exactly matches `m`. If it does, we print the five consecutive numbers starting from `n` as they all have exactly `m` trailing zeros. If not, we print 0 indicating no such `n` exists.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid numbers using binary search and mathematical properties of trailing zeros in factorials.",
