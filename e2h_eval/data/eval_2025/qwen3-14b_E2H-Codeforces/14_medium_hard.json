    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, no, the sample input was m=5, and the output is 5 numbers. Oh right, the first example input is m=5, and the output is 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Wait, but why? Let me check:\n\nWait 5! is 120 (1 zero), but the sample says for m=5, the answer is 5,6,7,8,9. So for each of those numbers, their factorial has exactly 5 trailing zeros. Let me check 5! is 120 (1 zero), but maybe the sample input was m=1, but the example shows input as ['1', '5']? Wait the example input is given as ['1', '5'] and output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']. Wait, perhaps the first input is m=1, and the output is 5 numbers. Wait that can't be. Wait the example says:\n\nIn the first sample, input is 1, output is 5 numbers. Wait no, looking back:\n\nThe example input is given as ['1', '5'], which probably represents two test cases. For example, when m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Wait but that's not possible because 5! has one trailing zero. Wait for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9? Because 5! has one zero, 6! is 720 (one zero?), wait no. Wait 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1 zero?), 7! is 5040 (1 zero?), 8! is 40320 (1 zero?), 9! is 362880 (1 zero?), and 10! is 3628800 (two zeros). So for m=1, the numbers 5-9 (inclusive) would have exactly one trailing zero. That's five numbers. So the first example input is m=1, output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Then the second input is m=5, output is 0. Wait why?\n\nWait for m=5, maybe there's no n such that n! has exactly 5 trailing zeros. Let me check. Let's compute the trailing zeros for some numbers.\n\nFor example, 25! has floor(25/5) + floor(25/25) = 5 + 1 = 6 zeros. So 25! has 6 zeros. What about 24!? 24/5 is 4, 24/25 is 0. So total 4. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer is 0. That explains the second part of the example.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nThe key idea here is that for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 possible n's. Wait, why 5? Because when there's a jump in the count, like when adding a multiple of 5, but maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. However, when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1, but when it crosses a multiple of 25, it increases by 2, etc. So, for example, when n increases from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2 (from 4 to 6). So between 24 and 25, there's a jump. Thus, for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros.\n\nBut for some m's, there could be multiple n's. For example, when the count increases by 1, then there's a range of n's that give the same count. For example, when n increases from 5 to 9, the count is 1. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9) that have exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\nSo the approach would be to find the possible n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nFirst, we can note that for a given m, there's a minimal n such that the count of trailing zeros is m. Then, there might be a range of n's (like up to some maximum) that also have the same count. However, if there's a jump in the count (like when n crosses a multiple of 25), then there may be no n's for certain m's.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where the count of trailing zeros is m. Let's call this n_min.\n\n2. Check if the count for n_min is exactly m. If not, then there are no such n's (so return 0).\n\n3. Then, find the maximum n where the count is still m. Let's say that's n_max. Then, the numbers from n_min to n_max are all valid. The count of numbers is n_max - n_min + 1.\n\nBut how do we find n_min and n_max?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower bound and upper bound of n where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how to find those bounds?\n\nThe standard approach for finding the number of trailing zeros for a given n is straightforward. But here, we need to invert the problem: given m, find all n's such that the count is m.\n\nThis seems like a binary search problem. Let me think.\n\nFor example, for a given m, we can find the smallest n such that the count of zeros is >= m. Then check if the count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the smallest n where the count is m, and then find the largest n where the count is m. Then, the numbers between them are the answers.\n\nBut how to find the smallest and largest n for a given m?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because when you increase n by 1, the count can stay the same or increase by 1 or more (if the new n is a multiple of 5, 25, etc.)\n\nSo for example, for m=5, the count for n=24 is 4, for n=25 it's 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m.\n\n- Then find the maximal n such that f(n) = m.\n\nIf there is no n where f(n) = m, then output 0.\n\nBut how to find these n's?\n\nFirst, we can use binary search to find the lower bound and upper bound.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Let's think. Let's find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is equal to m. If not, then no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is that value.\n\nBut then, how to find the upper bound. For example, once we have the minimal n where f(n) = m, the next numbers may have the same count until the next multiple of 5. For example, in the case of m=1, the minimal n is 5, and the maximum is 9. So the maximum n is the first n where f(n) = m+1 minus 1.\n\nWait, for example, the first n where f(n) = m+1 is x. Then, the maximum n where f(n) = m is x-1.\n\nSo for a given m, the maximum n is the first n where f(n) = m+1 minus 1. But if there is no such n (i.e., m+1 is not achievable), then the maximum n is infinity? Well, in reality, for any m, there is a point where the count increases beyond m. So for example, if m is very large, but the maximum n would be the first n where f(n) = m+1 minus 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_low where f(n_low) = m. How? Well, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n_low) is m. If not, then no solution.\n\n2. Then find the minimal n_high where f(n_high) = m+1. Then the maximum n where f(n) = m is n_high -1.\n\nSo the numbers between n_low and n_high -1 are all valid. The count is (n_high -1 - n_low + 1) = n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nTo find the minimal n where f(n) >= m, we can use binary search. Similarly for finding the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1.\n\nSo let's first code the function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way.\n\nNow, for a given m, we can perform a binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this low_n.\n\nThen, check if count_zeros(low_n) == m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call this high_n. Then, the maximum n for m is high_n -1.\n\nThus, the numbers from low_n to high_n -1 are all valid. The count is high_n - low_n.\n\nBut wait, what if there's no high_n? Like, for example, if m is very large, but for the given m, there's a range of n's that have exactly m zeros. But since for any m, there's an n that will have count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Because as n increases, count_zeros(n) increases.\n\nSo for example, for m=5, when we check for low_n, which is the minimal n with count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4+0=4. count_zeros(25) is 5+1=6. So for m=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to m=5. So there are no solutions. Hence, output is 0.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor given m:\n\n- Find the minimal n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >= m.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(n_low) is exactly m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1.\n\n- The maximum n for m is n_high -1.\n\n- The numbers from n_low to n_high -1 are all valid. So the count is (n_high -1 - n_low + 1) = n_high - n_low.\n\nBut then, how to perform the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nLet me think about the binary search. For example, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target. The possible range for binary search can be from 0 to 5*target. Because for any target, the count_zeros(5*target) is at least target. Because for 5*target, count_zeros(5*target) is floor(5t/5) + floor(5t/25) + ... which is t + floor(t/5) + ... which is larger than t.\n\nSo the binary search can be done between low=0 and high=5*m.\n\nWait, but for m=1, 5*m is 5. Which is correct. For m=5, 5*m is 25. Which is the n where count_zeros(25) is 6.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target can be done as follows:\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*target. While low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n       high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n       low = mid +1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nOnce we get that, we can check if count_zeros(low) == target. If not, return 0.\n\nElse, proceed to find the minimal n_high for target+1.\n\nOnce we have n_high, the maximum n is n_high -1.\n\nSo the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the possible n's. So the count is (n_high -1 - n_low +1) = n_high -n_low.\n\nBut wait, let's take the sample input where m=1.\n\nFor m=1, the target is 1. So:\n\nbinary search for minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 1. The minimal is 5.\n\nCheck count_zeros(5) is 1. Yes.\n\nThen find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2. Let's see.\n\nFor target=2, binary search:\n\nWe can find that the minimal n is 10 (count_zeros(10) is 2). So n_high is 10. So the max n is 9. So the range is 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. For target=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25 (count_zeros(25)=6). So check if it's equal to 5. No. So return 0.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, read m from input. Then:\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, n is positive integer. So for m=0, the answer is 1 (n=1?), but the input constraints say m is at least 1. So in our code, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low_n as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nif count_zeros(low_n) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute high_n as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nthe numbers are from low_n to high_n -1.\n\nso the count is high_n - low_n.\n\nthen output the count and the list of numbers.\n\nBut how to generate the list? Well, for example, if the count is k, then the numbers are [low_n, low_n+1, ..., high_n-1].\n\nBut for large m, this could be a lot of numbers. However, according to the problem statement, the output needs to print all the numbers. But for m up to 1e5, what is the maximum possible k?\n\nWell, for example, when m is such that the count_zeros increases by 1. For example, when n increases from 5 to 9, the count is 1. So the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So the count is 5. So for some m, there are 5 numbers. But how?\n\nWait, the difference between high_n and low_n is the number of elements. For example, in the case of m=1, high_n is 10 (the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2). So high_n - low_n is 10-5=5. Which is the correct count.\n\nSo the code can generate the numbers as a list from low_n to high_n-1 inclusive.\n\nBut how to generate that list? Well, for m=1, the list is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 elements. So the code can generate the list as [low_n + i for i in range(high_n - low_n)] ?\n\nWait, high_n - low_n is the number of elements. For example, high_n is 10, low_n is 5. high_n - low_n is 5. So the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 elements. So yes, the code can generate the list as [low_n + i for i in range(high_n - low_n)].\n\nBut what if high_n - low_n is zero? Well, that would mean that the count_zeros(low_n) is m, but the next number (low_n +1) has count_zeros of m+1. So for example, if m is 6, and low_n is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). Then, the next n is 26, which has count_zeros(26) = 6. Because 26//5 is 5, 26//25 is 1, total 6. So for m=6, the high_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) = 6, count_zeros(29) is 6 (since 29//5 is 5, 29//25 is 1. 5+1=6). count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 + 1 =7. So high_n for m+1=7 is 30. So the numbers for m=6 are 25 to 29. So 5 numbers again. So the code would generate 30-25=5 elements.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement a binary search function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nThen, for the given m:\n\nfind low_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(low_n) != m: output 0\n\nelse:\n\nfind high_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from low_n to high_n-1 inclusive.\n\nthen output the count (high_n - low_n) and the list.\n\nBut how to handle the binary search.\n\nImplementing the binary search function:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nBut what if the target is 0? Well, since m is >=1, the code will not call this function with target 0.\n\nBut for m=0, but the problem says m starts from 1.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut for m=1, the code will compute low_n as 5, and high_n as find_min_n(2) which is 10. So the numbers are 5-9.\n\nBut for m=5, low_n is find_min_n(5) which is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output 0.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nRead m.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nThen:\n\nlow_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(low_n) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    high_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = high_n - low_n\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low_n, high_n))))\n\nWait, but the range in Python is exclusive of the upper limit. So range(low_n, high_n) would generate numbers from low_n to high_n-1. Which is exactly what we need. So yes.\n\nBut for example, when low_n is 5 and high_n is 10, range(5, 10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut let's test for m=5:\n\nlow_n = find_min_n(5). Let's compute what find_min_n(5) returns.\n\ntarget is 5.\n\nInitially, low=0, high=25.\n\nLet me simulate the binary search.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think that for target=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25?\n\nWait count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) is 5 +1 =6. So the minimal n is 25. So find_min_n(5) returns 25. Then count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example, m=6.\n\nlow_n = find_min_n(6). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed.\n\nhigh_n is find_min_n(7). Let's compute find_min_n(7).\n\nWhat's the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7?\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6, count_zeros(29) is 6, count_zeros(30) is 7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase when m is 0? But according to the input constraints, m is >=1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: m=6, but what if there are 5 numbers. So code outputs 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: when m is such that there's only one n. For example, when m=2, what happens?\n\nLet me compute for m=2.\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. count_zeros(11) is 2. ... count_zeros(14) is 2. count_zeros(15) is 3. So for m=2, the low_n is 10. high_n is find_min_n(3) which is 15. So the numbers are 10-14 (5 numbers). So output is 5 numbers.\n\nWait but that's 5 numbers again. So why?\n\nBecause when the count increases by 1, the numbers between the previous multiple of 5 and the next multiple of 5. But perhaps for some m, the count increases by more than 1. For example, when m=6, but the next count is 7. So the code would return 5 numbers.\n\nBut why is it always 5 numbers?\n\nWait no. Let's think about when the count increases by 2. For example, when n=24 (count 4), n=25 (count 6). So for m=5, there's no solution. But for m=4, the low_n is 24, and high_n is find_min_n(5) which is 25. So the numbers are 24 to 24 (since high_n is 25, so 25-24=1. So the output is 1 number, 24. Which is correct because 24! has 4 trailing zeros.\n\nSo in this case, the code would output 1 number.\n\nSo the code works for this case.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m, and output the required numbers. So in the code, read m from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for input m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. For m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut what about when m is very big? Let's see for m=1e5. The binary search would have high = 5*1e5 = 500000. Which is manageable.\n\nBut for the find_min_n function, for target=1e5, the binary search would run in O(log(5*target)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input. For example, m = int(input())\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is ['1', '5'], which probably refers to two test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for two different cases. But the code should process a single m per run.\n\nWait the original problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read m from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the sample input is for two test cases. But the code is supposed to read one m and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample shows that for input m=1, output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' and for m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code should read m from input, and output the answer accordingly.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nImplement the functions as discussed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nlow_n = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(low_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = high_n - low_n\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low_n, high_n))))\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, this code would generate:\n\nlow_n = find_min_n(1) =5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nhigh_n = find_min_n(2) = 10.\n\nk is 5. The range is 5 to 10 (exclusive), which is 5,6,7,8,9. So the output is 5 followed by the numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case for m=5, the code returns 0.\n\nBut what about when m=6?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nlow_n = find_min_n(6) is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed.\n\nhigh_n = find_min_n(7) is 30. So the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nBut what about m=4?\n\nlow_n is find_min_n(4). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(20) is 4. So low_n is 20. Then high_n is find_min_n(5) which is 25. So the numbers are 20-24. So 5 numbers. Which is correct. Because 20! has 4 zeros, 21! also 4, 22!, 23!, 24! all have 4 zeros. 25! has 6.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the high_n is 25, then the range is 20 to 25, which is 5 numbers (20,21,22,23,24). Yes.\n\nBut in code, range(low_n, high_n) is 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. So yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother case: m=24.\n\nLet me compute for m=24.\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24 (100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0. Total 24). So low_n is 100. high_n is find_min_n(25). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(101) is 24. ... count_zeros(104) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25. So find_min_n(25) returns 105. So the numbers are 100-104. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo code outputs 5 and the numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nBut what about m=25?\n\nlow_n is find_min_n(25). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(105) is 25. So low_n is 105. Then check if count_zeros(105) is 25. Yes. Then find high_n for m+1=26.\n\ncount_zeros(109) is 25 (109//5=21, 109//25=4, 21+4=25). count_zeros(110) is 110//5=22 + 110//25=4 + 110//125=0 → 26. So find_min_n(26) returns 110. So the numbers are 105-109. 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, what about m=6, but the code returns 5 numbers. So the code seems to be working correctly.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when the high_n is 5* (m+1)? For example, when m is very large, but the code uses 5*target as high. For example, when target is m+1, which could be up to 1e5 +1. So 5*(1e5 +1) is 500,005. Which is manageable.\n\nBut for m=1e5, the code would compute 5*1e5=500000. But for that, the binary search would take O(log(5e5)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, what about when m is such that the count_zeros(n) increases by more than 1. For example, m=4, and the code returns 5 numbers. But when m is 6, the code returns 5 numbers. So the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code seems to be correct.\n\nBut let's check for m=0. But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: m=1, which is handled correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: m=2, which is handled correctly.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut when m is 0, but the input constraints don't allow that.\n\nNow, the code seems to be correct.\n\nSo the final code is as written above.\n\nBut in Python, when m=1, the code outputs:\n\nprint(k) followed by the list. So for the first sample input, the output is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is given as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'] for inputs ['1', '5'].\n\nSo the code for m=1 would output 5 followed by the numbers, and for m=5, 0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code must read from stdin and write to stdout. So the code is:\n\nRead m from input, then proceed.\n\nBut the code must be written as a Python script. So:\n\nNow, the code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nlow_n = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(low_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high_n = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = high_n - low_n\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low_n, high_n))))\n\nBut wait, for the case when k is zero? Well, no. Because if count_zeros(low_n) == m, then high_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Since count_zeros(low_n) is m, and count_zeros(high_n) is >= m+1. So high_n must be >= low_n + 1. So high_n - low_n is at least 1. So the code will output k >=1.\n\nBut what if m is such that there is exactly one n. For example, m=4, and the next number (n+1) has count_zeros(n+1) = m+1. Then, high_n is n+1. So k is (n+1) -n =1. So the code outputs 1 and the number n.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when m is 24, and the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut let's test for m=24:\n\nlow_n = find_min_n(24). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. So low_n is 100. Then high_n is find_min_n(25) which is 105. So the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. So 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the valid range of $ n $ values for a given $ m $, we use binary search to determine the smallest $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m $. We then check if this count is exactly $ m $. If not, there are no valid $ n $ values.\n3. **Finding Upper Bound**: After confirming the lower bound, we find the smallest $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m + 1 $. The valid range of $ n $ values lies between the lower bound and one less than this upper bound.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nlow_n = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(low_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high_n = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = high_n - low_n\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low_n, high_n))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target. The search range is from 0 to $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, ensuring we cover all possible values.\n3. **Main Logic**: After reading the input $ m $, we determine the smallest $ n $ (low_n) where the trailing zeros count is at least $ m $. If this count is not exactly $ m $, we output 0. Otherwise, we find the smallest $ n $ (high_n) where the count is at least $ m + 1 $, and the valid range of $ n $ values is from low_n to high_n - 1. The results are printed accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the valid range using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $.",
