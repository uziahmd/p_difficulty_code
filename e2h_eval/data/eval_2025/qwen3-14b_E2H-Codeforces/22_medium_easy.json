After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where their mark is the maximum for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the marks for the first student in each subject.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (columns), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if in any of the subjects their mark is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many students meet this condition.\n\nWait, but how do I process the data? Let's think about the steps.\n\nLet me think about the data structure. Let's read the gradebook as a list of lists. Each row is a student, each column is a subject. So for each subject (column), we need to find the maximum value.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe columns are:\n\nSubject 1: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2\nSubject 2: 2, 3, 1 → max is 3\nSubject 3: 3, 2, 2 → max is 3.\n\nThen for each student:\n\nStudent 1 has marks 2,2,3. For subject 1, his mark is 2 which is max. For subject 3, 3 is max. So he is successful.\n\nStudent 2 has 2,3,2. In subject 2, he has 3 which is max. Also subject 1 has 2 which is max. So he's successful.\n\nStudent 3 has 1,1,2. None of his marks are the max in their subjects. So not successful. Hence total is 2.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string of m digits. Then, for each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n\nOnce I have the max values for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max of that subject. If at least one, count them.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. Then convert each line into a list of integers. So, for example, the first line '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nThen, for each subject (columns), find the max. Let's think about how to get the columns. For example, for the list of students, each student's marks are in a list. So for column j, we need to take the j-th element of each student's list.\n\nSo, for each j in 0 to m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( student_marks[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max_marks for that subject.\n\nSo for student i, check if any of their marks in position j is equal to max_marks[j]. If yes, then count them.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. Convert each into a list of integers. Let's call this matrix.\n\nCompute max_marks for each subject. For each column j, compute max of matrix[i][j] across all i.\n\nThen for each student in matrix, check if any of their elements in the columns is equal to the max_marks for that column.\n\nIf yes, increment the count.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, the input can be read as follows:\n\nFirst line: n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen read n lines: for _ in range(n): line = input().strip()\n\nBut each line is a string of m characters. So for each line, we can convert it into a list of integers. For example, list(map(int, list(line))) ?\n\nYes. So:\n\nmatrix = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    matrix.append( [int(c) for c in line] )\n\nOnce matrix is built, then compute max_marks for each subject.\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if matrix[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = matrix[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions. For each column j, take the j-th element of each row and find the max.\n\nmax_marks = [ max( matrix[i][j] for i in range(n) ) for j in range(m) ]\n\nYes.\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student (each row in matrix), check if any of their elements equals the corresponding max_marks[j].\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in matrix:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nYes. Because once a student has at least one subject where they are the best, we count them once.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, test the first example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nmatrix is:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2,2,1 → max 2\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max 3\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max 3\n\nso max_marks = [2,3,3]\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]. Check each j:\n\nj=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]. j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]. j=0: 1 < 2. j=1: 1 <3. j=2: 2 <3. So no. Not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nmatrix:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1\n\ncolumn 2:7,8,1 → max 8\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nmax_marks = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nCheck each student:\n\nstudent 0: has 9 in column 0 (max). So counted.\n\nstudent 1: has 8 in column 2 (max). Also, column 4 is 8 (max). So counted.\n\nstudent 2: check each column. column 0: 1 <9. column1: 1 ==1 → yes. So counted.\n\nHence total 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase when all students have same marks. For example, n=2, m=1. All marks are 5. Then each student is best in the subject. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is best, count is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [1, 2], student 2 has [2, 1]. max_marks for column 0 is 2, column 1 is 2. So student 1 has 1 in column 0 (not max), but 2 in column 1 (max). So he is counted. Student 2 has 2 in column 0 (max), so counted. Total 2.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, convert each into list of integers.\n\nCompute max_marks for each column.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks equals the max in that column.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input:\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait the input is given as per the first line. Wait, in the sample input, the first example is given as a list of inputs, but in reality, the code needs to read from stdin. Wait, the user provided an example where the input is given as two test cases, but the actual code needs to process a single test case. Because in programming competition problems, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the input is given as follows: the first line contains n and m, then n lines follow. So the code should read from standard input, for a single test case.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, there are two examples. But that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple test cases. However, the actual code needs to process a single test case. Because in programming competitions, each test case is processed separately, but the code is written to read from stdin once.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input is given as per the first line. So the code should process one test case. The sample input shows two examples, but that's just for illustration. So the code should read from stdin once.\n\nSo the code should read n and m, then read n lines, process them, output the answer.\n\nThus, the code is as follows:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string, convert into a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_marks for each column.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max_marks for that column.\n\nCount the number of such students.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nmatrix = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    matrix.append( [int(c) for c in line] )\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if matrix[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = matrix[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in matrix:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in Python, for the first part, the code can be written as:\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions for max_marks.\n\nBut the code as written is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nmatrix becomes [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks is [2,3,3]\n\ncount is 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → [9,1,7,2,8]\n\n11828 → [1,1,8,2,8]\n\n11111 → [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks for columns 0: 9, 1, 1 → 9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → 1.\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 → 8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → 2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → 8.\n\nso max_marks = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\neach student:\n\nstudent 0: 9 (col 0) → yes.\n\nstudent 1: 8 in col2 or col4 → yes.\n\nstudent 2: in col1, 1 equals max 1 → yes.\n\nso count is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about the case where a student is the best in multiple subjects? Like in the first sample, student 1 is best in subject 1 and 2. But the code counts him once, which is correct.\n\nYes, because once he has at least one, the code breaks and counts him once.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code is written. Now, check for possible errors.\n\nWhat if m is 0? No, constraints say m is at least 1.\n\nWhat if n is 1? Then for each subject, the student is the best. So count is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Both students have 5. Then max_marks is 5. Both students have 5, so both are counted. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [5, 5], student 2 has [5,5]. Then for each column, max is 5. Each student has all marks equal to max. So both are counted. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code handles all cases.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
