Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to assign directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the flow is a valid maximum flow. The conditions are that for all vertices except source (1) and sink (n), the incoming flow equals outgoing flow. Also, the source has no incoming edges, and the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nHmm. The key points here are that the flow is a maximum flow, and we need to assign directions to edges so that the flow is valid and the directed graph is acyclic. But how?\n\nFirst, let me think about the flow conservation. For each vertex except 1 and n, the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows. So, for each edge, once directed, it contributes to either the outgoing or incoming flow of its endpoints.\n\nBut how do I determine the direction of each edge? Since the flow values are already given (ci for each edge), perhaps the problem reduces to finding an orientation of edges such that the flow is valid and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nWait, but the flow is already a maximum flow. So maybe the given ci's are the actual flow values on each edge, and we need to assign directions accordingly. However, since the original graph is undirected, the flow could go in either direction, but we need to choose directions that make the flow valid and the graph acyclic.\n\nAnother thought: the directed graph must be acyclic. That suggests that we can arrange the edges in a way that forms a DAG. Maybe topological sorting can help here. But how to model that with the flow constraints?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the total flow into v must equal the total flow out of v. So, if I consider each edge's direction, then for each node v, the sum of ci for edges directed towards v must equal the sum of ci for edges directed away from v.\n\nThis seems similar to finding an Euler tour, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a flow network where each edge's direction is chosen such that the net flow at each node (except source and sink) is zero.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the flow is already a maximum flow. So the given ci's are the flow values, and we need to assign directions so that they form a valid flow. However, since the original graph is undirected, the flow can be in either direction. So the problem is to assign directions to edges such that the flow is valid and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find such an orientation. How?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the flow. In a standard flow network, the flow conservation holds for all nodes except the source and sink. So the sum of flows leaving the source is equal to the sum of flows entering the sink. But in our case, the flow is already given, and the direction is to be determined.\n\nBut how to model the flow conservation. Let me think: for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows going into v must equal the sum of flows going out of v. So for each such node, the net flow is zero.\n\nSo, for each node v (excluding 1 and n), the sum over all edges incident to v of (flow direction) must be zero. Wait, but each edge contributes +ci if directed away from v, -ci if directed towards v. So the sum over all edges incident to v of (direction choice) * ci = 0.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like a system of equations. However, solving this directly for large n and m would be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative approach: think of this as a directed graph where each edge has a direction, and the flow conservation holds. Then, the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that. Maybe we can arrange the nodes in a topological order, and direct the edges accordingly. But how to ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where the flow conservation is satisfied. How?\n\nAnother idea: since the directed graph must be acyclic, there exists a topological order of the nodes. Let's suppose we arrange the nodes in a topological order, say v1, v2, ..., vn. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from earlier nodes to later nodes. But how does this help with flow conservation?\n\nBut how to find such an order that also satisfies the flow conservation constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG, and the flow conservation holds. Let me think of the flow conservation as a balance between incoming and outgoing flows.\n\nFor each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. So, the net",

During traversal, each edge is directed from the parent node to the child node, ensuring the graph remains acyclic.\n- **Direction Assignment**: For each edge encountered during DFS, the direction is set based on the original edge's endpoints. If the edge was originally from the parent to the child, it is kept as is; otherwise, it is reversed.\n- **Flow Conservation**: The DFS ensures that each node (except the source and sink) maintains flow conservation by directing edges away from the source and towards the sink, forming a valid DAG.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs a valid directed acyclic graph with flow conservation, ensuring the solution meets all problem constraints.",
