A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires per friend: nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available are:\n\nDrink: k * l ml.\n\nLime slices: c * d slices.\n\nSalt: p grams.\n\nNow, the number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nSo for drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast takes n * nl ml. So the maximum toasts from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). \n\nFor lime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast needs n slices. So max toasts from limes is total_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast needs n * np grams. So max toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. Drink total is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. For the first example, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation. Then the limes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Divided by n=3, 80//3 is 26. But the sample says limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nAh, because for each toast, you need n slices. So for the first sample, each toast requires 3 slices. So total slices available is 10 * 8 =80. So 80 /3 is 26.666..., which would be 26. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, what's the sample explanation?\n\nIn the first sample, the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, the total slices is 80. Each toast requires n slices (3). So 80 /3 is 26. So why does the sample say 80 toasts?\n\nWait, no. Oh wait, maybe I got the problem wrong. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for the first sample, 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So with 80 slices, you can have 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26 toasts. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's a contradiction. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the sample explanation:\n\nIn the first sample: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 =80 toasts. Oh, maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend, but perhaps the sample explanation is considering that each toast requires one slice per friend, but the calculation is done as total slices divided by 1 (per toast). No, that can't be. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. Therefore, for one toast, n slices are required. So the total number of toasts possible from the limes is (c*d) // n. Because each toast uses n slices. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check the first sample input:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. \n\nSo c=10, d=8. So total slices is 10*8=80. The sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that each toast requires 1 slice. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again:\n\n\"each friend needs a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh, so for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So if there are n friends, each toast requires n slices. So for the first sample, 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So with 80 slices, you can make 80 /3 = 26 toasts. But according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that the sample explanation is considering that each toast requires one slice. Which would be the case if the problem said that each toast requires one slice total. But according to the problem statement, it's per friend. \n\nWait the sample explanation says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why is the limes' value 80? Because the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, the limes should be 80 /3 = 26.666, which would be 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. So for the first sample, the limes can provide 80 slices. So 80 / n = 80 /3 = 26.666, which is 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the sample explanation is not taking into account the number of friends. Because the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So that suggests that the initial numbers are 6 (drink), 80 (limes), 100 (salt). Then divide by 3. So why is the limes' value 80?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the sample explanation is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, which is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait, why 20/3? Because each toast requires 3 friends * 3ml per toast per friend. So 3*3 =9 per toast. 20 /9 = 2.222, which would be 2. But the sample says 6 toasts. So that suggests that the sample explanation is using the total drink divided by nl (3) per toast, not multiplied by n. \n\nWait, that's a big confusion here. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl. So in the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. The total drink is 20 ml. 20//9 is 2. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, each friend needs 3 ml, and for one toast, total is 3 ml. Which would be possible if the problem says that per toast, the total is nl ml for all friends. \n\nThis suggests that I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-express the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for one toast, each friend has to have their own nl ml, slice, and np grams. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl ml. The total slices is n slices. The total salt is n * np grams. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml, and that's enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would be if per toast, the total drink is 3 ml (nl=3). Which would imply that for one toast, the total drink is nl, not n * nl. \n\nSo this is conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nLooking at the sample explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, the drink is 4*5=20. It is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts. But according to the correct calculation, that would be 20/(3*3) = 2.222. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which suggests that the sample explanation is considering that per toast, each friend needs nl ml, but the total per toast is nl. Which is impossible. Unless the problem statement is different.\n\nWait, maybe the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the total per toast is nl. So for example, if there are 3 friends, each toast requires 3 ml total, not 3 per friend. But that would contradict the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So the total per toast is n * nl ml. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, that's not the case. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl. So maybe the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total per toast is nl. Which would be impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, the total amount of drink is n * nl. But the sample explanation says that 20 ml is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be nl. \n\nSo this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong. But that's unlikely. So I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement once more.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these things. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml, and they can make 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / (n * nl) = 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222. But the sample explanation says that it's 20/3 =6. So why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is talking about the number of toasts per friend. Wait, the question is to find how many toasts each friend can make. \n\nWait, the problem says: the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\nAh! So each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend needs some resources. So for t toasts per friend, the total drink required is n * t * nl. Because each of the n friends makes t toasts, each requiring nl per toast. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose each friend makes t toasts. Then for each toast, each friend consumes nl ml. So for one friend, t toasts would require t * nl ml. For all n friends, it's n * t * nl ml. \n\nSimilarly, for the lime slices: each toast per friend needs a slice. So per friend, t toasts require t slices. For all friends, n * t slices. \n\nSalt: per toast per friend, np grams. So total salt is n * t * np grams. \n\nSo the total resources available must be >= these amounts.\n\nSo the drink available is k * l. So:\n\nk * l >= n * t * nl \n\n=> t <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nSimilarly for the limes:\n\nc * d >= n * t \n\n=> t <= (c*d) / n \n\nAnd for salt:\n\np >= n * t * np \n\n=> t <= p/(n * np)\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the first sample:\n\nk*l = 4*5=20\n\nn * nl = 3 * 3 =9 \n\nso t_drink = 20 /9 = 2.222, floor is 2.\n\nc*d = 10 *8=80. n=3. So t_limes = 80 /3 =26.666, floor is 26.\n\np is 100, n * np =3 *1=3. So 100/3=33.333, floor is 33.\n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which seems to be a mistake. Wait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait why is the drink enough for 6 toasts? Because according to their calculation, 20 /3 =6. But according to the correct formula, the drink is 20, and for t toasts, the required is n * t * nl =3 *t *3 =9t. So 9t <=20 => t<=2.222. So why does the sample explanation say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the sample explanation is calculating the total number of toasts that can be made in total, not per friend. Then, dividing by the number of friends to get per friend.\n\nFor example, in the sample explanation, they say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be total toasts. Then since there are 3 friends, each can make 6/3=2 toasts.\n\nBut how is the total toasts calculated? Let me think.\n\nIf the total toasts is T, then each friend makes T/n toasts. But that would require that T is divisible by n. However, the problem says that all friends must make the same amount. So T must be a multiple of n. But the way the problem is structured, the maximum T is the minimum of the three resources. But perhaps the sample explanation is thinking of T as the total number of toasts, and then dividing by n to get per friend.\n\nBut according to the correct approach, the t is the maximum such that:\n\nt <= (k*l) / (n * nl) \n\nt <= (c*d) / n \n\nt <= p/(n * np)\n\nWhich is exactly what I thought earlier.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, they computed the total toasts as 20 /3 =6 (for drink), which would be T =6. Then divided by 3 friends to get 2 per friend. But why is T =6?\n\nBecause for the drink, the total required for T toasts is T * n * nl. So:\n\nT * n * nl <= k*l \n\n=> T <= (k*l) / (n * nl )\n\nWhich in the first sample is 20/(3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.222. So T is 2. So the total toasts is 2, and each friend makes 2 toasts. But according to the sample explanation, they are saying that the drink allows for 6 total toasts, which would require T=6. So that's a contradiction. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. So the sample explanation seems to calculate for each resource the maximum total toasts possible, then divides by n to get per friend. Which suggests that the total toasts T is computed as:\n\nFor drink: T_drink = (k*l) // nl \n\nFor limes: T_limes = (c*d) // 1 (since each toast requires one slice per friend? Or per toast?)\n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that each toast is made by all friends together. So for each toast, each friend takes part, and thus consumes their own portion. So the total number of toasts is T. For each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So total drink is T * n * nl. Which brings us back to the original approach. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml, which is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be T_drink = 20 /3 =6. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. So T_drink * 3 = 20. Which would mean that T_drink = 20/3 =6. But that would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl. So per toast, the total drink is nl. Which would mean that per toast, all friends together consume nl ml. Which would be impossible unless nl is the total per toast, not per friend. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. \n\nBut the sample explanation must be correct. So what's the correct way to model this?\n\nLet me look at the sample explanation again. The first sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. The output is 2. According to the sample explanation, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Then divided by 3 friends gives 2. So how is 6 calculated?\n\nIn the sample explanation, they say that the drink is 4*5=20 ml. It is enough to make 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that per toast, 3 ml is consumed. So for 6 toasts, 6 *3 =18 ml. Which is under 20. So why is that the case?\n\nIf per toast, the total drink is nl (3 ml), then the total for T toasts is T * nl. Which would be 3*T. Then 3*T <= 20 → T ≤6.666. So T=6. \n\nBut according to this, the drink allows for T=6 toasts. Then, since there are 3 friends, each can make 6/3 =2 toasts. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut this would mean that for each toast, the total drink used is nl, not per friend. Which would imply that the problem statement is different. \n\nSo this suggests that the problem statement may have been misread. Let me recheck the problem statement once again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So the total for one toast is n * nl ml. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the total for one toast is nl ml. So why is this discrepancy?\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding between the total number of toasts and the number of toasts per friend. \n\nLet me think differently. Suppose that the number of toasts each friend can make is t. Then, for each friend, they make t toasts. For each toast, they need nl ml. So for one friend, total drink is t * nl. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nWhich is what I thought before. \n\nBut in the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml. Which equals n * t * nl = 3 * t *3 =9t. So 9t <=20 → t=2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would be T=6, and then t = T /n =6/3=2. Which is the same result. \n\nSo perhaps the sample explanation is calculating T as the total number of toasts that can be made by all friends combined. Then, each friend makes T/n toasts. \n\nSo how to compute T? \n\nFor T to be the total number of toasts, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink. So T * n * nl <= k*l → T <= (k*l) / (n * nl). \n\nBut the sample explanation says that T_drink is 20/3=6. Which would be if T * nl <=k*l. So T <= (k*l)/nl. \n\nWhich would be the case if each toast requires nl ml in total. \n\nSo this is a contradiction. \n\nBut the sample explanation is correct, so I need to find out what's the right way to model it. \n\nLet me try to think of the sample explanation's calculation. \n\nSample explanation says:\n\nDrink: 20 ml. Enough for 20/3=6 toasts. \n\nLimes: 10*8=80 slices. Enough for 80 toasts. \n\nSalt: 100/1=100 toasts. \n\nThen min(6, 80, 100) is 6. Divide by 3 friends, gives 2. \n\nSo the sample explanation assumes that for each resource, the maximum number of total toasts is:\n\nDrink: (total drink) / nl \n\nLimes: (total slices) / 1 \n\nSalt: (total salt) / np \n\nThen, the minimum of these is divided by n to get the per-friend toasts. \n\nBut why? \n\nThis suggests that each toast requires nl ml total, not per friend. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl ml per toast. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the correct approach is:\n\nTotal toasts T is limited by:\n\nT <= (k*l) / nl \n\nT <= (c*d) / 1 \n\nT <= p / np \n\nThen, the answer is floor(T /n). \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nLet me think: if each toast requires nl ml per friend, and there are n friends, then for T total toasts, each friend makes T/n toasts. \n\nWait, no. If there are T total toasts, then each toast involves all friends. So each friend makes T toasts. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each toast is made by all friends together. So each toast is a single event where each friend drinks once. So the number of toasts is T, and each friend makes T toasts. \n\nSo for each toast, the drink required is n * nl. \n\nSo total drink is T * n * nl. \n\nWhich would mean T = (k*l) / (n * nl). \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, they are computing T as (k*l) / nl. \n\nSo why is there a discrepancy? \n\nMaybe the problem is that the sample explanation is incorrect. Or perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per person, but the total per toast is nl. \n\nBut that would be impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters in total for all friends. \n\nIn that case, the calculations would align with the sample explanation. \n\nLet me recheck the problem statement again. \n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these things. So if there are T toasts, each friend participates in T toasts. So for each toast, each friend needs their own share. \n\nSo for T toasts, each friend needs T * nl ml of drink. \n\nSo for all friends, total drink is n * T * nl. \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nSo the sample explanation's calculation of 20/3=6 is not aligned with this. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be T=6. \n\nIf T=6, then total drink is n*T*nl = 3 *6 *3 =54, which is larger than 20. So that's impossible. \n\nSo this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation's description is wrong, but the actual calculation is as per the sample code. \n\nBut how to resolve this? \n\nLet me look at the sample input and output. \n\nFirst sample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. Output is 2. \n\nIf we use the approach where for each resource, compute the maximum possible t (per friend), then take the minimum:\n\nDrink: (k*l) // (n * nl) = (4*5)/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2 \n\nLimes: (c*d) //n = (10*8)/3 = 80/3 =26.666 → 26 \n\nSalt: p // (n * np) = 100/(3*1) = 33.333 →33 \n\nMinimum is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo this approach gives the correct result. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, they computed for drink: 20/3=6, then divided by 3 to get 2. \n\nWhich is the same as the correct approach. \n\nSo how is 6 derived? \n\nWell, 20/3 is 6.666, which is the value of (k*l) / nl = 20/3=6.666. Then, dividing by n gives 6.666/3=2.222, which is floored to 2. \n\nSo the sample explanation is saying that T_drink = (k*l)/nl = 20/3=6.666, then T_drink /n = 2.222 → floor to 2. \n\nBut how is T_drink calculated? \n\nIt appears that in the sample explanation, they are calculating T_drink as (total drink) / nl, which is 20/3 =6.666. Then dividing by n (3) gives 2.222. \n\nBut why would T_drink be calculated as (total drink)/nl? \n\nThat would be the case if each toast requires nl ml of drink in total, not per friend. \n\nBut the problem statement says that each friend needs nl ml per toast. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nBut the correct way to get the sample output is to calculate for each resource the maximum t as follows:\n\nt_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl) \n\nt_lime = (c*d) // n \n\nt_salt = p // (n * np) \n\nthen answer is min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt). \n\nWhich gives the correct sample output. \n\nSo the sample explanation's reasoning is wrong, but the correct approach is as above. \n\nSo the code should be written as:\n\nRead n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l \n\ntotal_drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d \n\ntotal_lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n \n\ntotal_salt = p \n\ntotal_salt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np) \n\nresult = min(total_drink_toasts, total_lime_toasts, total_salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nLet me test this against the sample input. \n\nFirst sample input: \n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink=20 \n\nn * nl =3*3=9 → 20//9=2 \n\nc=10, d=8 → total_lime_slices=80 → 80//3=26 \n\np=100 → n * np =3*1=3 → 100//3=33. \n\nmin(2,26,33) is 2 → correct. \n\nSecond sample input: \n\n['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink = 100*10=1000 \n\nn * nl =5 *4=20 → 1000//20=50 \n\nc=1, d=19 → total_lime_slices=19 → 19//5=3 \n\nsalt: p=90, n*np=5*3=15 → 90//15=6 \n\nmin(50,3,6) is 3 → which matches the sample output. \n\nThird sample input: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1,000,000 \n\nn * nl =10*50=500 → 1e6 /500 = 2000 \n\nc=25, d=23 → total_lime_slices=25*23=575 → 575//10=57 \n\nsalt: p=1, n*np=10*1=10 → 1//10=0 \n\nso min(2000,57,0) → 0 → matches sample output. \n\nYes, this works. \n\nSo the code should be written accordingly. \n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input line, split into integers. \n\nBut the input is given as a list of lines, but the problem says that the input is a single line. \n\nWait, looking at the sample input given in the problem:\n\nThe input is given as a list of lines, like:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that's probably for testing purposes. In reality, the program should read one line from stdin. \n\nWait the problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nSo the code should read one line from input. \n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines. But that's probably for the example. \n\nBut the user provided the sample input as a list of lines, but the actual input is one line. \n\nSo the code should read one line from stdin. \n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the line, split into parts, convert to integers. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlimes = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink, limes, salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut wait, what if any of these divisions are zero? Like in the third sample, the salt is 1 // (10 * 1) = 0. \n\nYes, which is correct. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nTesting the first sample input: \n\nInput line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\ndrink: 4*5=20, n * nl =3*3=9 → 20//9=2 \n\nlimes: 10*8=80 //3=26 \n\nsalt: 100 // (3*1)=33 → min is 2. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The goal is to find the minimum number of toasts that can be made considering all resources.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink available, the total number of lime slices, and the total amount of salt.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total number of lime slices. Each toast requires `n` slices.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt.\n3. **Determine the Minimum**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Thus, take the minimum value from the three calculated values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_limes = c * d\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_limes = total_limes // n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_limes, toast_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. This is then divided by the amount of drink required per toast for all friends combined.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is determined by multiplying the number of limes by the number of slices per lime. This is then divided by the number of friends to determine how many toasts can be made.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total amount of salt is divided by the amount of salt required per toast for all friends combined.\n- **Result**: The minimum value among the three calculated values gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring that all resources are sufficient for that number of toasts.",
