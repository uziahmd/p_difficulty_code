A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, each toast requires nl ml of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and np grams of salt per friend.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs these things. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl ml. Because each friend has one toast. Wait, no. Wait, if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend uses some resources. Or maybe for each toast, all friends have one. Like, for each toast, each friend needs their own portion. So for example, if there are t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml, so total drink per toast is n * nl ml. But wait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink for a toast. So for one toast, each friend has one, so total for one toast is n * nl ml. But if there are t toasts, then total drink needed is t * n * nl.\n\nSimilarly, for lime slices: each toast requires each friend to have a slice. So for t toasts, each friend needs t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. But since each lime is cut into d slices, the total available slices is c * d. So the maximum t allowed by limes is (c*d) // (n) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For t toasts, each friend needs one slice per toast. So total slices needed is n * t. Because each of the n friends has t toasts, each requiring a slice. So total slices needed is n * t. The available slices is c * d. So the maximum t allowed by limes is (c * d) // n. Because n*t <= c*d → t ≤ (c*d)/n.\n\nSimilarly for salt: each toast, each friend needs np grams. So total salt needed for t toasts is t * n * np. And the available salt is p grams. So t must satisfy t * n * np ≤ p → t ≤ p/(n * np).\n\nFor the drink: total available is k * l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So t must satisfy t * n * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl).\n\nSo the answer is the minimum of the three possible values from drink, limes, and salt. Then take the floor of that minimum.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So the number of toasts per friend is t, which must be the same for all. So the maximum possible t is the minimum of the three values calculated as:\n\nt_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nt_lime = (c * d) // n\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt).\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires n * nl = 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nFor limes: c=10, d=8. Total slices is 80. Divided by n=3 → 80//3 is 26.666… → 26? But sample says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, no. Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Wait, but according to my previous calculation, the t_lime is (c*d) // n. But in the sample, that would be 80//3=26. So why does the sample explanation say that limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nAh, here's the confusion. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nEach toast requires each friend to have a slice of lime. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. So for one toast, total slices needed is n. So for t toasts, total slices needed is n * t. So the maximum t is (c*d) // (n). \n\nBut in the sample, c*d is 10 * 8 = 80. So 80 divided by n=3 is 26.666… which would be 26. But the sample explanation says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the sample explanation says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nLet me check the note again. The note says:\n\nIn the first sample, the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires each friend to have a slice. So for one toast, each of the 3 friends needs a slice. So for one toast, 3 slices. So for 80 toasts, 3*80 = 240 slices. But the total slices available is 80. So that's impossible. So there's a mistake here. Wait, but the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that perhaps the problem statement is different than what I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the available slices is c * d. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nIn the first sample, c is 10, d is 8. So 10*8=80 slices. n is 3. So 80//3 is 26. So the sample explanation says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. But that's not possible. So why does the sample explanation say that?\n\nWait looking at the note again:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait wait, why is the limes enough for 80 toasts? According to this, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to our previous calculation, that's only possible if each toast requires one slice. But in that case, 80 toasts would require 80 slices. Which is exactly what's available. So maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend. Or perhaps per toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. But in the sample explanation, they have 80 slices, and that's enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that each toast requires one slice. So that suggests that maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice for all friends combined. That is, for each toast, one slice. But that would be strange.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible if each toast requires one slice. Then 80 slices would allow 80 toasts. So that's the case. But that contradicts the problem statement. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the sample explanation must be wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would mean that the total number of slices is 80, and each toast requires one slice. So the sample explanation seems to suggest that for each toast, one slice is needed. So perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for each toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So in the sample, the total slices is 80. So 80 / (n) = 80 /3 = 26.666. So the maximum t is 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So why is that?\n\nThis discrepancy indicates that I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. Therefore, for one toast, n slices are needed. For t toasts, n * t slices. So in the sample input, the limes are 10, each cut into 8 slices. So total slices is 10 * 8 = 80. So for t toasts, n * t must be ≤ 80. So t ≤ 80 / n. For n=3, 80/3 is 26.666. So t is 26. So why does the sample explanation say that limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nWait the sample explanation says: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Which suggests that the number of toasts is 80, but according to our calculation, that would require 3 * 80 = 240 slices. But 10 * 8 is 80 slices. So that's impossible. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong here?\n\nWait maybe the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice per friend. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible only if each toast requires one slice. So perhaps the problem statement is different. Maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice for the entire group. So for each toast, one slice. Then, for t toasts, t slices are needed. Which would make the sample explanation correct.\n\nBut that would contradict the problem statement. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo each friend needs a slice for each toast. So for each toast, each friend has one slice. So for t toasts, each friend has t slices, total n * t slices.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that the total slices is 80. So if t is 80, then n * t = 3 * 80 = 240 slices. Which is way more than 80. So this is impossible. Therefore, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs one slice. But the sample explanation is incorrect? No, that's unlikely. So what's the correct way to interpret the problem?\n\nLet me look back at the sample input and output.\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSample output is 2.\n\nAccording to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the note says that the drink allows 6 toasts, limes allow 80, salt allows 100. Then the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3? That doesn't make sense. Wait, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. But why divide by 3?\n\nAh, wait! Oh! Wait, perhaps the initial calculations are wrong. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So the number of toasts per friend is t. So for each friend, they make t toasts. So for the entire group, the total number of toasts is t per person, but the resources are calculated based on the total needed for all toasts.\n\nSo for the drink: each toast per friend requires nl ml. So for t toasts per friend, each friend needs t * nl ml. For all n friends, the total drink needed is n * t * nl.\n\nSimilarly, for the limes: each toast per friend needs one slice. So for t toasts per friend, each friend needs t slices. Total slices needed is n * t.\n\nFor salt: each toast per friend needs np grams. Total is n * t * np.\n\nSo the available drink is k * l. So the maximum t for drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nAvailable slices is c * d. So maximum t for limes is (c*d) // (n).\n\nAvailable salt is p. So maximum t for salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nDrink: (4 * 5) / (3 * 3) = 20 /9 = 2.222 → 2.\n\nLimes: (10 * 8) /3 = 80/3 = 26.666 → 26.\n\nSalt: 100 / (3 *1) = 33.333 → 33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. Which matches the sample output. So the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to this calculation, it's 26. So why does the note say that limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nAh! The note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But that's not the t value. Wait, the note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 20 ml of drink, which is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, where does that 6 come from? Because for the drink, the total required for t toasts is n * t * nl = 3 * t * 3 = 9t. So 9t <= 20 → t <= 2.222. So why does the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me re-calculate the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo:\n\nTotal drink is 4 * 5 = 20 ml.\n\nEach toast requires per friend nl=3 ml. So for one toast, each friend needs 3 ml. For t toasts, each friend needs 3t ml. For 3 friends, total drink is 3 * 3t = 9t ml. So 9t <= 20 → t <= 2.222. So the maximum t is 2. Which is what the sample output is.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Where does this 20/3 come from?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is considering the total number of toasts, not per friend. For example, if the total number of toasts is T, then each friend makes T toasts. Wait, no. Or perhaps the note is thinking of the total number of toasts made by all friends. For example, if each friend makes t toasts, then total toasts is n*t. So for drink, total required is (n*t) * nl. Because each toast requires nl per friend. Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nIf each friend makes t toasts, then for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per friend, total drink is t * nl. For n friends, total is n * t * nl.\n\nBut the total available drink is k * l. So n * t * nl ≤ k * l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl).\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if the total number of toasts is 6. But that would be for t=2 (each friend makes 2 toasts, total toasts is 3 * 2 = 6). So the note is talking about the total number of toasts, not per friend. So the note says that the drink allows for 6 total toasts (which would be t=2 per friend), but the limes allow for 80 total toasts (t=80/3=26.666 per friend?), but the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So the note is using the total toasts, not per friend.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach was wrong. Let me re-analyze.\n\nThe problem says that each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts is n * t.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which is the total number of toasts. So for the drink, the total number of toasts is T = n * t. So the drink required is T * nl. Because each toast requires nl per friend. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf each toast is per friend, then for T total toasts (each friend makes t toasts, so T = n * t), then the total drink required is T * nl. Because each toast requires nl ml. So for example, if T is the total number of toasts, then drink needed is T * nl.\n\nBut that would be the case if each toast requires nl ml per toast. But the problem says that each friend needs nl ml per toast. So for each toast that a friend makes, they need nl ml. So if there are T total toasts (n * t), then the total drink needed is T * nl. Because each toast requires nl ml. \n\nBut then, for the first sample, T is 6 (as per the note), and 6 * nl = 6 * 3 = 18 ml. Which is less than 20. So that's possible.\n\nSo with this approach, the drink is sufficient for T = (k * l) // nl. Because T * nl ≤ k*l.\n\nSimilarly, for the limes: each toast requires one slice. So total number of toasts T must be ≤ c*d. Because each toast requires one slice. So T = (c*d) // 1 = c*d.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams. So T * np ≤ p → T ≤ p // np.\n\nThen the answer is min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) // n ?\n\nWait, because T is the total number of toasts, and each friend makes t = T / n toasts. Since T must be divisible by n? Or not. Because the problem says that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So T must be divisible by n, since T = n * t. So the maximum T is the minimum of the three values (drink, limes, salt), and then t = T // n.\n\nWait, let's take the first sample:\n\nDrink: (4*5)/3 = 20/3 = 6.666 → 6 toasts (T=6).\n\nLimes: 10*8=80 toasts (T=80).\n\nSalt: 100 / 1 = 100 toasts (T=100).\n\nSo the minimum T is 6. Then t = 6 / 3 = 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAh! Now that makes sense. So the initial approach was wrong. The correct approach is to compute the maximum T (total toasts) possible, which is the minimum between:\n\n- total_drink = (k * l) // nl → because T * nl ≤ k*l → T ≤ (k*l) // nl.\n\n- total_limes = c * d → since each toast needs one slice.\n\n- total_salt = p // np → since T * np ≤ p → T ≤ p // np.\n\nThen, the maximum T is min(total_drink, total_limes, total_salt). Then, the number of toasts per friend is T // n. Because T must be divisible by n? Or not?\n\nWait, no. Because T is the total number of toasts. Since each friend makes the same number of toasts, T must be divisible by n. Otherwise, you can't split it equally. For example, if T is 7 and n is 3, then each friend can't make 2.333 toasts. So the actual maximum T is the minimum of the three values, but then we have to take the floor division of T divided by n.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that T is divisible by n? Because if T is not divisible by n, then the actual maximum T is the largest value less than or equal to the minimum of the three values that is divisible by n. But that seems complicated. However, the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So the maximum possible t is the maximum integer such that t * n ≤ T_max, where T_max is the minimum of the three values.\n\nSo the maximum t is floor(T_max / n).\n\nIn the first sample, T_max is 6. 6 / 3 = 2. So t is 2.\n\nIn the case where T_max is 7 and n=3, then t is 2 (since 3*2=6 ≤7, and 3*3=9>7).\n\nThus, the correct approach is:\n\nCalculate T_drink = (k*l) // nl\n\nT_lime = c * d\n\nT_salt = p // np\n\nT_max = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n\nThen the answer is T_max // n.\n\nSo this explains the sample.\n\nLet's recheck the first sample:\n\nT_drink is (4*5)/3 = 20//3 = 6.\n\nT_lime is 10*8=80.\n\nT_salt is 100//1 = 100.\n\nT_max = 6. 6//3=2 → correct.\n\nAnother example: if T_max is 7 and n=3 → 7//3=2.\n\nSo this is the correct approach.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute total_drink = (k * l) // nl. Because each toast requires nl ml. So total toasts T can't exceed (k*l) // nl.\n\n2. Compute total_limes = c * d. Because each toast needs one slice.\n\n3. Compute total_salt = p // np. Because each toast needs np grams.\n\nThen T_max = min(total_drink, total_limes, total_salt).\n\nAnswer is T_max // n.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So the mistake earlier was thinking that the drink was calculated as (k*l) // (n * nl), but that's not the case. Instead, the drink is calculated as (k*l) // nl, because each toast (regardless of which friend) requires nl ml. So for example, if there are T toasts, each requires nl ml. So total drink is T * nl. So T can be up to (k*l) // nl.\n\nSo the formula for T_drink is (k*l) // nl.\n\nNow, let's check the first sample's note again. It says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which is exactly T_drink = 20//3=6. Yes.\n\nSo this is the correct approach.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nThe code should read the input values, compute these three totals, take their minimum, then divide by n, taking the floor.\n\nSo for each input line, we need to process the numbers.\n\nLet me test with the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink = (4*5) // 3 = 20//3=6.\n\ntotal_limes = 10 * 8 =80.\n\ntotal_salt = 100//1=100.\n\nT_max = 6. 6//3=2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input line: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink total is 100*10=1000. nl=4 → 1000//4=250.\n\ntotal_limes: 1 *19=19.\n\ntotal_salt: 90//3=30.\n\nT_max is min(250,19,30) →19. 19//5=3.8 → floor is 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input line: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink total is 1000*1000=1,000,000. nl=50 → 1,000,000 //50 = 20000.\n\ntotal_limes: 25 *23=575.\n\ntotal_salt: 1//1=1.\n\nT_max is 1. 1//10=0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = (k * l) // nl\n\ntotal_limes = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p // np\n\nt_max = min(total_drink, total_limes, total_salt)\n\nanswer = t_max // n\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead the line as integers.\n\nThen compute the above steps.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead input line from stdin. Split into integers.\n\nFor example, for the first input line:\n\ninput_line = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = input_line\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = (k * l) // nl\n\ntotal_limes = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p // np\n\nt_max = min(total_drink, total_limes, total_salt)\n\nans = t_max // n\n\nprint(ans)\n\nBut wait, what if any of the values are zero? Well, since all inputs are positive integers, per the problem statement. So no division by zero.\n\nLet me check the constraints:\n\nThe input numbers are positive integers, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. So yes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → ans is 6//3=2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → total_drink = 100*10=1000 //4=250. total_limes=1*19=19. total_salt=90//3=30. min is 19. 19//5=3.8 → 3.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → total_drink = 1000*1000//50 = 1000000//50 = 20000. total_limes=25*23=575. total_salt=1//1=1. min is 1. 1//10=0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code will read from stdin, process each line, and print the answer.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of input lines. For example, in the sample input given in the problem statement, the input is three lines. But the user says that the input is a single line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is given as a single line. The sample input shows three lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe input says:\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nSo the code should read a single line of input. But in the sample input, the user shows three lines. But that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and print output. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given in a line. But the problem's sample input shows three lines, but the output shows three lines. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line. The sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's a formatting error. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nSo the input is a single line. The sample input given in the problem is probably for multiple test cases, but the actual code should read one line per test case. However, in the sample input, the user shows three lines, which may be three test cases. But the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from standard input and print the desired outputs. So for example, if the input is three lines, each being a separate test case, then the code should process each line and output three lines.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nOutput:\n\n['2', '3', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should read multiple lines of input (each line being a test case) and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first and only line. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line of input. However, the problem's note says that the code should read from stdin and print to stdout.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should be ready to run and handle the inputs. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each being a test case. But the problem says that the input is a single line. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line. So the code should read one line, process it, and output one line. But the sample input shows three lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases, but the problem may have a mistake. However, the user's example shows that the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three lines, and the output is a list of three lines. But the problem says that the input is a single line. This is likely a mistake in the problem description. However, in the problem's original context, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single line of input and output a single line. But in the sample, there are three test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, and the actual code should process multiple lines of input, each being a test case.\n\nBut the problem's input says that the first and only line contains the numbers. So the code should read one line of input. However, the sample input shows three lines. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's note, the sample input is given as a list of three lines, and the output is three lines. So the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is one line. This is conflicting.\n\nHowever, looking at the problem's original source, perhaps it's from Codeforces or similar, and the actual input is one line per test case. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the input is given as one line. So perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly. For example, the sample input may have three test cases, each given on a separate line. So the code should read each line and process it.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first and only line. This is conflicting.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read from stdin and print the desired outputs. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each being a test case. For example, in the sample input, there are three test cases, each given as a line. The code should read all lines from stdin, process each one, and print the result for each.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all lines from stdin, process each line, and output the answer for each line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. But the sample shows multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is from a contest where the input is multiple test cases, but the problem statement is not accurate. However, the user's example shows that the code should process multiple lines.\n\nBut given that the user's example includes multiple input lines and outputs, I think that the code should read multiple lines of input, each representing a test case. So in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split each into integers, process, and print the result.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single line. However, the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the actual code should read multiple lines. Given the sample input and output, it's likely that the code should process multiple test cases, each given as a line.\n\nSo the code should read all lines from stdin, for each line, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? For example, the code could be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    # process line\n\nBut for the purpose of the problem, perhaps the code is supposed to read one line. However, the sample input and output show multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple lines. But the problem statement says that the input is a single line. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the user's sample input and output:\n\nThe input is given as a list of three lines, and the output is a list of three lines. So the code must read each line and process it.\n\nSo, in the code, we need to read each line, split into integers, compute the answer, and print.\n\nTherefore, the code will process each line of input.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line.strip().split())\n    total_drink = (k * l",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Constraints**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. We need to calculate the maximum number of toasts that can be made considering all three resources.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available and determine how many toasts can be made with this amount.\n   - **Limes**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available and determine how many toasts can be made with these slices.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate the total grams of salt available and determine how many toasts can be made with this amount.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts is constrained by the minimum of the values calculated from the drink, limes, and salt. Finally, divide this value by the number of friends to ensure each friend makes the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line.strip().split())\n    total_drink = (k * l) // nl\n    total_limes = c * d\n    total_salt = p // np\n    t_max = min(total_drink, total_limes, total_salt)\n    print(t_max // n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads each line from standard input, which contains the parameters for each test case.\n2. **Resource Calculations**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available and divide by the amount needed per toast to determine how many toasts can be made.\n   - **Total Limes**: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices each lime is cut into to get the total number of slices.\n   - **Total Salt**: Divide the total grams of salt by the amount needed per toast to determine how many toasts can be made.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum of the three resource constraints gives the maximum number of toasts possible. This value is then divided by the number of friends to ensure each friend makes the same number of toasts, using integer division to handle any remainder.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required values and ensures that all constraints are respected, providing the correct result for each test case.",
