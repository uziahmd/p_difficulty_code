Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge choosing turns to take digits from a number A such that each makes exactly n moves (since the total digits are 2n). The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. And we need to find the sequence of H and M moves that achieves this maximum.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to decide for each step whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit, in a way that maximizes the total sum. But since both players are making exactly n moves, the choice at each step affects the remaining options.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of steps is 36. But trying all possibilities would be O(2^36), which is way too big. That's impossible for brute-force.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a dynamic programming approach here. Let's think about the state. The state depends on how many digits have been taken so far by each player. For example, if Homer has taken h moves and Marge has taken m moves, then the current state is (h, m). Since each must take exactly n moves, the total steps is 2n, and h + m = current step. Also, h can range from 0 to n, and m can range from 0 to n, but with h + m <= 2n and h <=n, m <=n.\n\nBut for each state (h, m), the remaining digits are the digits from position (h + m) onwards. Wait, because each time a digit is taken from the left. So for example, if we have taken h + m digits already, the next digit to take is the (h + m + 1)th digit of the original A.\n\nSo, the state can be represented by h and m (number of digits taken by Homer and Marge so far). The maximum number of states would be (n+1)*(n+1) = 18*18=324, which is manageable.\n\nBut what's the value we need to track? Since the goal is to maximize the total sum, for each state (h, m), we need to know the maximum possible sum that can be achieved from that state onward. Then, we can make decisions based on which choice (H or M) gives a better total.\n\nBut how do we compute that? Let's think recursively. Suppose we are at state (h, m). The next move can be either H or M, provided that h < n or m < n respectively.\n\nFor example, if h < n, then Homer can take the next digit. The digit is A[h + m], since we've taken h + m digits already. Then, the sum contributed by this choice is the digit multiplied by 10^{remaining digits} (but wait, the digits are added to the front of their number. Oh right! Because when you take a digit, you append it to your number. Wait, no: the problem says that each turn, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his number. So, for example, if the original number is 1234, and Homer takes first digit 1, then his number is '1', and then the remaining digits are 234. Then, if Marge takes next, she takes 2, her number is '2', and then remaining is 34, etc.\n\nBut the actual value of S1 and S2 depends on the order in which digits are taken. For instance, if Homer takes a digit first, then that digit is the first digit of his number, and subsequent digits are added to the end. So, the value of S1 is the digits taken by Homer in the order they were taken, concatenated. So, the first digit taken by Homer is the first digit of S1, the next is second, etc. Therefore, the value of S1 is sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (digit_i * 10^{n-1 -i}).\n\nBut when considering the DP approach, how do we track the contribution of the digits taken so far? Because the same state (h, m) could have different contributions depending on the choices made before. However, since the problem requires maximizing the total sum of S1 and S2, perhaps we can model the DP state as the maximum total sum that can be achieved from the current state onward, given that Homer has taken h digits and Marge m digits so far.\n\nWait, but the digits that have been taken so far contribute to the sum. However, the digits taken in previous steps affect the value of S1 and S2. For example, if Homer took a digit d at step k, then this digit contributes d multiplied by 10^{n - h'}, where h' is the number of digits he had taken before that step. But this seems complicated to track in the DP state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP state can be (h, m), and for each state, we track the maximum possible total sum that can be achieved from that state onwards, given that Homer has already taken h digits and Marge m digits. Then, when we choose to take a digit now, we can calculate how much it contributes to the total sum.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Suppose we are at state (h, m), meaning Homer has taken h digits and Marge m digits. The current digit to take is the (h + m)th digit (assuming zero-based or one-based? Well, the original A has 2n digits. For example, if h + m is 0, then the first digit is taken. So, the index is h + m in the original string.)\n\nIf the next move is Homer taking the digit, then he adds this digit to his number. The position of this digit in his number is h-th position (since he has already taken h digits, this will be the (h+1)th digit, which is the first digit in his number if h was 0). Wait, no. For example, if Homer takes a digit when he has h digits already, then this new digit is appended to his number, which makes it h+1 digits. So, the first digit he takes is the first digit of his number. The next one is the second, etc. Therefore, the value of this digit in S1 is digit * 10^{n - (h+1)} }, because when he has taken h+1 digits, the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc. Wait, no. If the total length of S1 is n digits, then for each digit taken by Homer at step i (when he has taken h digits before this step), the digit is placed at position h (the next position). The value of that digit is digit * 10^{n - (h + 1)} }, since the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, ..., the last by 10^0.\n\nSo, for example, if Homer takes a digit now, when he has already taken h digits, then this digit will be the (h+1)th digit of his number. The contribution of this digit to the total sum is digit * 10^{n - (h + 1)}. Similarly for Marge.\n\nBut this seems to require knowing h and m for each state. Because when we take a digit now, the contribution depends on how many digits each has already taken.\n\nTherefore, the DP state can be (h, m), and for each state, we can compute the maximum total sum that can be achieved from that state onward. The transition would be:\n\nAt state (h, m), the next digit is A[h + m].\n\nIf Homer can take it (h < n), then the contribution is (digit * 10^{n - (h + 1)} ) plus the DP value of the next state (h + 1, m).\n\nSimilarly, if Marge can take it (m < n), then the contribution is (digit * 10^{n - (m + 1)} ) plus the DP value of the next state (h, m + 1).\n\nWait, but why? Because when Homer takes the digit now, he adds it to his number. The position of this digit in his number is h+1 (since he had h digits before). So, the contribution is digit * 10^{n - (h+1)} }, and then the rest of the digits will be added in the future steps, which are accounted for by the DP value.\n\nBut the DP value for (h, m) represents the maximum total sum from that state onwards, including the current choice.\n\nSo, the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[h][m] = max( (current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp[h+1][m]) if Homer can take, (current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp[h][m+1}) if Marge can take )\n\nBut wait, the current digit is added to either Homer's or Marge's number. So, the contribution of this digit to the total sum is (digit * 10^{n - h - 1} ) for Homer, or (digit * 10^{n - m - 1} ) for Marge. Then, the rest of the digits are handled by the DP.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nThe problem is that for each state (h, m), we need to compute the maximum possible sum. So, the DP approach would memoize these values.\n\nNow, the base case is when h + m = 2n, which is impossible, but the base case is when h = n and m = n, which is when all digits have been taken. In that case, the sum is 0.\n\nSo, the DP can be built recursively with memoization, using memoization for (h, m) states.\n\nBut for n up to 18, the maximum h and m are 18, so the number of states is (19)^2 = 361, which is very manageable.\n\nBut how to compute the 10^{...} terms quickly? Well, for each h and m, when we take a digit, the exponent depends on h or m. For example, when Homer takes a digit, the exponent is (n - h - 1). But since n can be up to 18, the exponents can be up to 17, so precomputing powers of 10 up to 18 digits is feasible.\n\nSo, precompute a power array, where power[k] = 10^k. But wait, for the exponent, for example, if Homer takes a digit when he has h digits already, then the exponent is (n - (h + 1)) ?\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose Homer's number has length n. Each digit he takes contributes to his number. The first digit he takes is the first digit of his number, which is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, ..., the last by 10^0.\n\nSo, when Homer takes a digit at a time when he has already taken h digits, this digit is the (h+1)th digit of his number. Therefore, its contribution is digit * 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nYes. So, the exponent is (n - h - 1). For example, if h is 0, the exponent is n - 1, which is correct.\n\nSo, for each state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m], which is the (h+m)th digit (assuming the original A is 0-based or 1-based? Well, the input is a string. Let's say the input is a string of length 2n. For example, for the first sample input, \"1234\" is 4 digits, n=2. Then, when h + m is 0, the first digit is A[0], which is '1'.\n\nSo, the code would need to process the digits as a string, and for each (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m].\n\nNow, the DP function can be memoized. Let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe can use memoization via lru_cache, but since n is up to 18, and h and m can be up to 18, it's feasible.\n\nBut for the DP, we need to compute the maximum sum, and also track the path (the sequence of H and M choices) that leads to that maximum sum. So, the DP approach needs to track not only the maximum sum but also the choices made.\n\nBut how to do that? Well, perhaps during the DP computation, for each state (h, m), we can track which choice (H or M) gives the maximum sum, and then reconstruct the path once the DP is computed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the powers of 10 up to n (since the maximum exponent is n-1).\n\nWait, for example, for n=18, the exponent can be up to 17. So, 10^17 is a big number, but in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nBut when we compute the contribution of each digit, we need to multiply the digit by 10^{n - h - 1} or similar.\n\nBut how to compute this? For each (h, m) and choice, we can calculate the value.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and A.\n\nCompute the length of A is 2n.\n\nPrecompute the power of 10 for exponents from 0 to n-1. For example, power[i] = 10^i.\n\nThen, implement a memoized DP function that for each (h, m) returns the maximum sum achievable from that state, and also the choice (H or M) that leads to that maximum.\n\nBut how to memoize both the maximum sum and the choice. Well, perhaps two separate memoization tables: one for the maximum sum, and another for the choice (H or M) to take at each state.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, for each state, we can compute the maximum sum and record the best choice.\n\nSo, let's think of the DP as follows:\n\nWe can use memoization for the maximum sum. For each (h, m), the function returns the maximum possible sum from that state onward.\n\nOnce we have the DP table filled, we can backtrack from (0, 0) to find the path.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Precompute the power array.\n\n- Implement a memoization-based DP for the maximum sum.\n\n- Once the DP is computed, backtrack through the choices to build the sequence.\n\nNow, let's think about the DP function.\n\nLet's define a function max_sum(h, m) which returns the maximum sum achievable from state (h, m). The base case is when h == n and m == n, return 0.\n\nElse, the current digit is A[h + m]. Let's call this digit d (converted to integer).\n\nIf h < n, then Homer can take the digit. The contribution would be d * power[n - h - 1] + max_sum(h+1, m).\n\nIf m < n, then Marge can take the digit. The contribution would be d * power[n - m - 1] + max_sum(h, m+1).\n\nWe need to choose between these two options (if both are possible) whichever gives a higher sum. If only one is possible, take that.\n\nBut wait, for example, when h + m = 2n - 1, then the next step is the last digit. So, h + m can be up to 2n-1.\n\nSo, the DP function for (h, m) is:\n\ncurrent_digit = int(A[h + m])\n\nif h < n and m < n: both options are possible.\n\nBut for example, if h is already n, then only Marge can take (but m must be less than n).\n\nSo, for each state, the code will check which options are available.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is:\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    if h == n and m == n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if memo contains (h, m):\n\n        return memo[(h, m)]\n\n    current_digit = int(A[h + m])\n\n    options = []\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        # Homer takes the digit\n\n        contribution = current_digit * power[n - h - 1]\n\n        next_sum = dp(h + 1, m)\n\n        total = contribution + next_sum\n\n        options.append(total)\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        # Marge takes the digit\n\n        contribution = current_digit * power[n - m - 1]\n\n        next_sum = dp(h, m + 1)\n\n        total = contribution + next_sum\n\n        options.append(total)\n\n    # choose the maximum option\n\n    max_total = max(options)\n\n    memo[(h, m)] = max_total\n\n    return max_total\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for some states, there may be only one option. For example, when h is already n, then only Marge can take the digit.\n\nBut how to handle that in code. Also, when both options are possible, we need to compare the two and choose the one with higher total.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, we can then backtrack from (0, 0) to build the sequence.\n\nBut how to backtrack? For that, during the DP computation, we need to track which choice (H or M) was taken for each state (h, m) to reach the maximum sum. So, perhaps during the DP, for each state (h, m), we store not only the maximum sum but also the choice (H or M) that was chosen.\n\nAlternatively, after computing the DP table, during backtracking, for each state (h, m), we can check which choice (H or M) gives the maximum sum. If both are possible, we check which one gives the higher value.\n\nSo, during backtracking, starting from (0, 0), for each step, we check if Homer can take the digit (h < n) and Marge can take (m < n). Then, for each possible choice, compute the value and select the one that matches the DP value.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think.\n\nLet's say during backtracking, we are at (h, m). We need to determine whether the next move was H or M.\n\nFor example, current digit is A[h + m]. Let's compute the value if we take H (if allowed) and compare it with the value if we take M (if allowed). The correct choice is the one that gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut since the DP function already returns the maximum sum, we can compute for each possible choice (H and/or M) the value of (contribution + next_dp_value) and see which one equals the current DP value.\n\nBut how to compute the next_dp_value?\n\nWell, for example, for the current state (h, m), the DP value is max_val. If we choose H, then the next state is (h+1, m), and the contribution is current_digit * power[n - h -1] + dp(h+1, m). But since dp(h, m) is equal to that value (if H is chosen), then we can check whether the contribution for H plus dp(h+1, m) equals the current max_val. If yes, then H is the choice.\n\nBut how to compute that during backtracking? Well, during the backtracking phase, for each state (h, m), we can check both possibilities (if allowed) and see which one gives the correct value.\n\nSo, during backtracking, the steps are:\n\nInitialize h = 0, m = 0.\n\nresult = empty string.\n\nwhile h + m < 2n:\n\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n\n    if h < n and m < n:\n\n        # both options are possible\n\n        option_H = current_digit * power[n - h - 1] + dp(h+1, m)\n\n        option_M = current_digit * power[n - m - 1] + dp(h, m+1)\n\n        if option_H == dp_value:\n\n            result += 'H'\n\n            h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            result += 'M'\n\n            m += 1\n\n    elif h < n:\n\n        # only H can take\n\n        result += 'H'\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # only M can take\n\n        result += 'M'\n\n        m += 1\n\nBut how to get the dp_value for each state? Well, during the DP computation, we have stored all the dp values in a memo table. So during backtracking, for each (h, m), we can get the dp value from the memo.\n\nBut how to compute the option_H and option_M? Because the dp(h+1, m) and dp(h, m+1) are already computed.\n\nSo, during backtracking, we can compute the option for each possible choice and see which one matches the dp value for (h, m).\n\nBut in practice, for the code, this can be implemented.\n\nNow, the problem is that for large n, the power(n - h -1) can be very big. But Python handles big integers, so it's okay.\n\nBut for n up to 18, the maximum power is 10^17, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a memoization-based DP for the maximum sum, then backtrack to find the path.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and A. For example, in the first sample input, n is 2 and A is '1234'.\n\nThen, precompute the power array. For exponents from 0 to n-1. For example, for n=2, exponents are 0 and 1. So power[0] = 1, power[1] = 10.\n\nBut wait, for Homer's contribution, when he takes a digit when he has h digits already, the exponent is (n - h - 1). For example, h=0, the exponent is n - 0 -1 = n-1. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the power array can be precomputed as:\n\npower = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n\nWait, no. For example, if n is 2, then the exponents needed are 1 (n-1 - h?), no. Wait, the exponents are (n - h -1). For h ranging from 0 to n-1.\n\nSo for n=2, h can be 0 or 1.\n\nWhen h=0, the exponent is 2 - 0 -1 = 1 → 10^1.\n\nWhen h=1, exponent is 2 - 1 -1 = 0 → 10^0.\n\nSo the power array needs to have entries up to 10^{n-1}.\n\nSo, the power array can be precomputed as [10^k for k in range(n)].\n\nWait, for exponents from 0 to n-1. So for k in 0..n-1.\n\nYes. So for n=2, the power array is [1, 10].\n\nThus, for a given h, the exponent is (n - h - 1) → which is (n-1 - h). So, for example, when h is 0, exponent is n-1 - 0 = n-1. So the power is power[n - h -1] = power[n-1 - h] ?\n\nWait, the exponent is (n - h - 1). Let's see:\n\nn - h - 1 = (n-1) - h.\n\nSo, the exponent is (n-1 - h). So, for example, for h=0, it's n-1 -0 = n-1. So the power array needs to have elements up to 10^{n-1}.\n\nSo, the power array can be precomputed as:\n\npower = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n\nBut for exponents up to n-1. Wait, for example, for i from 0 to n-1, 10^i. Then, for exponent (n-1 - h), the value is power[n-1 - h].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, when h is 0, the exponent is n-1, which is power[n-1 - 0] = power[n-1], which is 10^{n-1}.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can precompute this.\n\nNow, the DP function. Since Python's recursion stack can be limited, but for n=18, the maximum depth of recursion is 2n steps, which is 36. So recursion is manageable.\n\nBut for memoization, perhaps using lru_cache with a decorator is easier.\n\nBut since the parameters h and m are integers, and the function is called with them, we can memoize the function.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, the function needs to be decorated with @lru_cache(maxsize=None), but the parameters must be hashable.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = ... \n\nA = ... \n\npower = [ ... ]\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h == n and m == n:\n        return 0\n    current_digit = int(A[h + m])\n    options = []\n    if h < n:\n        contribution = current_digit * power[n - h - 1]\n        next_val = dp(h + 1, m)\n        options.append(contribution + next_val)\n    if m < n:\n        contribution = current_digit * power[n - m - 1]\n        next_val = dp(h, m + 1)\n        options.append(contribution + next_val)\n    return max(options)\n\nBut wait, this code is wrong. Because when both options are available, the code appends both options and takes the max. However, when only one option is available, options has one element, and max is taken. But what if neither option is available? Well, that's only possible when h ==n and m ==n, which is the base case.\n\nBut for the code, the base case is handled.\n\nBut for the case when h + m is 2n, but h and m are not both n? That can't happen. Because h + m can be up to 2n. For example, when h =n and m =n, then h + m = 2n. So the base case is correct.\n\nBut during the DP, for each state (h, m), the code checks if h <n or m <n.\n\nBut in the code above, for the options list, when h <n, it appends the option for H, and when m <n, appends the option for M. Then, returns the max of options.\n\nBut what if both are possible? Then, the code chooses the maximum between the two.\n\nBut this code is not correct. Because when both options are possible, the code returns the maximum between the two. But during the backtracking, how do we know which option was chosen?\n\nBut for the purpose of the DP, the code correctly computes the maximum sum. However, the problem is that when multiple options give the same maximum sum, the code would pick one (the first one, but in reality, the code returns the max of the list, which is the same in that case). However, the problem allows any of the possible sequences that achieve the maximum sum.\n\nBut the code for the DP function is correct in terms of calculating the maximum sum.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, the backtracking can proceed.\n\nNow, the code for backtracking.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, we can start from h=0, m=0, and for each step, decide whether to take H or M.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For each state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m]. We can check both options (H and M) and see which one gives the value that equals the dp(h, m) value.\n\nFor example:\n\ncurrent_dp_value = dp(h, m)\n\ncurrent_digit = int(A[h + m])\n\nif h < n and m < n:\n\n    option_H = current_digit * power[n - h - 1] + dp(h + 1, m)\n\n    option_M = current_digit * power[n - m - 1] + dp(h, m + 1)\n\n    if option_H == current_dp_value:\n\n        choose H\n\n    else:\n\n        choose M\n\nelif h < n:\n\n    choose H\n\nelse:\n\n    choose M\n\nBut how to compute option_H and option_M? Because during backtracking, the dp function has already been computed for all states.\n\nSo, during backtracking, for each (h, m), we can compute these options and compare.\n\nSo, the code for backtracking:\n\nh, m = 0, 0\n\nresult = []\n\nwhile h + m < 2 * n:\n\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n\n    if h < n and m < n:\n\n        option_h = int(current_digit) * power[n - h - 1] + dp(h + 1, m)\n\n        option_m = int(current_digit) * power[n - m - 1] + dp(h, m + 1)\n\n        if option_h == dp(h, m):\n\n            result.append('H')\n\n            h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            result.append('M')\n\n            m += 1\n\n    elif h < n:\n\n        result.append('H')\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        result.append('M')\n\n        m += 1\n\nOnce this loop is done, the result list is the sequence of moves.\n\nBut wait, the code for the dp function may have some issues. Let's take the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\npower is [1, 10], since n=2. The exponents for Homer's contribution are (n - h -1) = 2 - h -1 = 1 - h.\n\nWait, when h is 0, it's 1 - 0 = 1. So 10^1 = 10. For h=1, it's 1-1=0 → 10^0=1.\n\nSo, for the first step, h=0, m=0. current_digit is 1.\n\noption_h is 1 * 10^1 + dp(1, 0).\n\noption_m is 1 * 10^1 (since for m=0, n - m -1 = 2 - 0 -1 = 1) + dp(0, 1).\n\nBut what's the value of dp(1, 0) and dp(0, 1)?\n\nThis requires working through the DP steps, but perhaps the code would correctly compute it.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in the code for the DP function. Because, for example, when Marge takes the digit, the contribution is current_digit multiplied by 10^{n - m - 1} ?\n\nYes, because Marge's number is being built. When she takes a digit, it's the (m+1)th digit of her number, so the contribution is digit * 10^{n - (m+1)} ?\n\nWait, no. For Marge's number, the same logic applies. She has m digits so far, and takes another. So the new digit is the (m+1)th digit of her number. The value of this digit is multiplied by 10^{n - (m + 1)}.\n\nYes, which is 10^{n - m - 1}.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\nThe correct output is 'HHMM' which gives Homer 12 and Marge 34, total 46.\n\nAnother possible output is 'HMHM' which gives Homer 13 and Marge 24 → total 37, which is worse. Wait, but the sample output shows that the first option is better. Wait, the sample input says the output is ['HHMM', 'HMHM']? Wait, the example input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\nOutput:\n\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nWait, perhaps the first sample input is 2 and 1234, and the output is HHMM. Let's see:\n\nFor HHMM, the sequence is:\n\nH takes 1, then H takes 2, then M takes 3, then M takes 4.\n\nHomer's number is 12, Marge's is 34. Sum is 12 + 34 = 46.\n\nAnother option, HMHM: H takes 1, M takes 2, H takes 3, M takes 4. Homer's number is 13, Marge's is 24. Sum is 13 + 24 = 37. Which is less than 46. So the first option is better.\n\nSo the code should select HHMM.\n\nNow, let's see how the DP would compute this.\n\nLet's compute the dp(0, 0) value.\n\nAt (0, 0), current digit is 1.\n\nOption H: 1 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 1 * 10^1 = 10. Then, add dp(1, 0).\n\nOption M: 1 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 10. Then, add dp(0, 1).\n\nSo, the code would compare dp(1, 0) and dp(0, 1).\n\nLet's compute dp(1, 0):\n\nAt (1, 0), h=1, m=0. current digit is A[1+0] = A[1] = 2.\n\nh < n (1 < 2), m < n (0 < 2).\n\nOption H: current_digit is 2, contribution is 2 * power[2 - 1 -1] = 2 * 10^0 = 2. Then, add dp(2, 0). dp(2, 0) is when h=2 (n=2), m=0. Now, since h is already n, only M can take.\n\nAt dp(2, 0): current digit is A[2 + 0] = A[2] = 3.\n\nOnly M can take. So contribution is 3 * power[2 - 0 -1] = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then, add dp(2, 1).\n\ndp(2, 1): current digit is A[2+1] = A[3] = 4. Now, m is 1 < 2. So M takes. Contribution is 4 * 10^(2 -1 -1) = 4 * 10^0 = 4. Then add dp(2, 2) which is 0. So total is 4. So dp(2, 1) = 4. So dp(2, 0) is 30 + 4 = 34.\n\nSo, for dp(1, 0), option H gives 2 + 34 = 36.\n\nOption M: current_digit is 2. contribution is 2 * power[2 - 0 -1] = 2 * 10^1 = 20. Then, add dp(1, 1).\n\nLet's compute dp(1, 1). At this state, h=1, m=1. current digit is A[2] = 3.\n\nh < 2 and m < 2. Both options possible.\n\nOption H: 3 * power[2 -1 -1] = 3 * 10^0 = 3. Then add dp(2, 1) = 4. Total 3 +4=7.\n\nOption M: 3 * power[2 -1 -1] = 3*1=3. Then add dp(1, 2). dp(1, 2) is when h=1, m=2 (since n=2, m is 2, which is equal to n. So, only H can take.\n\ndp(1, 2) has current digit A[1+2] = A[3] =4. Only H can take. contribution is 4 * power[2 -1 -1] = 4 * 1 =4. Then add dp(2, 2) = 0. So total is 4. So option M for dp(1, 1) is 3 +4=7. So both options for dp(1,1) give 7. So dp(1,1) =7.\n\nSo, for option M in dp(1, 0), the value is 20 +7 = 27. So comparing option H (36) and option M (27), the maximum is 36. So dp(1,0) =36.\n\nNow, back to dp(0, 0) option H is 10 + 36 = 46.\n\nNow, let's compute option M for dp(0, 0). It's 1 * 10^1 =10, plus dp(0, 1).\n\nSo, let's compute dp(0, 1). At (0, 1), current digit is A[0 +1] = A[1] = 2.\n\nh=0 <2, m=1 <2.\n\nOption H: contribution 2 * power[2-0-1] = 2 * 10^1 =20. Then add dp(1, 1) which is 7. Total 20+7=27.\n\nOption M: contribution 2 * power[2 -1 -1] = 2 * 10^0 =2. Then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a number A, with each player making exactly n moves, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers formed by the digits they take.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach to determine the maximum possible total prize money from each state (h, m), where h is the number of digits Homer has taken and m is the number of digits Marge has taken.\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: Since the value contribution of each digit depends on its position in the final number, we precompute powers of 10 up to the maximum required exponent.\n3. **Backtracking to Determine Moves**: After computing the DP table, we backtrack from the initial state (0, 0) to determine the sequence of moves that leads to the maximum total prize.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    power = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return 0\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[current_pos])\n        options = []\n        if h < n:\n            contribution = current_digit * power[n - h - 1]\n            next_val = dp(h + 1, m)\n            options.append(contribution + next_val)\n        if m < n:\n            contribution = current_digit * power[n - m - 1]\n            next_val = dp(h, m + 1)\n            options.append(contribution + next_val)\n        return max(options)\n    \n    # Backtracking to find the path\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    result = []\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[current_pos])\n        if h < n and m < n:\n            option_h = current_digit * power[n - h - 1] + dp(h + 1, m)\n            option_m = current_digit * power[n - m - 1] + dp(h, m + 1)\n            if option_h == dp(h, m):\n                result.append('H')\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                result.append('M')\n                m += 1\n        elif h < n:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of length `2n`.\n2. **Power Calculation**: We precompute powers of 10 up to `n-1` to efficiently calculate the contribution of each digit based on its position in the final number.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function uses memoization to store results of subproblems. It calculates the maximum total prize from each state (h, m) by considering both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit).\n4. **Backtracking**: After computing the DP table, we backtrack from the initial state (0, 0) to determine the optimal sequence of moves. At each step, we check which move (Homer or Marge) leads to the maximum total prize as computed by the DP function.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal sequence using dynamic programming and backtracking, ensuring both correctness and performance for the given constraints.",
