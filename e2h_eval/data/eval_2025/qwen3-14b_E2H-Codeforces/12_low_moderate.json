The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem is about calculating the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The movement between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. The goal is to find the total minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation is that she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Task 1 is at 3. Starting from 1, moving clockwise. So from 1 to 3: that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Time taken is 2. Then she completes task 1.\n- Then task 2 is at 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2, since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, she would have to go from 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. So total time now is 2 + 3 = 5. Then completes task 2.\n- Then task 3 is at 3 again. She's at 2. Moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total time 5 + 1 = 6. So total is 6.\n\nBut why isn't there a shorter path? Well, because the movement is only allowed clockwise. So, when moving from one house to another, the time is the minimal steps in the clockwise direction.\n\nSo the key here is to compute for each task, the time taken to move from the previous position to the current task's house, considering the clockwise direction.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that Xenia starts at position 1. For each task in order, we need to calculate the distance from her current position to the next task's position, moving clockwise. Then add that distance to the total time, and update her current position.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two positions in a circular arrangement?\n\nSuppose current position is pos, and next task is at a_i. The distance is (a_i - pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because if pos is 3 and a_i is 2, then moving clockwise, the distance is (n - pos + a_i) ? Let me think.\n\nFor example, n=4. pos=3, target is 2. The clockwise path is 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Let's see: (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. So yes. So the formula for the distance between pos and target is (target - pos) if target >= pos, else (target - pos + n). Which can be written as (target - pos + n) % n. But wait, if target is greater than pos, then (target - pos) is positive. If target is less than pos, then adding n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nYes. So the formula is (target - pos) if target >= pos else (target - pos + n). Which can be simplified as (target - pos + n) % n. But since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\nSo for each task, we need to compute the distance from the current position to the target, add that to the total time, and then update the current position to the target.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in order. So for the first task, Xenia is at position 1. Then, for each subsequent task, she's at the position of the previous task. So the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n   compute distance from current_pos to a_i, clockwise.\n\n   add that distance to total_time.\n\n   set current_pos = a_i.\n\nBut wait, the example given:\n\nFirst example:\n\ntasks are [3,2,3].\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. distance is (3-1) = 2. total_time += 2 → 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. distance is (2 -3 +4) = 3. total_time becomes 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. distance is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad where houses are arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current position to the target house in a clockwise direction.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses on a circular road can be calculated using the formula `(target - current + n) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses. This ensures that the movement is always considered in the clockwise direction.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the time taken for each move between consecutive tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    current_pos = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for target in a:\n        if target >= current_pos:\n            distance = target - current_pos\n        else:\n            distance = (target - current_pos + n)\n        total_time += distance\n        current_pos = target\n    \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to zero.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the target house using the formula that accounts for the circular nature of the road.\n- **Update Position and Time**: After computing the distance for each task, update the total time and the current position to the target house.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by considering the circular movement constraints and processing each task in sequence. The complexity of this solution is O(m), which is optimal given the problem constraints.",
