The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise. How many steps? Well, since it's a ringroad, the distance between current position and target can be calculated as (target - current) mod n, but since movement is only clockwise, maybe it's (target - current) if target >= current, else (n - current + target). Wait, but for example, from 1 to 3 in a 4-house ringroad: 1→2→3 is two steps. Which is (3-1) = 2 steps. But if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - current + target) steps. For example, from 3 to 2: 3→4→1→2 is 3 steps. But wait, the ringroad is clockwise, so moving from 3 to 2 would require going around the circle. So the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Wait, no. Let me think again. If current is at position x and target is at position y, then moving clockwise, the number of steps is (y - x) mod n if you can't go backward. Wait, no. Because if x is 3 and y is 2 in a 4-house setup, then moving clockwise would require (2 - 3 + 4) = 3 steps. Which is correct. So the formula is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + n). Alternatively, (y - x + n) % n. Because if y is larger than x, then adding n and mod n would give the same as y -x. But if y is smaller, then (y -x +n) mod n gives the correct steps. So for example, 2-3 +4 = 3, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the distance from the previous position to the current target, and sum all those distances.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in order. So Xenia must do task 1 first, then task 2, then task 3, etc. So the order of the tasks is fixed. So the problem reduces to processing the list of a_i's in order, and computing the total movement time between consecutive positions, starting from position 1.\n\nSo the initial position is 1. Then, for each task in the list, we calculate the distance from the previous position to the current a_i, add that to the total, and update the previous position to a_i.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple tasks in the same house? Like, if the list is [3,3,3], then the first time we move from 1 to 3 (distance 2 steps). Then the next task is already at 3, so no movement. Then again no movement. So total steps is 2.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each a_i in the list:\n\n    calculate the distance between current position and a_i, add to total_time\n\n    set current position to a_i\n\nSo the problem becomes straightforward once we can compute the distance between consecutive positions.\n\nNow, how to compute the distance between current and next?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the distance is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Or equivalently, (next - current) % n if the modulo is handled properly. Wait, let's see:\n\nFor example, current is 3, next is 2, n=4. (2-3) is -1. mod ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 as given.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house. This movement is done clockwise, so the distance between two houses can be calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: Process each task in sequence, updating the total time and current position after each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    if target >= current:\n        total_time += target - current\n    else:\n        total_time += (target - current + n)\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start at house 1, and initialize `total_time` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative time taken.\n2. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each target house in the list of tasks:\n   - Calculate the distance from the current house to the target house. If the target house is ahead in the clockwise direction (i.e., `target >= current`), the distance is simply `target - current`.\n   - If the target house is behind (i.e., `target < current`), the distance is adjusted by wrapping around the circle, which is computed as `target - current + n`.\n3. **Update Position**: After calculating the distance for each task, update the current position to the target house and add the calculated distance to `total_time`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
