    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells in, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but for each ring, how do we compute the number of cells?\n\nLet me think. For a single ring, say the first one. The border of a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of cells. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border would be 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns have (H-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). Alternatively, maybe it's 2*(W + H) - 4, since each corner is counted twice. Let me check with example.\n\nTake a 3x3 rectangle. The border is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4? Wait 3*2 + 3*2 would be 12, minus 4 gives 8. Which matches the first example input where output is 8. So yes, that formula works. So for a rectangle of size W x H, the number of cells in the border is 2*(W + H) - 4. Or equivalently 2*(W + H - 2). Because 2*(W + H) -4 = 2(W + H - 2).\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we need to compute this value for the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1))? Let me check the example.\n\nTake the third example input: 7 9 2. The output is 40. Let's see:\n\nFirst ring: i=1. The rectangle is 7x9. The border is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Then second ring (i=2): the rectangle is 7-4*(1) = 3, and 9-4*(1) =5. So 3x5. The border is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12? Wait 2*(3+5) is 16, minus 4 is 12. Then total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the example. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, what if the rectangle becomes too small? Like, for example, if the i-th ring would require that the width or height is less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3 + 1)/4 ) is 1. So k can't be more than that. So for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions for the rectangle would be at least 3 - 4*(i-1). Wait for i=1, it's 3, and for i=2, it's 3 -4*(1) = -1? No, but the input constraints ensure that k is such that for all rings up to k, the dimensions are valid. So perhaps the input ensures that for each i in 1..k, the width and height after subtracting 4*(i-1) are at least 3? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) × (h - 4(i-1)). So for that rectangle to exist, the width and height must be at least 1. But since the input constraints for k are given as 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ), perhaps that ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are at least 3? Let me think.\n\nWait, let's take min(w, h) as m. Then the maximum possible k is floor( (m + 1)/4 ). Let's see for m=3: floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k=1. Then for i=1, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) = w - 0 = w, which is 3. Similarly for h. So the rectangle is 3x something. So for the first ring, it's okay. For k=2, the maximum allowed would be when m is such that (m+1)/4 is >=2. For example, m=7: (7+1)/4 = 2, so floor is 2. Then for i=2, 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. So the rectangle is 3x... So that's okay. So the input ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are at least 3? Or maybe even more. So the code can safely compute each ring's perimeter.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nadd to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, but why is the perimeter calculated as 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)? Because the formula for the perimeter of the rectangle's border is 2*(w + h) - 4, which is same as 2*(w + h - 2). Yes.\n\nSo for each ring, compute that and sum.\n\nSo let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the second output.\n\nThird example input: 7 9 2. First ring is 28, second ring: current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then first ring: 5x5. perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Second ring: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So current_w=1, current_h=1. Then perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 2*0=0? Wait, but that's a problem. But according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For w=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the input would not allow that. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k. Then loop for each i from 1 to k, compute current_w and current_h, compute perimeter, add to sum.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k.\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    sum += perimeter\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, but let me check for another example. Let's say w=7, h=7, k=2. Then:\n\nFirst ring: 7x7. perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Total 24+8=32. Let's see if that's correct. The first ring is the outer border, which is 7x7. The second ring is the border of 3x3, which is 8 cells. So total 24+8=32. Yes.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=1. The perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be the outer border of 5x5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the input constraints: the input is three integers. The third one is k, which is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. So the code can process all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line. For example, the input could be given as a single line, like '3 3 1' etc. So in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the sum as described.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input, compute the sum.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nLet me check for another case. Suppose w=5, h=5, k=1. Output is 16. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: w=5, h=5, k=1. What if k is 1. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: Let's take w=7, h=7, k=2. As discussed earlier, output is 24+8=32. Let's see:\n\ncurrent_w for i=1 is 7, current_h 7. perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 24.\n\ni=2: current_w =7-4=3, current_h=7-4=3. perimeter 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Sum is 32. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
