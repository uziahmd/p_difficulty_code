    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me try to understand the problem.\n\nThe plate is divided into w rows and h columns. The gilded rings are added starting from the edge. The first ring is the outermost layer, then each subsequent ring is 2 cells inward. Each ring is one cell thick. The i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle is 4 less in both dimensions. Like, for the first ring, the original rectangle is w x h. The next ring would be (w-4) x (h-4), but only if that's possible. So for each ring, we need to compute the perimeter of that rectangle, but subtracting the overlapping parts?\n\nWait, the problem says that each ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. So for example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. Then the second ring is the perimeter of the rectangle that's 2 cells in from each edge. But how do we compute the number of cells in each ring?\n\nLet me think. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in its perimeter (the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter is the total cells on the edges. For example, a 3x3 rectangle has a perimeter of 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. For a rectangle, the perimeter in terms of cells would be: top row (W cells), bottom row (W cells), left column (H-2 cells, since top and bottom are already counted), right column (H-2 cells). So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Or maybe another way: the perimeter is 2*(width + height) - 4, since each corner is counted twice. For example, 3x3: 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which matches the first example input. The first example input is 3 3 1, output is 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), but only if that rectangle is valid. However, the problem says that k is given such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for each i from 1 to k, the rectangle for the i-th ring must have dimensions that are at least 3x3? Or maybe not, but the problem ensures that k is valid.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the examples.\n\nTake the third example input: 7 9 2. Output is 40.\n\nFirst ring: the rectangle is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 - 2) = 2*14 = 28? Wait 2*(7+9-2) is 2*(14) = 28? Wait 7+9 is 16, minus 2 is 14, multiplied by 2 is 28. Yes. Then the second ring is for the rectangle of size (7 - 4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and (9 - 4*(2-1)) = 9-4=5. So 3x5. The perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the sample. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input is 3 3 1. The perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 7 9 1. Output is 28. Which is the perimeter of 7x9. Which is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for each ring is 2*(width + height - 2), where width and height are the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each ring from 1 to k:\n\n   - compute current width: w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute current height: h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute perimeter: 2*(w_i + h_i - 2)\n\n   - add to total.\n\nBut wait, what if the current width or height becomes less than 3? Well, according to the problem statement, the input k is such that it's allowed. Because the constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 = 1, floor is 1. So k can be 1. For that case, the first ring is 3x3, which is valid. For the next ring, i=2, the dimensions would be 3-4*(2-1) = 3-4 = -1, but since k is constrained, this case is not allowed. So the input will ensure that for all i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to worry about negative numbers here.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor i in 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, but let me check for another example. Suppose w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be the outer ring. But if k=2, then for i=2, current_w = 5 -4*(1) = 1, current_h same. Which would be 1x1, but that's invalid. But according to the constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). For w=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code can proceed as described.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k.\n\nThen compute sum for each i from 1 to k of 2*( (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 )\n\nSimplify the expression inside:\n\ncurrent_w + current_h - 2 = (w + h - 8*(i-1) ) - 2 ?\n\nWait, current_w is w -4*(i-1), current_h is h -4*(i-1). So adding them gives (w + h) - 8*(i-1). Then subtract 2: (w + h - 8*(i-1) ) - 2 = w + h - 2 - 8*(i-1). Then multiply by 2.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute each term step by step.\n\nSo in code:\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nreturn total\n\nYes. So that's straightforward.\n\nNow let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h =3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 7 9 1. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 7 9 2. First ring is 7,9 → 28. Second ring: i=2, current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h =9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: let's take w=5, h=5, k=1. The perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct. For a 5x5 square, the outer ring has 16 cells.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=1. What if k=1? The answer is 16.\n\nAnother example: if w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nYes. So code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead input: the input is a single line with three integers. So, for example, in the sample input, the first line is '3 3 1'.\n\nIn Python, read the input line, split into three integers.\n\nThen compute the sum as explained.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for when i starts from 1 to k. For example, for i=1, the 4*(i-1) is zero. So yes.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → output 28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1 → output 16. Correct.\n\nAnother case: w=5, h=5, k=2? Well, according to the constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). min(w,h) is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate with specified dimensions and a given number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it is 1 cell thick and starts from the edge of the plate, moving inward by 2 cells for each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each gilded ring forms a border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells inward from the first, and so on. The number of cells in each ring can be calculated using the perimeter formula for a rectangle.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For a rectangle of width `w` and height `h`, the number of cells in its perimeter (border) is given by `2 * (w + h - 2)`. This formula accounts for the top and bottom rows (each of length `w`) and the left and right columns (each of length `h-2` to avoid double-counting the corners).\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle and use the perimeter formula to find the number of cells in that ring. Sum these values for all rings up to `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` which represent the width, height, and number of rings respectively.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the adjusted width and height of the inner rectangle by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both dimensions. This adjustment accounts for the inward movement of each subsequent ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: Using the adjusted dimensions, compute the perimeter of the inner rectangle using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by leveraging the perimeter formula for rectangles and iterating through each ring's dimensions, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
