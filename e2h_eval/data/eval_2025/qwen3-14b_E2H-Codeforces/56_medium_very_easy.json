Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. Hmm. So, the key here is to find a way to pair each spaceship with a base, and ensure that all those line segments don't cross each other.\n\nFirst, since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible perfect matchings. Because for R=B=10, the number of permutations is 10! which is around 3.6 million. That's manageable for a brute-force approach, right? Especially since 10 is small.\n\nSo the plan is: generate all possible perfect matchings (permutations of the bases for the spaceships), and for each permutation, check if any two line segments cross. If there's at least one permutation where none of the segments cross, output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nBut how do I check if two line segments intersect?\n\nWait, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So that simplifies things a bit. Because when checking if two segments cross, we don't have to worry about overlapping lines or colinear points. So for two segments AB and CD, they either cross each other or not. And since no three points are colinear, the only way they can intersect is if they cross each other in the interior.\n\nSo, how to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nI remember there's a computational geometry method. Let me think. For two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2), first check if they intersect using orientation-based methods. The steps are:\n\n1. Check if the orientations of (p1, q1, p2) and (p1, q1, q2) are different. Also check the same for (p2, q2, p1) and (p2, q2, q1). If both pairs have different orientations, then they intersect.\n\nBut wait, this is the standard method for checking if two line segments intersect. However, since the problem states that no three points are colinear, we don't have to handle the case where the points are colinear. So, the check can be done by checking if the orientations are different for both segments.\n\nSo, first, I need a function to compute the orientation of three points. The orientation is determined by the cross product. For three points p, q, r:\n\norientation = (qy - py) * (rx - qx) - (qx - px) * (ry - qy)\n\nWait, more accurately, the cross product of vectors pq and pr. Or perhaps the cross product of vectors (q-p) and (r-p). The sign of this cross product tells us the orientation.\n\nThe formula for orientation(p, q, r) is:\n\nval = (qy - py) * (rx - qx) - (qx - px) * (ry - qy)\n\nIf val is 0, colinear. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, this case won't happen. So for our problem, we can ignore that case.\n\nSo, the orientation function returns positive, negative, or zero. But since no three points are colinear, the zero case won't happen here.\n\nSo, for two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2), they intersect if:\n\norientation(p1, q1, p2) != orientation(p1, q1, q2) AND orientation(p2, q2, p1) != orientation(p2, q2, q1).\n\nSo, that's the condition.\n\nTherefore, for each permutation of the bases (i.e., each possible assignment of spaceships to bases), we need to check all pairs of segments to see if any two cross.\n\nIf for any permutation, all pairs of segments are non-crossing, then output Yes.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead R and B. Then read R points for spaceships, then B points for bases.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as first line R and B, then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nThen the next 3 lines are bases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the code needs to read R and B, then read R points as spaceships, then B points as bases.\n\nBut the problem says that R and B are equal? Wait, the problem says that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. So R must equal B. Wait, the input constraints say 1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10. But the problem says that it's possible to assign R spaceships to B bases. So for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible. So, the first thing the code can check is whether R != B. If so, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input may have R and B not equal? Like, for example, in the second example given, the input is 2 1. So R=2, B=1. Then, the answer is No because you can't have a perfect matching. So, the first check is: if R != B, output No. Otherwise, proceed to check for possible matchings.\n\nSo in code, first check if R != B. If yes, output No. Else, proceed.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if R and B are equal. If not, output No.\n\nElse, generate all possible permutations of the bases, assigning each spaceship to a base. For each permutation, check if all the line segments between the spaceship and their assigned base do not cross each other.\n\nBut how to generate the permutations? Since each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships. For example, if there are R spaceships, and B=R bases, then each permutation of the bases corresponds to a possible assignment. For example, for the first spaceship, assign the first base in the permutation, the second spaceship the second base, etc.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the B bases (since B=R), we can check all pairs of line segments.\n\nNow, the code structure would be:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nif R != B: print No.\n\nelse:\n\n   read R spaceship coordinates.\n\n   read B base coordinates.\n\n   generate all permutations of the B bases.\n\n   for each permutation:\n\n      check all pairs of line segments (from spaceship i to base permutation[i]) for intersection.\n\n      if no intersections, return Yes.\n\n   if none of the permutations work, return No.\n\nSo, the key functions needed are:\n\n- A function to check if two line segments intersect.\n\n- Generating permutations of the bases.\n\nNow, in Python, itertools.permutations can generate all permutations of the bases.\n\nNow, for the check between segments:\n\nFor each pair of line segments (i, j) where i < j, check if they intersect.\n\nIf any pair does, then this permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for a given permutation, for all 0 <= i < j < R, check if the segment between spaceship i and base permutation[i] intersects with the segment between spaceship j and base permutation[j].\n\nIf any such pair exists, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, the code for checking a permutation is:\n\ndef is_valid(perm, spaceships, bases):\n\n    for i in range(len(spaceships)):\n\n        for j in range(i+1, len(spaceships)):\n\n            seg1 = (spaceships[i], bases[perm[i]])\n\n            seg2 = (spaceships[j], bases[perm[j]])\n\n            if do_segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1]):\n\n                return False\n\n    return True\n\nBut how to implement do_segments_intersect?\n\nImplement the orientation-based check.\n\nLet me code that.\n\nFirst, the orientation function:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n\n    # p, q, r are tuples (x, y)\n\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n\n    if val == 0:\n\n        return 0  # colinear, but problem says no three points are colinear, so this should not happen\n\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\nThen, the function to check if two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case: if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4\n\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases (endpoints on the other segment)\n\n    # But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so the endpoints can't lie on the other segment.\n\n    # Wait, because if p2 is on the line segment p1q1, then orientation(p1, q1, p2) would be zero, but the problem says no three points are colinear, so that's not possible. Hence, no need to handle the special cases.\n\n    # Therefore, the only case is the general case.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but what if one of the segments is entirely contained within the other? But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, that can't happen. Because for example, if p2 is on the line segment p1q1, then p1, p2, q1 are colinear. Which is not allowed.\n\nSo, the problem says that no three points are colinear. Therefore, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other, and the above condition holds.\n\nSo, the segments_intersect function can be implemented as checking whether o1 != o2 and o3 != o4.\n\nTherefore, in the code, for each pair of segments, check this condition.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut in Python, for the permutations, we need to generate all possible permutations of the bases. For example, if the bases are stored as a list, then permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut note that the bases are read as a list. For example, in the first sample input, the bases are:\n\n[-2, 1], [0,3], [2,2]\n\nSo, each permutation is a reordering of these points.\n\nNow, for each permutation, we check all pairs of line segments.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n\n(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\nBases:\n\n(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\nIn the first sample, the answer is Yes. For example, connecting each spaceship to the base in order.\n\nSo, the segments would be:\n\n(0,0)-(-2,1)\n\n(2,0)-(0,3)\n\n(3,1)-(2,2)\n\nDo these segments cross each other?\n\nCheck between first and second: do they cross?\n\nLet me compute their orientations.\n\nFor segment 1: (0,0) to (-2,1). Let's check the orientation of the points of segment 2.\n\nSegment 2 is (2,0) to (0,3). So, for the first segment, check orientation between (0,0), (-2,1), (2,0) and (0,0), (-2,1), (0,3).\n\nWait, the first segment is p1=(0,0), q1=(-2,1). The second segment is p2=(2,0), q2=(0,3).\n\nSo, o1 is orientation(p1, q1, p2) = orientation((0,0), (-2,1), (2,0)).\n\nCalculating:\n\n(q1y - p1y) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n(r.x - q1.x) = 2 - (-2) = 4.\n\n(q1x - p1x) = -2 - 0 = -2.\n\n(r.y - q1.y) = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nval = 1 * 4 - (-2) * (-1) = 4 - 2 = 2. So positive. So o1 is 1.\n\no2 is orientation(p1, q1, q2) = orientation((0,0), (-2,1), (0,3)).\n\n(q1y - p1y) is 1-0=1.\n\n(r.x - q1.x) is 0 - (-2) = 2.\n\n(q1x - p1x) is -2 - 0 = -2.\n\n(r.y - q1.y) is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nval = 1 * 2 - (-2)*2 = 2 +4 =6>0. So o2 is 1. So o1 and o2 are same. So the first condition is not satisfied. So the segments do not cross. So the first and second segments don't cross.\n\nSimilarly, check between first and third segments.\n\nBut perhaps in this case, the example's permutation is valid.\n\nSo the code would check all pairs, and if none cross, return yes.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all permutations of the bases, and for each, check all pairs of segments.\n\nNow, considering that for R=10, the permutations are 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking (R choose 2) pairs. For R=10, that's 45 pairs per permutation. So total operations are 3.6 million * 45 = around 163 million operations. That's acceptable for Python? Well, perhaps for the given constraints (R up to 10), but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nBut given that R and B are up to 10, and the code is for a programming competition problem, this approach should be acceptable.\n\nNow, coding steps.\n\nImplement the orientation function.\n\nImplement the segments_intersect function.\n\nRead the input.\n\nCheck if R != B. If so, output No.\n\nElse, generate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation, check if all pairs of segments in the permutation are non-intersecting.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, for the permutations, the bases are stored as a list. So, for example, bases is a list of tuples.\n\nBut note that the problem says that the input for the bases is given as B lines. So, for example, for the first sample input, after the spaceships, the next B lines are the base positions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nif R != B: print 'No' and exit.\n\nElse:\n\nread R lines for spaceships: spaceships = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(R)]\n\nread B lines for bases: bases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(B)]\n\nThen generate all permutations of the bases.\n\nBut in Python, itertools.permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings.\n\nThen, for each perm in permutations(bases):\n\n   check for all i < j if segments between spaceship i and perm[i], and spaceship j and perm[j] intersect.\n\nIf any such pair exists, skip this permutation. Else, return 'Yes'.\n\nSo, code.\n\nBut in Python, the permutations function returns tuples of the elements. Since the bases are stored as a list of tuples, each permutation is a tuple of tuples.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for the permutation, the perm is a list (or tuple) of the bases in some order. For the i-th spaceship, the assigned base is perm[i].\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nBut for the code to be efficient, perhaps precompute all the permutations and check them.\n\nBut for R=10, the permutations are manageable.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut also note that for the case where R=0? Well, the constraints say R and B are at least 1. So no.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # Returns 1 if clockwise, -1 if counter-clockwise, 0 if colinear\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n    # General case\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    # Generate all permutations of bases\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        # Check all pairs of segments\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # Get the two segments\n                p1 = spaceships[i]\n                q1 = perm[i]\n                p2 = spaceships[j]\n                q2 = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, the permutation is generated as permutations of the bases. But the bases are stored as a list of tuples. However, when generating permutations, if there are duplicate points, but the problem says that no two points coincide. So the problem says that all points are unique. So, the permutations are unique.\n\nBut in the code, for example, if the bases are in the same positions as the spaceships, but the code is okay.\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nLet's test against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo the spaceships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)], bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nOne permutation is the same order. Let's check for all pairs:\n\ni=0, j=1: segments (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3). Do they intersect?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the orientations would be o1 and o2 same, so returns false. So no intersection.\n\ni=0, j=2: segment (0,0)-(-2,1) and (3,1)-(2,2). Let's see.\n\nCheck if they cross.\n\np1 = (0,0), q1 = (-2,1). p2 = (3,1), q2 = (2,2).\n\nCompute o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) = orientation( (0,0), (-2,1), (3,1) )\n\nval = (1 - 0) * (3 - (-2)) - (-2 - 0) * (1 - 1) → 1*(5) - (-2)*(0) → 5. Positive.\n\no2 is orientation(p1, q1, q2): (0,0), (-2,1), (2,2).\n\nval = (1-0) * (2 - (-2)) - (-2 - 0) * (2-1) → 1*4 - (-2)*1 → 4 +2 =6 → positive. So o1 and o2 are same. So segments don't cross.\n\nThen, check for i=1 and j=2: segments (2,0)-(0,3) and (3,1)-(2,2).\n\nCheck if they cross.\n\np1 = (2,0), q1 = (0,3). p2 = (3,1), q2 = (2,2).\n\no1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) → orientation( (2,0), (0,3), (3,1) )\n\nval = (3-0) * (3-0) - (0-2) * (1-3) → 3*3 - (-2)*(-2) → 9 -4 =5 → positive.\n\no2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2) → (2,0), (0,3), (2,2). \n\nval = (3-0) * (2 - 0) - (0-2)*(2-3) → 3*2 - (-2)*(-1) → 6 - 2 =4 → positive. So o1 and o2 same. So no crossing.\n\nThus, this permutation is valid. So the code would return Yes.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. So since R != B, output is No. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Suppose the spaceships are (0,0), (2,2). Bases are (0,2), (2,0). So possible permutations are [(0,2), (2,0)] and [(2,0), (0,2)].\n\nIn the first permutation: connect (0,0) to (0,2), and (2,2) to (2,0). The two segments are vertical lines. They are parallel, so no intersection.\n\nIn the second permutation: connect (0,0) to (2,0) and (2,2) to (0,2). The segments are horizontal lines. No intersection. So output is Yes.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Spaceships (0,0), (2,2). Bases (1,1), (3,3). Then, any permutation would have two segments from (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,2) to (3,3). These are colinear, but since no three points are colinear. Wait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So in this case, the points (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) are colinear. But the problem says that no three points are on the same line. So this input is invalid. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to have no three points colinear. So the code can assume that.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, in the code, for the permutation, the segments are checked. But in this case, the code would generate permutations, but the problem says that such input is not possible.\n\nSo, the code is safe.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nBut in the code, the input is read as a list of lines. For example, in the first sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, but this is probably a mistake. Because the first line is the first input, but the way the input is given is perhaps in the code as multiple lines. But the code reads all lines from stdin.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given as follows. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is 3+3+1 = 7 lines. But the first sample input in the problem is written as a list of two elements. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the input. But the code is supposed to read from standard input.\n\nBut in the code, the input is read as all lines from stdin. So, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when R=1 and B=1? Then, there is only one possible permutation. The segment between the spaceship and base. No other segments. So it's valid. Output is Yes.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Spaceships (0,0), (1,1). Bases (0,1), (1,0). So the two possible permutations are:\n\nperm1: [(0,1), (1,0)].\n\nSegments: (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0). These are vertical lines, no intersection. So valid. Output Yes.\n\nAnother permutation is [(1,0), (0,1)]. Segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). Horizontal lines. No intersection. So output yes.\n\nSo code returns yes.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Spaceships (0,0), (2,2). Bases (1,0), (1,2). So the two possible permutations.\n\nIn permutation [ (1,0), (1,2) ]: segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,2)-(1,2). These are two lines that cross? Let's see.\n\nCheck if segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,2)-(1,2) intersect.\n\nFor the first segment p1=(0,0), q1=(1,0). Second segment p2=(2,2), q2=(1,2).\n\nCheck orientations:\n\no1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) → (0,0), (1,0), (2,2). val = (0 - 0) * (2 - 1) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) → 0 * 1 - 1 * 2 = -2 → -1.\n\no2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2) → (0,0), (1,0), (1,2). val = (0-0)*(1 - 1) - (1-0)*(2 - 0) → 0*0 -1*2 = -2 → -1. So o1 and o2 are same. So no intersection.\n\nSo the segments don't cross. So valid.\n\nAnother permutation: [(1,2), (1,0)]. Then the segments are (0,0)-(1,2) and (2,2)-(1,0). Do these cross?\n\nLet me check.\n\np1 = (0,0), q1 = (1,2). p2 = (2,2), q2 = (1,0).\n\nCheck orientations:\n\no1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) → (0,0), (1,2), (2,2). \n\nval = (2-0) * (2 - 1) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 2) → 2*1 - 1*0 = 2 → positive.\n\no2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2) → (0,0), (1,2), (1,0). \n\nval = (2 - 0) * (1 - 1) - (1 - 0) * (0 - 2) → 2*0 -1*(-2) = 2 → positive. So same. So no intersection.\n\nSo again, valid. So code returns yes.\n\nAnother case where two segments cross. For example, R=2, B=2. Spaceships (0,0), (2,2). Bases (1,1), (1,2). Now, the only possible permutations are:\n\nperm1: [(1,1), (1,2)] → segments (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(1,2). Do they cross?\n\nCheck:\n\np1 = (0,0), q1 = (1,1). p2 = (2,2), q2 = (1,2).\n\nCheck orientations:\n\no1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) → (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). All colinear. But the problem says no three points are colinear. So this input is invalid. So the code can assume that this case is not present.\n\nBut suppose that the input is valid. For example, spaceships (0,0), (2,2). Bases (1,1), (1,3). Now, the segments are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(1,3). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute:\n\no1: orientation(p1, q1, p2) → (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) → colinear? No, because (1,1) is on the line between (0,0) and (2,2). But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So this input is invalid. So the code can assume that the input doesn't have such cases.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nAnother example where the segments cross. Suppose R=2, B=2. Spaceships (0,0) and (3,3). Bases (1,2) and (2,1). Now, the segments (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1) cross.\n\nCheck if they cross.\n\np1 = (0,0), q1 = (1,2). p2 = (3,3), q2 = (2,1).\n\no1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) → (0,0), (1,2), (3,3). \n\nval = (2-0) * (3 - 1) - (1-0) * (3 - 2) → 2*2 - 1*1 = 4-1=3 → positive.\n\no2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2) → (0,0), (1,2), (2,1). \n\nval = (2-0) * (2 - 1) - (1-0) * (1 - 2) → 2*1 -1*(-1) = 2+1=3 → positive. So o1 and o2 same. So no cross.\n\nWait, but the segments might cross. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, the segments are (0,0) to (1,2) and (3,3) to (2,1). Let me draw them.\n\nThe first segment goes from (0,0) to (1,2). The second segment from (3,3) to (2,1). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute the equations of the lines.\n\nLine 1: y = 2x.\n\nLine 2: passing through (3,3) and (2,1). The slope is (1-3)/(2-3) = (-2)/(-1) = 2. So equation is y -3 = 2(x-3) → y = 2x -6 +3 → y = 2x -3.\n\nSo the lines are parallel? Because both have slope 2. So they don't cross. So the segments are on parallel lines. So no intersection. So code correctly returns no.\n\nHmm. So what's an example where two segments cross?\n\nLet me think. For example, spaceship1 (0,0), spaceship2 (3,3). Bases (1,1) and (2,2). But again, this is colinear. Not allowed.\n\nAnother example: spaceship1 (0,0), spaceship2 (3,3). Bases (1,2) and (2,1). So the segments are (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1). As before, which are on parallel lines.\n\nAnother example: spaceship1 (0,0), spaceship2 (2,2). Bases (1,1) (invalid, but suppose it's allowed). Then the segments are colinear, but the problem says no three points are colinear. So invalid.\n\nLet me think of two segments that cross. For example, spaceship1 (0,0), spaceship2 (2,2). Bases (1,3) and (3,1). So the segments are (0,0)-(1,3) and (2,2)-(3,1). Do they cross?\n\nCheck the orientations:\n\np1 = (0,0), q1 = (1,3). p2 = (2,2), q2 = (3,1).\n\no1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) → (0,0), (1,3), (2,2).\n\nval = (3-0) * (2 - 1) - (1-0) * (2 - 3) → 3*1 -1*(-1) = 3 +1 =4 → positive.\n\no2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2) → (0,0), (1,3), (3,1).\n\nval = (3-0) * (3 -1) - (1-0) * (1 -3) → 3*2 -1*(-2) =6 +2=8 → positive. So o1 and o2 same. So no cross.\n\nWait, but the lines may cross. Let me find the equations.\n\nLine 1: from (0,0) to (1,3). Slope is 3. Equation y=3x.\n\nLine 2: from (2,2) to (3,1). Slope is (1-2)/(3-2) = -1. Equation: y-2 = -1(x-2) → y = -x +4.\n\nFind intersection: 3x = -x +4 → 4x=4 → x=1. y=3. So the point (1,3) is on both lines. But this is the endpoint of the first segment and lies on the second line. But the problem says no three points are colinear. So the point (1,3) is a base, and the spaceship2 is (2,2), and the base (3,1). Are these three points colinear? Let's see: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) are colinear. So this input would violate the problem's condition. Hence, the code can assume that this situation does not occur.\n\nSo, the code is safe.\n\nAnother example where two segments cross. Let's take spaceship1 (0,0), spaceship2 (3,3). Bases (1,2) and (2,1). The segments are (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1). Earlier calculation shows that the lines are parallel, so no intersection.\n\nHmm. It's challenging to find a valid example where two segments cross. Let me think of another scenario.\n\nSpaceship1 (0,0), spaceship2 (3,0). Bases (1,1) and (2, -1). So the segments are (0,0)-(1,1) and (3,0)-(2,-1). Do they cross?\n\nCheck orientations:\n\np1 = (0,0), q1 = (1,1). p2 = (3,0), q2 = (2,-1).\n\no1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) → (0,0), (1,1), (3,0).\n\nval = (1-0) * (3-1) - (1-0)*(0-1) → 1*2 -1*(-1) = 2 +1 =3 → positive.\n\no2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2) → (0,0), (1,1), (2,-1).\n\nval = (1-0) * (2-1) - (1-0) * (-1-1) → 1*1 -1*(-2) = 1 +2 =3 → positive. Same, so no cross.\n\nBut visually, the lines are:\n\nLine 1: y=x.\n\nLine 2: from (3,0) to (2,-1). Slope is (-1-0)/(2-3) = -1/-1 = 1. So same slope. Parallel. So no cross.\n\nAnother example. Let's take spaceship1 (0,0), spaceship2 (2,2). Bases (1, 0) and (1, 2). So segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,2)-(1,2). These are horizontal lines, no cross.\n\nBut what if the bases are (1, 0) and (1, 3)? Then the segments are (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,2)-(1,3). Do they cross?\n\nCheck orientations",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting line segments intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the bases and verifying if any permutation results in non-intersecting segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Check**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If not, immediately return \"No\".\n2. **Permutations Generation**: Generate all possible permutations of the bases. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of spaceships to bases.\n3. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, check if any pair of line segments (connecting spaceships to their assigned bases) intersect. This is done using orientation checks to determine if two line segments cross each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input_lines[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[idx].split())\n        spaceships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                p1 = spaceships[i]\n                q1 = perm[i]\n                p2 = spaceships[j]\n                q2 = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Orientation Check**: The `orientation` function calculates the orientation of three points using the cross product. This helps determine if points are clockwise, counter-clockwise, or collinear.\n- **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses orientation checks to determine if two line segments intersect. If the orientations of the endpoints of one segment relative to the other segment differ, the segments intersect.\n- **Permutations and Validation**: By generating all permutations of the bases, we check each possible assignment of spaceships to bases. For each permutation, we ensure no two segments intersect by checking all pairs of segments.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments using permutations and ensures correctness by leveraging geometric properties to detect intersections.",
