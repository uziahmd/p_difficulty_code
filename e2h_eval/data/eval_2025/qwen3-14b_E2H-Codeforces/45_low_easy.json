There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the first game is between 1 and 2, then the second game is between 1 (who has 1 game) and 3 (who has 0). The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that works. \n\nBut for n=4, the sample output is 2. Why can't the winner play 3 games? Let's see. Suppose the winner plays three games. That would require them to have three matches. But each time, they have to face someone with a game count differing by at most one. Let's think. Let's say the winner plays three games. Let's think about how the tournament would be structured. \n\nIn a normal knockout tournament, the number of games required is n-1. But here, the structure is different. The problem isn't about the usual bracket but about arranging matches such that the winner can have as many games as possible. \n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum possible number of games the winner can play, given the constraints on the matches. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). How can we model this?\n\nFor the winner to play as many games as possible, each time they play a match, they need to have opponents who have played either the same number of games or one less. \n\nLet's consider that each time the winner plays a game, they must have an opponent. Let's imagine that the winner plays k games. Then, each of those games requires that the opponent has played either k-1, k-2, ... games? Or perhaps not. Let's think of the structure.\n\nWait, the winner's first game is against someone who has 0 games (since it's the first game). Then, after winning, the winner has 1 game. The next game must be against someone with 0 or 1 games. If the winner wants to maximize their games, perhaps they need to arrange that each time they play, their opponent has as many games as possible. \n\nWait, maybe this is similar to building a binary tree where each node represents a game. The winner's path through the tournament would be a path from the root to a leaf, but the structure depends on the constraints. \n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as finding the largest k such that the sum of the first k numbers (like Fibonacci sequence?) is less than or equal to n. Because for the winner to play k games, each time they have to have opponents that have played up to k-1 games. \n\nWait, let's think about how many players are needed for the winner to have k games. Let's think recursively. For the winner to play k games, they must have played against k opponents. Each of these opponents must have been in the tournament up to that point. \n\nBut each time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have a number of games that is either equal to the winner's current games minus one, or same. Let me think: when the winner plays their first game, they have 0 games, opponent also has 0. After that, the winner has 1 game. For the next game, the opponent can have 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, maybe the opponent should have 1 game. But how can that happen? Because that opponent would have had to play once before. \n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me think. Let's say that the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is f(k). Then, for the first game, you need 2 players. For the second game, the winner needs to have another opponent. But that opponent must have played 1 game (so that the difference is 1). How many players are required for that? Well, the opponent must have played once. So that requires that there's a subtree where that opponent has played once. So for the winner to have 2 games, the total players needed is 2 + 1 = 3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think recursively. To have the winner play k games, the first game is against someone. Then, for the second game, the winner must have an opponent who has played either 0 or 1 games. But to get that opponent, they must have played once. So that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the number of games each player has already played before facing each other.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because, for the winner to play `k` games, they must face opponents who have played either `k-1` or `k` games, which recursively requires a certain number of players. The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games can be derived using a Fibonacci-like approach. We iterate through possible values of `k` until the required number of players exceeds the given `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    # We need to find the maximum k such that fib(k+1) <= n\n    # Where fib(1)=1, fib(2)=2, fib(3)=3, fib(4)=5, etc.\n    # Let's compute the Fibonacci sequence until it exceeds n\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 1\n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci-like Sequence**: The problem can be approached by considering a sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games. This sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with different initial values.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from the smallest values, we iteratively compute the sequence terms until the term exceeds the given number of players `n`. The number of iterations gives us the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n3. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases directly, ensuring that the correct result is returned even for the smallest input values.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using an iterative method, ensuring it works within the constraints of very large values of `n` (up to $10^{18}$).",
