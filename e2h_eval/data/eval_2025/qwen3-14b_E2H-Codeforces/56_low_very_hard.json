Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between R rebel spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. And since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible permutations of assignments and see if any of them satisfies the non-intersecting condition.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The key point is that any two line segments (from a spaceship to a base) must not intersect. So for a given permutation (matching), we need to check all pairs of line segments and ensure none cross each other.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check if R equals B. Because a perfect matching requires that the number of spaceships and bases are equal. If they are not equal, then immediately output No. Wait, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", which implies that R must equal B. So first check if R != B, then output No.\n\nBut looking at the input examples, in the first case R and B are both 3. In the second example, R is 2 and B is 1. So the answer is No because you can't have a perfect matching. So yes, the first thing to check is whether R equals B. If not, output No.\n\nSo the first step is to check if R == B. If not, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, assuming R = B. Then, we need to check all possible perfect matchings (i.e., all possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases) and see if any of them has non-intersecting line segments.\n\nBut how many permutations are there? For R = B = 10, it's 10! = 3.6 million. Wait, 10! is 3,628,800. That's manageable for a brute-force approach, since for each permutation, checking all pairs of lines for intersections.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nSo the problem reduces to: For each possible permutation (matching), check if all pairs of line segments (from spaceship to base) are non-intersecting. If any permutation satisfies this, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Generate all possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases. Each permutation represents a possible matching.\n- For each permutation, generate all line segments (spaceship to base) and check if any two of them intersect.\n- If there's a permutation where no two segments intersect, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the line segment intersection check correctly.\n\nFirst, how to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect?\n\nI remember that there's a computational geometry method for this. The standard approach is to use the orientation method. The steps are:\n\nTwo segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n1. The orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different. (This is the case where the segments cross each other.)\n\nOR\n\n2. One of the endpoints of a segment lies on the other segment. For example, C lies on AB, or D lies on AB, etc. But since the problem states that no three points are colinear, this case can't happen. Because the problem says that no three points are on the same line. Wait, the note says that it's guaranteed that no two points coincide and no three are on the same line. So, in the input, all points are distinct and no three are colinear. Therefore, any two segments cannot have an endpoint lying on the other segment. Because if that were the case, then the endpoint (say, C) would lie on AB, making three points (A, B, C) colinear, which is not allowed. So that case is impossible. Therefore, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other in their interiors. Therefore, for our problem, the check can be simplified to checking if the two segments cross each other.\n\nSo, the code for checking if two segments AB and CD intersect can be done by checking if the orientations of (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) are different, and orientations of (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) are different.\n\nBut how to compute orientation?\n\nThe orientation of three points (p, q, r) can be determined by the cross product of vectors pq and pr. The formula is:\n\norientation = (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n\nIf the result is positive, the points are clockwise (right turn). If zero, colinear. If negative, counter-clockwise (",
