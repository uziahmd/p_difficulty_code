The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, right. For a rectangle of size width x height, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) can be calculated as 2*(width + height - 2). Because each side contributes (width) or (height) cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's perimeter would be 2*(3+3-2) = 8, which matches the first example input where the output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the previous. Wait, the first ring is the edge. The second is two cells in, which would mean that the dimensions for the second ring's rectangle would be (original width - 4*(2-1)) = w - 4*1, same for height. Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the dimensions decrease by 4 in each direction. Because for example, the first ring is the outermost, then the next is 2 cells inward. So for the next ring, the width and height are reduced by 2*2 = 4 each. So the formula given in the problem makes sense.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that for each i, the dimensions are valid. For example, if the original w and h are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1) from each, the resulting width and height must be at least 3? Or maybe not. Because for example, if the rectangle is 3x3, then the first ring is 3x3. The perimeter is 8. But for the next ring, the dimensions would be 3-4*(2-1) = 3-4= -1, which is invalid. But since the input k is constrained such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ), perhaps that ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to worry about negative numbers here.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nadd this to total.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input is 3 3 1. Then current_w and current_h are 3 and 3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first output.\n\nAnother example: input 7 9 2. Let's compute for i=1 and i=2.\n\ni=1: current_w =7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. For i=2: current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the third sample output.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k, then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i, the current_w and current_h, compute perimeter, sum all.\n\nNow, let's think about the constraints. The input k is up to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w,h) is 3, then (3+1)/4=1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense, because for i=1, the current_w and current_h are 3 and ... but if min(w,h) is 3, then for i=2, the current_w would",
