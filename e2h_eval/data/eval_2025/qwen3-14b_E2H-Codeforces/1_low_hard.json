The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, right. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is calculated as 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's border would be 2*(3+3-2) = 8 cells, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1 and output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), I need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the previous. Wait, the first ring is the edge. Then the next is two cells in, which would make the next rectangle smaller by 2 on each side. So the width and height decrease by 2*2 = 4 each time? Oh right, because for each ring, you're moving in by 1 cell on each side. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (original width - 2*(i-1)*2) ? Wait, the problem statement says the i-th ring is on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So yes, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so 2*2 = 4 per dimension.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we compute the perimeter of the rectangle with width w_i = w - 4*(i-1) and height h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all these perimeters.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that for each i, the rectangle is valid. For example, if the original w and h are 3, then for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3. For i=2, it would be 3 - 4*(1) = -1, which is invalid. But the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ), which ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to worry about negative values here.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop from i = 1 to k:\n\nFor each i, compute current width and current height.\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nAdd that to the total.\n\nWait, but why? Because the perimeter of a rectangle (number of cells in the border) is 2*(width + height - 2). Because for example, for a rectangle of width W and height H, the top and bottom rows contribute W cells each, and the left and right columns contribute (H-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2(W + H - 2).\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each ring, compute that perimeter and add to the total.\n\nSo for example, the third sample input is 7 9 2.\n\nFirst ring: current_w =7, current_h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which is the second sample's output when k=1.\n\nSecond ring: i=2. current_w =7 -4*(1) = 3. current_h=9 -4*(1)=5. Perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28 + 12=40, which matches the third sample's output.\n\nYes. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k. Then for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter as described and sum them.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i:\n\ncurrent_w = w - ",
