For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C. So each note has a position in this list, and the distance between two notes is the number of semitones when moving from the first to the second in the cyclic order. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. For example, between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me think: C to C# is 1, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4. Yes. So the distance between X and Y is (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? Wait, but if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. But if X is higher, like E to C, then the distance would be (C's position - E's position + 12) mod 12? Wait, no. Because according to the problem statement, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's check: the notes are ordered cyclically. Let's say the positions are 0-based. Let me assign numbers:\n\nLet me create a list of the notes in order. Let's see:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo for example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11. Then, the distance from X to Y is (y_pos - x_pos) if y is after x. But if y is before x, then it's (y_pos + 12 - x_pos). But since the distance is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. So for example, between E (position 4) and C (position 0), the distance would be (0 + 12 - 4) = 8 semitones. Which matches the example given.\n\nSo the way to calculate the distance between two notes is (y_pos - x_pos) if y is after x, else (y_pos + 12 - x_pos). Alternatively, since the notes are arranged in a circle, the distance can be calculated as (y_pos - x_pos) % 12. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4): (4 - 0) = 4, which is correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. So, for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. But if we have X and Y, then the distance from X to Y is (y_pos - x_pos) if that's positive, else (y_pos - x_pos + 12). Which is equivalent to (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper, which implies that the distance is always the minimal number of semitones when moving upwards. Wait, no. Because for example, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. But if you go the other way around, it's 8 semitones. But the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So, the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones when you move from X to Y in the upward direction. So if X is lower than Y, then it's the difference. If X is higher than Y, then it's (12 - (X-Y))? Or maybe the distance is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12. Wait, but for example, if X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (Y - X) is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. But in the problem description, the distance between X and Y is considered as the number of semitones when moving from X to Y along the scale. So for example, if X is C and Y is E, the distance is 4. If X is E and Y is C, the distance is 8. So the distance is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. However, when you have two notes, the distance between them is the minimal number of semitones in the upward direction. So that's how we need to calculate it.\n\nSo, first, I need to map each note to its position in the list. So I can create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. Let's make that list.\n\nOnce I have the positions, for any three notes, I need to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, the three notes can be arranged in any order. So for the three notes, there are 6 possible permutations (since 3! = 6). For each permutation, we can check if the first to second is 4 semitones, and second to third is 3 semitones (for major). Or for minor, first to second is 3, second to third is 4.\n\nBut how do I check all possible permutations?\n\nAlternatively, for any triplet of notes, there are multiple ways to arrange them. For example, for a major chord, there must be some ordering where X, Y, Z satisfy distance(X,Y) = 4, distance(Y,Z) =3. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo for the three notes, I can generate all possible permutations and check for each if they meet the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the three notes from input.\n\n2. For each of the three notes, find their positions in the note_order list.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the three notes (since order matters for checking the conditions).\n\n4. For each permutation, check:\n\n   a. For major: distance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3.\n\n   b. For minor: distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4.\n\n5. If any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate permutations?\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, permutations(notes, 3) will generate all possible orderings of the three notes.\n\nBut since the input is three notes, the permutations will be 6 possibilities.\n\nSo, for each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck if (distance between x and y is 4) and (distance between y and z is 3) → major.\n\nOr check if (distance between x and y is 3) and (distance between y and z is 4) → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets either condition, then return accordingly.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so there's no case where both major and minor are possible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Create a list of note_order, and a dictionary mapping note names to their positions.\n\n- For the three input notes, get their positions.\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n- For each permutation, check for major and minor conditions.\n\n- If any permutation meets major, then output 'major'.\n\n- Else, check if any permutation meets minor, output 'minor'.\n\n- Else, 'strange'.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, the note_order list. Let's define it as:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the order is given as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nYes. So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nThen, the note_to_pos dictionary can be built as:\n\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nNow, for each note in the input, we can get their positions.\n\nOnce that's done, for each permutation of the three notes, compute the distances.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two notes. Let's write a helper function:\n\ndef distance(x, y):\n\n    x_pos = note_to_pos[x]\n\n    y_pos = note_to_pos[y]\n\n    return (y_pos - x_pos) % 12\n\nWait, but for example, between C (0) and E (4), the distance is 4. Between E and C, it's (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo yes, this function returns the distance from x to y, as per the problem's definition.\n\nSo for a permutation (a, b, c), check:\n\nd1 = distance(a, b)\n\nd2 = distance(b, c)\n\nif d1 == 4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each permutation in permutations(notes, 3):\n\n   check for major and minor.\n\nOnce any of these is found, return the result.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nRead the input. The input is three space-separated notes, given as a list. Wait, the input is given as a single line with three notes. For example, in the sample input, the first input is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] — but that's probably an example of multiple test cases. Wait, the actual input is a single line with three notes. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo for example, the sample input is perhaps:\n\nC E G\n\nWhich would be the first case. But the sample shows that the input is given as a list of three examples. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nBut that's probably an example of multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is only one line. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases. But the actual code needs to read one line of input, which is three notes. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, but for the code, each input is a single line with three notes.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the code should read a single line, split into three notes. For example, in the sample input, the first example is \"C E G\" which would be the input line. Then the output is \"major\".\n\nBut the sample shows that the input is given as a list of three examples, but that's probably for the purpose of the example. So the code is supposed to process a single input line with three notes.\n\nSo the code will read input as input().split().\n\nSo, for example, if the input is 'C E G', then the code will split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nSo, first, create the note_order list and the note_to_pos dictionary.\n\nThen, read the three notes.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor condition.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the condition, return the result.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (note_to_pos[y] - note_to_pos[x]) % 12\n\n    d2 = (note_to_pos[z] - note_to_pos[y]) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but that's the code. Let's test it against the examples.\n\nFirst example: input is 'C E G'.\n\nThe permutations include (C, E, G). For this permutation:\n\nd1 is (E - C) = 4-0=4 → mod 12 is 4. Then d2 is (G - E) → G is 6, E is 4 → 6-4=2? Wait, no. Wait, note_order is:\n\nC (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11).\n\nWait, no. Wait for note_order, the list is:\n\n['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo the index for E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7.\n\nSo for the permutation (C, E, G):\n\nd1 is (E's pos - C's pos) = 4 - 0 =4 → mod 12 is 4. Correct.\n\nd2 is (G's pos - E's pos) = 7-4=3. So yes. So this permutation would trigger the major condition. So the code would print 'major'.\n\nSecond example: input is C# B F.\n\nThe notes are ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nLet's check permutations. One of them is B, C#, F.\n\nCheck for that permutation:\n\nx = B, y = C#, z = F.\n\nB's position is 10 (since note_order is ... A (9), B (10), H (11). So B is index 10.\n\nC# is index 1.\n\nSo d1 is (1 - 10) mod 12 → (1-10) is -9 mod 12 is 3. So 3 semitones. Then, distance between C# and F: F is index 5. So (5 - 1) = 4. So d2 is 4. So this permutation meets the minor condition. So code would print 'minor'.\n\nThird example: input is A B H.\n\nNotes are A (9), B (10), H (11).\n\nCheck permutations. Let's take all permutations.\n\nFor example, A, B, H.\n\nd1 between A and B is 10-9=1 → mod 12 is 1. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A.\n\nd1 is H's pos (11) - B's (10) → 1 → mod 12 is 1. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B. d1 is A's pos (9) - H's (11) → 9-11 = -2 → mod 12 is 10. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B. d1 is H (11) - A (9) → 2 → mod 12 is 2. Then d2 is B (10) - H (11) → (10 - 11) = -1 mod 12 is 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. d1 is A (9) - B (10) → 9-10 = -1 mod 12 is 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A. d1 is B's pos (10) - H's (11) → 10-11 = -1 mod 12 is 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code works for the sample.\n\nBut wait, what about other permutations? Let's think of another example.\n\nAnother example: let's say the input is 'C# B F' as in the sample. Let's check permutations.\n\nOne of the permutations is B, C#, F. As discussed earlier, d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So minor.\n\nAnother permutation could be C#, F, B. Let's check:\n\ndistance between C# and F is 5 - 1 = 4 (since F is index 5). Then distance between F and B is 10 -5 = 5. So not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: F, B, C#. Distance from F to B is 10-5=5. No.\n\nBut the code checks all permutations, so once any permutation meets the condition, it returns.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the same note is repeated? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes. But the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, the input is three notes, but perhaps they can be same? However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, the problem says that the input is three notes. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. But perhaps the code can handle that.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is three notes, but the code will process them regardless.\n\nNow, what about the case where two notes are same? For example, input is C C C. Then, the distance between any two is zero. So no major or minor.\n\nBut the code will check all permutations, but none will satisfy the conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations, which generates all possible orderings. For each permutation, it checks the two conditions.\n\nBut in code, the code checks for each permutation, and if any permutation meets the major condition, it prints 'major' and exits. Similarly for minor. Otherwise, 'strange'.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut need to import permutations from itertools.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (note_to_pos[y] - note_to_pos[x]) % 12\n    d2 = (note_to_pos[z] - note_to_pos[y]) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the exit() function may not be the best practice, but for code submission, it's acceptable. Alternatively, using sys.exit().\n\nBut in code submission, using exit() may work, but perhaps better to use sys.exit. However, in code submission, the code may be written with return or break. However, in the code as written, for the first permutation that meets the condition, it prints and exits.\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function is in the sys module. So perhaps the code should import sys and use sys.exit(). However, in some environments, exit() is available. But to be safe, perhaps replace exit() with sys.exit().\n\nBut in the code as written, the code would raise a NameError if exit() is not available. So better to use sys.exit().\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (note_to_pos[y] - note_to_pos[x]) % 12\n    d2 = (note_to_pos[z] - note_to_pos[y]) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input: 'C E G' → code outputs 'major'.\n\nSample input: 'C# B F' → code outputs 'minor'.\n\nSample input: 'A B H' → code outputs 'strange'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G#'.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's see:\n\nFor example, C, E, G#.\n\ndistance between C and E is 4. Then E to G# is 8-4=4? Wait, note_order for G# is 8. E is 4. So distance is 8-4=4. So d1=4, d2=4 → not major. So not major. For minor, check if d1 is 3 and d2 is 4. No. So this would be strange.\n\nBut perhaps another permutation. Let's say E, G#, C. Then:\n\ndistance between E and G# is 8-4=4. Then between G# and C: C is 0. So (0 - 8) mod 12 is 4. So d2 is 4. So no. So no match.\n\nSo code returns strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# E G' → check if any permutation meets major or minor.\n\nFor example, C#, E, G.\n\ndistance from C# (1) to E (4) is 3. Then E to G is 7-4=3. So 3 and 3 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: E, G, C#.\n\ndistance E to G is 3. G to C# is 1 -7 = -6 mod 12 is 6. No.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, G, E. distance from C# to G is 7-1=6. No.\n\nAnother permutation: G, C#, E. distance from G to C# is (1 -7) mod 12 → ( -6 ) mod 12 = 6. No.\n\nSo no, so code returns strange.\n\nAnother example: 'C E G' → major.\n\nAnother example: 'C Eb G' → but wait, the note names are as per the problem. The note_order includes C#, D#, F#, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the note_order is as given, so Eb is not present. Wait, the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the note names are as such. So in the problem statement, the note after E is F. So there is no Eb. So the input notes are only those in the note_order list. So the code can assume that the input is valid.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent the musical notes in a cyclic order with their respective positions. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between any two notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using their positions in the cyclic order. The distance is computed as the difference in their positions modulo 12, which accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three input notes, check if the distances between consecutive notes in the permutation match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, print the corresponding result. If none do, print \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (note_to_pos[y] - note_to_pos[x]) % 12\n    d2 = (note_to_pos[z] - note_to_pos[y]) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Order and Position Mapping**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes in a cyclic manner. The `note_to_pos` dictionary maps each note to its corresponding index in this list.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using their positions in the `note_order` list. This is done using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the input notes, we check each possible ordering to see if it fits the criteria for a major or minor triad. A major triad requires a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note. A minor triad requires the reverse distances (3 and 4 semitones respectively).\n4. **Early Exit**: As soon as a valid major or minor triad is found, the program exits immediately with the corresponding result, ensuring efficiency.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the input notes and leverages modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale, ensuring accurate distance calculations.",
