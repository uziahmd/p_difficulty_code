For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three notes forms a major, minor, or strange chord. Let me think through the steps.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the chord is made of three notes. The order doesn't matter, but we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the three input notes.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes. Because the order matters for checking the distances. For example, for a major chord, there's a specific order where X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3.\n3. For each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor conditions.\n4. If any permutation meets the major condition, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how do I calculate the distance between two notes?\n\nThe notes are in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, the note H is equivalent to B? Or maybe it's a typo? Wait, the problem statement says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh, but then after H comes C again. Wait, but in the problem statement, they mention that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me check that.\n\nLet me think about the order. Let me list the notes in order:\n\nThe order is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then back to C. So each consecutive note is a semitone apart. So the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. Between C and D is 2 semitones, etc. But when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. So for example, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, C to D is 2, C to D# is 3, C to E is 4). So that's correct.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes? Let's assign each note a numerical index. Let's create a list of the notes in order, and then for any two notes, compute their positions. The distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? No, wait. Because the distance is measured along the scale from the lower to the upper. So if X is before Y in the list, the distance is Y_index - X_index. If X is after Y, then the distance would be (12 - X_index + Y_index) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Suppose X is C (index 0), Y is E (index 4). Distance is 4 semitones. Correct. If X is E (index 4) and Y is C (index 0), then the distance is (0 + 12 - 4) = 8 semitones? Because you go from E to F (1), F to F# (2), etc., up to C. Which is 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (12 - (X_index - Y_index))? Or more generally, the distance is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if Y is lower than X, then the distance is (12 - (X_index - Y_index))? Let me see:\n\nFor example, X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0). The distance from X to Y would be (0 -4) mod 12? That's 8. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? Wait, but mod 12 can give negative numbers? Wait, no. Because if Y is after X, then Y_index - X_index is positive. If Y is before X, then Y_index - X_index is negative. But mod 12 would give a positive value. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, in Python, the modulo operator returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So for example, (0 -4) % 12 is 8. So yes, if I compute (Y_index - X_index) % 12, that would give the correct number of semitones between X and Y, considering that the distance is measured as the minimal steps from X to Y in the cyclic scale. Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones, because you have to go from E to C via the higher notes. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_index - X_index + 12). Which is equivalent to (Y_index - X_index) mod 12, but only if we take the positive value. Wait, but in code, perhaps I can compute it as (y - x) if y > x else (y -x + 12). Alternatively, (y -x) % 12, but that would give the correct value. Let me check:\n\nIf x is 4 (E), y is 0 (C). (0-4) is -4. mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (y -x) mod 12. But wait, in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its index. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let me check the order again. The problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in the example given, the third input is \"A B H\". Let me check what the distance between B and H is. Wait, B is index 10, H is index 11. So distance from B to H is 1 semitone. Then from H to A? Well, H is index 11, A is index 9. So the distance from H to A would be (9 - 11) mod 12 = ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10 semitones. But according to the problem's example, the third input is A B H. Let's see what the possible permutations could be. For example, let's check if any permutation of A, B, H can form a major or minor chord.\n\nBut let's think about the example given. The sample input is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], outputs are ['major', 'minor', 'strange'].\n\nSo for the third case, A B H. Let's see. Let's list all permutations of the three notes and check for each possible ordering.\n\nLet me think of the possible orderings. Let's say the three notes are A, B, H. Let's consider all permutations. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 semitones and second to third is 3. Or for minor, first to second is 3 and second to third is 4.\n\nSo for example, let's take the permutation A, B, H. Let's compute the distance between A and B. A is index 9, B is 10. So 10-9=1 semitone. Then B to H is 11-10=1. So that's not matching. Another permutation: A, H, B. The distance between A and H is (11-9)=2 semitones. Then H to B is (10-11) mod 12 = ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11. Not helpful. Another permutation: B, A, H. Distance between B and A is (9-10) mod 12 = 11 semitones. Then A to H is 2 semitones. Not matching. Another permutation: B, H, A. B to H is 1 semitone (H is index 11, B is 10. 11-10=1). Then H to A is (9 - 11) mod 12 = -2 mod 12 = 10. Not 3 or 4. Another permutation: H, A, B. H to A is (9 -11) mod 12 = 10 semitones. A to B is 1. Not helpful. H, B, A: H to B is (10 - 11) mod 12 = 11. B to A is 11 semitones. No. So none of the permutations meet the major or minor criteria. Hence output is 'strange'.\n\nSo that's why the third example is strange.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor the three notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the distances). For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 (major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (minor). If any permutation satisfies either condition, return the corresponding result.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so there's no need to check for overlapping cases.\n\nSo first, I need to create a mapping from note names to their indexes.\n\nLet me create a list called note_order, which contains the notes in order. Let's see:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes. Let me count:\n\nC (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11). Yes. So that's 12 elements.\n\nSo the note_order list is as above.\n\nNow, for each note in the input, we can find its index in this list.\n\nOnce I have the indexes of the three notes, I can generate all permutations of the three indexes, and for each permutation, check the distances.\n\nBut since the three notes are given as a set, but the order is not fixed, I need to generate all possible permutations of the three elements. For three elements, there are 3! = 6 permutations.\n\nSo for example, if the three notes are X, Y, Z, then the permutations are XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY, ZYX.\n\nFor each of these permutations, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 (major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (minor).\n\nSo for each permutation, compute:\n\ndistance1 = (note2 - note1) % 12\n\ndistance2 = (note3 - note2) % 12\n\nWait, no. Because the distance between note1 and note2 is (note2's index - note1's index) mod 12? Wait, no. Because the distance is calculated from the lower note to the upper. But the way we compute the distance is (note2's index - note1's index) if note2 is higher than note1, else (note2's index - note1's index + 12). Which is exactly (note2 - note1) mod 12. So yes.\n\nBut for example, if note1 is C (index 0) and note2 is E (index 4), then (4-0) mod 12 is 4, which is correct. If note1 is E (4) and note2 is C (0), then (0-4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct.\n\nBut in the problem's definition, the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to upper. So for a permutation (X, Y, Z), the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from X to Y, which is (Y - X) mod 12. But that's only if X is lower than Y. Wait, no. Because the mod 12 gives the correct distance regardless. For example, if X is higher than Y, then the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Which would be the same as (Y + 12 - X) if Y < X. So yes, the mod 12 gives the correct distance.\n\nSo for each permutation of the three notes, we can compute the distance between first and second, and between second and third. Then check if the first distance is 4 and the second is 3 (major), or first is 3 and second is 4 (minor).\n\nSo for example, for the first sample input, C E G. The indexes are 0, 4, 7. Let's check permutation C, E, G. Distance between C and E is 4, between E and G is 7-4=3. So that's a major chord. So the answer is major.\n\nAnother example: C# B F. The notes are C#, B, F. Let's see their indexes. C# is 1. B is 10. F is 5. Let's look at the permutation B, C#, F. The indexes are 10, 1, 5. The distance between B (10) and C# (1) is (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5) is (5 -1) = 4. So that's a minor chord. So the answer is minor.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Create a mapping from note names to their indexes.\n\n- Read the three input notes.\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n- For each permutation, check if the distances between first and second, and second and third, match the major or minor criteria.\n\n- If any permutation satisfies major, return 'major'; if any satisfies minor, return 'minor'; else 'strange'.\n\nNow, in Python, how to generate permutations of the three notes. Since the input is three elements, we can generate all possible permutations using itertools.permutations.\n\nBut for code efficiency, even with three elements, it's manageable.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nFirst, create a dictionary to map note names to their index.\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nThen, read the input. The input is given as a list of three notes. For example, in the sample input, the first input is ['C E G', ...], but perhaps the actual input is three space-separated notes. Wait, the problem says that the input is the only line containing 3 space-separated notes. So the input is something like 'C E G' (as a string, split into three parts).\n\nWait, the example shows that the input is given as a list of three elements, but in reality, the input is a single line with three notes. For example, the sample input is:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably an example of the input and output. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the input is a single line, like 'C E G' (for example). The sample input shows that the input is given as a list of three examples, but that's probably just for the example. So the actual code should read a single line, split into three notes.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nBut that's probably for the purpose of the example. However, in reality, the input is one line with three notes, e.g., for the first case, the input is \"C E G\".\n\nSo the code should read a single line, split into three notes.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nWhich would give a list of three strings.\n\nOnce we have the three notes, we can get their indexes.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check if the distances meet the criteria.\n\nNow, for each permutation (x, y, z):\n\ndistance_xy = (y_index - x_index) % 12\n\ndistance_yz = (z_index - y_index) % 12\n\nCheck if distance_xy == 4 and distance_yz == 3 → major.\n\nOr if distance_xy == 3 and distance_yz == 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, return 'major'; if any meets minor, return 'minor'; else 'strange'.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but this code would check all permutations. Once any permutation meets the major or minor condition, it would print and exit. Since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no need to check further once a condition is found.\n\nBut wait, for example, if a permutation meets both major and minor conditions? But according to the problem statement, that's impossible. So the code can safely check for major first, then minor.\n\nBut in reality, for a permutation, can it satisfy both? For example, if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3, then the sum is 7. For the same permutation, can d1 be 3 and d2 be 4? Only if 3+4=7, which is same as 4+3. So for the same permutation, it's possible only if d1=3 and d2=4, but that would require that (y -x) mod 12 is 3 and (z - y) mod 12 is 4. But in that case, (z -x) mod 12 is 7. But for the same permutation, the sum of d1 and d2 is 7. So for a permutation to satisfy both major and minor conditions, it would need that d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 (for major) and also d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 (for minor). Which would require that 4=3 and 3=4, which is impossible. So no permutation can satisfy both conditions.\n\nThus, the code can check for major first, then minor.\n\nBut in the code above, for each permutation, it checks if it's major, then if not, checks if it's minor.\n\nBut for example, if a permutation is major, then the code will print 'major' and exit. Otherwise, check for minor.\n\nBut what if there are multiple permutations that meet the same condition? But the problem says that the answer is unique, so once any permutation meets the condition, we can return the answer.\n\nBut in code, the permutations are generated in some order. For example, for the first sample input, the first permutation may be C, E, G, which meets the major condition. So the code will print 'major' and exit.\n\nBut what if another permutation (like E, G, C) is checked first? Let's see. For E to G, the distance is (7-4) = 3 mod 12. Then G to C is (0 -7) mod 12 = 5? Wait, no. Let me compute:\n\nE is index 4, G is 7. So d1 is (7-4) = 3. Then G is 7, C is 0. (0-7) mod 12 is 5? Wait, (0-7) is -7, mod 12 is 5. So d2 is 5. So that permutation would not meet the major or minor conditions. So the code would check all permutations until it finds one that meets the condition.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, it checks for major first. So if any permutation meets the major condition, the code returns 'major'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: C E G.\n\nPermutations include C, E, G. d1 = 4, d2=3 → major. So code returns 'major'.\n\nSecond sample input: C# B F. Let's see. The notes are C#, B, F. Let's check permutations. One of them is B, C#, F. Let's compute:\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1. d1 is (1 -10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then C# is 1, F is 5. d2 is (5-1) = 4. So that's minor. So code returns 'minor'.\n\nThird sample input: A B H. Let's check all permutations. For example, A, B, H. d1 is 1 (B - A is 10-9=1). d2 is H - B is 11-10=1. Not. Another permutation: B, H, A. d1 is H - B is 11 -10=1. d2 is A - H is 9-11 = -2 mod 12 = 10. No. Another permutation: H, A, B. d1 is A - H is 9-11 = -2 mod 12 = 10. d2 is B - A = 1. No. None of the permutations meet the criteria, so output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, edge cases. What about when the same note is used multiple times? But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. But the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, the input is three notes. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, the problem says that the input is three notes. But what if two of them are the same? For example, input C C C. Then, for any permutation, the distances would be zero. So no major or minor. So output 'strange'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is three notes, but they can be same? Probably, but according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. But the code would handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: notes that wrap around. For example, H, C, E. Let's see. H is index 11, C is 0, E is 4. Let's check permutation H, C, E. d1 is (0 -11) mod 12 = 1. d2 is 4-0 = 4. So 1 and 4 → not. Another permutation: C, E, H. d1 is 4, d2 is (11 -4) = 7 mod 12 → 7. Not. Another permutation: C, H, E. d1 is (11 -0) mod 12 = 11. d2 is 4-11 mod 12 → -7 mod 12 = 5. No. So no.\n\nAnother example: C, E, B. Let's see. Let's check permutations. Let's take E, B, C. E is index 4, B is 10. d1 is (10 -4) mod 12 = 6. Not 3 or 4. Another permutation: B, E, C. B is 10, E is 4. d1 is (4-10) mod 12 = ( -6 ) mod 12 = 6. No. Another permutation: C, B, E. d1 is B - C is 10 - 0 = 10 mod 12 → 10. No. Hmm. Not sure. Maybe this is a strange chord.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code seems correct.\n\nBut let me think about the note_order. Are the notes in the correct order? For example, the note_order list is:\n\n['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nYes. Because the problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the code uses the note_to_index dictionary. So for example, 'B' is at index 10, 'H' is at index 11.\n\nNow, in the code, when the user inputs 'B' and 'H', the code correctly maps them to their indexes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin, process, and output the correct answer.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the exit() function may not be the best. But for code submission, using sys.exit() is better. However, in code submission, using print and breaking early is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, the code can use 'exit()' but perhaps it's better to use sys.exit. However, in code submission, it's possible that the code may not have imported sys. So perhaps the code should import sys and use sys.exit. But in the code above, the code uses exit(), which in Python is available in the standard environment. But perhaps it's better to use sys.exit. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, after finding the answer, return and break. However, in the code, the code can check all permutations and then decide.\n\nBut in the code as written, once a permutation is found that meets the condition, it prints and exits. Otherwise, after checking all permutations, it prints 'strange'.\n\nBut the code as written would work.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input. Let's take the first sample input: C E G. The code would generate permutations, and the first permutation that meets the condition is C, E, G. So d1 is 4, d2 is 3. So it prints 'major'.\n\nAnother test case: C# B F. Let's see, the code will generate permutations, and for the permutation B, C#, F, d1 is (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is 5 - 1 = 4. So it's minor.\n\nAnother test case: A B H. All permutations checked, nothing found. So output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut what about the case where the same note is repeated? For example, input C C C. All permutations would have d1 = 0 and d2 = 0. So no match. Output 'strange'.\n\nAnother example: C E G#.\n\nLet's check. Let's see:\n\nC is 0, E is 4, G# is 8.\n\nPermutation C, E, G#: d1 is 4, d2 is 4 (8-4=4). So not major (needs 4 and 3). Not minor (needs 3 and 4). So no. Another permutation: C, G#, E. d1 is 8-0=8 mod 12 is 8. Not. Another permutation: E, C, G#. d1 is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. No. So output strange.\n\nAnother example: C D# G. Let's see. C is 0, D# is 3, G is 7. Permutation C, D#, G: d1 is 3, d2 is 4 (7-3=4). So that's minor. So code would output 'minor'.\n\nYes. Because d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So the code would detect that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for either a major or minor chord based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of notes ordered by their semitone positions.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, calculate the semitone distances between consecutive notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Use modular arithmetic to compute the semitone distances between notes, considering the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Criteria Check**: For each permutation, check if the distances match the criteria for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of notes from C to H. Each note is mapped to an index using a dictionary for quick lookup.\n2. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three input notes to check all potential sequences.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Check Conditions**: Each permutation is checked against the criteria for major and minor chords. If any permutation meets the criteria, the result is printed immediately. If no valid permutation is found, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical scales.",
