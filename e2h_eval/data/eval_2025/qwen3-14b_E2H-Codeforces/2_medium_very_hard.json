Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells on the two diagonals. Then check all other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grid is n x n where n is odd. The diagonals are the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). For each cell in these diagonals, they must be the same as each other. Also, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check if all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check if all other elements (non-diagonal) are the same, and that they are different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, let's collect all the diagonal elements. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell in the grid, we can check if it's on either of these diagonals.\n\nSo for step 1: iterate through all cells. For each cell, if it's on a diagonal, check if it's equal to the first diagonal character (the one from the first cell, maybe). But wait, perhaps the first diagonal character is not the same as others. So maybe collect all diagonal characters and check if they are all the same.\n\nWait, but the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So all the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must be the same. So for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti-diagonal has 'x', then that's okay. But if the main has 'x' and anti has 'y', that's invalid.\n\nSo first, collect all the elements on both diagonals. Then check if all of them are the same. Then check that all non-diagonal elements are the same and different from that.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonals? Let's think.\n\nFor a grid of size n x n, for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nMain diagonal: (i, i)\n\nAnti-diagonal: (i, n-1 -i)\n\nBut note that for the center cell (when n is odd), it's part of both diagonals. So when collecting the diagonal elements, we need to make sure that we don't have duplicates. But for checking if all are same, even if we collect duplicates, it's okay. For example, if the center cell is part of both diagonals, but all elements in the diagonals are same, then even if we check it twice, it's still valid.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nCollect all the elements on the main and anti diagonals. Then check if all of them are the same. Let's call this value d_char.\n\nThen collect all the elements that are not on either diagonal. Check if all of them are the same, and that they are different from d_char.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n. So grid is a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck for diagonals:\n\ndiag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diag_chars) != 1: then return NO.\n\nElse, d_char is the only element in diag_chars.\n\nThen check the non-diagonal cells:\n\nother_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(other_chars) != 1: return NO.\n\nElse, check that other_chars's element is different from d_char.\n\nIf all these pass, return YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if all non-diagonal cells are same as d_char? Then that would be invalid. Because the other squares must have same letter different from diagonals.\n\nSo, for example, if the diagonals are all 'x' and the other cells are also 'x', then it's invalid. Because the other cells must be same but different from diagonals.\n\nSo, the code would need to check that the other_chars set has exactly one element, and that it's different from d_char.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the diagonals are all same, but the other cells are same as each other but same as diagonals? Then the answer is NO.\n\nSo yes, the code needs to check that other_chars is a singleton set, and that it's different from d_char.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLet me see. The diagonals are:\n\nFirst row: x (0,0), then (0,4) is x. Then (1,1) is o, (1,3) is o. (2,2) is x. (3,1) is o, (3,3) is o. (4,0) is x, (4,4) is x.\n\nWait, so the diagonals have x, o, x, o, x, o, x, o, x? Wait, maybe not. Let me think for n=5.\n\nEach cell (i,j) where i==j or i+j=4.\n\nFor i=0: j=0 (i==j) and j=4 (i+j=4). So cells (0,0) and (0,4).\n\ni=1: j=1 (i==j) and j=3 (i+j=4). So (1,1) and (1,3).\n\ni=2: j=2 (i==j) and j=2 (i+j=4). So (2,2) is part of both.\n\ni=3: j=3 (i==j) and j=1 (i+j=4). So (3,3) and (3,1).\n\ni=4: j=4 (i==j) and j=0 (i+j=4). So (4,4) and (4,0).\n\nSo all the diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,0) x; (0,4) x.\n\n(1,1) o; (1,3) o.\n\n(2,2) x.\n\n(3,3) o; (3,1) o.\n\n(4,4) x; (4,0) x.\n\nSo the diagonal characters are x, x, o, o, x, o, o, x, x. Wait, but for (2,2) it's x. So the set of diag_chars would be {x, o}? Because there are x and o in the diagonals. Therefore, len(diag_chars) is 2, which is not 1. So the first condition fails. Hence output is NO, which matches the sample input's first output.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nLet's check. For n=3.\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) w; (0,2) w.\n\n(1,1) s.\n\n(2,0) w; (2,2) w.\n\nSo the diagonals are w, w, s, w, w. So the set is {w, s}? Wait no, the diagonals are all cells where i==j or i + j = 2.\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (i==j) and j=2 (i + j = 2). So (0,0) and (0,2).\n\nFor i=1, j=1 (i==j) and j=1 (i + j = 2). So (1,1) is part of both.\n\nFor i=2, j=2 (i==j) and j=0 (i + j = 2). So (2,2) and (2,0).\n\nSo the diagonal cells are (0,0) w, (0,2) w, (1,1) s, (2,0) w, (2,2) w. So the diag_chars are {w, s}?\n\nWait, that would make len(diag_chars) = 2, which would fail. But according to the sample input, the output is 'YES'. Wait, but according to the sample input, the second input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nWhich is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nSo the diagonals:\n\n(0,0) is w, (0,2) is w.\n\n(1,1) is w.\n\n(2,0) is w, (2,2) is w.\n\nSo all the diagonal elements are w. Because for (1,1) it's w. So the diag_chars is {w}.\n\nAh! Oh right, because the middle cell (1,1) is part of both diagonals. So in this case, the diagonals are all w. Then the other cells are the non-diagonal ones.\n\nLet me check:\n\nNon-diagonal cells are those not on the diagonals. For example, (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nIn the grid:\n\nRow 0: (0,1) is s. \n\nRow 1: (1,0) is s, (1,2) is s.\n\nRow 2: (2,1) is s.\n\nSo all non-diagonal cells are s. And the diagonal is w. So the other_chars is {s}, which is different from w. So the answer is YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo why in my earlier analysis of the second sample input, the diagonals were all w. Because the (1,1) is w. So the code would collect all the diagonal elements as w. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the third sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e. So the diag_chars would be {x, e} → len is 2. So the first check fails. So output is NO, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code logic works here.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is given as a list of strings. Wait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as first line n, then n lines each with n letters.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as the first line contains integer n, then n lines of letters. However, in the sample input, the user provided a list of three test cases, each as a string. But the actual problem's input is for a single test case.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But that's probably because the sample input is given as a list of inputs for multiple test cases, but the actual program needs to process a single test case.\n\nWait, the original problem's input is as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Then n lines follow. So for each test case, the input is n followed by n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input provided in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of three test cases. However, in the actual programming problem, the code needs to read from standard input. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one test case at a time.\n\nWait, the problem's sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nOutput:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut this is probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, in reality, the code needs to read from stdin. So for example, in the actual programming competition problem, the input would be given as:\n\nFor example, for the first test case, the input would be:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen for the next test case, the input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the user is showing that the code must process multiple test cases. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the input is for one test case. So the sample input provided in the problem is perhaps a list of test cases, but the code must process one test case. However, the sample output shows that the code should output for each test case in the input. But that's confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as a list of three test cases (as strings), and the output is a list of three results. But that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, in the actual programming problem, the code is supposed to read one test case, process it, and output one result. But perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n ... Each of the next n lines contains n small letters...\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. However, that's probably a mistake in the problem's formatting. But looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases. The sample output is a list of three outputs. But perhaps the actual problem is that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's description says nothing about that. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's original statement:\n\nThe problem says that the input is for a single test case. So the sample input is probably a list of three separate test cases, and the code is supposed to process each of them. But how?\n\nBut the original problem's sample input may be formatted in a way that's not standard. For example, perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample output shows three outputs. This suggests that the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is conflicting with the problem statement's input description. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem's input is described as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n ... Each of the next n lines contains n small letters.\n\nSo, the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample output shows that for each input, the code returns the corresponding output.\n\nBut this is a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the code should handle multiple test cases, but the problem's input description is not clear.\n\nBut looking at the original problem's sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the sample output is a list of three answers. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each with their own n and grid.\n\nBut how to know? Well, looking at the original problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut the first line of the first test case is 5, then 5 lines. The second test case starts with 3, then 3 lines, etc. So the code should read multiple test cases. But how many? How does the code know when to stop?\n\nBut the problem's input description says nothing about multiple test cases. So this is a bit confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original source, perhaps this is from Codeforces or similar, and the sample input is shown as a list of test cases. However, the actual code is supposed to read one test case. But the sample input and output are presented in a way that suggests multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, but the sample output shows three answers. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code must read from stdin. How is the input given?\n\nIn programming competitions, typically, each test case is processed in a single run. However, sometimes the code must process multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is described as for a single test case.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says nothing about that. This is a problem.\n\nBut looking at the sample input format, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given as per the input description.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, the code would read until EOF.\n\nBut for example, the first line is n, then n lines. Then another n, then n lines, etc.\n\nBut how to know when to stop reading?\n\nIn programming competition problems, sometimes the number of test cases is given. But here, the problem says nothing about that.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description may be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But that would not explain the sample output.\n\nThis is a critical point. Because if the code is supposed to process one test case, then the sample input and output is presented incorrectly. But given that the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three answers, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, the problem's sample input is given as a list of three test cases. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the code should process each of these test cases and output the corresponding answer.\n\nSo the code needs to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous. But given the sample input and output, I think that the code should process multiple test cases, each with their own n and grid.\n\nBut how to read them? Because in practice, the code would read from stdin until EOF.\n\nSo, for example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into individual test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut how to parse the input correctly?\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, each test case is given as a single string. For example, the first test case is \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\".\n\nSo for the code, the input is given as multiple lines. For example, the code reads from stdin, and each test case is given as follows: the first line is n, then n lines of the grid.\n\nSo the code should process multiple test cases. But how to know when to stop? Well, in programming competitions, the code usually processes until EOF. So the code will read all lines until there are no more lines.\n\nBut in practice, for Python, the code can read all input at once, split into tokens, and process accordingly.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving this problem, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case, but the sample shows multiple test cases. But that's conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases. But the sample output is a list of three answers. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is incorrect. Or perhaps the problem's input is for a single test case, but the sample input is presented as a list of multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is a problem. However, looking at the original problem statement again, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample output is given as a list of answers. But that would not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that is not standard. For example, perhaps the code is supposed to read from a list of test cases, but that's not the case in practice.\n\nThis is a critical point. If I proceed under the assumption that the code is supposed to process a single test case, then the code would read n, then n lines. Then process it.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is given as a string that includes the n and the lines. So for example, the first input line is 5, followed by 5 lines. So the code would process that.\n\nBut then, the sample output would be the first element of the output list. But the sample output shows three outputs. Which implies that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut since the problem says that the input is for a single test case, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's not standard. Perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases for the purpose of showing examples, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nBut then, how to explain the sample output? Well, perhaps the sample input is not the actual input format, but a way to show multiple examples. But the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps I should look for the correct way to read the input based on the problem statement.\n\nThe problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo, the code should read one n, then n lines. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is a list of three test cases, but that's probably a formatting error. So for example, the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but in reality, the code should process one.\n\nBut the sample output shows three answers. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample output is given as a list of answers. But this would imply that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut without further information, I think that the code should process a single test case, and the sample input's format is just a way to present multiple examples.\n\nBut then, the sample input and output would be for three separate test cases, but the code would process one.\n\nBut this is not helpful. To resolve this, perhaps I should look at the problem's original source. However, since I can't do that, I'll proceed with the assumption that the code must process a single test case, and the sample input is given as multiple test cases for illustration purposes.\n\nBut then, the sample input and output would be for three test cases. But the code must process one. But how to reconcile this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written as a list of test cases, but each test case is given as a single string. For example, the first test case is the string \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\", which is parsed into n=5, then five lines.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, and process multiple test cases. Each test case is given as follows: the first line is n, then n lines. So the code should read until there is no more input.\n\nIn that case, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nFor example, in Python, reading from stdin can be done with sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), which gives a list of lines.\n\nThen, for each test case, we read the first line as n, then read the next n lines as the grid. Then process, and repeat until all lines are processed.\n\nBut how to handle multiple test cases?\n\nLet me think: for example, the input may have multiple test cases. For example, after processing one test case, the code proceeds to process the next.\n\nSo the code can read all lines into a list, then process them sequentially.\n\nFor example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen, process the lines as follows:\n\ncurrent_line = 0\n\nwhile current_line < len(lines):\n\n    n = int(lines[current_line])\n\n    current_line += 1\n\n    grid = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        grid.append(lines[current_line])\n\n        current_line += 1\n\n    # process grid and output result\n\nSo this would handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines, but the sample input has three test cases, I think this is the correct approach.\n\nThus, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, the code will read all test cases, and for each, process it and output YES or NO.\n\nNow, returning to the problem.\n\nOnce the grid is read, the code must perform the checks as discussed.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nFirst, for each test case:\n\nRead n, then read n lines, each of length n.\n\nThen, check:\n\n- All diagonal elements (main and anti) are the same.\n\n- All non-diagonal elements are the same and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nFor the grid:\n\ndiag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diag_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    d_char = diag_chars.pop()\n\n    other_chars = set()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n -1):\n\n                other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n    if len(other_chars) != 1:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        o_char = other_chars.pop()\n\n        if o_char == d_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, in the case where all non-diagonal cells are same, but same as diagonal. Then it's invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? For example, when n=1. But n is at least 3, so no.\n\nBut for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 3*3 - 3*2 + 1 (since the center is counted in both diagonals). Wait, for n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 2*3 -1 = 5 (since the center is counted once). So total non-diagonal cells is 9 -5 =4.\n\nSo, for each case, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut what if all non-diagonal cells are empty? No, since n >=3.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=5\n\ngrid:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe diagonals include:\n\nLooking at (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\n(1,1) is o, (1,3) is o.\n\n(2,2) is x.\n\n(3,1) is o, (3,3) is o.\n\n(4,0) is x, (4,4) is x.\n\nSo the diag_chars is {x, o} → len is 2 → print NO.\n\nSample test case 2:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: 'wsw' → positions (0,0)=w, (0,1)=s, (0,2)=w.\n\nRow 1: 'sws' → (1,0)=s, (1,1)=w, (1,2)=s.\n\nRow 2: 'wsw' → (2,0)=w, (2,1)=s, (2,2)=w.\n\nDiagonals are:\n\n(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nThese are w, w, w, w, w → diag_chars is {w}.\n\nOther cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) → s, s, s, s → other_chars is {s}.\n\ns != w → YES.\n\nSample test case 3:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals: (0,0)=x, (0,2)=x; (1,1)=x; (2,0)=x; (2,2)=e. So diag_chars is {x, e} → len 2 → print NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would work for these cases.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut in Python, reading the input as per multiple test cases.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, split into a list.\n\nThen process each test case as per the code above.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n\n            idx += 1\n\n        # process grid\n\n        diag_chars = set()\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n                    diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        if len(diag_chars) != 1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        d_char = diag_chars.pop()\n\n        other_chars = set()\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if not (i == j or i + j == n -1):\n\n                    other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        if len(other_chars) != 1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        o_char = other_chars.pop()\n\n        if o_char == d_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the other_chars is empty? For example, when n=1. But n is at least 3, so no.\n\nBut for n=3, there are 9 - 5 = 4 cells not on diagonals. So other_chars will have at least one element.\n\nSo code is safe.\n\nNow, test cases.\n\nBut what about cases where the other_chars is empty? Not possible.\n\nNow, what about when the other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3.\n\nSo code is okay.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where all non-diagonal cells are same as diagonal. For example:\n\nn=3:\n\nxxx\n\nxox\n\nxxx\n\nThe diagonals are x's. The non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) → all x. So other_chars is {x}, same as d_char. So output is NO.\n\nAnother case where the diagonals are all same, but other cells are not same. For example:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are a's. Other cells: (0,1) is a, (1,0) is b, (1,2) is b, (2,1) is a. So other_chars is {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother case where other_chars is same, but same as diagonal. Output NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are 'a', other cells 'b' → YES.\n\nSo the code handles these.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin. So the code above should work.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the code uses line.strip(), but perhaps the input lines have leading/trailing whitespace. However, according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. So perhaps using line.strip() is not correct. Because if a line is like 'xooox\\n', then line.strip() would remove any leading/trailing whitespace, but in the problem statement, the lines are exactly n letters. So perhaps the code should read the line as is, but ensure that it's of length n.\n\nBut in practice, the code should read the line as given, but perhaps the code should take the line as it is, without stripping. Because if the line has leading or trailing spaces, then the code would read them as part of the grid, which is invalid. However, according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. So the code can assume that each line is exactly n letters. Thus, perhaps the code should read the line as is, but in practice, when reading via input(), the trailing newline is stripped. However, when using sys.stdin, perhaps it's better to read each line as it is, but in practice, the code can read each line as line.rstrip('\\n') to remove the newline character.\n\nBut in the code above, the code uses line.strip(), which removes leading and trailing whitespace. Which could be problematic if the input lines have leading or trailing whitespace. However, according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. So perhaps the code should read the line as it is, but without the newline character.\n\nBut perhaps the code should read each line as lines[idx], and then take the entire string. For example, if the input is given as:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen each line after the first is exactly n letters. So the code should read the line as-is, but in practice, when reading via sys.stdin, each line includes the newline character. So using line.strip() would remove any leading/trailing whitespace, which may be necessary if the input has trailing spaces. However, according to the problem statement, the lines contain exactly n letters, so perhaps it's better to read the line as line.rstrip('\\n') to remove the newline, but not strip other whitespace.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, the code can use line.strip() to get rid of any leading/trailing whitespace, which may be present due to input formatting. However, if the input is correct, then line.strip() would give the correct string.\n\nBut for example, if a line is 'xooox\\n', then line.strip() gives 'xooox', which is correct. So the code uses line.strip().\n\nBut in the code above, the lines are read as [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]. So for example, empty lines are skipped. However, the input may not have empty lines. But during the reading process, if there are empty lines, they are skipped. But according to the problem statement, each test case has n lines after the first line. So the code may have issues if the input has empty lines.\n\nBut assuming that the input is correct, the code should work.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses 'lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]' which creates a list of non-empty lines. So, for example, if the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The grid must have all letters on both diagonals the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same but different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read multiple test cases from standard input.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: For each test case, check if all characters on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Ensure all elements not on the diagonals are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Output Result**: Print \"YES\" if both conditions are met, otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n            idx += 1\n        \n        diag_chars = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        \n        if len(diag_chars) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        \n        d_char = diag_chars.pop()\n        other_chars = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n                    other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        \n        if len(other_chars) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        \n        o_char = other_chars.pop()\n        if o_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of strings, each representing a line from the input. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: We iterate through each cell in the grid and collect characters from both diagonals into a set. If the set size is 1, all diagonal characters are the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, we collect characters not on the diagonals into another set. If this set size is 1 and its element is different from the diagonal character, the grid forms an \"X\".\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases where the grid might not meet the criteria by checking set sizes and comparing characters appropriately.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both conditions required for the grid to form an \"X\" and handle multiple test cases as specified.",
