Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. The problem says that the X is formed when both diagonals have the same letters, and all other squares have the same letter different from the diagonals. So, how do I check this?\n\nFirst, let me think about the structure of the square. The square has n rows and columns, with n being odd. The two diagonals are the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells (not on either diagonal) must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo the steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Check all cells on both diagonals. They should all be the same character. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check all other cells (those not on either diagonal) to be the same character, say 'o', and ensure that 'o' is not equal to 'd'.\n\nBut how do I check these conditions?\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through the cells. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, I can check if it's on either of these diagonals.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the other characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping cells? For example, in the case of a square with odd n, the center cell is part of both diagonals. But that's okay; it's still part of the diagonals.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate through every cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, determine if it's on a diagonal.\n- Collect all the diagonal characters and non-diagonal characters.\n- Check that all diagonal characters are the same.\n- Check that all non-diagonal characters are the same.\n- Check that the two characters (diagonal and non-diagonal) are different.\n\nBut how to collect them? Let's think.\n\nLet me first collect the diagonal characters. For each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. So for all such cells, collect their characters. Then check that all of them are the same.\n\nThen, for all other cells (those not on diagonals), collect their characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to handle this in code?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\n- Check if all diagonal cells have the same character.\n\n- Check if all non-diagonal cells have the same character.\n\n- Check that the two characters are different.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me first collect the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal character (for example, the top-left cell, (0,0)), and check that all other diagonal cells match it.\n\nSimilarly for the non-diagonal cells. Take the first non-diagonal cell (if any) and check that all others match it.\n\nBut wait, there might be cases where there are no non-diagonal cells. Wait, no. Since n is at least 3, and for n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the center. So the total number of diagonal cells is 2n - 1 (since for each row, there's two cells except for the middle row which has one). But for n=3, 2*3-1=5 cells. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo in code:\n\nFirst, collect the diagonal characters. Let's get the first diagonal character (say, from (0,0)), and then check that all other diagonal cells are equal to it.\n\nThen collect the non-diagonal characters. Take the first non-diagonal cell (like (0,1), if that's not a diagonal cell?), and check that all others are equal to it.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell? Well, perhaps for the first row, the first cell that's not on the diagonal. For example, in the first row (i=0), the diagonal cells are (0,0) and (0, n-1 - 0) = (0, n-1). So for the first row, the cells in between (if any) are non-diagonal. So for n=5, in the first row, positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The diagonals are 0 and 4. So positions 1, 2, 3 are non-diagonal. So the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1).\n\nBut what if all cells are on diagonals? That's only possible for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no, for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead the grid as a list of strings.\n\nCheck for the diagonal characters:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nIf i == j or i + j == n-1: it's a diagonal cell.\n\nCollect all these characters. Check that they are all the same.\n\nThen collect all the other cells (non-diagonal), check that they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line as a string. Let's store them as a list of lists, perhaps. Or maybe just as a list of strings.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check that len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1, and that the two sets are different.\n\nWait, but that would work? Because if all diagonal cells are same, then diagonal_chars will have size 1. Similarly for non-diagonal.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for example, for n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells (each of the two diagonals, but overlapping in the center). The non-diagonal cells are 4, which are the ones not on either diagonal.\n\nSo, in code, the above approach would collect all the diagonal characters into diagonal_chars, and the others into non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut then, if the diagonal_chars has size 1 and non_diagonal_chars has size 1, and they are different, then return YES.\n\nBut what about if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, that's impossible here because n is at least 3. For example, n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 2*3 - 1 = 5. The total cells is 9. So 9-5=4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCheck that the diagonal_chars has exactly one unique character, and non_diagonal_chars has exactly one unique character, and that they are different.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut in code, the code would be:\n\ndiagonal_set = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_set = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_set.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_set.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_set) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_set) == 1:\n\n    if diagonal_set != non_diagonal_set:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for example, if the diagonal has multiple characters, but the non-diagonal has one. But the code checks that both sets have exactly one element. So, that would work.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_set is empty? Well, for n >=3, that's not possible. For example, n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So for the code, the non_diagonal_set will have at least one element.\n\nBut in code, for the case when the non_diagonal_set is empty, but that's impossible here. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_set is empty? Like n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo the code would work?\n\nWait, but in the example given:\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLet me parse this.\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nNow, the diagonals are:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) where i==j or i +j =4 (since n=5, n-1=4).\n\nSo for i=0, j=0 (i==j) and j=4 (i+j=4). So those are part of the diagonals.\n\nFor i=1, j=1 and j=3.\n\nFor i=2, j=2 (since i+j=4 would be j=2, since 2+2=4. So that's the center cell.\n\nFor i=3, j=1 and j=3? Wait, i=3, j=1: 3+1=4. Yes. And j=3: i=3, j=3? i+j=6, which is not 4. So for i=3, the anti-diagonal is j=1 (since 3+1=4). And the main diagonal is j=3 (i=3, j=3).\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\nLooking at all cells:\n\nRow 0: positions 0 and 4 (x and x).\n\nRow 1: positions 1 and 3 (x and x).\n\nRow 2: position 2 (x).\n\nRow 3: positions 1 and 3 (x and x).\n\nRow 4: positions 0 and 4 (x and x).\n\nSo the diagonal characters are x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x? Wait, for each cell in the diagonals. Let me count:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: x.\n\ni=0, j=4: x.\n\ni=1, j=1: x.\n\ni=1, j=3: x.\n\ni=2, j=2: x.\n\ni=3, j=1: x.\n\ni=3, j=3: x.\n\ni=4, j=0: x.\n\ni=4, j=4: x.\n\nSo all diagonal cells are x. So diagonal_set is {x}.\n\nNow the non-diagonal cells. For example, row 0, j=1,2,3: o, o, o. Row 1, j=0,2,4: o, o, o. Row 2, j=0,1,3,4: s, o, o, o. Row 3, j=0,2,4: o, o, o. Row 4, j=1,2,3: o, o, o.\n\nSo the non-diagonal characters include s, o, etc. So the non_diagonal_set would contain 's' and 'o'?\n\nWait, for example, in row 2, column 0 is s. That's not on the diagonal. So that's part of non_diagonal_set. So the non_diagonal_set would have 's' and 'o'? So the non_diagonal_set would have size 2. Therefore, the code would check len(diagonal_set) is 1 and len(non_diagonal_set) is 1? No. So the code would output NO. Which matches the first sample input's output of NO.\n\nYes. So the code would correctly return NO.\n\nAnother sample input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'. Let's see.\n\nn=3.\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ni=0, j=0 (w), j=2 (w).\n\ni=1, j=1 (w).\n\ni=2, j=0 (w), j=2 (w).\n\nSo all diagonal cells are w.\n\nThe non-diagonal cells are:\n\nRow 0, j=1: s.\n\nRow 1, j=0: s, j=2: s.\n\nRow 2, j=1: s.\n\nSo non_diagonal_set is {s}.\n\nSo diagonal_set is {w}, non_diagonal_set is {s}, which are different. So code returns YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input is 3:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (x), j=2 (x).\n\ni=1, j=1 (x).\n\ni=2, j=0 (x), j=2 (e).\n\nSo the diagonal cells are x, x, x, x, e. So the diagonal_set would be {x, e} (since the cell (2,2) is e? Wait, for i=2, j=2: i + j = 4, which for n=3 is 2+2=4? No. Wait n is 3, so n-1 is 2. So i + j = 2. For i=2, j=0: 2+0=2, yes. So that's part of the anti-diagonal. The cell (2,2) is i=2, j=2: i + j =4, which is not equal to 2 (n-1 is 2). So that cell is not part of the anti-diagonal. So for i=2, j=2, it's only on the main diagonal (i==j). So the cell (2,2) is part of the main diagonal. So in this case, the cell (2,2) is e. So the diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So the diagonal_set is {x, e} (since there are two different characters). Therefore, the code would check len(diagonal_set) is 2, which is not 1. So returns NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nBut what about when the non-diagonal characters are same as the diagonal? For example, if all cells are same. Then the diagonal_set is {a}, non_diagonal_set is {a}. So the code would check if they are different, which they are not. So returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'b'. Then returns YES.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. However, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the input is given as the first line being n, then n lines of strings. But the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n small letters.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's given as a list of strings, like:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nWait, but that's probably how the sample is presented. However, in actual programming competition input, the input is read from stdin. So for the code, the user will input n, then n lines of strings.\n\nBut for the code, the code needs to read from standard input. So for example, in Python, the code would read the first line as n, then read n lines, each being a string.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich is the first test case.\n\nBut the code must process multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is the first line is n, then n lines of letters. So the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut that's probably how the sample is presented. However, in reality, the problem says that the input is one test case. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe input is given as first line n, then n lines. But the sample shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nNo, the problem says that the input is for one test case. But in the sample input, it's given as multiple test cases, but that's probably because the user is showing multiple examples. However, the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n small letters.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. But the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. However, that's probably because the sample input is given as a list of test cases. But in reality, the code should read one test case.\n\nWait, the problem says that the user is to write a program that reads input from standard input and outputs to standard output. So the code must read one test case. But the sample input shows that the user is providing multiple test cases. However, that's probably because the sample is given as a list of inputs and outputs. But in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case per run.\n\nWait, but the sample input is given as a list of multiple test cases. However, in practice, the code is supposed to process one test case. For example, in programming competitions, each test case is processed separately, but the code is written for a single test case. Unless the problem says otherwise.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line is n, then n lines of letters. So the code must read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the user is providing multiple test cases, but that's probably for the purpose of the example. However, the actual code should process one test case. So in the code, we need to read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is a list of strings. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? But the problem statement does not mention that. So perhaps the sample is written in a way that the first input is a list of test cases. But that's not clear.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters. So the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows that there are three test cases. But that's probably because the sample is written as a list of inputs and outputs. For example, the first input is for the first test case, the second input is for the second test case, etc. But in practice, the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the user's code must read from stdin. So in Python, the code would read the first line as n, then read n lines. But if the input is given as multiple test cases, then the code would need to process them all. However, the problem statement does not mention that. So perhaps the sample input is formatted in a way that's confusing. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the input is one test case. Therefore, the code must read one test case. However, the sample input shows that there are three test cases. But that's probably because the sample input is given as a list of test cases. However, in practice, the code must read one test case. So for example, the first sample input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich is the first test case. The output is NO.\n\nThe second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nWhich outputs YES.\n\nThe third test case is:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nWhich outputs NO.\n\nBut in practice, the code is supposed to process one test case. So the code must read n, then n lines.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the code could read all lines from stdin, split them, and process accordingly. However, the problem says that the code must read from standard input. So for example, the code would be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen process the grid.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that the user is to provide multiple test cases, but the code is written to process one. But that's not possible. So perhaps the sample input is not the actual input format, but just an example of multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code must process one test case.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string.\n\nThen process as discussed.\n\nBut in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j), check if it's on a diagonal.\n\nSo:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, that's impossible. Because for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 9 - 5 =4.\n\nBut what about when n=1? Well, the problem says n is at least 3, so no.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut let's test some edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'b'.\n\nSo the code returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'a' → returns NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have two different characters. For example, in the first diagonal cell is 'a', another is 'b' → diagonal_chars has size 2 → returns NO.\n\nAnother case: non-diagonal has two different characters → returns NO.\n\nSo the code handles all these cases.\n\nBut what about when the non-diagonal set is empty? Well, for n=3, no.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's look at the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nIn this case, the non_diagonal_chars includes 's' and 'o' (from row 2, column 0). So the non_diagonal_chars has size 2. Hence, the code returns NO.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w; (1,1) w; (2,0) w, (2,2) w. So diagonal_chars is {'w'}.\n\nThe non-diagonal cells are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So non_diagonal_chars is {'s'}, which is different from 'w'. So returns YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo the code works for the sample inputs.\n\nNow, what about when the non-diagonal set is empty? Well, no, but for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother case: n=3, all cells are same. Then, diagonal and non-diagonal sets are same. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are all 'a', non-diagonal are all 'a' → returns NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'b' → returns YES.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in Python, sometimes when reading input, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters. So using input().strip() would be safe. However, perhaps the input lines may have leading or trailing whitespace? The problem says that each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the input lines are exactly n characters long. So using input().strip() would be incorrect if the line has leading or trailing whitespace. However, the problem says that each line contains exactly the letters. So perhaps the correct way is to read the line as input().strip().\n\nBut for example, if a line is 'xooox\\n', then input().strip() would remove the newline and give 'xooox' which is correct. But if the line is read as input().strip(), then any leading/trailing whitespace would be removed. However, the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters. So the code can safely read each line as input().strip().\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, stripping whitespace.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = set()\n\nnon_diagonal = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal) == 1 and len(non_diagonal) == 1 and diagonal != non_diagonal:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, comparing sets with '!=' is possible. For example, if diagonal is {'a'}, non_diagonal is {'b'}, then diagonal != non_diagonal is True.\n\nBut what if diagonal is {'a'}, non_diagonal is {'a'}? Then diagonal == non_diagonal → returns False.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal is empty? For example, n=1. But the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, the code will have non_diagonal as a set with elements.\n\nTherefore, this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1: the code returns NO, as expected.\n\nSample 2: returns YES.\n\nSample 3: returns NO.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen diagonal is {a}, non_diagonal is {a} → returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals:\n\n(0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) a; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal is {a}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1) b; (1,0) b; (1,2) a; (2,1) b.\n\nWait, for (1,2): i=1, j=2. i + j = 3. n-1 is 2 (n=3). So 3 != 2. So not on diagonal. So non-diagonal cells. So non_diagonal is {b, a}? Because (1,2) is a. So the non_diagonal set has 'b' and 'a' → len is 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo the code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case where non-diagonal is same as diagonal. For example, n=3, grid:\n\naxa\n\nxaa\n\naxa\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) x; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal set is {a, x} → len 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nThus, this code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Character Collection**: Traverse each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it lies on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal where row index equals column index, and anti-diagonal where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`). Collect characters from these diagonals into one set and characters from other positions into another set.\n3. **Validation**: Check if both sets contain exactly one unique character each, and ensure that the characters in the two sets are different.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = set()\nnon_diagonal = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal) == 1 and len(non_diagonal) == 1 and diagonal != non_diagonal:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first input line is the integer `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n- **Character Collection**: By iterating through each cell in the grid, we determine if it lies on either of the diagonals. Characters on diagonals are collected into the `diagonal` set, while others go into the `non_diagonal` set.\n- **Validation Checks**: The solution checks if both sets contain exactly one unique character each, ensuring they are different. If these conditions are met, the grid forms an \"X\", and we print \"YES\"; otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations, ensuring clarity and optimal performance for the given constraints.",
