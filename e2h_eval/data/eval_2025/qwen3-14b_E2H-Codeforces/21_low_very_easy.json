The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because even chests can only be opened by odd keys, and odd chests can only be opened by even keys. So for each group, we take the minimum of the two counts.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parities. \n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So odd chests count is 2 (9 and 11), even chests count is 3 (14,6,2).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parities. 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd keys count is 1 (7), even keys count is 3 (others).\n\nSo for even chests (3) and odd keys (1): min(3,1) = 1. For odd chests (2) and even keys (3): min(2,3) = 2. Total is 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output of 3. That works.\n\nSecond example input: \nChests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even chests count is 5, odd chests 0. Keys: 5 (odd). So for even chests, need odd keys. There's 1 odd key. So min(5,1) =1. The other part is min(0, even keys count). But since there are no odd chests, that part is zero. So total is 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even chests need odd keys, but there are none. So answer is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, how to implement this in Python?\n\nThe steps for code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i. For each a_i, check if it's even or odd. Count even_chest and odd_chest.\n\nRead the list of b_j. Similarly count even_key and odd_key.\n\nThen compute the sum of min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nThat's the answer.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Oh, the input examples show multiple test cases. Wait, the first input line is for example, the first input is ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', ...], but perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases? Wait, no. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then second line is a_i, third line is b_j. So the code should read one test case. But looking at the sample input, the first example's input is given as a single case, but the sample input shows three different inputs. Wait, perhaps the user provided multiple test cases in the example? Or perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases as separate examples. But the actual problem is that the code needs to process a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m. Then the second line has n integers, third line has",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in the list of chests and keys.\n2. **Match Parities**: Use the counts to determine how many valid pairs can be formed:\n   - Even chests can only be opened by odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can only be opened by even keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum counts of even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    odd_chest = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chest += 1\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    odd_key = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key += 1\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and split into a list of integers for easier processing.\n2. **Parity Counting**: We iterate through the list of chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Pair Calculation**: Using the counts of even and odd chests and keys, we compute the maximum possible valid pairs by taking the minimum of the respective counts for each valid combination (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys).\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys, adhering to the constraints and ensuring optimal performance.",
