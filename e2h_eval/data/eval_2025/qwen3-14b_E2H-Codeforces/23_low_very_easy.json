            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimum number of draws required.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The input is three tiles. For each case, I have to determine how many more tiles she needs to draw to have at least one mentsu.\n\nSo for each of the three input cases, I need to check if there's already a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimum number of tiles to add.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s. That's a sequence, so answer is 0. In the second case, three 9m's, that's a triplet. Third case, 3p, 9m, 2p. She can draw 1p or 4p to make a sequence with 2p and 3p. So adding one tile gives a sequence. So answer is 1.\n\nSo the problem is to check for each input whether there's already a mentsu. If not, find the minimal steps to reach one.\n\nSo the plan is: For the given three tiles, check if they form a mentsu. If yes, return 0. Else, find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu?\n\nFirst, check for triplet. All three tiles must be same. So for example, if all three are same, then it's a triplet. So that's easy.\n\nIf not, check for sequence. For that, the three tiles must be in same suit, and their numbers must be consecutive. But the order doesn't matter. So for example, 1s, 2s, 3s is a sequence. Also, 3s, 1s, 2s is same. So we need to check if the three numbers are consecutive, and same suit.\n\nBut what if the three tiles are not in same suit? Then no sequence.\n\nSo for the initial three tiles, check if they form a triplet or a sequence. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about possible cases.\n\nCase 1: The three tiles can form a triplet with one more tile. For example, two of same tile. Then adding one more would make three. So for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding another 1m would make a triplet. So in this case, need 1 tile.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to form a sequence with fewer tiles. So we need to consider both possibilities.\n\nBut how to find the minimal steps?\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCheck for all possible ways to form a mentsu (triplet or sequence) with the current tiles plus some added tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios when the initial three tiles don't form a mentsu.\n\nFor example, let's take the third sample input: 3p, 9m, 2p. So the three tiles are 3p, 2p, and 9m. So the 3p and 2p are same suit. So for them to form a sequence, we need 1p or 4p. So adding one tile. So the answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: suppose the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 1p. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add 1m (so 1 tile). Or, perhaps form a sequence. But since the suits are different, sequences can't be formed. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: tiles are 1m, 2m, 3p. Then, can't form a triplet. For a sequence, the 1m and 2m are same suit, but need 3m. So adding 3m would make a sequence. So answer is 1. Alternatively, maybe other options?\n\nBut if the tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, adding 3m would form a sequence. So need one tile. So the answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, adding another 1m would make triplet. Or adding 3m to form a sequence. So which requires less? Adding one tile in either case. So answer is 1.\n\nBut what",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking if the current set of tiles already forms a mentsu, and if not, calculating the minimum additional tiles required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Triplet**: If all three tiles are identical, then it's already a triplet, and no extra tiles are needed.\n2. **Check for Sequence**: If the three tiles are in the same suit and their numbers form a consecutive sequence, then it's already a sequence, and no extra tiles are needed.\n3. **Determine Minimum Extra Tiles**:\n   - If neither a triplet nor a sequence is formed with the current tiles, we need to calculate the minimum tiles required to form either:\n     - **Triplet**: Count how many of each tile exist and determine how many more are needed to form a triplet.\n     - **Sequence**: Check for possible sequences by considering the numbers and suits of the tiles, and determine the minimum tiles needed to complete a sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_tiles_to_draw(tiles):\n    # Check for triplet\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return 0\n\n    # Check for sequence\n    # Extract suit and numbers\n    suits = [tile[1] for tile in tiles]\n    nums = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles]\n\n    # Check if all suits are the same\n    if len(set(suits)) == 1:\n        # Sort the numbers\n        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n        if sorted_nums[1] == sorted_nums[0] + 1 and sorted_nums[2] == sorted_nums[1] + 1:\n            return 0\n\n    # Now, need to find the minimal number of draws\n    # Consider all possibilities for triplet and sequence\n\n    # First, check for possible triplet\n    from collections import Counter\n    count = Counter(tiles)\n    max_count = max(count.values())\n    # To form a triplet, need 3 of the same\n    # So if any tile has 2, need 1 more\n    if max_count == 2:\n        return 1\n    elif max_count == 1:\n        # Need to add two more of one tile\n        return 2\n\n    # If not triplet, check for possible sequence\n    # Group by suit\n    suit_groups = {}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        suit = tile[1]\n        if suit not in suit_groups:\n            suit_groups[suit] = []\n        suit_groups[suit].append(int(tile[0]))\n\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n    for suit, numbers in suit_groups.items():\n        # For each suit, check what's the minimal draws to get a sequence\n        # Sort the numbers\n        sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n        # Try to find the best way to extend to a sequence\n        # Possible scenarios: existing numbers can be part of a sequence\n        # For example, if numbers are [1, 2], need 3 (draw 1)\n        # If numbers are [1, 3], need 2 (draw 1)\n        # If numbers are [2, 3], need 1 (draw 1)\n        # If numbers are [1, 4], need 2 or 3 (draw 2)\n        # Let's check all possible sequences that can be formed with these numbers\n\n        # We can try to find the minimal tiles needed to complete a sequence\n        # For each possible starting number in the range 1-7\n        # Or check possible sequences that can be completed with existing numbers\n\n        # For the given numbers, find the minimal tiles to add\n        # Let's consider all possible sequences that can include at least two of the existing numbers\n        # For example, if the numbers are [1, 2], then adding 3 gives a sequence\n        # If the numbers are [1, 3], then adding 2 gives a sequence\n        # If the numbers are [2, 3], adding 1 or 4\n        # If the numbers are [1, 4], need to add 2 and 3, or 3 and 5, etc.\n\n        # So for the sorted numbers, check for possible sequences\n        # For each pair of numbers, see what is needed\n        # But maybe there's a better way\n\n        # Let's think: the existing numbers may have 1, 2, or 3 elements\n        # Since we have 3 tiles, but grouped by suit, the numbers in this group can be 1, 2, or 3 elements\n        # For example, if the suit group has 2 numbers, like [1, 2], then need to add 3\n        # If the suit group has 2 numbers like [1, 3], need to add 2\n        # If the suit group has 2 numbers like [2, 3], need to add 1 or 4\n        # For the case of 2 numbers, the minimal is 1\n        # For the case of 1 number, need to add two more numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3)\n\n        # So let's handle based on the length of the numbers in the suit group\n        n = len(numbers)\n        if n == 3:\n            # Already checked earlier, so not a sequence\n            # So need to check if they can be extended\n            pass\n        elif n == 2:\n            a, b = sorted_numbers\n            # Need to find the minimal tiles to add\n            # Possible sequences: a, a+1, a+2;
