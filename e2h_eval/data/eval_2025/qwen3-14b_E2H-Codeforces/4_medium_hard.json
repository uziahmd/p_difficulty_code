The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then, determine who wins, and increment their respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach here.\n\nSo the key is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, so that we can calculate the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, then add the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think about how the moves are determined. For Nikephoros, his moves are cyclic through his sequence A. So for round i (assuming zero-based?), his move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, his move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each round from 0 to n-1, compute the moves of both players, determine who wins, and count the losses. But with n up to 2e9, we can't do this for each round.\n\nSo we need to find out how many times each possible pair of moves (a, b) occurs over the n rounds, and then compute for each such pair how many times it contributes to each player's loss count.\n\nBut how to compute the number of occurrences of each (a, b) pair?\n\nAlternatively, since the sequences are periodic, the combined sequence of moves for both players will have a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let me think: the LCM of m and k is the smallest number L where both m and k divide L. So after L rounds, the pattern of moves for both players repeats. So the entire sequence of (A's move, B's move) pairs will repeat every L rounds.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it L. Let's say L = lcm(m, k).\n\n2. For the first L rounds, we can simulate all the rounds and count how many times each player loses in this period. Let's call these counts per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_pol.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles in n rounds is total_cycles = n // L. The remaining rounds are rem = n % L.\n\n4. So the total losses would be total_cycles * per_cycle_nik + losses_in_remaining_rounds.\n\nBut wait, what if L is larger than n? Then, there are zero full cycles, and we just process the first n rounds. So the approach is valid regardless.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute L = LCM(m, k). But how to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need to compute GCD first.\n\nBut how to compute GCD? Well, Python's math module has gcd, but note that for Python versions before 3.5, it's in fractions, but assuming that the code is written for Python 3.5+.\n\nWait, but for Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists, but returns the absolute value. However, since m and k are positive integers, it's okay.\n\nSo once we have L, then for each of the L rounds, we can compute the moves for both players, check who wins, and accumulate the counts for each cycle.\n\nThen, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // L. The remaining rounds is rem = n % L.\n\nSo the total losses for Nikephoros is total_cycles * per_cycle_nik + count_remaining_nik, and same for Polycarpus.\n\nNow, the problem becomes how to compute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_pol, and the count_remaining for the rem rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the per_cycle counts?\n\nFor each of the L rounds (from 0 to L-1), we can compute the move of A and B, then determine who wins, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut L could be up to m*k. Since m and k are up to 1000, L can be up to 1e6. Which is acceptable, because 1e6 is manageable even for 2e9.\n\nSo for example, m=1000 and k=1000, then LCM is 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k).\n\nSimulate each of the L rounds, compute the moves, and count how many times each player loses in this cycle.\n\nThen, multiply by the number of full cycles (total_cycles = n // L), and then simulate the remaining rem rounds (rem = n % L) and add those counts.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_pol by simulating L rounds.\n\nThen compute total_cycles = n // L, rem = n % L.\n\nThen simulate the first rem rounds, count how many times each loses, and add to the total.\n\nBut how to simulate the rounds for the L rounds and the rem rounds?\n\nFor each round i (from 0 to L-1):\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine who wins.\n\nSimilarly for the rem rounds, for i in 0..rem-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m], etc.\n\nSo the code can have a helper function that, given a number of rounds, returns the counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nWait, but for the per_cycle counts, it's for L rounds. For the rem rounds, it's for rem rounds.\n\nSo, the helper function could be something like:\n\ndef count_losses(num_rounds):\n\n    nik = 0\n\n    pol = 0\n\n    for i in range(num_rounds):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        # determine outcome\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n            pol +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n\n            nik +=1\n\n    return nik, pol\n\nBut for num_rounds up to 1e6, this is acceptable. Because 1e6 iterations are manageable in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, the code would run in O(L) time, which is acceptable as L is up to 1e6.\n\nSo the overall steps are:\n\nCalculate total_cycles and rem.\n\nCompute per_cycle_nik, per_cycle_pol = count_losses(L)\n\ntotal_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n\ntotal_pol = total_cycles * per_cycle_pol\n\nThen, add the counts from rem rounds:\n\nrem_nik, rem_pol = count_losses(rem)\n\ntotal_nik += rem_nik\n\ntotal_pol += rem_pol\n\nThen output total_nik and total_pol.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, let's test this approach.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo for 12 rounds, simulate each.\n\nBut the sample has n=7 rounds. So total_cycles is 7//12=0, rem=7.\n\nSo simulate 7 rounds.\n\nWhich is what the sample does.\n\nSo the code would correctly compute the counts.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nThe second input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). LCM(8, 1) is 8.\n\nn=5, so total_cycles is 5//8=0, rem=5. So simulate 5 rounds.\n\nIn each round, A's move is R (since 0%8=0, 1%8=1, etc. but for 0-4, all are R. B's move is R each time. So all draws. So output is 0 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut first, need to compute LCM.\n\nImplementing LCM in Python.\n\nFirst, compute GCD.\n\nPython's math.gcd function returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers. However, note that in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists, but for negative numbers, it returns the absolute value. But since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nSo:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to import math.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute L = lcm(m, k).\n\nCompute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_pol by simulating L rounds.\n\nThen compute total_cycles = n // L, rem = n % L.\n\nCompute the rem rounds and add.\n\nBut for the case where L is 0? No, m and k are at least 1, so LCM is at least 1.\n\nNow, implement the count_losses function.\n\nBut for large L (up to 1e6), the loop is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nBut for the code, the helper function can be written inline.\n\nBut in Python, for loops are manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nlcm_val = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\ndef count_losses(num_rounds):\n\n    nik = 0\n\n    pol = 0\n\n    for i in range(num_rounds):\n\n        a_idx = i % m\n\n        b_idx = i % k\n\n        a = A[a_idx]\n\n        b = B[b_idx]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        # determine winner\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (pol +=1)\n\n            pol +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot (nik +=1)\n\n            nik +=1\n\n    return nik, pol\n\nper_cycle_nik, per_cycle_pol = count_losses(lcm_val)\n\ntotal_cycles = n // lcm_val\n\nrem = n % lcm_val\n\nrem_nik, rem_pol = count_losses(rem)\n\ntotal_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik + rem_nik\n\ntotal_pol = total_cycles * per_cycle_pol + rem_pol\n\nprint(total_nik, total_pol)\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, let's see:\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=7\n\nA is RPS (m=3)\n\nB is RSPP (k=4)\n\nlcm(3,4)=12.\n\ncount_losses(12) would compute the number of losses in 12 rounds.\n\nBut for the sample, the first 7 rounds are considered. So in the code, rem is 7, and count_losses(7) is called.\n\nBut let's see what the code does.\n\nBut let's test the code for the first sample.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7\n\nA is RPS (so indexes 0: R, 1: P, 2:S)\n\nB is RSPP (indexes 0: R, 1:S, 2:P, 3:P).\n\nFor each round from 0 to 6 (7 rounds):\n\ni=0:\n\na_idx=0%3=0 → R\n\nb_idx=0%4=0 → R → draw. No loss.\n\ni=1:\n\na_idx=1%3=1 → P\n\nb_idx=1%4=1 → S → P vs S. S beats P. So Nikephoros loses (since B's move is S, which beats A's P. So Nikephoros loses. So nik +=1?\n\nWait, the code checks:\n\nif (a is R and b is S) → Nikephoros wins. Else if (a is S and b is P) → Nikephoros wins. Or (a is P and b is R) → Nikephoros wins. Else, Polycarpus wins.\n\nSo for a=P, b=S: the condition is (a is P and b is R)? No. So else clause.\n\nSo for a=P and b=S: what's the outcome?\n\nP is paper, S is scissors. Scissors beats paper. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So code adds 1 to nik.\n\nYes, in the sample explanation, in the second round (i=1?), the first round is 0, then i=1 is round 2? Wait the sample explanation says:\n\nRound 1: R-R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (so his count increases by 1)\n\nBut according to the code, in i=1, which is the second round (assuming rounds start at 0?), the code would have a=P, b=S. Which is a loss for Nikephoros. So yes.\n\nIn the sample explanation, Nikephoros has 3 losses. Let's see.\n\nBut according to the code, the count for rem=7 rounds would be:\n\nLet me simulate the 7 rounds.\n\nRound 0:\n\nA: R (i=0 mod 3=0), B: R (i=0 mod4=0). Draw.\n\nRound 1:\n\nA: P (i=1 mod3=1), B: S (i=1 mod4=1). S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. nik +=1.\n\nRound 2:\n\ni=2: a is S (i=2 mod3=2), B is i=2 mod4=2 → P. S vs P. S beats P. Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus loses. pol +=1.\n\nRound 3: i=3. a is 3 mod3=0 → R. B is 3 mod4=3 → P. R vs P. P beats R. So Nikephoros loses. nik +=1.\n\nRound 4: i=4. a is 4 mod3=1 → P. B is 4 mod4=0 → R. P vs R. P beats R. Nikephoros wins. pol +=1.\n\nRound 5: i=5. a is 5 mod3=2 → S. B is 5 mod4=1 → S. Draw. No change.\n\nRound 6: i=6. a is 6 mod3=0 → R. B is 6 mod4=2 → P. R vs P. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. nik +=1.\n\nSo total nik is 3 (rounds 1,3,6). pol is 2 (rounds 2,4). Which matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nSo the code would return for rem=7, nik=3, pol=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when n is larger than the LCM?\n\nLet's say n is 12 + 7 = 19. Then total_cycles = 1 (19//12=1), rem=7. So the code would calculate 1* per_cycle_nik + rem_nik.\n\nBut per_cycle_nik is the number of losses in 12 rounds. Let's imagine that in 12 rounds, the counts are x and y. Then for 19 rounds, it's x + counts for 7 rounds.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where m or k is 0? But according to the input constraints, m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling very large LCM values. For example, m=1000, k=1000. LCM is 1e6. So the code would simulate 1e6 rounds. Which is acceptable in Python. Because 1e6 iterations are manageable.\n\nBut what if m and k are 1000 each, and n is 2e9? Then LCM is 1e6, total_cycles is 2e9 // 1e6 = 2000, and rem is 0. So the code would run 1e6 steps once, then multiply by 2000. Which is manageable.\n\nSo the code is efficient enough.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut in Python, for the input, the second line is the sequence A, and third line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut in the actual code, the input is read via input() functions. So the code should read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is 7, then the next line is RPS, then the third line is RSPP.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nlcm_val = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\ndef count_losses(num_rounds):\n    nik = 0\n    pol = 0\n    for i in range(num_rounds):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a = A[a_idx]\n        b = B[b_idx]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            pol += 1\n        else:\n            nik += 1\n    return nik, pol\n\nper_cycle_nik, per_cycle_pol = count_losses(lcm_val)\ntotal_cycles = n // lcm_val\nrem = n % lcm_val\n\nrem_nik, rem_pol = count_losses(rem)\n\ntotal_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik + rem_nik\ntotal_pol = total_cycles * per_cycle_pol + rem_pol\n\nprint(total_nik, total_pol)\n\nWait, but what if lcm_val is zero? Well, m and k are at least 1, so lcm_val is at least 1.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nlcm_val = 12.\n\ncount_losses(12) would compute for 12 rounds. But the code doesn't need to process that for the sample, since rem is 7.\n\nBut the code works.\n\nAnother sample: the second input in the example is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is length 8, B is length 1. LCM(8,1)=8. n=5. So rem is 5. count_losses(5) would process 5 rounds. All A's moves are R, B's moves are R. So no losses. Output 0 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly the LCM. For example, n=12. Then rem is 0. So the code would compute total_cycles=1, rem=0. So the code would add 0.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where all rounds are draws. For example, A and B are same sequences. Then output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: A is \"R\", B is \"S\". So for each round, A's move is R, B's is S. So Nikephoros wins. So for n rounds, Polycarpus has n losses, Nikephoros 0.\n\nSo code would compute for lcm(1,1)=1. count_losses(1) returns (0, 1). So total_cycles = n//1 =n, rem=0. So total is n*0 + 0 = 0 for nik, and n*1 + 0 =n for pol.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: A is \"R\", B is \"P\". So for each round, B's move is P. So A's R loses to P. So Nikephoros loses. So for n rounds, nik has n losses, pol 0.\n\nSo code would compute for lcm(1,1)=1. count_losses(1) returns (1, 0). So total_cycles =n, etc.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible due to the potentially enormous number of rounds, so we use a more efficient approach based on cycle detection and mathematical properties.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Cycle Detection**: Since both players use cyclic sequences, the combined sequence of moves repeats every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their respective sequences. This LCM value determines the period after which the move pairs repeat.\n2. **Precompute Losses in One Cycle**: Calculate the number of losses for each player over one full cycle of the combined sequence.\n3. **Scale Up Using Full Cycles**: Determine how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds and compute the losses for these full cycles.\n4. **Handle Remaining Rounds**: After accounting for full cycles, handle any remaining rounds that do not complete another full cycle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nlcm_val = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\ndef count_losses(num_rounds):\n    nik = 0\n    pol = 0\n    for i in range(num_rounds):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a = A[a_idx]\n        b = B[b_idx]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            pol += 1\n        else:\n            nik += 1\n    return nik, pol\n\nper_cycle_nik, per_cycle_pol = count_losses(lcm_val)\ntotal_cycles = n // lcm_val\nrem = n % lcm_val\n\nrem_nik, rem_pol = count_losses(rem)\n\ntotal_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik + rem_nik\ntotal_pol = total_cycles * per_cycle_pol + rem_pol\n\nprint(total_nik, total_pol)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the move sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the period after which the move pairs repeat.\n3. **Counting Losses in One Cycle**: The function `count_losses` simulates one full cycle of moves and counts the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remaining Rounds**: By dividing the total number of rounds by the LCM, we determine the number of full cycles. The remaining rounds after these full cycles are handled separately to ensure accuracy.\n5. **Efficiency**: By leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, we avoid simulating each round individually, thus reducing the complexity from O(n) to O(LCM(m, k)), which is feasible given the constraints.",
