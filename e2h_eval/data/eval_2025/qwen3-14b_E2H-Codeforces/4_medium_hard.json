The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then determine who wins, and increment their loss count accordingly.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, so we can compute the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, then add the remainder.\n\nLet me think about how the moves are generated. For Nikephoros, his moves are A repeated cyclically. Similarly for Polycarpus with B. So for round i, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for B, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for each round i (from 0 to n-1) what the moves are, and then determining who wins. But with n up to 2e9, we can't check each round individually.\n\nSo we need to find out how many times each possible pair of moves (a, b) occurs in the n rounds, and then compute for each such pair whether it's a win for Nikephoros, a win for Polycarpus, or a draw.\n\nBut how do we calculate the number of times each (a, b) pair occurs?\n\nThe sequences of A and B are periodic. The combined sequence of (A, B) will have a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = T. So every T rounds, the pattern of (A, B) pairs repeats.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n- Compute T = LCM(m, k). \n\n- For each of the T rounds in one full cycle, compute how many times each (a, b) pair occurs. Then, calculate how many full cycles there are in n rounds, and the remainder rounds.\n\n- Multiply the counts per cycle by the number of full cycles, then add the counts from the remaining rounds.\n\nSo first, compute how many full cycles and the remainder:\n\ntotal_cycles = n // T\n\nremainder = n % T\n\nThen, for each of the T rounds, we can precompute the outcome (whether Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus wins, or draw). Then, for each full cycle, we can accumulate the total number of losses for each player.\n\nBut how to compute the number of times each (a, b) pair occurs in the T rounds? Well, since each round in the T rounds is unique (because T is the LCM), each (a, b) pair is determined once per T rounds. So for each of the T rounds, we can compute the move of A and B, check the outcome, and accumulate the counts for that cycle.\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, multiply by total_cycles, and then process the first 'remainder' rounds of the next cycle.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n2. Compute T = LCM(m, k). Since m and k can be up to 1000, their LCM can be up to 1e6 (since 1000 * 1000 is 1e6, but LCM could be less if there are common factors).\n\n3. For each of the T rounds, determine the moves of A and B. For example, for round i in 0..T-1:\n\n   a_i = A[i % m]\n\n   b_i = B[i % k]\n\n   Then determine the outcome between a_i and b_i.\n\n4. For each outcome, count how many times Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus gains a spot), and how many times Polycarpus loses (Nikephoros gains a spot). Also, count draws.\n\nBut for the full cycles, we can compute the total number of losses per cycle, then multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remainder, process the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute for each of the T rounds, the outcome. Then:\n\nfull_cycles = n // T\n\nremaining_rounds = n % T\n\ntotal_nik = 0\n\ntotal_poly = 0\n\nfor each of the T rounds:\n\n   add the outcome to the per-cycle counts.\n\nthen:\n\ntotal_nik += full_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n\ntotal_poly += full_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n\nthen process the first remaining_rounds rounds in the cycle, adding their outcomes.\n\nSo the problem is manageable because T can be up to 1e6 (if m and k are 1000 each, and coprime). For each T, processing all rounds is O(T), which is acceptable since T is up to 1e6, and 1e6 is manageable even for Python.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the LCM of m and k. To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So first compute GCD of m and k.\n\nSo, how to compute GCD in Python? Well, we can use math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nBut wait, for Python versions, but assuming that the code is written in Python 3.5+.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A as a string.\n\nRead B as a string.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to T-1:\n\n   a = A[i % m]\n\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n   determine the outcome between a and b.\n\n   if a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so total_poly += 1)\n\n   elif b beats a: then Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot (total_nik += 1)\n\n   else: draw, nothing.\n\nOnce we have per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly, multiply by full_cycles.\n\nThen, process the first remaining_rounds rounds (i from 0 to remaining_rounds - 1) and add their outcomes.\n\nSo, the main part is to compute for each pair (a, b) who wins.\n\nHow to determine the winner?\n\nWe can have a helper function, or a lookup table. Let's think:\n\nFor two moves, a and b:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a, b) is (R, S) or (S, P) or (P, R): then a beats b. So Nikephoros wins.\n\nElse, if (a, b) is (S, R) or (P, S) or (R, P): then b beats a. So Polycarpus wins.\n\nSo for example, if a is R and b is S: Nikephoros wins. If a is S and b is R: Polycarpus wins.\n\nSo, perhaps we can create a function that returns 0 for draw, 1 for Nikephoros wins, -1 for Polycarpus wins.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair (a, b), check the conditions.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n\nSo, in the code, for each pair, we check this.\n\nSo, during the per-cycle processing, for each i in 0 to T-1, compute a and b, get the result, and accumulate per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\nWait, no. For each round, if the result is 1, that means Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. So in that case, total_poly += 1. If the result is -1, then Nikephoros loses, so total_nik += 1. If 0, nothing.\n\nSo, in the per_cycle processing, for each of the T rounds, we can accumulate the number of times Nikephoros loses (which contributes to total_nik) and the number of times Polycarpus loses (contributes to total_poly).\n\nSo for each round in the cycle, we can compute:\n\nif result is 1: Polycarpus gets a spot (so per_cycle_poly += 1)\n\nif result is -1: Nikephoros gets a spot (per_cycle_nik += 1)\n\nelse: nothing.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nper_cycle_nik = 0\n\nper_cycle_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(T):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    res = get_result(a, b)\n\n    if res == 1:\n\n        per_cycle_poly += 1\n\n    elif res == -1:\n\n        per_cycle_nik += 1\n\nOnce that is done, then for full_cycles, multiply per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly by full_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds (remaining_rounds), process each of the first remaining_rounds rounds in the same way, adding to total_nik and total_poly.\n\nSo the overall code would be:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute m, k.\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute per_cycle_nik, per_cycle_poly.\n\nfull_cycles = n // T\n\nremaining = n % T\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n\nThen, for i in 0 to remaining - 1:\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    res = get_result(a, b)\n\n    if res == 1:\n\n        total_poly += 1\n\n    elif res == -1:\n\n        total_nik += 1\n\nThen output total_nik and total_poly.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute LCM(m, k). Let's code that.\n\nIn Python, math.gcd is available. So:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to handle when a or b is zero? But since m and k are at least 1, per the input constraints (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000), so no problem.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3. B is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12. So T=12.\n\nThen for each of 12 rounds, compute the moves and outcomes.\n\nBut let's see the example. The first sample's rounds are 7, which is less than 12, so full_cycles is 0, remaining is 7. So we process the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the example explanation:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (because S beats P? Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nRound 1: R-R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S. So Nikephoros's move is P (second round?), but let me check the example's note.\n\nWait the note says:\n\nIn the first sample the game went like this:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses. Wait, how?\n\nWait, Nikephoros's move is P, Polycarpus's move is S. So S beats P? Because S cuts P. So in that case, Polycarpus wins. So Nikephoros loses. So that would mean that the result is -1 (Polycarpus wins), so Nikephoros gets a spot. So total_nik increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the sample output, Nikephoros has 3 losses. Let's see.\n\nBut according to the note, the first sample's output is 3 2. So Nikephoros has 3 losses (so total_nik is 3), Polycarpus has 2 (total_poly is 2).\n\nLet me check the example's rounds:\n\nThe note says:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses. So that's a loss for Nikephoros (so total_nik +=1).\n\nRound 3: S vs P → Polycarpus loses. So total_poly +=1.\n\nRound 4: R vs P → Nikephoros loses (P beats R). So total_nik +=1.\n\nRound 5: P vs R → Polycarpus loses. total_poly +=1.\n\nRound 6: S vs S → draw.\n\nRound 7: R vs P → Nikephoros loses. total_nik +=1.\n\nSo total_nik is 3 (rounds 2,4,7), total_poly is 2 (rounds 3,5).\n\nSo the code should compute that.\n\nNow, let's see what the code would do for the first sample.\n\nn=7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4). T=12.\n\nfull_cycles = 7//12 = 0. remaining=7.\n\nSo for i from 0 to 6 (7 rounds):\n\ni=0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. No change.\n\ni=1: A[1%3]=P, B[1%4]=S → P vs S. S beats P. So result is -1 → Nikephoros loses. total_nik +=1.\n\ni=2: A[2%3]=S, B[2%4]=P → S vs P. S beats P? Wait, S (scissors) beats P (paper). So Nikephoros wins. So result is 1 → Polycarpus gets a spot. total_poly +=1.\n\ni=3: A[3%3=0] → R, B[3%4=3 → P. R vs P → P beats R. So Nikephoros loses. total_nik +=1.\n\ni=4: A[4%3=1 → P, B[4%4=0 → R. P vs R. P beats R. Nikephoros wins. So result is 1 → total_poly +=1.\n\ni=5: A[5%3=2 → S, B[5%4=1 → S. S vs S → draw.\n\ni=6: A[6%3=0 → R, B[6%4=2 → P. R vs P → Nikephoros loses. total_nik +=1.\n\nSo after 7 rounds, total_nik is 3 (from i=1,3,6) and total_poly is 2 (i=2,4). Which matches the sample. So code works.\n\nAnother sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nBecause all rounds are R vs R. All draws. So no one loses. So output 0 0.\n\nSo the code would compute m=8, k=1. LCM(8,1)=8. For each of 8 rounds, all are R vs R. So per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly are 0. Then n=5, full_cycles is 0, remaining 5. Process 5 rounds, all draws. So output 0 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if n is 0? But according to the problem statement, n ≥ 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when one sequence is longer than the other, but their LCM is large.\n\nNow, considering that T can be up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nIn Python, the code needs to read the input. However, the input format is a bit tricky. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A as a string.\n\nThird line contains sequence B as a string.\n\nBut in the example input given in the problem, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWhich is probably a mistake in the problem statement. But the actual input is three lines: first line is n, second is A, third is B.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input would be:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo the code needs to read those three lines.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the LCM function, then compute T.\n\nThen process the T rounds for the per_cycle counts.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so total_poly +=1)\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot (total_nik +=1)\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    T = lcm(m, k)\n\n    per_cycle_nik = 0\n\n    per_cycle_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(T):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        res = get_result(a, b)\n\n        if res == 1:\n\n            per_cycle_poly +=1\n\n        elif res == -1:\n\n            per_cycle_nik +=1\n\n    full_cycles = n // T\n\n    remaining = n % T\n\n    total_nik = full_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n\n    total_poly = full_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n\n    # process remaining rounds\n\n    for i in range(remaining):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        res = get_result(a, b)\n\n        if res == 1:\n\n            total_poly +=1\n\n        elif res == -1:\n\n            total_nik +=1\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first sample's code would generate T=12, and for the first 7 rounds, which is the remaining part.\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input.\n\nAnother possible test case: when n is exactly T.\n\nBut the code would process full_cycles = 1, remaining 0. So the code would add the per_cycle counts once.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The code uses 0-based indexes for the rounds. For example, for i in 0 to T-1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother possible problem is when T is larger than n. For example, when n is smaller than T. Then full_cycles is 0, and remaining is n. Which is handled.\n\nNow, what about when T is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, so T is at least 1.\n\nNow, testing the code with the first sample:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich gives:\n\nm=3, k=4. T=12.\n\nper_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly are calculated for 12 rounds. But in the sample, the code processes the first 7 rounds (remaining=7). Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the time constraints? For T up to 1e6, and each loop is O(T), then for 1e6, it's acceptable. For Python, 1e6 iterations are acceptable.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, but the code handles it with O(T) steps.\n\nSo, the code should pass all test cases.\n\nAnother test case: when A is \"R\" and B is \"S\". Then for each round, Nikephoros plays R, Polycarpus plays S. So R vs S: Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So for n=1, output is 0 1.\n\nAnother example: A is \"R\", B is \"P\". Then each round, R vs P. P beats R. So Nikephoros loses. So output is 1 0 for n=1.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nSo, I think this code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after they play rock-paper-scissors for `n` rounds using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when `n` is very large (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds.\n2. **Finding the LCM**: The combined sequence of moves will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`, denoted as `T`. This allows us to break down the problem into cycles of length `T`.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each cycle of length `T`, we determine how many times each player loses. This is done once and then multiplied by the number of full cycles in `n` rounds.\n4. **Remaining Rounds**: After accounting for full cycles, we handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n    else:\n        return -1  # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_cycle_nik = 0\n    per_cycle_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a, b)\n        if res == 1:\n            per_cycle_poly += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            per_cycle_nik += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remaining = n % T\n    \n    total_nik = full_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n    total_poly = full_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n    \n    for i in range(remaining):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a, b)\n        if res == 1:\n            total_poly += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values for the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus are read.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the cycle length `T`.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round in the cycle of length `T`, we determine the outcome of each round and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles Handling**: The number of full cycles in `n` rounds is calculated, and the results from one cycle are multiplied by the number of full cycles.\n5. **Remaining Rounds Handling**: Any remaining rounds after full cycles are processed individually to account for the final partial cycle.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, reducing the problem complexity significantly.",
