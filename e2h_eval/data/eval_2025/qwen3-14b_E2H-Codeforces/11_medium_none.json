    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs:\n\nThe input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires per friend: nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nThen, the number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made before that resource runs out. Then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast takes n * nl ml. So the maximum toasts possible from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, if it's not divisible, we take the floor.\n\nFor lime slices: total_slices = c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So max toasts from limes is total_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So max toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20//9 is 2 (since 2*9=18, 3*9=27>20). So that gives 2.\n\nLimes: 10 *8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80//3 is 26 (since 3*26=78, 3*27=81>80). Wait but in the note, they said the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but according to my calculation, each toast requires n slices. So for 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement. The note says:\n\nIn the first sample: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nAh! Wait the problem says that each friend needs a slice of lime per toast. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. So for the first sample, n=3, so per toast, 3 slices. So total slices is 10 * 8 = 80. So 80 / 3 = 26.666, which would be 26 toasts. But according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's a contradiction. Which means I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the note says:\n\nIn the first sample: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, the limes are cut into d slices each. So for the first sample, c=10 limes, d=8 slices per lime. So total slices is 10*8=80. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices. So for the first sample, n=3 friends. So 3 slices per toast. So 80 slices would allow 80//3 = 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So there's a mistake here. What's wrong?\n\nWait looking back at the note:\n\nThe note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, the sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So the numbers are n=3, c=10, d=8. So total slices is 10 * 8 = 80. The note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that each toast requires 1 slice. But that would be if each toast requires one slice per friend? Or perhaps I have the problem statement wrong.\n\nWait the problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for the first sample, 3 slices per toast. Then 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26 toasts. But according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that the per toast is 1 slice. So maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice in total, not per friend. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So total slices per toast is n. So the note's explanation must have an error? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the note.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100/1=100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\"\n\nWait why is the limes enough for 80 toasts? Because the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires n slices. So why is that number 80?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is considering that each toast requires one slice per friend. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So 80 toasts would require 80 * n slices. Let's see for the first sample: n=3. 80 * 3 = 240 slices. But the total slices is 80. So that's impossible. Therefore, there's something wrong here.\n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How can that be?\n\nLet me re-examine the note's explanation. The note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3 equals 2. So that suggests that the initial numbers are 6 toasts from drink, 80 from limes, 100 from salt. Then divide by 3? But that doesn't make sense. Wait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. But why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the numbers in the note are not the number of toasts possible, but the total number of toasts that can be made per friend. Wait no. Let me think again.\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. But that would mean that the initial numbers are the total number of toasts that can be made, but then divided by the number of friends. That doesn't make sense. Because the answer is the number of toasts per friend. So for example, if the total number of toasts is 6, then each friend can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts. But how?\n\nWait maybe the note is wrong. Or perhaps the problem is that the initial numbers are the total number of toasts that can be made, but the answer is the number of toasts per friend. So for example, the total number of toasts possible is the minimum between the three resources. Then, since each toast requires all friends to participate, the number of toasts per friend is that total divided by n? But that would only make sense if the total number of toasts is the same as the number of toasts per friend multiplied by n. But that's not the case.\n\nWait no. Let me think again. Let's say that each toast is made by all friends. So if they make t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So the total amount of drink required is t * n * nl. Because each toast requires each friend to have nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend has t * nl, and total for all friends is t * n * nl.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum t such that:\n\nt * n * nl <= total_drink (k*l)\n\nt * n <= total_slices (c*d)\n\nt * n * np <= total_salt (p)\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of:\n\n(total_drink) // (n * nl),\n\n(total_slices) // n,\n\n(total_salt) // (n * np)\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink = 4 * 5 = 20. n * nl = 3 * 3 =9. 20//9 = 2 (since 2*9=18, 3*9=27>20). So that gives 2.\n\ntotal_slices is 10 * 8 = 80. divided by n (3) is 80//3=26. So that gives 26.\n\ntotal_salt is 100 / (3 * 1) = 33.333, so 33.\n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. So answer is 2. Which matches the sample output. But according to the note, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to this calculation, the limes are enough for 26 toasts. So the note's explanation seems to be wrong. But why?\n\nAh, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But perhaps the note is wrong. Or perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait this suggests that the note is calculating the total toasts possible as 6, 80, 100. But according to the problem statement, that's not correct. Because the drink allows for 20/(3) = 6.333... toasts. But that's not the correct way to calculate it. Because the drink is used per toast as n * nl. So for each toast, the drink needed is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But according to the note's calculation, it's 20/3 =6. Which suggests that the note is considering that per toast, each friend needs nl ml, but the total per toast is nl, not n * nl. Which would be wrong. So this indicates that the note is wrong, but that's impossible. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is correct, but I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. That would imply that for one toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl = 1. But in the sample input, nl is 3. So that's impossible.\n\nThis suggests that the note's explanation is incorrect. But that's unlikely. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement once more.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs their own nl ml. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl ml. So the note's explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. But that would be if each toast requires 3 ml (nl=1?), but in the sample input, nl is 3. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait sample input is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1' — the parameters are n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the drink is 4*5=20 ml. For each toast, each of the 3 friends needs 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 *3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. Which is the correct answer. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be if per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be if each toast requires nl=1 ml per friend. But in the sample input, nl is 3. So why does the note say that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait maybe the note is wrong. Or perhaps the note is referring to the number of toasts that each friend can make. Like, if each friend can make 6 toasts, but since there are three friends, the total toasts is 6? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So the total for all friends is n * nl per toast. So the total drink is k*l. So the maximum number of toasts is (k*l) // (n * nl). But in the note, the sample says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the total per toast is 3 ml (n * nl = 3 * 1). But in this case, nl is 3. So that's not matching.\n\nWait maybe the note is talking about the number of toasts per friend. For example, if the total toasts is 6, then each friend makes 6 toasts. But that would require that the drink is 6 * nl * n. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nIf each friend makes t toasts, then for each toast, they need nl ml. So per friend, total drink is t * nl. For all friends, it's n * t * nl. Which equals the same as the total drink needed for t toasts (each toast requiring n * nl ml). So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). Which is the same as (total_drink) // (n * nl). \n\nSo the note's explanation is wrong. Or maybe the note is correct and I'm making a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but that's the total number of toasts that can be made by all friends. But then, since each toast requires all friends to participate, the number of toasts per friend is 6 / 3 = 2. Which matches the sample output. So that would be the case. So the note is saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts (total), the limes are enough for 80 toasts (total), and the salt for 100 toasts (total). Then, since each toast is made by all friends, the number of toasts per friend is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nAh! That makes sense. So the note's explanation is correct. But how?\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum number of toasts that can be made in total, and then divide that by the number of friends, because each toast requires all friends to participate. Wait no, because each toast is made by all friends. So the number of toasts that can be made is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the answer is t. But how to compute t?\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nt * n * nl ≤ total_drink\n\nt * n ≤ total_slices\n\nt * n * np ≤ total_salt\n\nSo t is the minimum of (total_drink // (n * nl)), (total_slices // n), (total_salt // (n * np)).\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink is 20. n * nl is 3 * 3 =9. 20//9 = 2. So t can be 2. \n\ntotal_slices is 80. n is 3. 80//3 is 26. So t can be 26.\n\nsalt is 100. n * np is 3 * 1 =3. 100//3 is 33. So t can be 33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2, which is the answer. So the answer is 2.\n\nBut the note says that the drink allows 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the total_drink was 20, and the per toast is 3 ml. Which would be if n * nl was 3 ml. Which would be if n=1, nl=3. But in the first sample, n=3. So why does the note say that the drink allows for 6 toasts?\n\nAh! The note is wrong. Or perhaps the note is using a different approach. Let me check the note's explanation again:\n\nThe note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. But 20/3 is 6.666, so 6 toasts. But that would be if each toast requires 3 ml of drink. Which would be if per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be if n=1, or nl=1.\n\nBut in the first sample, n=3, and nl=3. So per toast, the total drink is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. Which is correct.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be if the per toast is 3 ml. So why does the note say that?\n\nMaybe the note is wrong. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is considering the total number of toasts that each friend can make individually. For example, if each friend can make t toasts, then the total drink needed is n * t * nl. So the maximum t is (k*l) / (n * nl). Which is the same as before. So the note's explanation must be wrong.\n\nBut given that the sample output is correct, the code should follow the logic that t is the minimum of the three values computed as (total_drink // (n * nl)), (total_slices // n), (total_salt // (n * np)).\n\nSo in the first sample, the answer is min(2, 26, 33) = 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntoast_slices = total_slices // n\n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_slices, toast_salt)\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntoast_slices = total_slices // n\n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nans = min(toast_drink, toast_slices, toast_salt)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nLet me check with the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\ntotal_drink = 4 *5 =20\n\nn * nl = 3 *3 =9 → 20//9 =2.\n\ntotal_slices =10*8=80 → 80//3 =26.\n\ntotal_salt =100 // (3 *1) = 33. So min(2, 26, 33) is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink = 100 *10=1000.\n\nnl=4. So n * nl =5 *4=20 → 1000//20=50.\n\ntotal_slices: c=1, d=19 → 1*19=19. divided by n=5 → 19//5=3.\n\ntotal_salt: p=90. n * np =5 *3=15. 90//15=6.\n\nmin(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1000 *1000 = 1e6.\n\nn * nl = 10 *50=500 → 1e6 // 500 = 2000.\n\ntotal_slices: 25 *23 = 575. divided by n=10 → 575//10=57.\n\ntotal_salt: p=1. n * np=10 *1=10 → 1//10=0.\n\nso min(2000,57,0) is 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to work for the samples. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. The input is a single line with the numbers. But looking at the example input, the first line shows that the input is a list of strings. Wait, the user provided the input as a list of strings, but in reality, the input is a single line. For example, the first example input is:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that's probably the test cases. But in the actual problem, the input is a single line. So the code should read a single line from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line contains positive integers ... So the code should read one line from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into integers, then process.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the variables as discussed.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the line, split into the 8 variables.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntoast_slices = total_slices // n\n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nans = min(toast_drink, toast_slices, toast_salt)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nBut what if division is zero? Well, since all inputs are at least 1, then for example, n * nl is at least 1*1=1. So division is safe.\n\nBut what if the division results in zero? For example, if the total_drink is less than n * nl. Then toast_drink is zero. Which would make the answer zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → outputs 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the Python code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The solution involves calculating how many toasts can be made based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the input values which include the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n   - **Total Salt**: Use the given grams of salt directly.\n3. **Toast Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available, considering each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total lime slices available, considering each toast requires a slice per friend.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available, considering each toast requires a specific amount of salt per friend.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value from the three constraints calculated above, as this determines the maximum number of toasts that can be made without exhausting any resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_slices = total_slices // n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_slices, toast_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into individual variables representing the problem parameters.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: The total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt are computed based on the given inputs.\n- **Toast Constraints Calculation**: Each resource's constraint on the number of toasts is calculated by dividing the total available resource by the amount required per toast for all friends.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum of the three constraints is taken to ensure that no resource is exhausted before others, thus determining the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of toasts by considering all constraints and using integer division to handle the resource limits accurately.",
