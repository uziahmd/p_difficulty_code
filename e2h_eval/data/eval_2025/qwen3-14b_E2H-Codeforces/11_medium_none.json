A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo the problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. I need to find the maximum number of toasts each can make.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (bottles of drink), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then nl (ml per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters of drink per toast. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml. Because each of them uses nl. Oh right, because for each toast, each friend has their own portion. So total drink per toast is n * nl.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend. So for one toast, n slices are needed. Because each of the n friends uses one slice. And the salt per toast is n * np grams, since each friend uses np grams.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the total available drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal available lime slices: c * d.\n\nSalt available: p grams.\n\nThen, for each resource, compute how many toasts can be made given that resource.\n\nFor drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast requires n * nl. So the number of toasts possible from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, if it's not divisible, we take the floor.\n\nFor lime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast needs n slices. So toasts from limes is total_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast needs n * np grams. So toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nWait, but the example given in the first case:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nLet me compute:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend? Wait, no. Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs nl=3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nLimes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (since n=3). 80//3 is 26.666... → 26? But in the sample explanation, they say 80 toasts. Wait, no. Wait the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the sample explanation says: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but according to my calculation, each toast requires n slices. So for n=3 friends, each toast needs 3 slices. So total slices is 80. So 80 /3 is 26.666, which would be 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, what's the problem statement again? \"each friend needs a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for example, if there are 3 friends, each toast needs 3 slices. So the total number of toasts possible from the lime slices is (c*d) // n. \n\nBut in the sample input, c is 10, d is 8. So 10*8=80 slices. Divided by n=3, gives 26.666, which would be 26. But according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait looking back at the sample explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, the explanation says:\n\nthe limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires a slice per friend. So for 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80/3 = 26.666 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps the problem statement is different. What's the correct way?\n\nWait the problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So the total number of toasts possible from the limes is (total_slices) // n. But in the sample explanation, they have 80 slices, and they say that it's enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that each toast requires 1 slice. That's conflicting. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh, so for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. Therefore, per toast, n slices are needed. So the total number of toasts possible from the lime slices is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the limes are 10 * 8 = 80 slices. For n=3, 80 // 3 is 26. But the sample explanation says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would only be possible if per toast, 1 slice is needed. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have misread the problem.\n\nWait the problem says: \"a slice of lime\". So perhaps each toast requires one slice per friend. Or maybe each toast requires one slice in total. Which is the correct interpretation?\n\nLooking at the sample explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me think. The sample says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Wait, but why is the limes giving 80 toasts?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nOverall the friends have 20ml of drink. Enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. (Because each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend? No, wait the drink per toast is n * nl. For the first sample, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait that's impossible. Wait what's going on here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait why is that 20 / 3? Because each toast requires 3 ml? But that would be if each toast requires 3 ml total. But according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for 3 friends, each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml. But according to the sample explanation, they are dividing 20 by 3, which suggests that per toast, 3 ml is needed. So there's a contradiction here. Which implies that I have misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, the total drink required is n * nl. But the sample explanation says that 20 ml is enough for 20 /3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. But in the first sample, nl is 3. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait the first sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, 3 friends × 3 ml = 9 ml. So total drink is 4×5=20. 20 / 9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How?\n\nThis suggests that I have completely misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. So for example, in the first sample, 3 friends, nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. 20 ml divided by 9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait why 20 divided by 3? That would be if each toast requires 3 ml of drink. But why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait maybe I have the problem backwards. Maybe each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, the total is nl * n? Or is it per toast per friend?\n\nWait the wording is: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml, and they have 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. That would mean that each toast requires 3 ml. Which would be if nl is 1 per friend. But in the first sample, nl is 3.\n\nSo this suggests that perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the sample explanation is using nl as per toast, not per friend. This is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, total is n * nl. But in the sample explanation, they are dividing total drink by nl, not by n * nl. Which would be wrong.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, they are doing 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that per toast, the drink required is 3 ml. Which would be if nl is 3 ml per toast for all friends combined. Which would be a different interpretation.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. How can I resolve this?\n\nLet me check the sample explanation again. The first sample input is:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSample explanation says:\n\nTotal drink is 4*5=20. Enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So why 20 divided by 3?\n\nIf each toast requires 3 ml of drink, then 20/3 is 6. So that would be possible if the per toast is 3 ml. But how does that relate to the parameters?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for one toast, the total is n * nl. But the sample explanation is saying that the drink is sufficient for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, 3 ml is needed. Which would be the case if nl is 1 ml per friend. But in the sample, nl is 3.\n\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have misread the problem statement.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, the total amount of drink required is n * nl.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is 20ml, and that's enough for 20 /3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if per toast, 3 ml is needed. Which would be if n * nl = 3. For example, if n is 3 and nl is 1, then 3 * 1 = 3. So 20 /3 is 6.666, which would be 6.\n\nBut in the sample input, n is 3, nl is 3. So n * nl is 9. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2. But the sample explanation says 6. So this indicates that perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters in total, not per friend. Which would be a different interpretation.\n\nThis is very confusing. How to resolve this?\n\nLet me look at the sample explanation again. It says:\n\nthe answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\n\nWait, the min of 6, 80, 100 is 6. Then divided by 3 gives 2. So why is the drink's possible toasts 6?\n\nIf the drink's possible toasts is 6, then that would be 20ml divided by (something) equals 6. So 20 / x =6 → x= 3.333... So that would mean that per toast, 3.333 ml is needed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for one toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So the total is n * nl. But the sample explanation says that the drink allows 6 toasts. So 20 / (n * nl) = 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222. But the sample says 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total number of toasts is calculated as (total drink) / (nl) / n. Wait that would be same as (total drink) / (n * nl). Which would be same as before.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, they have 20 / 3 = 6. Which is (total drink) / nl. So that would suggest that per toast, the total drink is nl. Which would be if per toast, each friend needs nl / n ml? That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, the total is nl ml. Which would be if nl is per toast, not per friend. But that doesn't make sense with the wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the actual requirement is that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the sample explanation is incorrect. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters for all friends combined. So for example, each toast requires nl ml total, not per friend. In that case, for the first sample, the drink is 20ml, and each toast requires 3 ml. So 20 /3 =6. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nBut that would contradict the problem statement's wording. So what is the correct interpretation?\n\nThe problem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So if there are n friends, then for one toast, the total drink is n * nl ml. \n\nBut the sample explanation suggests that the drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. So this is a contradiction. How to resolve this?\n\nPerhaps the problem statement has a mistake in the sample explanation. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the parameters.\n\nLet me look at the first sample input and output again.\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → output is 2.\n\nAccording to the sample explanation:\n\nDrink is 4 * 5 = 20 ml. Enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Then limes are enough for 80 toasts, salt for 100. The answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2.\n\nWait why divide by 3? Because there are 3 friends. So the total number of toasts is the minimum of the three resources, divided by the number of friends?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Wait the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3. But why?\n\nAh, perhaps the initial calculation for each resource is the maximum number of toasts possible, but each toast requires all friends to participate. So the total number of toasts possible is the minimum between the three resources. But why is the sample explanation dividing by 3?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Which would imply that the initial calculations are for something else. But why?\n\nLet me think again. If the friends want to make t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend needs some resources. So for the drink, the total required is t * n * nl. For the limes, it's t * n slices. For the salt, it's t * n * np.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nt * n * nl ≤ total_drink (k * l)\n\nt * n ≤ total_slices (c * d)\n\nt * n * np ≤ total_salt (p)\n\nWe need to find the maximum t such that all three inequalities are satisfied.\n\nSo solving for t:\n\nt ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nt ≤ (c*d) / n \n\nt ≤ p / (n * np)\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of the three values, taking the floor of each.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\nk*l = 20\n\nn * nl = 3 * 3 =9 → 20 /9 = 2.222 → 2.\n\nc*d = 10 *8 =80. divided by n=3 → 80/3 =26.666 → 26.\n\np is 100. n * np is 3 *1=3. 100 /3 =33.333 →33.\n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. So answer is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be if the drink constraint was 20 /3 =6. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Because the sample explanation is wrong? Or perhaps the sample explanation is referring to something else. Let me check the sample explanation again.\n\nThe sample explanation says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait this suggests that the initial calculation for the drink is 20 /3 =6 toasts. But according to our previous analysis, that would be if the drink required per toast is 3 ml. Which would be if the total per toast is 3 ml, not n * nl. Which would be the case if nl is 1 per toast. But in the sample, nl is 3. So why is the sample explanation dividing by 3 instead of by n * nl?\n\nThis suggests that the sample explanation is incorrect. But that's unlikely. So what is the correct way to interpret the problem?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is considering the total number of toasts that can be made, and then dividing by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So the initial numbers are 6, 80, 100. Which are the total number of toasts possible if each toast requires 3 ml of drink (for 6), 1 slice per toast (for 80), and 1 gram of salt per toast (for 100). Then, since there are 3 friends, the number of toasts per friend is the total divided by 3. But that would imply that the total number of toasts is the same for all friends. But this is not the case.\n\nThis suggests that the problem is not about the number of toasts per friend, but the total number of toasts, and then each friend makes that many. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nThe problem says: \"How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\nSo each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts is t per friend. So for the drink, the total required is t * n * nl. \n\nBut in the sample explanation, they are calculating for the drink 20 /3 =6, which would be t * n * nl = 6 * 3 * 3? No. Wait if t is 2, then 2 * 3 *3 = 18 ml. Which is less than 20. So that makes sense. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, which would be t=6, requiring 6 *3 *3 =54 ml, which is more than 20. So this is impossible.\n\nThus, the sample explanation must be wrong, or I'm missing something. But the sample output is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is not explaining the correct steps. For example, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong, but the correct approach is the one I derived earlier.\n\nLet me try to calculate the sample input using the approach I had before.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total drink is 4*5=20.\n\nnl=3 → per toast per friend, 3 ml.\n\nSo for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. Total drink required: 3 * t * 3 =9t. 9t ≤20 → t ≤ 2.222 → t=2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 → total slices 80. Each toast requires n=3 slices. So 3t ≤80 → t ≤ 26.666 →26.\n\nSalt: p=100, np=1. Salt required per toast is 3 * 1 * t =3t. 3t ≤100 → t ≤33.333 →33.\n\nMinimum of 2,26,33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. So this approach is correct.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, but the actual calculation is correct. So perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect, but the correct way is to calculate the three values as I did.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nthen the answer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts).\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\ndrink_toasts = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2.\n\nlime_toasts = 80//3 =26.\n\nsalt_toasts = 100 // (3*1) = 33.\n\nmin(2,26,33) is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the sample explanation is wrong? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the sample explanation.\n\nIn the sample explanation, they said that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the drink required per toast is 3 ml. Which would be if the per toast total is 3 ml. Which would be if nl is 1 per friend. But in the sample input, nl is 3. So the sample explanation is possibly wrong. But the actual calculation is as I did.\n\nSo the code should be written as follows:\n\nRead the input numbers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l.\n\ntotal_drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntotal_salt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(total_drink_toasts, total_lime_toasts, total_salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nNow let's check the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000.\n\nnl=4. So per toast, total drink is 5 *4 =20. So 1000//20 =50.\n\nLimes: c=1, d=19 → total slices 19. Divided by n=5 → 19//5=3.\n\nSalt: p=90. np=3. total salt per toast is 5*3=15. 90//15=6.\n\nmin(50,3,6) →3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink is 1,000,000.\n\nnl=50. Per toast, drink required is 10 *50 =500. 1e6 /500 = 2000.\n\nLimes: c=25, d=23 → total slices 25*23=575. Divided by 10 →57.5 →57.\n\nSalt: p=1. np=1. per toast: 10 *1 =10. 1//10 is 0.\n\nSo min(2000,57,0) →0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input line, split into integers, compute the above values.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlimes = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink, limes, salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut wait, what if any of the denominators are zero? But according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers. So no division by zero.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow let's test the first sample input:\n\nInput line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → drink is (4*5) // (3*3) → 20//9=2. limes: (10*8)//3 →80//3=26. salt: 100//(3*1)=33. min is 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code should read from stdin, process the input, and print the result.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The solution involves calculating how many toasts can be made based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available, the total number of lime slices available, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Toast Constraints**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available, considering each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total number of lime slices available, considering each toast requires `n` slices.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available, considering each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt.\n3. **Determine the Result**: The result is the minimum value among the constraints calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntoast_lime = total_lime // n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. This total is then divided by the amount of drink required per toast for all friends combined.\n- **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices available is calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime. This total is divided by the number of friends to determine how many toasts can be made with the available slices.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total amount of salt available is divided by the amount of salt required per toast for all friends combined.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the three calculated constraints (drink, lime slices, salt) gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all resources are sufficient for that number of toasts.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the constraints for each resource and ensures that the solution is optimal and meets all problem requirements.",
