He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that matches the assignments.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, with exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. And if there are multiple possibilities, any correct one is acceptable.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, the key idea is that for the correct string s, each of its prefixes and suffixes of length k (for 1<=k<=n-1) must be present in the input. But since the input has exactly two strings for each length, one of them is a prefix and the other a suffix (or vice versa?), but not necessarily. Wait, no: the input contains all the improper prefixes and suffixes. So for example, for a string s of length n, there are n-1 prefixes (length 1 to n-1) and n-1 suffixes (same lengths). So the input has exactly 2n-2 strings, which is the sum of those two.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as a list of these 2n-2 strings, but we don't know which are prefixes and which are suffixes. Our job is to assign each of them as P or S such that there exists a string s that has exactly the P's as its prefixes and S's as its suffixes.\n\nSo how can I find such an assignment?\n\nThe approach I think is to find a candidate string s, then check which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of s, and then assign accordingly. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment (as long as there exists at least one s that fits), perhaps we can find s by considering the possible candidates.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, for the correct s, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be present in the input. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be present. Also, the full string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and suffix. Wait, maybe not. For example, if the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1], then combining them would give us s[0] + s[1..n-1] = s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the correct s must have the following property: the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be in the input. But since the input has two strings of length n-1, one of them is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Then, the actual string s would be the combination of the prefix (of length n-1) plus the last character of the suffix (of length n-1). Wait, no. Because the suffix of length n-1 is the string s[1..n], so if we have the prefix of length n-1 (s[0..n-2]) and the suffix of length n-1 (s[1..n-1]), then combining these two would give us s[0..n-2] + s[n-1]. But the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], so the last character of the suffix is s[n-1]. So the full string s is the prefix of length n-1 (which is s[0..n-2]) plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1 (s[n-1]). Therefore, if we take the two strings of length n-1, and assume one is a prefix and the other is a suffix, then the full string s can be constructed as prefix + (suffix[-1]).\n\nWait, but that's only if the prefix is of length n-1 and the suffix is of length n-1. So for example, suppose that the two strings of length n-1 are A and B. Then, if A is a prefix and B is a suffix, then the full string would be A + (last character of B). But then, the suffix B must be the last n-1 characters of the full string. Which would be A's last n-2 characters plus the last character. Wait, maybe not. Let me think:\n\nIf the full string is s of length n. The prefix of length n-1 is s[0...",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is not specified. Our task is to assign each input string as a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that matches these assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate Strings**: The longest prefix and suffix (each of length `n-1`) can help us reconstruct the original string `s`. By considering all possible pairs of these longest strings, we can generate candidate strings for `s`.\n2. **Check Validity**: For each candidate string `s`, verify if all given strings are either a prefix or a suffix of `s`. If they are, we can then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n3. **Construct Result**: Once a valid candidate string `s` is found, determine which input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of `s`, and construct the result string accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n - 2]\n    \n    # Find all strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all possible pairs of the two candidates for the longest prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Construct possible s\n            possible_s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Now check if all strings are either prefix or suffix of possible_s\n            # Also, check that the prefixes and suffixes of possible_s are present in the input\n            # We need to collect all prefixes and suffixes of possible_s\n            all_prefixes = set()\n            all_suffixes = set()\n            for l in range(1, n):\n                all_prefixes.add(possible_s[:l])\n                all_suffixes.add(possible_s[-l:])\n            # Now check if all strings in the input are in all_prefixes or all_suffixes\n            valid = True\n            for s in strings:\n                if s not in all_prefixes and s not in all_suffixes:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                # Now assign P and S\n                res = []\n                for s in strings:\n                    if s in all_prefixes and s in all_suffixes:\n                        # Need to decide whether it's prefix or suffix\n                        # But since there are exactly two strings for each length\n                        # But for the current possible_s, we can check if it is a prefix or suffix\n                        # However, the problem allows any valid assignment\n                        # So we can assign based on whether it's a prefix or suffix\n                        # To avoid ambiguity, we can check if it's a prefix of possible_s\n                        # But since the same string can be both, we need to count occurrences\n                        # Alternatively, for each string, check if it is a prefix of possible_s\n                        # If it is, assign P, else assign S\n                        # However, if it's both, we can choose arbitrarily\n                        # But for the problem, it's sufficient to find any valid assignment\n                        # So here, we can check if it's a prefix of possible_s\n                        is_prefix = False\n                        for l in range(1, n):\n                            if possible_s[:l] == s:\n                                is_prefix = True\n                                break\n                        if is_prefix:\n                            res.append('P')\n                        else:\n                            res.append('S')\n                    elif s in all_prefixes:\n                        res.append('P')\n                    else:\n                        res.append('S')\n                print(''.join(res))\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Constructing Candidate String**: For each pair of these candidates, a potential string `s` is constructed by combining the prefix candidate with the last character of the suffix candidate.\n4. **Validation**: Each candidate string `s` is validated to ensure all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n5. **Result Construction**: Once a valid candidate string `s` is found, the result string is constructed by checking each input string against the prefixes and suffixes of `s`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down potential candidates for the original string `s` and validates them to ensure correctness.",
