He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The input gives all improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that fits the assignment. Also, note that multiple answers might be possible, but we can return any valid one.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible approach. For each possible candidate string s, check if the given list of prefixes and suffixes matches. But since n can be up to 100, generating all possible s's isn't feasible directly. However, maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, meaning there's at least one possible s. So perhaps we can find the correct s by checking for the longest possible prefix and suffix.\n\nAnother idea: The longest proper prefix is of length n-1. Similarly for the suffix. For the actual string s, the longest proper prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest proper suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, among the input strings, there are two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the prefix (the first n-1 characters of s), and the other must be the suffix (the last n-1 characters of s). But since there are two strings of length n-1, perhaps we can try both possibilities and see which one works.\n\nOnce we determine the correct longest prefix and suffix, we can build the string s. Then, check whether all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nWait, but how do we know which of the two length n-1 strings is the prefix or suffix?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the correct s is such that the longest proper prefix is P and the longest proper suffix is S. Then, the first n-1 characters of s is P, and the last n-1 characters of s is S. Therefore, the first character of S must be the same as the second character of P, because the last n-1 characters of s start at position 1. Wait, for example, if s is of length 5, then the longest proper prefix is s[0..3] (length 4) and the longest proper suffix is s[1..4] (length 4). So, the first character of the suffix (s[1]) is the second character of the prefix (s[1]). Therefore, the first character of the suffix is the same as the second character of the prefix. But how can I use this?\n\nAlternatively, if I have two candidates for the longest prefix and suffix, then for the correct s, the longest prefix and suffix must overlap in such a way that their overlapping parts match.\n\nFor example, suppose the two length n-1 strings are A and B. If A is the prefix, then the actual string s would be A + [last character]. But then, the suffix of length n-1 is B, which is s[1..n-1], so B must be equal to A[1..n-2] + last character. Similarly, if B is the prefix, then the suffix would be A, which must be equal to B[1..n-2] + last character.\n\nSo, perhaps for the two length n-1 strings, we can try each possibility as the prefix and see if the corresponding suffix is possible. Once we find the correct s, we can then check all the given strings against it.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Find all the input strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each of these two strings, assume it is the longest proper prefix. Then, the actual string s would be this string plus a character. But what is that character? Well, the longest proper suffix is another string of length n-1. Let's call the two length n-1 strings A and B. Suppose we take A as the prefix. Then, the suffix must be B. But the suffix is the last n-1 characters of s. Since the prefix is A (length n-1), the s is A + c, where c is the last character. Then, the suffix (of length n-1) is s[1..n], which is A[",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is not specified. Our task is to assign 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) to each input string such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix of `s` are of length `n-1`. There are exactly two such strings in the input. We need to determine which one is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n2. **Construct Candidate String**: For each candidate longest prefix, construct the potential string `s` by appending a character such that the longest suffix matches the other string of length `n-1`.\n3. **Validate Candidate String**: Once a candidate string `s` is constructed, validate if all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n4. **Determine Assignment**: Using the validated string `s`, determine the correct assignment of 'P' and 'S' for each input string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try each candidate as the prefix and see if we can find a valid s\n    for i in range(2):\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1 - i]\n        \n        # The actual string s would be prefix_candidate + last_char\n        # The suffix_candidate should be s[1:]\n        # So, s[1:] = suffix_candidate => s = prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate\n        # But also, s should be prefix_candidate + last_char, so:\n        # prefix_candidate + last_char = prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate\n        # Therefore, last_char = suffix_candidate[-1]\n        # Also, the prefix_candidate must be the first n-1 characters of s\n        # Which is prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate[0:-1]\n        # So, prefix_candidate must equal to s[:n-1] = prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate[:-1]\n        # Therefore, check if prefix_candidate == prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate[:-1]\n        if len(prefix_candidate) != len_n_minus_1:\n            continue\n        if len(suffix_candidate) != len_n_minus_1:\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if prefix_candidate[1:] == suffix_candidate[:-1]\n        if prefix_candidate[1:] == suffix_candidate[:-1]:\n            # Then the string s is prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate\n            s = prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate\n            break\n    else:\n        # If the above didn't find a valid s, try swapping the candidates\n        # (This part is redundant because the loop already checks both possibilities)\n        # But just in case, let's recheck with the other possibility\n        for i in range(2):\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[1 - i]\n            if prefix_candidate[1:] == suffix_candidate[:-1]:\n                s = prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate\n                break\n\n    # Now, check all the input strings against s\n    result = []\n    for st in strings:\n        is_prefix = True\n        is_suffix = True\n        if len(st) > len(s):\n            is_prefix = False\n            is_suffix = False\n        else:\n            if s[:len(st)] != st:\n                is_prefix = False\n            if s[-len(st):] != st:\n                is_suffix = False\n        if is_prefix:\n            result.append('P')\n        elif is_suffix:\n            result.append('S')\n        else:\n            # This shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n            result.append('P')  # fallback, though not needed\n\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential longest prefixes and suffixes.\n3. **Constructing Valid String**: By checking the overlap between the prefix and suffix candidates, we construct a potential string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: Each input string is checked against the constructed string `s` to determine if it is a prefix or suffix.\n5. **Result Construction**: The result string is built by assigning 'P' or 'S' based on the validation checks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes while adhering to the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.",
