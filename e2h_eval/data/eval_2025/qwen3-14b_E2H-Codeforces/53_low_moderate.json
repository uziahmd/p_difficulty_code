Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the output is 3.\n\nHmm. How do I check all possible substrings and their occurrences?\n\nAn idea: for each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. The maximum possible L is floor(n/2), since if the string is length n, the longest possible substring that can appear twice is when it's split into two parts. But maybe even longer? Wait, no. For example, if the string is 'aaaaa', then a substring of length 3 can appear multiple times. For example, 'aaa' appears starting at 0, 1, 2. So the maximum possible length would be n-1, but only if there's a duplicate. But for the general case, the maximum possible L is n-1 (if the first n-1 characters are same as the last n-1, but that's possible only for some strings).\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nLoop over possible lengths L from the maximum possible (which is len(s) - 1) down to 1. For each L, check all possible substrings of length L. For each substring, check if it appears at least twice. If yes, return L as the answer.\n\nThe first L where this is true is the maximum possible, so we can stop there.\n\nBut how to efficiently check for each L?\n\nFor each L, generate all substrings of length L, and track their occurrences. For example, using a dictionary where keys are the substrings and values are the count of their occurrences. If any count is >=2, then return L.\n\nBut for each L, we can generate all possible substrings of that length, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut what about overlapping occurrences? For example, in 'ababa', for L=3, the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). So the same substring occurs twice. So the code should count that.\n\nSo the approach is correct. For each L, collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\n1. Iterate L from max_possible down to 1.\n\n   The max possible L is len(s) - 1. Because for example, if the string is of length 5, then a substring of length 4 can appear twice if the first four and last four characters are same. But for L = len(s), the substring is the entire string, which can't appear twice.\n\n   So for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n      For each L, check all substrings of length L. For each substring, check if it appears more than once.\n\n      If found, return L.\n\n2. If no such L is found, return 0.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nRead the input string. Then, for each possible L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   Create a set or a dictionary to track the substrings. For each starting index i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n      substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n      Check if this substring has been seen before. If yes, then return L.\n\n      Else, add it to the set.\n\nWait, but for checking if a substring appears at least twice, we can use a set. For example, for each L, iterate through all substrings of length L, and check if any of them is present in the set more than once. However, using a set may not track counts. So perhaps for each L, we can collect all substrings, and check if the length of the set is less than the number of substrings (i.e., there are duplicates). But that's not sufficient, because if there are multiple duplicates, but the same substring appears more than once.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, we can collect all substrings of length L into a list, and then check if any element appears at least twice. For example, for each L, generate all substrings, and for each substring, check if it's in a list. But this would be O(n^2) for each L, but given that the maximum length of the string is 100, this is acceptable.\n\nBut for each L, the",
