Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the two names. That means, the count of each character in the pile must be exactly equal to the sum of the counts of each character in the guest's name and the host's name.\n\nSo the approach here is to:\n\n1. Read the three input lines: guest, host, and pile.\n2. Combine the guest and host names into a single string.\n3. Check if the combined string and the pile have the same character counts.\n\nBut how do I check that? Well, in Python, I can use the collections.Counter class, which counts the occurrences of each element. So, if I create a Counter for the combined guest and host names, and another Counter for the pile, then these two Counters should be equal.\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both Counters have the same counts for all characters, then it's a yes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Concatenate guest and host into a single string, let's call it combined.\n- Create a Counter for combined and a Counter for pile.\n- Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the pile has more letters than the combined names? Like, if the combined length is 5 and the pile is 6 letters. Then obviously, the counts can't match. So checking the length first might be a good idea. Because if the lengths are different, we can immediately return NO.\n\nSo first, check if the length of the pile is equal to the sum of the lengths of guest and host. If not, output NO. Otherwise, proceed to check the counts.\n\nThat's a good optimization. Because even if the lengths are different, the counts can't match. So that's a quick check.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case (each of the three inputs in the example):\n\n1. Read guest, host, pile.\n2. Check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n3. Else, check if the combined Counter of guest + host equals the Counter of pile. If yes, output YES else NO.\n\nYes. Now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as three lines. Wait, the input is three lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo, the first line is guest, second is host, third is pile.\n\nSo, the code needs to read three lines from stdin. But in the example given, the input is given as a list of three strings. But in the actual problem, the input is three lines. So, for the code, we need to read three lines from standard input.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So, in Python, the code can read them via input().strip() three times.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is a list of three strings. But that's probably just for the example. The actual input is three lines.\n\nSo, the code will be:\n\nRead three lines:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combine guest and host into combined = guest + host.\n\nCheck len(combined) == len(pile). If not, print NO.\n\nElse, check if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile). If yes, print YES else NO.\n\nYes. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut what about cases where the combined string and the pile have the same length but different characters? For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AA\". Then the length is 2 vs 2, but the counts are A:2 vs A:1, B:1. So the Counter would differ.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO.\n\nNow, in Python, the Counter is from collections. So, need to import that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about when the combined string and pile have the same length but different counts? Like, guest is \"AB\", host is \"CD\", pile is \"ACBD\". Then the counts are same. But if pile is \"AABC",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Length Check**: First, check if the total length of the guest's and host's names combined matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, it is immediately clear that the pile cannot be rearranged to form the combined names.\n3. **Character Count Check**: If the lengths match, use a character count comparison to verify if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names. This is efficiently done using Python's `collections.Counter` which counts the occurrences of each character in a string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines from standard input, each representing the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters respectively.\n- **Combined Length Check**: The combined length of the guest and host names is compared with the length of the pile. If they differ, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n- **Character Count Comparison**: Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile. If these counts match exactly, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both the length and character composition of the strings, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
