The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the problem is about a frog jumping on a number line. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But there's a constraint: whenever it jumps, it can't land outside the interval [0, x]. For each x from 0 to m, we need to compute f(x), which is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach under that constraint. Then sum all these f(x) values from x=0 to m.\n\nHmm. The challenge here is to find an efficient way to calculate this sum given that m can be as large as 1e9. Brute-forcing each x up to m isn't feasible. So we need to find some mathematical pattern or formula.\n\nLet me think about what positions the frog can reach. The frog can make any combination of adding a and subtracting b. But since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the reachable positions depend on x.\n\nWait, but the frog can make multiple jumps. Let's think of the possible positions as numbers that can be expressed as 0 + k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But with the constraint that during the entire sequence of jumps, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. However, the problem says that the frog can reach a position if there exists a path that reaches it without stepping outside [0,x]. So the reachable positions are those that can be written as a linear combination of a and b, but with certain constraints.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this. Let's consider the problem without the x constraint first. What positions can the frog reach?\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a,b). Because the frog can add a and subtract b any number of times. So the set of positions reachable in general is all multiples of d = gcd(a,b), where d divides both a and b.\n\nBut with the x constraint, the frog can't go beyond x. So for a given x, the positions reachable are all multiples of d that are between 0 and x, but also reachable via some sequence of jumps that doesn't go outside [0,x].\n\nWait, but how do we know if a position is reachable? Because even though it's a multiple of d, maybe you can't reach it without going out of bounds. For example, if x is small enough that you can't get there through the allowed jumps.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model this. Let's think about the case when x is large enough. Suppose that x is large enough that the frog can reach any multiple of d between 0 and x. Then f(x) would be floor(x/d) + 1 (since 0 is included). However, if x is not large enough, then maybe some positions can't be reached.\n\nBut how to determine when x is large enough?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d up to x. Once x is beyond that, the count becomes (x//d +1). But how?\n\nLet me think of the example given. In the first sample input: m=7, a=5, b=3. The gcd(5,3) is 1. So the frog can reach any integer. But the constraints are that during the jumps, the frog can't go outside [0,x]. For example, when x=5, the frog can reach 0,5. But how about 5-3=2? Well, to reach 2, the frog would have to jump from 0 to 5 (which is allowed since x=5), then from 5 to 5-3=2. That's allowed. So for x=5, f(5)=3 (positions 0,2,5). But according to the sample explanation, f(5)=3. Then when x=7, the frog can reach more positions. Like 0, 5, 2, 7 (5+2?), but maybe other positions as well.\n\nSo, the problem seems to involve two parts: determining which positions are reachable (based on their congruence mod d) and ensuring that there's a path that doesn't go out of [0,x].\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model the reachable positions as all multiples of d that are between 0 and x, provided that x is sufficiently large. Otherwise, some positions may not be reachable.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d up to x. Because once the frog can reach a position, it can add a's and subtract b's as needed, but maybe the constraints of not going out of bounds are satisfied.\n\nWait, but this depends on a and b. Let me think of the case where a=5, b=3. The frog can reach 0,5,2,7 (from 5+2?), etc. For example, to reach 2, the frog jumps 5 then subtracts 3. But to reach 7, it could jump 5+5=10 (but if x is 7, that's not allowed). Wait, no. If x is 7, then the frog can't jump to 10. So in that case, the frog can't reach 7 unless there's a way to get there without exceeding x.\n\nSo the problem is more complex than just considering the multiples of d. Because even if a position is a multiple of d, it might not be reachable due to the constraints of the x limit.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the reachable positions. The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (since d is the gcd of a and b) and is in [0, x], but only if there's a way to reach it without stepping outside [0, x] during the journey.\n\nBut how can we model that?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nLet d = gcd(a, b). Let's first note that all reachable positions must be multiples of d. So for each x, the maximum number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1. But this is only achievable if all those positions are reachable under the constraints.\n\nBut when can that be achieved?\n\nIf the frog can reach any multiple of d in [0, x], then f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1. Otherwise, it's less than that.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each x, whether the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. If yes, then f(x) is that count. Otherwise, it's some smaller value.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Once x is larger than that, then f(x) is floor(x/d)+1.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find the minimal value of x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable. Let's call this minimal x as 'threshold'. Then for x >= threshold, f(x) is floor(x/d)+1, and for x < threshold, f(x) is something else.\n\nBut how to compute this threshold?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is determined by the minimal value such that the frog can reach the positions a and b. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the problem again. The frog can jump forward by a or backward by b. So, to reach a position k, the frog must have some combination of jumps that allows it to reach k, without stepping outside [0,x] during the process.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent the allowed jumps. Then, for a given x, the reachable positions are the nodes reachable from 0 in this graph, with the constraint that all nodes along the path are within [0,x].\n\nBut for large x (up to 1e9), we can't compute this for each x.\n\nAlternative idea: For each x, the reachable positions are all positions that are multiples of d and can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path to reach them doesn't go outside [0,x].\n\nBut how to find this set?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0 and <=x, provided that there exists some way to reach it by adding a's and subtracting b's, possibly in steps that don't exceed x.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that once the frog can reach a position, it can reach higher positions by adding a's, but only if that doesn't go beyond x. Similarly, subtracting b's from positions that are high enough.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother approach: Let's assume that d = gcd(a, b). We can divide all variables by d. Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since a' and b' are coprime.\n\nNow, the problem becomes: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and the problem reduces to the case where a and b are coprime.\n\nLet me think of this scenario. Let's assume that a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is >= (some value) and is congruent to 0 mod 1 (so all integers). But again, the problem is that the frog can't go out of the [0,x] interval.\n\nWait, but if a and b are coprime, then for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. How?\n\nFor example, if a=5 and b=3 (coprime). Let's say x is 8. The frog can reach 0, 5, 2 (5-3), 7 (5+2?), but how to reach 7? Well, from 5, add another 5 to get 10, but that's beyond x=8. So that's not allowed. So perhaps the frog can't reach 7 if x is 8. Wait, but how else?\n\nAlternatively, the frog can reach 0, then jump to 5 (allowed), then jump to 5-3=2, then from 2, jump to 2+5=7 (allowed since x is 8). Yes! So that's allowed. So 7 is reachable. So in this case, for x=8, the frog can reach 0,2,5,7. But wait, what about 3? How to reach 3? Well, from 0, can't jump to 3. From 5, subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, adding 5 gives 7. Subtracting 3 gives -1 which is invalid. So 3 is not reachable. Hmm. So even though a and b are coprime, the frog can't reach all positions. So my previous assumption was wrong.\n\nThis suggests that the problem is more complex. So the key is to find for each x, the set of positions that are reachable under the constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea: For positions that are multiples of d, let's think about the minimal number of steps to reach them. But again, with the x constraint.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path to reach that position (by adding a's and subtracting b's) never goes out of [0,x].\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAnother thought: The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0 and <=x, provided that x is large enough. For example, once x is >= (a + b), then the frog can reach any multiple of d in [0,x]. But how to verify this?\n\nLet me take the example where a=5, b=3, and x=8. We saw that 7 is reachable. Also, 2 is reachable. What about 4? Let's see. Can the frog reach 4? Let's think. Starting from 0, can we get to 4?\n\nPossible steps:\n\n0 → 5 (allowed). Then 5 → 2 (allowed). Then 2 → 5 (again). Then 5 → 2 again. It seems stuck. How about 0 → 5 → 2 → 5 → 2... No. How about trying to reach 4 via other steps. Maybe 0 → 5 → 5+5=10 (but x is 8, so that's not allowed). So no. So 4 is not reachable even though x is 8. Therefore, my earlier assumption is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that even for x >= a + b, not all positions are reachable. So what's the pattern here?\n\nLet me think again. Since a and b are coprime, the problem is similar to the classic coin problem where you can make any amount >= (a*b -a -b) + 1. But that's when you can use any combination of coins. However, in this problem, the frog can only add a's and subtract b's. So it's different.\n\nWait, but the frog can move in both directions. So for example, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k+a (if allowed) or k -b (if allowed). So the problem is similar to BFS, but with the constraint of not going beyond [0, x].\n\nBut how can we model this for arbitrary x?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that for the frog to reach a position k (a multiple of d), there must exist some integer t such that k = t*a - s*b, where t and s are non-negative integers. However, during the process of reaching k, the frog must not step outside [0, x].\n\nBut how can we ensure that? For example, in the case of k=2, which is 0 + 1*5 - 1*3. So the frog jumps to 5, then to 2. This is allowed as long as x >= 5 and x >= 2. So if x is >=5, then this is allowed.\n\nBut for k=4, can we find t and s such that 4 = 5t -3s? Let's see. Trying small values:\n\nt=1: 5 - 3s =4 → 3s=1 → no solution.\n\nt=2: 10 -3s =4 → 3s=6 → s=2. So 2*5 -2*3 = 10-6=4. So yes. So the equation holds. But how to reach 4 without going out of [0,x]?\n\nThe path would be:\n\nStart at 0.\n\nJump +a twice: 0 →5 →10. But if x is 8, then 10 is beyond x. So that's not allowed. So the path is invalid. So the frog can't take that path. But is there another path?\n\nAlternative path: Maybe using subtraction steps. For example, 0 →5 (allowed), then subtract b once to get 2 (allowed). Then add a once to get 7 (allowed if x >=7). Then subtract b once to get 4 (allowed if x >=4). So if x >=7, then yes. So in that case, for x >=7, the frog can reach 4.\n\nIn the previous example where x was 8, that path is allowed. So 4 is reachable. But earlier I thought it wasn't. Oh right! So I made a mistake earlier. So the frog can reach 4 if x is at least 7.\n\nSo the problem is that even though there exists a way to reach the position (like 4), the path taken must not go beyond x. So for a given x, the frog can reach a position k if there's a way to reach it with steps that stay within [0,x].\n\nSo the question is: for a given x, which positions k (multiples of d) can be reached by such paths?\n\nThis seems complicated. But perhaps we can find that once x is large enough, all positions that are multiples of d and between 0 and x are reachable. What's that \"large enough\" value?\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime. Suppose that x >= (a + b). Then, for any position k between 0 and x, which is a multiple of d=1, can the frog reach it?\n\nLet me take the example of k=4, a=5, b=3, and x=7. The path is 0 →5 →2 →7 →4. All steps are within [0,7]. So yes. So 4 is reachable.\n\nAnother example: suppose k is any number between 0 and x. How can the frog reach it?\n\nWell, the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, which in this case is any integer. But how to find the path?\n\nPerhaps the following approach: for any k, the frog can reach it by first moving forward enough times to get to a position that is greater than or equal to k, then subtracting b's. But the problem is that the steps must not go out of [0,x].\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. Suppose that the frog can reach all positions in [0, x] that are multiples of d, provided that x >= a + b. But how to prove this?\n\nLet me think of the general case where a and b are coprime. Let's say x >= a + b. For any k between 0 and x, can the frog reach it?\n\nAssume that k can be written as k = a * t - b * s, where t and s are non-negative integers. But how to find a path that stays within [0,x].\n\nOne possible approach is to first reach a position that is at least k, then subtract b's until reaching k. But how to ensure that during the process, the frog doesn't go below zero.\n\nAlternatively, the frog can reach any position that is in [0, x], by first jumping forward to a position that is at least k + b, then subtracting b's. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since a and b are coprime, there exists integers t and s such that a*t - b*s = k. But since we want t and s to be non-negative, this is not guaranteed. However, for k >= 0, there might be a way.\n\nBut even if there's a way to write k as a linear combination, the path to reach it may require steps that go out of [0,x].\n\nBut perhaps for x >= a + b, the frog can always find a path that stays within [0,x].\n\nLet me think of another example. Let's say a=3, b=5, and x=8. We want to reach 4. How?\n\nWe can do 0 →3 →6 → (6-5=1) → (1+3=4). So yes. So the steps are allowed as long as x is at least 6. So for x >=6, yes.\n\nAnother example: a=4, b=5. x=9. Reach 1?\n\nWe need to find t and s such that 4t -5s =1. Let's see: 4*4 -5*3 = 16-15=1. So t=4, s=3. But the path would be 0→4→8→12 (but x=9, which is less than 12. So that's not allowed. So the path is invalid.\n\nAlternative path: Let's see. How to reach 1.\n\nMaybe 0 →4 → (4-5) is -1, which is invalid. So that's not allowed. So what other ways?\n\nWait, maybe the frog can reach 1 by going forward and backward in a different way. For example, 0 →4 →8 (allowed since x=9). From 8, subtract 5 once to get 3 (allowed). From 3, add 4 to get 7 (allowed). Subtract 5 to get 2. Add 4 to get 6. Subtract 5 to get 1. So yes. The path is 0 →4 →8 →3 →7 →2 →6 →1. All steps are within [0,9]. So yes, the frog can reach 1.\n\nSo even though the direct path of adding 4 four times and subtracting 5 three times would go over x, there exists an alternative path that stays within the bounds. Hence, for x >= a + b, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (which is 1 here).\n\nThis suggests that once x is at least a + b, the frog can reach any multiple of d (which is 1) between 0 and x. Thus, for x >= a + b, f(x) = x + 1 (since d=1). Wait, but in this example, a=4 and b=5, x=9. The number of reachable positions would be 10 (positions 0-9). But according to the earlier example, the frog can reach 1. So yes, all positions are reachable. Thus, f(x) = x+1 for x >= a + b.\n\nBut what about when x is less than a + b? For example, x = a + b -1. In that case, maybe some positions are not reachable.\n\nSo the general idea is:\n\nLet d = gcd(a, b). Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, a' and b' are coprime.\n\nThen, for the problem, once x is large enough (say, x >= a + b), the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d between 0 and x. So for x >= some threshold, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut what is the threshold?\n\nThe threshold is when x is large enough that the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d in [0, x]. For this, the threshold is probably (a' + b') * d - something. Wait, but since a' and b' are coprime, the classic Frobenius number is (a'*b' - a' - b'), but that's for the case where you can use any combination of a' and b' coins. However, in our case, the frog can add a's and subtract b's, which is different.\n\nBut perhaps the threshold is (a' + b') * d. Or maybe (a' -1) * (b' -1) * d? Not sure.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving the problem, perhaps we can find that once x >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d in [0, x]. Thus, for x >= a + b, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nIf this is true, then the sum can be split into two parts:\n\n1. For x < threshold (say, threshold = a + b), compute f(x) individually.\n\n2. For x >= threshold, compute f(x) as floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find the threshold?\n\nIn the example where a=5 and b=3 (d=1, a'=5, b'=3), threshold is 5+3=8. Let's check for x=8. According to the earlier example, the frog can reach 4 (as in the example where x=8). So for x=8, which is a + b, all positions are reachable. So for x >= a + b, f(x) = x + 1.\n\nBut wait, for x=8, the sum of positions is 9. But according to the sample input, when x=7, the f(x) is 8. Which implies that for x=7, which is less than a + b (8), the frog can reach 8 positions. But according to the previous analysis, for x=8, which is a + b, the frog can reach all positions. So the threshold is a + b.\n\nThus, the hypothesis is that once x >= a + b, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x], and thus f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut what if a and b are not coprime? Let's take a=4, b=6. Then d = 2. a' = 2, b' =3. So a' and b' are coprime. The threshold would be a' + b' = 5. So multiplied by d, threshold is 5*d= 10. So for x >= 10, the frog can reach all multiples of 2 between 0 and x. Let's see.\n\nFor x=10, the frog can reach positions 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. How?\n\nYes. For example, to reach 2: 0 +a (4) is 4, then subtract b (6) → 4-6 = -2 (invalid). So that's not allowed. But perhaps another path: 0 → 4 → 8 → 12 (but x=10, so invalid). Hmm, no. Wait, this seems like a problem.\n\nWait, the threshold is supposed to be a + b. But in this case, a=4, b=6. a + b = 10. So according to the hypothesis, x >= 10 should allow the frog to reach all multiples of d (which is 2) between 0 and x.\n\nBut how to reach 2?\n\nLet me think. The frog can jump forward by a (4) and backward by b (6). So for example, to reach 2:\n\nIs there a way to get there without stepping outside [0, x]?\n\nLet me think of the steps. Let's say x is 10.\n\n0 →4 (allowed). 4 → 8 (allowed). 8 → 8-6=2 (allowed). So yes. So the path is 0 →4 →8 →2. All steps are within [0,10]. So 2 is reachable.\n\nAh, right! So the frog can reach 2 by going to 8 first, then subtracting 6. So yes. So for x >= 10, the frog can reach all multiples of 2 up to x.\n\nSo the hypothesis seems valid.\n\nTherefore, the general approach is:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b). Then, for x >= a + b, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nFor x < a + b, we need to compute f(x) individually. However, since m can be up to 1e9, and a and b are up to 1e5, we need an efficient way to compute the sum for x < a + b.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think about the cases where x < a + b. For each x in [0, m], if x < a + b, we need to compute f(x). However, if m is large (like 1e9), but a + b is small (like 1e5), then we can compute f(x) for all x up to min(m, a + b - 1), and then for x >= a + b, compute using the formula.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Compute the threshold T = a + b.\n\n3. For x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\n4. For x < T, compute f(x) using BFS or some other method.\n\nBut since T can be up to 2*1e5 (since a and b are up to 1e5), and m can be up to 1e9, we need to compute for x up to min(m, T-1) the values of f(x), and then sum them.\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for x < T?\n\nFor each x in 0 to T-1, we need to find the number of positions reachable by the frog under the constraint that during the jumps, the frog never leaves [0, x].\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem. For each x, we can model the reachable positions as a set, and for x < T, we can precompute all f(x) values.\n\nBut since T is up to 2e5, and for each x up to T, we can run BFS or DP, this is feasible.\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for all x up to T-1 efficiently?\n\nAlternative idea: For each x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by the frog without stepping outside [0, x]. Let's think of it as a graph where each node is a position in [0, x], and edges are the allowed jumps. Then, f(x) is the number of nodes reachable from 0 in this graph.\n\nBut for each x, this graph is different. However, for x < T, and T up to 2e5, we can precompute for all x up to T-1.\n\nBut doing BFS for each x is O(T^2) time, which for T=2e5 is 4e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible. So we need a better way.\n\nAlternative approach: For all x in 0 to T-1, the reachable positions are the same as the positions reachable in the graph where the frog can jump to k+a or k-b, but only if they are within [0, x].\n\nBut for x < T, the maximum x is T-1, which is up to 2e5. Let's think of building a DP table where dp[x][k] indicates whether position k is reachable for x. But this is O(T^2) space, which is also not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each position k, determine the minimal x where k becomes reachable. Then, for all x >= that minimal x, k is counted in f(x). But how?\n\nBut how to find for each k, the minimal x where it is reachable.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as for each x, the reachable positions are the same as those reachable in the graph where the frog can jump to k+a or k-b, but the frog cannot go beyond x. So for x, the reachable positions are those that are reachable in the graph up to x.\n\nBut how to compute this for all x up to T-1?\n\nAlternative idea: For a fixed x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by the frog starting from 0, using any number of jumps, and never stepping outside [0, x].\n\nThis is equivalent to the set of positions reachable in the graph where the frog can move to k+a or k-b, but only if the new position is in [0, x].\n\nBut this can be modeled as a BFS for each x. However, doing this for each x up to T-1 is expensive.\n\nBut perhaps we can find that for x >= x', the reachable positions for x are a superset of those for x'.\n\nBecause if you increase x, you allow more positions to be reachable. For example, if x increases, then more jumps are allowed, hence more positions can be reached.\n\nSo for x1 < x2, the reachable positions for x1 is a subset of those for x2.\n\nThis suggests that we can compute for each x, the reachable positions incrementally.\n\nLet me think. For example, we can precompute for all x from 0 to T-1, the reachable positions by building upon previous computations.\n\nFor example, for x=0: only position 0 is reachable.\n\nFor x=1: check if 0 can reach any new positions. From 0, adding a would take us to a, but if a > 1, it's not allowed. Subtracting b would take us to -b, which is invalid. So only 0 is reachable.\n\nSimilarly, for x=2, etc.\n\nBut how to compute this incrementally?\n\nWe can maintain a set of reachable positions for each x. However, for x increasing from 0 to T-1, when we increase x by 1, the new positions that can be added are those that were previously unreachable but now can be reached because of the new x.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a BFS that grows as x increases. For example, for x=0, the reachable positions are {0}.\n\nFor x=1, the reachable positions are the same as before, unless adding a or subtracting b from existing positions leads to new positions within [0,1].\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each x, the reachable positions are the same as the set of positions reachable in the graph where the frog can move freely, but with the constraint that all positions are ≤x and ≥0. This is equivalent to the positions that are reachable in the original problem (without x constraint) and are ≤x, and can be reached via a path that never exceeds x.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nBut the original problem without x constraints allows the frog to reach any position that is a multiple of d. So for x ≥ some value, all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nBut for x < T, some of those multiples may not be reachable.\n\nBut perhaps for x < T, the reachable positions are the same as the positions that are multiples of d and can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path to reach them doesn't go beyond x.\n\nBut again, how to compute this?\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. For each x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by the frog in the graph where the frog can move to k+a or k-b, but only if the new position is in [0, x]. This is equivalent to the set of positions that are reachable in the graph where the frog can move freely, but with the restriction that the frog cannot go beyond x.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with BFS for each x. However, for x up to T-1, this would take O(T^2) time.\n\nBut since T is up to 2e5, this would be 4e10 operations, which is way too slow for Python.\n\nAlternative Idea: Precompute for all x up to T-1, the reachable positions using a BFS that builds upon previous results. For example, when x increases by 1, we can check if any new positions are reachable by adding a or subtracting b from existing positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For x from 0 to T-1:\n\nInitially, for x=0, the reachable positions are {0}.\n\nFor x=1, the reachable positions are the same as for x=0, plus any positions that can be reached from x=0 by adding a or subtracting b, but within [0, 1]. For example, if a is 1, then adding a to 0 gives 1, which is allowed. So for x=1, the reachable positions are {0, 1}.\n\nBut for x=1, if a is 2, then adding a would give 2, which is outside of x=1. So no new positions.\n\nSo for each x, the reachable positions are the union of the previous reachable positions (for x-1) and any new positions that can be reached by adding a or subtracting b from positions that are reachable for x-1, but are now within [0, x].\n\nWait, but when x increases by 1, the new positions that can be added are those that are exactly x, and can be reached by a jump from x-a or x + b (but x +b would be larger than x, so not allowed). Or, perhaps the new positions are those that are reachable by adding a to a position that is x -a, or subtracting b from a position that is x + b (but that's not possible since x +b is larger than x).\n\nSo for each x, the new positions that can be added are:\n\n- x itself, if it can be reached by adding a to some position (x -a) that is reachable for x-1, or by subtracting b from some position (x + b) that is reachable for x-1. But since x +b >x, that's not allowed. So only the first possibility.\n\nSo for x, the new positions are those that can be reached by adding a to a position that is x -a, which must be in the reachable positions for x-1.\n\nThus, we can model this with a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet me define reachable[x] as a set of positions reachable for x. But storing sets is memory-intensive. Instead, we can track for each x, the set of positions reachable up to x, and for each x, check if x can be reached by adding a to x -a (if x -a is reachable for x-1).\n\nBut how to track this?\n\nLet me think of it as follows: for each x, the reachable positions are the same as for x-1, plus possibly x if it can be reached by adding a to (x -a) or by subtracting b from (x +b). But since x +b is larger than x, the second option is not possible. So only the first option.\n\nSo, for x >= a, if (x -a) is reachable for x-1, then x is reachable for x.\n\nAdditionally, for x >= b, if (x +b) is reachable for x-1, then x is reachable for x? No, because x +b is larger than x. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, no. The frog can jump to x from (x +b) by subtracting b. But (x +b) is larger than x, so that's not allowed. So the only way to reach x is by adding a to (x -a), assuming that (x -a) is reachable and that x -a >= 0.\n\nThus, for each x >= a, we can check if x -a is reachable in x-1. If so, then x is reachable in x.\n\nAdditionally, the frog could have reached x by subtracting b from a position that is x +b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these counts for all values from 0 to a given integer $ m $.

So the code should read all lines from stdin and process each line as a separate test case.\n\n    # Therefore, the code will read all input lines, split them into groups of three integers, and process each group as a separate test case.\n\n    # So adjust the code to read all input lines, split into tokens, and process each set of three integers as a test case.\n\n    # Now, let's restructure the code accordingly.\n\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    results = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(data):\n        m = data[i]\n        a = data[i+1]\n        b = data[i+2]\n        i += 3\n        # Process this test case\n        d = math.gcd(a, b)\n        T = a + b\n        max_x = m\n        # Compute for x < T\n        # Precompute f(x) for x from 0 to min(T-1, m)\n        max_small = min(T - 1, m)\n        # Initialize a dp array where dp[x] is a set of reachable positions\n        # However, for efficiency, we can track a boolean array for each x\n        # Since for x < T, we can compute reachable positions incrementally\n        # We can use a 2D array, but since T is up to 2e5, and for each x up to T-1, we can use a 1D array\n        # We can use a 1D array that tracks for each position whether it's reachable for the current x\n        # But since for x increasing, the reachable positions can be built upon previous states\n        # So we can use a set that grows as x increases\n        # Alternatively, use a 1D array for each x up to T-1, but with the observation that for x >= x', reachable[x] includes reachable[x']\n\n        # Let's use a list of sets, where reachable[x] is the set of positions reachable for x\n        # But for space efficiency, we can use a single array that gets updated as x increases\n\n        # Let's use a boolean array for the current x\n        # Initialize for x=0\n        # We'll use a list of sets, but for efficiency, we can track the reachable positions as x increases\n        # For each x, the reachable positions are the same as for x-1, plus possibly new positions\n\n        # Initialize a list of sets, but since T can be up to 2e5, and m can be up to 1e9, but for x < T, we need to compute f(x)\n        # For each x from 0 to max_small, compute f(x)\n\n        # We can use a 1D boolean array for the current x\n        # We'll use a list called 'reachable' which is updated as x increases\n        # Initially, for x=0, only 0 is reachable\n        # For x from 1 to max_small:\n        #   reachable[x] = reachable[x-1] union {new positions}\n        # To find new positions, check if x can be reached by adding a to x - a, or subtracting b from x + b (but x + b > x, so not possible)\n        # So only check if x - a is in reachable[x-1], then add x\n\n        # However, since we are building for x up to max_small, we can use a dynamic programming approach\n\n        # Create a list of sets, but for efficiency, we can track a single set that grows as x increases\n        # However, for each x, the reachable positions depend on the previous state\n\n        # Alternative approach: for each x, keep track of a boolean array indicating reachable positions\n        # But since x can be up to T-1 (up to 2e5), and for each x, the positions can be up to x, we can use a 2D array, but it's memory intensive\n        # Instead, use a 1D array for the current x, and update it as x increases\n\n        # Let's proceed with this approach\n        # Initialize a 2D array is not feasible, so instead, for each x, we can keep a set of reachable positions\n        # But for x up to T-1, and T up to 2e5, this is manageable\n\n        # Use a list of sets, reachable_sets, where reachable_sets[x] is the set of positions reachable for x\n        # But for x up to max_small\n        # However, since for x < T, the reachable positions for x can be built incrementally\n\n        # Initialize a set for x=0\n        reachable = set()\n        reachable.add(0)\n        small_sum = 0\n        if max_small >= 0:\n            small_sum += 1  # f(0) = 1\n\n        for x in range(1, max_small + 1):\n            # Copy the previous reachable positions\n            new_reachable = set(reachable)\n            # Check if x can be reached by adding a to (x - a)\n            if x - a >= 0:\n                if (x - a) in reachable:\n                    new_reachable.add(x)\n            # Also check if x can be reached by subtracting b from (x + b)\n            # But (x + b) is larger than x, so not allowed\n            # So no need to check\n            # Additionally, check if any existing positions can jump to x by subtracting b\n            # For example, if there's a position y in reachable such that y - b = x, but y must be <= x\n            # So y = x + b must be <= x, which is impossible.
