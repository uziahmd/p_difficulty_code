    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So we need to find the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. The constraints are that each edge is either 1 or -1, and for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i is -1. And then, for each such tree, compute the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n, and sum all those values over all good trees.\n\nFirst, let's think about what a good tree is. For each vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges must be -1. Let's consider the degrees of the vertices. Because each edge contributes to exactly two vertices (its endpoints), the product for each vertex is the product of the weights of edges connected to it. \n\nLet me think: For each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. Let's consider the product of all these products across all vertices. Each edge is counted twice in this big product (once for each endpoint). So the total product would be (-1)^n. But on the other hand, the product of all edges' weights multiplied by themselves twice (since each edge is in two vertices' product) would be (product of edge weights)^2. Therefore, (-1)^n = (product of edge weights)^2. But since the square of any real number is non-negative, this implies that (-1)^n must be 1. Wait, that can't be right unless n is even. Wait, but that would mean that for odd n, there are no good trees. But looking at the sample input, when n=2, which is even, there's one good tree. For n=1, the problem says n is positive integer. Let's check for n=1.\n\nWait, for n=1, there's only one vertex. But a tree with one vertex has zero edges. So for each vertex (only one here), the product of the edges incident to it is the product of zero terms. Which is 1? But the condition requires it to be -1. So for n=1, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer for n=1 would be 0. Which matches the sample input where n=1 gives output 0.\n\nSo, this suggests that for odd n, there are no good trees. Because (-1)^n would be -1, but the product of squares is 1. So that's impossible. Therefore, for odd n, the answer is zero. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the product over all vertices of their product of incident edge weights equals the product of all edge weights squared. Because each edge is counted twice. So:\n\nproduct_{v} (product_{e incident to v} w_e) ) = product_{edges} (w_e)^2.\n\nBut each vertex's product is -1, so the left side is (-1)^n. Therefore:\n\n(-1)^n = product_{edges} (w_e)^2.\n\nBut since each w_e is either 1 or -1, their squares are 1. Therefore, the product is 1. Therefore, (-1)^n must equal 1. Which implies that n must be even. Otherwise, there are no good trees. So for any odd n, the answer is 0. That's a key insight!\n\nSo for example, the sample input when n=1 (odd) gives output 0. Similarly, for n=3, the answer would be 0. So the first thing our code can do is check if n is even. If it's odd, output 0. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo the problem reduces to even n. Let's assume n is even.\n\nNow, the question is, for even n, how many good trees are there, and what is the sum of d(1,n) over all of them?\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute the sum without enumerating all trees.\n\nLet me think about the conditions again. Each vertex has product of incident edges equal to -1. Let's think about the degrees of the vertices. Let me think about the product of the edges adjacent to a vertex. Suppose a vertex has degree k. Then the product of the edge weights is -1. Since each edge is either 1 or -1, the product is -1. So the number of edges with weight -1 incident to the vertex must be odd. Because the product of numbers (each ±1) is -1 iff there's an odd number of -1s. So for each vertex, the number of edges incident to it with weight -1 is odd.\n\nSo, for each vertex, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it is odd. Let's think about the implications of this.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as follows: For each tree structure (i.e., the underlying unweighted tree), count the number of valid weight assignments (satisfying the product conditions) and compute the contribution of each such assignment to the sum. Then sum over all possible tree structures.\n\nBut since the number of trees is huge (n^{n-2}), we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that for each tree structure, the number of valid weight assignments is 2^{something}, and the average value of d(1,n) over those assignments is something. Then multiply by the number of trees and the average.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find that the sum over all good trees of d(1,n) is equal to something like (-1)^{something} multiplied by the number of good trees, or similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem using linear algebra. Each edge has a variable w_e ∈ {1, -1}. For each vertex, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let's take the logarithm? No, since we're dealing with products, perhaps taking logs isn't helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, note that the product conditions are multiplicative constraints. Let's consider that each edge is a variable that can be ±1. Let's take the product for each vertex. For example, for vertex v, product_{e adjacent to v} w_e = -1. Let's take the log of both sides, but since they are multiplicative, perhaps we can convert this into additive equations by considering the exponents. However, since each w_e is ±1, we can represent them as variables x_e where x_e ∈ {0,1} (with x_e=0 representing 1 and x_e=1 representing -1). Then, the product for vertex v is the product of (-1)^{x_e} for each edge e adjacent to v. That product equals (-1)^{sum x_e} = -1. Therefore, sum x_e ≡ 1 mod 2. So for each vertex, the sum of x_e (for edges adjacent to it) is congruent to 1 mod 2. \n\nSo we have a system of equations over GF(2). Each equation is sum_{e adjacent to v} x_e = 1 mod 2. \n\nNow, the variables are the x_e for each edge. The equations are for each vertex v.\n\nBut in a tree, the number of edges is n-1. The number of equations is n. However, the sum of all equations is sum_{v} sum_{e adjacent to v} x_e = sum_v 1 mod 2. On the left side, each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint). So the left side is 2 * sum x_e, which is 0 mod 2. The right side is n mod 2. So for the system to be consistent, we must have n mod 2 = 0. Which aligns with our earlier conclusion that n must be even. Therefore, for even n, the system is consistent, and the number of solutions depends on the rank of the system.\n\nIn general, for a tree, the system of equations is such that the equations are not all independent. For example, the sum of all equations equals 0 mod 2, as discussed. So the system has rank n-1. Therefore, the number of solutions is 2^{(number of variables - rank)} }, which is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 2^0 = 1? Wait, no. Wait, variables are the edges (n-1 variables), and the system has rank (n-1) because the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2. So for even n, the system has rank n-1. So the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? That can't be right. Because for example, in the sample case where n=2, there is 1 solution. Which matches. For n=2, there is one edge. The equations are for vertex 1 and 2. Both equations say that the sum of x_e (which is the single edge) is 1 mod 2. So x_e must be 1. Which gives one solution. So yes, the number of solutions is 1. So for general even n, the number of solutions for the system is 1? That seems surprising. Because for each tree structure, the number of valid weightings is 1? But that would mean that for each tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign the weights to satisfy the conditions. But that seems counterintuitive. How can that be?\n\nWait, let's think for n=4. Suppose we have a tree. Let's take a star-shaped tree with root 1 connected to 2,3,4. Then, for each of the vertices 2,3,4, their degree is 1, so the sum of x_e for their edges must be 1 mod 2. For vertex 1, which has degree 3, the sum of x_e (the three edges) must be 1 mod 2. So for each of the edges connected to 2,3,4 (each is a single edge), their x_e must be 1. So x_1-2 = 1, x_1-3 = 1, x_1-4 = 1. Then, for vertex 1, the sum is 1+1+1 = 3 mod 2 is 1. Which satisfies the condition. So that's one solution. So indeed, for this tree structure, there's exactly one valid weighting. \n\nBut suppose we have a different tree structure. Let's take a chain 1-2-3-4. Then, the edges are e1 (1-2), e2 (2-3), e3 (3-4). Now, for each vertex:\n\nVertex 1: degree 1. So x_e1 = 1.\n\nVertex 2: degree 2. Sum x_e1 + x_e2 = 1 mod 2.\n\nVertex 3: degree 2. Sum x_e2 + x_e3 = 1 mod 2.\n\nVertex 4: degree 1. x_e3 = 1.\n\nSo, from vertex 1 and 4: x_e1 = 1 and x_e3 = 1. Then, substituting into vertex 2's equation: 1 + x_e2 = 1 mod 2 → x_e2 = 0. Then vertex 3's equation: 0 + 1 = 1 mod 2. Which holds. So the solution is x_e1 = 1, x_e2 = 0, x_e3 = 1. Thus, exactly one solution. So again, one solution for this tree structure.\n\nSo it seems that for any tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign the edge weights to satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the number of good trees is equal to the number of tree structures multiplied by 1. So the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} (number of trees) multiplied by 1. But wait, the original problem says that the total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}. So for each tree structure, there are 2^{n-1} possible weightings. But the number of valid weightings for a good tree is 1 per tree structure. Therefore, the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 1.\n\nBut that would imply that for each tree structure, there's exactly one valid weighting. Which seems to be the case based on our previous examples. So how does that work?\n\nBecause the system of equations is such that for any tree, the system has exactly one solution. Because the system is determined. So the rank of the system is (n-1) equations (since the sum of all equations is zero, which is compatible for even n). Therefore, the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1. So yes, exactly one solution per tree structure.\n\nTherefore, the total number of good trees is the number of trees (n^{n-2}) multiplied by 1. So for even n, the number of good trees is n^{n-2}.\n\nBut then, the problem asks for the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees. Since for each tree structure, there is exactly one valid weighting, and the sum is over all tree structures, each contributing their d(1,n) under their unique weighting.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: compute the sum of d(1,n) over all possible tree structures (each with their unique valid weighting), multiplied by 1 (since each tree contributes once).\n\nSo the problem now becomes: for each tree T, compute d(1,n) under the unique valid weighting of T, then sum over all trees T.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum?\n\nLet me think about what d(1,n) is. It's the sum of the weights of the edges along the path from 1 to n in the tree T. But the weights are determined by the unique solution to the system of equations for the tree T.\n\nSo the question is: for a given tree T, what is the sum of the weights along the path between 1 and n?\n\nBut how can we find this sum for all trees T?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find some property that allows us to compute the sum over all trees.\n\nLet me think about the weighting. For each tree T, the edge weights are uniquely determined. How can I find the weight of each edge?\n\nLet me think again about the system of equations. Each edge is part of two vertices' equations. The system is such that for each vertex, the sum of x_e (where x_e is 0 or 1, representing the weight being 1 or -1) is 1 mod 2. \n\nBut solving this system for a tree. How can I find the x_e's?\n\nLet me think of the tree as a graph. Let me pick a root, say node 1, and perform a traversal. For example, in a tree, we can assign variables based on parent-child relationships.\n\nSuppose we root the tree at node 1. For each node, except the root, there is exactly one parent. Let me consider the edges as directed from parent to child. Let me think about the equations.\n\nFor the root (node 1), the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. For each non-root node v, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to it (which includes the edge to its parent and any edges to children) must be 1 mod 2.\n\nBut perhaps we can express the variables in terms of each other. Let me think recursively. For example, for each node v (except root), let me denote the edge between v and its parent as e_v. Then, the equation for v is x_e_v plus the sum of x_e for edges between v and its children equals 1 mod 2. However, since the tree is arbitrary, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since the system is determined, perhaps there's a unique way to assign the variables. For example, if we choose a root (like node 1), and for each node, assign the variable x_e (edge between parent and node) based on the equations.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each node, except the root, we can determine the value of x_e (the edge between it and its parent) based on the equations for the node.\n\nLet me take the root node. Its equation is the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it. Let's say the root has degree k. Then, the sum of all x_e's for these edges is 1 mod 2. However, for each of its children, their equations will involve x_e (the edge between them and the root). Let's think about this.\n\nLet me consider the tree rooted at node 1. For each non-root node v, let e_v be the edge connecting v to its parent. The equation for node v is:\n\nx_{e_v} + (sum of x_e for edges from v to its children) = 1 mod 2.\n\nBut for each child of v, their equation will involve x_{e_child} (the edge between them and their parent, which is v). This seems recursive.\n\nBut perhaps we can set the variables for the edges in a way that allows us to compute them. For example, for each node v (starting from the root), we can process its children and determine x_e for the edge to the child.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For the root (node 1), we have some number of edges. Let's suppose we have a way to determine the variables for the edges connected to the root. However, the root's equation requires that the sum of all x_e's for edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. However, for each of these edges, their other end is a child of the root. Let me think of the root's children. For each child u of the root, the equation for u is x_{e_u} (the edge between root and u) plus the sum of x_e's for edges from u to its children equals 1 mod 2. \n\nBut if I can set the variables for the edges from u to its children, then I can determine x_{e_u} based on that equation. However, this seems like a problem of dependencies. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system can be solved by setting the variables for all edges except those connected to the root, and then solving for the root's edges. But since the system is determined, perhaps there's a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any tree, the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n is equal to -1 multiplied by something. Let me think of the sample case where n=4. In the third sample, the answer was -10 mod MOD, which for n=4 (even) is correct.\n\nBut how to find the sum over all trees?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the contribution of each edge to the total sum. For each edge e, how many times does it contribute its weight (either +1 or -1) to the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees?\n\nBecause the total sum is the sum over all good trees of the sum of edge weights on the path from 1 to n. Which is equivalent to the sum over all edges e of (weight of e in the tree) multiplied by the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nBut since for each tree, the weight of e is either 1 or -1, and the number of trees where e is on the path is some value. However, for each tree, the weight of e is determined uniquely. So perhaps we can find, for each edge e, the expected value (over all trees) of (weight of e) multiplied by the indicator that e is on the path from 1 to n. Then multiply by the total number of trees (since each tree contributes once).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nBut first, for a given edge e, what is the probability (over all trees) that e is on the path between 1 and n? Well, since the trees are all possible labeled trees, and for each tree, the path between 1 and n is unique.\n\nBut the number of trees where e is on the path between 1 and n can be computed as follows. Let's think of e as connecting nodes u and v. For the edge e to be on the path between 1 and n, one of u or v must be in the subtree of the other when considering the tree rooted at 1 (but this depends on the tree structure). Alternatively, for any tree, the edge e is on the path between 1 and n if and only if removing e splits the tree into two components, one containing 1 and the other containing n. So for each possible edge e between u and v, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees where u is in the component containing 1 and v is in the component containing n when e is removed (or vice versa).\n\nBut how many trees have e on the path from 1 to n?\n\nThe number of such trees can be calculated using the formula from combinatorics. For a given pair of nodes u and v, the number of trees where the path between u and v includes edge e. Wait, but here e is not fixed. Wait, perhaps we can think of the number of trees where the edge between u and v exists and lies on the path between 1 and n. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for any pair of nodes u and v, the number of trees where u and v are connected directly by an edge and that edge is on the path between 1 and n. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the number of trees where the path from 1 to n includes a particular edge e. Let me think of the number of trees where e is present and lies on the path from 1 to n. For this, we can consider that e connects two nodes, say a and b. For e to be on the path from 1 to n, one of a or b must be in the subtree of the other when the tree is rooted at 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for any edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of trees where e is present multiplied by the probability that e is on the path between 1 and n in a random tree.\n\nBut the number of trees that include edge e is (n^{n-2}) * [probability that e is present in a random tree]. Wait, no. The number of trees that include edge e is (n^{n-2}) multiplied by (something). Wait, Cayley's formula says that the number of trees on n labeled nodes is n^{n-2}. For any particular edge, the number of trees that contain it is n^{n-3} * 2. Wait, no. Wait, there is a formula: the number of trees on n labeled nodes that contain a particular edge is 2 * n^{n-3}.\n\nBut how?\n\nYes, according to Cayley's formula, the number of trees on n nodes is n^{n-2}. For any specific edge (u, v), the number of trees containing that edge is n^{n-3} * 2? Or n^{n-3} * 1? Let me think.\n\nThere's a theorem that says that the number of trees containing a particular edge is 2 * n^{n-3} ?\n\nAlternatively, think of the number of trees containing edge (u, v). To count this, imagine that we contract the edge (u, v) into a single node. The resulting graph has n-1 nodes. The number of trees on the contracted graph is (n-1)^{n-3} (by Cayley's formula). However, each such tree corresponds to a tree on the original n nodes that contains the edge (u, v). But there are multiple ways to split the contraction. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, when you have a tree containing (u, v), you can think of it as a tree on n nodes where u and v are connected. The number of such trees is (n^{n-2}) * [probability that a random tree contains (u, v)].\n\nBut another way: Let's fix the edge (u, v). For any tree, the number of edges is n-1. The total number of possible edges is C(n, 2). So the probability that a random tree contains (u, v) is (n-1) / C(n, 2) ) * something? No, that's not correct. Because the trees are not uniform in edge selection.\n\nBut there's a known formula for this. According to the formula, the number of labeled trees on n nodes that contain a specific edge is 2 * n^{n-3}. \n\nFor example, when n=2, the number of trees is 1, and the number of trees containing the only possible edge is 1. According to the formula, 2*2^{2-3} = 2*(1/2) = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. The number of trees is 3^{1}=3. Each tree has 2 edges. For any specific edge, how many trees contain it? For example, the number of trees containing edge (1,2) is 2. Because the third node can be connected to either 1 or 2. So formula gives 2*3^{3-3} = 2*1=2. Correct.\n\nSo the formula holds. Therefore, for any specific edge, the number of trees that contain it is 2 * n^{n-3}.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nWell, for each edge e, the number of trees where e is present is 2 * n^{n-3}. But we need to know, among those trees, how many have e on the path between 1 and n. \n\nBut how many trees contain e and have e on the path between 1 and n?\n\nLet me think. Suppose e is between u and v. For e to be on the path between 1 and n, one of u or v must be in the subtree of the other when the tree is rooted at 1. But this depends on the tree structure.\n\nAlternatively, for any tree containing e, the probability that e is on the path between 1 and n is equal to the probability that, in a random tree, the edge e is on the path between 1 and n. \n\nBut how can we calculate that?\n\nAnother approach: For a fixed edge e between u and v, the number of trees that contain e and have e on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of trees where e is present and 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed. \n\nWhen we remove e, the tree splits into two components. Let’s say one component contains 1 and the other contains n. Then, the edge e is on the path between 1 and n. \n\nThe number of such trees is equal to the number of ways to split the nodes into two subsets S and T, such that S contains 1 and T contains n, and S and T are connected by e. Then, for each such split, the number of trees where e is present and splits the tree into S and T is (|S|^{ |S| - 1} ) * ( |T|^{ |T| - 1} )) ?\n\nWait, this is similar to the concept of counting the number of trees that have a particular cut. \n\nYes, according to the formula, the number of trees that have edge e and split the graph into subsets S and T is |S|^{ |S| - 1} * |T|^{ |T| - 1} }, where |S| + |T| = n. \n\nBut in our case, the subsets S and T must contain 1 and n respectively. So for a fixed edge e between u and v, the number of trees that contain e and have e on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of ways to split the nodes into subsets S and T, such that S contains 1 and T contains n, and e connects S and T. \n\nBut since e is fixed, this split is determined by whether u is in S and v in T or vice versa. However, since the split must have S and T containing 1 and n, respectively, we can think as follows:\n\nAssume that e connects u and v. For e to be on the path between 1 and n, one of u or v must be in the subtree of the other when the tree is rooted at 1, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, for the split to have S containing 1 and T containing n, and e is between S and T. So for the edge e between u and v, either u is in S and v is in T, or vice versa. But S must contain 1, T must contain n. So the number of such splits is equal to the number of ways to choose S and T such that 1 is in S, n is in T, and e is between S and T.\n\nBut since e is fixed, this is only possible if one of u or v is in S and the other in T. Let's say u is in S and v is in T. Then, the number of such splits is the number of ways to choose S containing 1 and u, and T containing n and v, and S and T are complementary. But this seems complex. However, there's a formula for this.\n\nThe number of trees that contain edge e and have e on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of ways to choose subsets S and T such that 1 is in S, n is in T, and e connects S and T. For each such split, the number of trees is |S|^{ |S| - 1} * |T|^{ |T| - 1} }, but multiplied by 1 (since e is fixed as the edge between S and T).\n\nBut since e is fixed, the split is determined by which side of the edge contains 1 and n. So for example, if u is in the same component as 1 and v is in the same component as n, then the split is S = (nodes in u's component) and T = rest. But how to count this?\n\nAlternatively, consider that for the edge e between u and v, the number of trees that contain e and have e on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of trees where e is present and 1 and n are in different components when e is removed. \n\nThe number of such trees is equal to the number of ways to split the nodes into two parts, one containing 1 and the other containing n, and then build a tree on each part and connect them via e. \n\nThe number of ways to split the nodes into two parts S and T, where S contains 1 and T contains n, and e connects S and T. But since e is fixed between u and v, this requires that one of u or v is in S and the other in T. So for example, if u is in S and v is in T, then S must contain 1 and T must contain n. \n\nThe number of such splits is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset S containing 1 and u, and T containing n and v, such that S and T are complementary. But this seems too vague. \n\nBut here's a better approach: For any edge e between u and v, the number of trees that contain e and have e on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of trees that contain e multiplied by the probability that e is on the path between 1 and n in a random tree that contains e.\n\nLet's think of this probability. Given that a tree contains edge e, what is the probability that e is on the path between 1 and n?\n\nIn a random tree containing e, the path between 1 and n is unique. The edge e is on this path if and only if 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed. \n\nWhen e is removed, the tree splits into two subtrees. Let’s say that one subtree has size k and the other has size (n - k). The probability that 1 and n are in different subtrees is equal to (k * (n - k)) / (C(n, 2)), but no, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, given that the tree contains e, the probability that 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed. Let me think: when you have a tree with edge e between u and v. When you remove e, the tree is split into two subtrees. Let’s call them A and B. For e to be on the path between 1 and n, 1 must be in A and n in B, or vice versa. \n\nThe number of ways this can happen depends on the sizes of A and B. But how can we compute this for all possible trees?\n\nBut perhaps the probability that 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed is equal to 2/(n) ?\n\nWait, for a random tree that contains e, what is the probability that 1 and n are in different components after removing e?\n\nLet me think of the tree as being built in a way that e is present. Imagine that we fix e as part of the tree. Then, the rest of the tree is formed. For the purposes of the path between 1 and n, the position of 1 and n relative to e determines whether e is on the path.\n\nBut this feels too abstract. Maybe there's a clever way to compute the expected value.\n\nBut perhaps instead of focusing on individual edges, we can think about the sum over all trees of d(1,n) as follows.\n\nRecall that for each tree, the d(1,n) is the sum of the weights of edges along the path from 1 to n. And for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the system of equations.\n\nBut what is the sum of the weights of the edges along the path from 1 to n for a given tree?\n\nLet me think about the system of equations again. For each tree, the edge weights are determined uniquely. How?\n\nLet me think of the tree as a graph. Let's consider the path from 1 to n. Let's denote this path as P. Let me think of the sum of the weights of edges on P as S. What is S?\n\nBut how does the system of equations relate to this sum?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire tree. For each vertex, the product of its incident edge weights is -1. \n\nLet me think about the product of all these products. As before, this equals (-1)^n. Also, this equals the product of all edge weights squared, which is 1. So for even n, this holds. \n\nBut how to relate this to the sum S?\n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the number of -1 edges incident to each node. For each node, the number of -1 edges is odd. \n\nBut perhaps we can find some relation between the sum S and the number of -1 edges on the path from 1 to n. \n\nBut I'm stuck here. Let me think of small examples.\n\nTake n=2. There is only one tree, with one edge between 1 and 2. The weight of this edge must be -1, since for each node, the product of incident edges is -1. So the sum d(1,2) is -1. Which matches the first sample.\n\nFor n=4, the third sample says that the sum over all good trees is -10. The number of good trees is 4^{4-2} = 16. But according to the note, there are 16 good trees. The sum of d(1,4) over all trees is -10.\n\nBut how can we find this for general n?\n\nLet me think about the sum over all trees of d(1,n). Since each tree contributes its unique d(1,n), which is the sum of the weights of edges on the path from 1 to n. Let me denote this sum as S_T for tree T. Our goal is to find the sum of S_T over all trees T.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following: For each tree T, the sum S_T is equal to the number of edges on the path from 1 to n with weight -1 minus the number of edges with weight 1. Because each edge contributes +1 or -1. So S_T = (number of -1 edges on path) * (-1) + (number of +1 edges) * 1 = (number of +1 edges - number of -1 edges) = (total edges on path) - 2 * (number of -1 edges). But the total edges on the path is the length of the path from 1 to n. In a tree, the length of the path between 1 and n is equal to the depth of n in the tree rooted at 1, but varies depending on the tree structure.\n\nHowever, this seems difficult to compute for all trees. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find that for each tree, the sum S_T is equal to -1. But that's not true for n=4. In the sample, the sum is -10 over 16 trees. So average is -10/16 = -5/8. So it's not a constant.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern. For n=2, sum is -1. For n=4, sum is -10. Let's see:\n\nn=2: sum is -1 = -(2-1) * 1 ?\n\nn=4: sum is -10 = -(4-1) * something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the expected value of S_T for a random tree. For n=2, it's -1. For n=4, it's -10/16 = -5/8. Let's see if there's a pattern.\n\nBut how can we find this expected value?\n\nLet me think of the contribution of each edge to the expected value. For each edge e, the expected value of its contribution to S_T is equal to the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by the expected value of its weight, given that it",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the distances $d(1, n)$ for all good trees with $n$ vertices.
