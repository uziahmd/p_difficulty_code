    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum in the array after removing one element. So my goal is to find which element to remove such that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nFirst, let's consider the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). But when we remove one element, the new max and min could be different. For example, if the original array has elements [1,3,3,7], removing 7 gives [1,3,3], max is 3, min is 1, difference 2. If we remove 1, then the array becomes [3,3,7], difference is 4. So clearly, removing the max or min elements might help.\n\nBut how do I find which element to remove?\n\nLet me think: The optimal choice would be to remove either the maximum element or the minimum element. Because if we remove an element that's not the max or min, the max and min of the array remain the same, so the instability remains the same as before. Wait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4]. If I remove 2, the array becomes [1,3,4], min is 1, max is 4, difference 3. Which is same as original (4-1=3). So removing elements that are not the extremes doesn't change the instability. Therefore, the only way to reduce the instability is to remove either the maximum or the minimum element.\n\nWait, but maybe there are cases where removing a certain element that's not the max or min can lead to a smaller instability? Let me think of an example. Suppose the array is [1, 5, 5, 5, 10]. Original instability is 9. If I remove 1, the instability is 10-5=5. If I remove 10, it's 5-1=4. But if I remove one of the 5s, the array becomes [1,5,5,10], which has instability 9 again. So no improvement. So in this case, removing the max or min is better.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6]. Original instability is 5. If I remove 1, the instability is 6-2=4. If I remove 6, it's 5-1=4. If I remove one of the 5s, the array becomes [1,2,5,6], instability is 5. So again, removing the max or min gives better results.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal approach is to consider two cases: when we remove the first element (the min) or the last element (the max) in the sorted array. Wait, but the array may have multiple elements with the same value as min or max.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if the array has multiple minima or maxima, removing any of them would give the same result. So for example, if the array is [1,1,3,3], removing either 1 or 3 would be the way to go. So the minimal instability would be 3-1=2. But if you remove one of the 1s, the array becomes [1,3,3], instability is 2. If you remove one of the 3s, the array becomes [1,1,3], instability is 2. So same result.\n\nSo the key idea is: the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between:\n\n- the instability after removing the first occurrence of the min element (so the new min is the next smallest element, and the max is the original max, but if there are multiple min elements, removing one leaves others, so the min is still the same?)\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. Suppose the array is [1,1,3,3]. The original instability is 3-1=2. If I remove one of the 1s, the array becomes [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. If I remove one of the 3s, the array becomes [1,1,3], instability is 3-1=2. So the instability is same as before. So in this case, removing any element doesn't change the instability. But that's because the original instability was already the same as the instability after removal.\n\nBut in this case, the answer would be 2, which is the same as the original instability. However, the original instability is 2, but after removing one element, the instability is still 2. So in this case, the answer is 2.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If we remove 5, the instability is 4-1=3. If we remove 1, it's 5-2=3. So the minimal instability is 3.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between (max of the array after removing one min element) minus (min of the array after removing one min element) and (max of the array after removing one max element) minus (min of the array after removing one max element).\n\nWait, but how do I compute these?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between:\n\n- the instability of the array with the first element removed (if the first element is the min or max?), or maybe not. Wait, no. The problem is that the array may have multiple minima and maxima. So perhaps the optimal approach is to sort the array, and then check for each possible position where removing that element would give the minimal instability.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, checking all possibilities would take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nWait, but for each possible element to remove, how can I compute the instability quickly?\n\nIf the array is sorted, then for each element, when you remove it, the new min and max are either the same as the original (if the element is not the min or max), or they are the next elements.\n\nSo here's an idea: sort the array first. Then, the original min is a[0], original max is a[-1].\n\nIf we remove the first element (a[0]), then the new min is a[1], and the new max is a[-1]. So the instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\nIf we remove the last element (a[-1]), then the new max is a[-2], and the new min is a[0], so the instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n\nIf we remove any other element (say, a[i] where 0 < i < n-1), then the min and max of the array remain the same as the original, so the instability is the same as original (a[-1] - a[0]).\n\nSo, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], original instability). Wait, but original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. So if we compare these three options.\n\nWait, but in this case, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. When we remove the first element, the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. When we remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal among these two options and the original instability?\n\nWait, but for example, if the array is [1,3,3,7], sorted. Original instability is 6. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 7 -3 =4. If we remove the last element (7), the instability is 3 -1 = 2. So the minimal is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut according to the above idea, the minimal is min( a[-1] -a[1], a[-2] -a[0], original instability). But original instability is 6, and the two options are 4 and 2, so min is 2. So that works.\n\nAnother example: [1, 100000]. If we remove the first element, the instability is 0. If we remove the second element, the instability is 0. So the answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,3,4]. Original instability is 3. If we remove first element, the instability is 4-2=2. If we remove last element, instability is 3-1=2. So the minimal is 2. Which is better than original.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]). Because when you remove the first element, you get a[-1] - a[1], and when you remove the last element, you get a[-2] - a[0]. All other elements when removed don't change the instability, so the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. So the minimal is min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], ... ? )\n\nWait, but what if the array has more than two elements, and removing some middle element could lead to a better instability?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If we remove 2, the array becomes [1,4,5], instability is 4. If we remove 4, the array becomes [1,2,5], instability is 4. So no improvement. But if we remove 5, the instability is 4-1=3. If we remove 1, it's 5-2=3. So the minimal is 3. Which is min between (a[-1]-a[1] =5-2=3, a[-2]-a[0]=4-1=3). So the answer is 3.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is min between those two options.\n\nAnother example: [1,3,4,5,7]. Original instability is 6. If I remove 3, the array becomes [1,4,5,7], instability 6. If I remove 4, the array becomes [1,3,5,7], instability 6. So no improvement. But if I remove 1, instability is 7-3=4. If I remove 7, instability is 5-1=4. So the minimal is 4, which is min between a[-1] -a[1] (7-3=4) and a[-2] -a[0] (5-1=4). So that works.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal possible instability after removing exactly one element is the minimum between (the instability after removing the first element) and (the instability after removing the last element). Because all other elements when removed don't change the instability.\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 100]. Then, the original instability is 99. If we remove the first element, the instability is 100 - 2 = 98. If we remove the last element, the instability is 9 - 1 = 8. Which is better. So the answer is 8. But if there's an element in the middle that's not the min or max, but removing it would make the instability smaller? Well, no. Because if you remove any element that's not the min or max, the instability remains the same as original. So in this case, the answer is min(98, 8) =8.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nSort the array. Then, the answer is min( (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) )\n\nWait, but what if the array has multiple elements with the same value?\n\nFor example, [1,1,1,1]. Then, removing any element gives [1,1,1], instability 0. Which is min between (a[-1] - a[1] = 1-1=0 and a[-2] -a[0] =1-1=0). So correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 1, 2, 3]. Original instability is 2. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the last element (3), the instability is 2-1=1. Which is better. So the answer is 1, which is a[-2] - a[0] = 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array. Then, the answer is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what about when n is 2?\n\nLike the second example in the input: [1, 100000]. After sorting, the array is [1, 100000]. Then, removing the first element gives instability 0, removing the last gives 0. So the answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo for n=2, the answer is 0, since after removing one element, the array has only one element, so instability is 0.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nSort the array. Then, compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what about when n is larger than 2?\n\nYes, for n >= 2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n and array a.\n\nSort a.\n\nIf n == 2, then the answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nWait, but why not consider other possibilities? For example, if there are multiple minima and maxima. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the array is [1,1,3,3]. After sorting, the array is [1,1,3,3]. Then, the answer would be min( a[-1] - a[1] = 3-1=2, a[-2] -a[0] = 3-1=2 ). So the answer is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut if we remove one of the 1s, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,2,3]. The answer would be min(3-2=1, 2-1=1). So answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2: output 0.\n\nElse: compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 3?\n\nFor example, [1, 2, 5]. Original instability is 4. If we remove 5, the instability is 2-1=1. If we remove 1, the instability is 5-2=3. So the answer is 1. Which is a[-2] - a[0] = 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,3,5]. Removing 5 gives instability 3-1=2. Removing 1 gives 5-3=2. So the answer is 2. Which is min( (5-3)=2, (3-1)=2 ) → 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The answer is min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo yes, this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print( min(option1, option2) )\n\nWait, but what about when there are multiple elements that can be removed, leading to even better options?\n\nFor example, suppose the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. The sorted array is [1,3,4,5,7]. So the options are:\n\noption1 = 7 - 3 = 4.\n\noption2 = 5 - 1 = 4.\n\nBut what if we remove the 3? The array becomes [1,4,5,7], instability 7-1=6. Which is worse. So the answer is 4.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7]. So the options are 7-2=5 and 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7]. So sorted array is [1,2,5,5,5,5,7]. The options are 7 - 2 = 5, and 5 - 1 =4. So the answer is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo this approach seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's test the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\nn is 4.\n\noption1 = 7 - 3 =4?\n\nWait, a[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3. So 7-3=4.\n\noption2 is a[-2] (3) - a[0] (1) → 2. So min(4,2) is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. The answer is min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) → 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1,1,1]. The answer is min(1-1=0, 1-1=0) → 0.\n\nAnother case: n=5, array [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. So options are 100 - 2 = 98, and 4-1=3. So answer is 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3 and the array is [1, 2, 100]. So the code would compute option1 as 100 - 2 =98, option2 as 2 - 1 =1. So the answer is 1. Which is correct, because removing 100 gives [1,2], instability 1. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print( min(option1, option2) )\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nsort a.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] ) )\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1 =7 -3=4, option2=3-1=2 → min is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nn=3, [1, 2, 3] → min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) → 1.\n\nAnother case: n=5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) →3.\n\nAnother case: [1, 1, 3, 3]. min(3-1=2, 3-1=2) →2.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead input: first line is n, then the second line is list of integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']? Or perhaps the input is read as two separate test cases?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer n. The second line contains n integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. But in programming competition problems, each test case is processed separately. However, the code is supposed to read from stdin, and process one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as per the following. So the user is to read one test case. The sample input shows two examples, but in practice, the code should read one test case.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\nBut that's probably a way to show two separate test cases. But in reality, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for each run, has one test case. So the code should read n, then the array.\n\nSo the code should read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen process as above.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nBut let me test for n=2, the code returns 0. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when n is 3, and the array is [1, 1, 1]. The code returns min(1-1=0, 1-1=0) →0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. The code returns min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) →1. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThis code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is calculated as the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. By removing one element, we aim to minimize this difference.\n2. **Sorting Insight**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the potential minimum and maximum values after removing one element. When the array is sorted, the minimum value is at the start and the maximum value is at the end.\n3. **Key Observations**:\n   - Removing the first element (minimum) or the last element (maximum) can potentially reduce the instability.\n   - For arrays with more than two elements, the optimal instability after removing one element can be determined by considering two scenarios:\n     - Removing the first element (which is the smallest) and calculating the instability using the second smallest and the largest elements.\n     - Removing the last element (which is the largest) and calculating the instability using the second largest and the smallest elements.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By sorting the array once, we can efficiently compute the two potential instabilities and take the minimum of the two.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers.\n- **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n- **Handling Edge Case**: If the array has exactly two elements, removing either will result in an array with a single element, hence the instability is 0.\n- **Calculating Options**: For arrays with more than two elements, we calculate the instability after removing the first element (considering the second smallest and the largest elements) and after removing the last element (considering the second largest and the smallest elements). The minimum of these two values is the answer.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is $O(n \\log n)$, making it suitable for large input sizes up to $10^5$.",
