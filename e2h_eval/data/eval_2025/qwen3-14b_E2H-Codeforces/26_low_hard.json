Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D. Let's think through how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So the sides are ordered such that x is between A and B, y is between B and C (but since B ≤ y and y ≤ C, and B ≤ C), and z is between C and D. Also, the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order x ≤ y ≤ z, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.\n\nSo the main idea is to iterate over all possible x, y, z that meet the constraints and check if x + y > z. However, given that the maximum value for D can be up to 5e5, iterating through all possible triples would be O(B*C*D) which is way too slow. For example, if B and C are 5e5, then even considering x and y would be O( (5e5)^2 ), which is 2.5e11 operations. That's impossible to compute in time.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's note that x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C, and z ranges from C to D. Also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, and y ≤ C ≤ z, the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z. Therefore, the triangle inequality requires x + y > z. So for each valid x and y, we need to find the number of z's that are between max(C, ... ) and D such that z < x + y. Wait, but z must be at least C. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, D] that are less than x + y. But also, since z has to be ≥ C, and also ≥ y (since y ≤ C and z ≥ C). Wait, no. The problem says that y is between B and C. So y can be as high as C. And z is between C and D. So z is ≥ C. Since y ≤ C, and z ≥ C, then z ≥ y. So the order is x ≤ y ≤ z. So for the triangle inequality, x + y > z must hold.\n\nSo for each x and y, the z's that are allowed are those that are in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. Because z has to be less than x + y. But z also has to be ≥ C and ≤ D. So the number of valid z's for a given x and y is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1), provided that x + y -1 ≥ C. Otherwise, there are zero such z's.\n\nBut wait, what if x + y -1 is less than C? Then there are no z's. So for each x and y, we need to compute the count of z's that are in [C, D] and ≤ x + y - 1. So the count is:\n\nif x + y -1 < C → 0\nelse:\n   upper = min(D, x + y -1)\n   count_z = upper - C + 1\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], compute the count_z as above, and sum all these counts.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that x ranges up to B (which could be 5e5), and y up to C (also 5e5). So the total number of (x,y) pairs is O(B*C), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11. Which is way too big for a brute force approach.\n\nSo we need a way to compute this sum without iterating through all possible x and y.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the sum over x and y of the count_z for each pair.\n\nLet me rephrase the count_z for a given x and y:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C else 0.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nif x + y > C, then:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1 )\n\nBut since x + y -1 can be larger than D, the min(D, ...) is",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key constraint for a non-degenerate triangle is that the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side. Given the constraints on the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can derive an efficient solution by focusing on the triangle inequality condition $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: The sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ are constrained such that $A \\leq x \\leq B$, $B \\leq y \\leq C$, and $C \\leq z \\leq D$. Since $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the triangle inequality reduces to checking if $x + y > z$.\n2. **Efficient Counting**: For each valid pair $(x, y)$, the number of valid $z$ values that satisfy $x + y > z$ can be determined by counting the integers in the range $[C, \\min(D, x + y - 1)]$.\n3. **Mathematical Insight**: Instead of iterating through all possible pairs $(x, y)$, we can use prefix sums to precompute the counts for different ranges of $x + y$, which allows us to compute the total number of valid triangles efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        A = int(input[idx])\n        B = int(input[idx+1])\n        C = int(input[idx+2])\n        D = int(input[idx+3])\n        cases.append((A, B, C, D))\n        idx += 4\n    \n    results = []\n    for A, B, C, D in cases:\n        # Precompute the prefix sums for the counts of z values\n        # For a given s = x + y, the number of z's is max(0, min(D, s-1) -
