The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q and the inversion count of p is greater than that of q. And we need to compute this modulo a given mod value.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. We need to consider all possible pairs of permutations p and q, but only those where p is lex smaller than q and inv(p) > inv(q). The answer is the total count of such pairs.\n\nBut with n up to 500, the total number of permutations is n! which is way too big for brute force. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's consider that for all pairs of distinct permutations (since p and q are different?), but wait, the problem says p and q are two permutations. But since p is lex smaller than q, they can't be the same. So all pairs (p, q) where p < q in lex order, and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q. The total number of such pairs is (total permutations choose 2), because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. So the total number is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But we need to find how many of these pairs have inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nWait, but for each pair (p, q) where p < q, we can check if inv(p) > inv(q). The problem is to count all such pairs.\n\nBut considering that for each pair (p, q) where p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). But since we need the count of those where inv(p) > inv(q), perhaps we can find some symmetry here.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: For all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of the following holds:\n\n- p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)\n- p < q and inv(p) < inv(q)\n- p < q and inv(p) = inv(q)\n- Or q < p and inv(q) > inv(p)\n- Or q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)\n- Or q < p and inv(q) = inv(p)\n\nBut since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p is true. So for all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, we can split into two cases: p < q and q < p. \n\nNow, suppose we look at all ordered pairs where p != q. Let’s denote:\n\nA = number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)\nB = number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q)\nC = number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q)\n\nSimilarly, for the pairs (q, p) where q < p, the same counts would be similar. But since for each pair (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p is true.\n\nSo the total number of pairs (p, q) where p != q is 2*(A + B + C) = n!*(n! - 1). Wait no, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q is n! * (n! - 1). But the number of ordered pairs where p < q is exactly (n! choose 2) = (n! * (n! - 1))/2. Similarly for q < p. So A + B + C = (n! * (n! - 1))/2.\n\nNow, for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the following is true:\n\nEither p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) → contributes to A\n\nOr p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) → contributes to B\n\nOr p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) → contributes to C\n\nOr q < p and inv(q) > inv(p) → which would be equivalent to p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) if we swap p and q. Wait, no. Let me think: if q < p, then the pair (q, p) would be considered in the case where q < p. So for the unordered pair {p, q}, if p < q, then it's in the first case, else in the second.\n\nBut for the entire set of ordered pairs, the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to A + D,",
