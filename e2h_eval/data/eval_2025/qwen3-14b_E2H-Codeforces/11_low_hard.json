A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (bottles of drink), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, each toast requires nl ml of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and np grams of salt per friend.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for each toast, each friend uses these amounts. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. Because each of the n friends has nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend needs one slice). And for salt, each toast requires n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available are:\n\nDrink: k * l ml.\n\nLime slices: c * d slices.\n\nSalt: p grams.\n\nThen, for each toast, the total required is:\n\ndrink_per_toast = n * nl\n\nlime_slices_per_toast = n * 1 (since each friend needs one slice per toast)\n\nsalt_per_toast = n * np\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts possible is the minimum between:\n\ntotal_drink // drink_per_toast,\n\ntotal_lime_slices // lime_slices_per_toast,\n\ntotal_salt // salt_per_toast.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each friend must make the same number of toasts. So the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total required for all friends is t * n * nl for drink, etc.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate how much total drink is available: total_drink = k * l.\n\nHow many toasts can be made based on drink: total_drink // (n * nl). Because each toast requires n * nl ml.\n\nSimilarly for limes: total_lime_slices = c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So total_lime_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So total_salt // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, no: nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs nl=3 ml. So for one toast, all friends together need 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So total_drink is 20. So 20 // 9 is 2 (since 9 * 2 = 18, 9*3=27 which is more than 20). So that gives 2.\n\nFor limes: c=10, d=8. Total slices is 10*8=80. Each toast requires n=3 slices. 80//3 is 26 (since 3*26=78, 3*27=81>80). But in the sample explanation, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that seems conflicting with my calculation. Let me check.\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. Therefore, per toast, the number of slices needed is n. So for the first sample, n=3. So per toast, 3 slices. The total slices available is 10 * 8 = 80. So 80 / 3 = 26.666..., so floor is 26. But the sample explanation says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that's a contradiction. What's going on here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nIn the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to my calculation, it's 80 / 3 = 26.666. So why",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, lime slices, and salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the constraints imposed by each resource and finding the minimum value among them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink available, the total number of lime slices, and the total amount of salt.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total number of lime slices available. Each toast requires `n` slices.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value of the constraints calculated from the drink, lime slices, and salt.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split into individual numbers\n    numbers = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the values\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = numbers\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Drink per toast (for all friends)\n    drink_per_toast = n * nl\n    # Number of toasts limited by drink\n    toasts_drink = total_drink // drink_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Lime slices per toast (for all friends)\n    lime_per_toast = n\n    # Number of toasts limited by limes\n    toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // lime_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate total salt available\n    total_salt = p\n    # Salt per toast (for all friends)\n    salt_per_toast = n * np\n    # Number of toasts limited by salt\n    toasts_salt = total_salt // salt_per_toast\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: We compute the total amount of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle. Similarly, we compute the total number of lime slices by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n- **Constraints Calculation**: For each resource (drink, lime slices, salt), we determine how many toasts can be made by dividing the total available resource by the amount required per toast for all friends.\n- **Result Determination**: The final result is the minimum value among the constraints derived from each resource, as this represents the limiting factor in the number of toasts that can be made.",
