A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs:\n\nThe input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFirst, calculate the total amount of drink available. That's k * l ml. Then, each toast requires n * nl ml in total for all friends. Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, all n friends together need n * nl ml. So the total drink required for t toasts is t * n * nl. Similarly for the other resources.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink used is n * nl. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl. So the total available drink is k*l. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, that's only if we have enough of the other resources.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Total slices available is c * d. So maximum toasts based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, total is n * np grams. So maximum toasts based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources must be sufficient. So the maximum possible t is the minimum of those three numbers.\n\nWait, but the example given in the first case:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. Let's compute each part.\n\nDrink: 4*5 =20 ml. For each toast, 3 friends *3 ml per toast (nl=3). So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. So that's 2 toasts. \n\nLimes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each. Total 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (since 3 friends each have one). 80 /3 is 26.666... floor 26. But wait, the sample says limes are enough for 80 toasts? Wait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, what's that?\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 10 *8 =80 toasts. Oh, but how? Because each toast requires n slices. So for each toast, n slices. So total slices is c*d. So the maximum toasts from limes is (c*d) // n. In the first example, c*d is 10*8=80. Divided by n=3, 80//3 is 26. So why does the note say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the note again.\n\nIn the first sample, the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, the limes would allow for 80 slices. Each toast requires n slices (n=3 friends). So 80 slices can make 80 /3 = 26.666 toasts, which would be 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". Wait, how?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. Therefore, for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the total number of slices available is c*d. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n. \n\nBut in the first sample, c*d",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the maximum possible toasts based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Drink Available**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n2. **Calculate Maximum Toasts Based on Drink**: Divide the total drink by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Calculate Total Lime Slices Available**: Multiply the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n4. **Calculate Maximum Toasts Based on Limes**: Divide the total slices by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n5. **Calculate Maximum Toasts Based on Salt**: Divide the total salt by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n6. **Determine the Result**: The result is the minimum value from the three calculated maximums, as all resources must be sufficient for the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    inputs = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the parameters\n    n = inputs[0]\n    k = inputs[1]\n    l = inputs[2]\n    c = inputs[3]\n    d = inputs[4]\n    p = inputs[5]\n    nl = inputs[6]\n    np = inputs[7]\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Drink required per toast for all friends\n    drink_per_toast = n * nl\n    # Maximum toasts based on drink\n    max_drink = total_drink // drink_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Slices required per toast for all friends\n    lime_per_toast = n\n    # Maximum toasts based on limes\n    max_lime = total_lime_slices // lime_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate salt required per toast for all friends\n    salt_per_toast = n * np\n    # Maximum toasts based on salt\n    max_salt = p // salt_per_toast\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n- **Drink Requirement per Toast**: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink for all friends.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is found by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n- **Salt Requirement per Toast**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt for all friends.\n- **Result Calculation**: The number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum of the maximum toasts possible based on drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring all resources are sufficient for the same number of toasts.",
