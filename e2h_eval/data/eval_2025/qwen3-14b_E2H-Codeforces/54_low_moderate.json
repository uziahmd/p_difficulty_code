Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. The goal is to minimize the absolute difference between the angle formed and a. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to calculate the possible angles that can be formed in a regular polygon. Let's think about the properties of regular polygons.\n\nIn a regular n-gon, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's for the internal angles of the polygon itself. However, the problem here is about angles formed by three vertices, not necessarily adjacent ones.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the angle at vertex v2 when we choose two other vertices v1 and v3. Let's imagine the regular polygon is inscribed in a circle. Since it's regular, all vertices lie on a circle. So, the central angles between consecutive vertices are 360/n degrees.\n\nNow, for three points on a circle, the angle at v2 (the vertex) depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2. For example, if v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps counterclockwise from v2, then the angle at v2 would be determined by the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a formula for the angle formed by three vertices of a regular polygon. Let me recall some geometry here.\n\nIn a regular polygon, if you pick three vertices v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the vertex where the angle is measured, then the angle at v2 depends on the number of sides between v1 and v3 around the polygon.\n\nLet me think: suppose between v2 and v1 there are k edges (so the arc between them is k * (360/n) degrees), and between v2 and v3 there are m edges. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 would be determined by the arc that's opposite to the angle. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inscribed angle theorem.\n\nAlternatively, considering the triangle formed by the three points. For a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, the angle at v2 would be equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, no. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc that it subtends. So if the angle is at v2, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2 would be the one that the angle subtends. Wait, but in that case, the angle at v2 would be half of that arc's measure. Wait, but if the polygon is regular, then the arc between v1 and v3 depends on how many steps apart they are.\n\nSo let's say that between v1 and v3, there are k steps along the perimeter of the polygon. Then the arc length (central angle) between them is k*(360/n) degrees. However, since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. The angle at v2 would be half of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Wait, but if the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 is, say, x degrees, then the angle at v2 would be x/2 degrees. But how does that relate to the number of steps between v1 and v3?\n\nAlternatively, think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Let me try to find a formula for the angle.\n\nSuppose that in a regular n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is θ = 2π/n radians. Now, if we have three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that between v2 and v1 there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are m steps counterclockwise (so the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter is k + m steps). But since the polygon is regular, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 would be (k + m) steps. However, the arc that includes v2 would be n - (k + m) steps. Wait, but the angle at v2 depends on which arc is considered.\n\nWait, the angle at v2 is formed by the two chords v2v1 and v2v3. The angle between those two chords depends on the arc that is opposite to the angle. That arc is the one that is not containing v2. So, for example",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves calculating the possible angles that can be formed using the properties of regular polygons and selecting the closest one to the target angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Regular Polygon Angles**: In a regular n-gon, each central angle between consecutive vertices is $ \\frac{360}{n} $ degrees. The angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of steps between these vertices along the perimeter.\n2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: The angle formed at a vertex (say v2) by two other vertices (v1 and v3) is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. This arc's measure is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3.\n3. **Closest Angle Calculation**: For each possible number of steps between v1 and v3, calculate the corresponding angle and determine which one is closest to the target angle `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Calculate the base angle for each possible step\n    # The angle at v2 is (k * 180 / n) degrees where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3\n    # Wait, no. Let me think again:\n    # The central angle between v1 and v3 is (k * 360 / n), and the inscribed angle would be half of that if the arc is the one opposite to v2.\n    # But since the polygon is convex, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 must be less than 180 degrees.\n    # Wait, but for a regular polygon, if you pick v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between them (along the perimeter), then the arc between them is k*(360/n) degrees.\n    # However, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps are between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon.\n    # Suppose between v2 and v1 there are i steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are j steps counterclockwise. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is (i + j) steps.\n    # But the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter is i + j, and the arc length is (i + j) * (360/n).\n    # The angle at v2 is half of the arc that is opposite to it, which is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. So the angle is (arc_length)/2 = (k * 360 / n) / 2 = k * 180 / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2.\n    # But since the polygon is convex, k can be from 1 to n-2. Because if k is n-1, then the arc would be almost the whole circle, but the angle would be (n-1)*180/n, which is more than 180 degrees, which is impossible for a convex polygon.\n    # Wait, but the angle at v2 must be less than 180 degrees. So the arc that does not contain v2 must be less than 180 degrees. Hence, k must be from 1 to (n-2)/2 steps? Or maybe not. Let's think again.\n    # For example, in a square (n=4), the possible angles are 45 degrees (when k=1) and 90 degrees (when k=2). Wait, for k=2 steps between v1 and v3, the arc is 2*360/4 = 180 degrees. Then the angle at v2 is 180/2 = 90 degrees. But if k=1, the arc is 90 degrees, angle is 45 degrees.\n    # So for any k from 1 to n-2, the angle is k * 180 / n. However, when k exceeds n/2, the arc that does not contain v2 would actually be the smaller arc. So perhaps the actual value of k is the minimal between k and n - k.\n    # Wait, no. Because when you choose v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between them along the arc that does not contain v2, k can be from 1 to n-2. But if k > n/2, then the arc that contains v2 would be shorter, and the angle would be based on the arc that doesn't contain v2. But that would make the angle larger than 90 degrees. However, for a convex polygon, all internal angles are less than 180, so the angle at v2 must be less than 180 degrees. So for k from 1 to n-2, the angle is k * 180 / n.\n\n    # Therefore, for each possible k in 1 <= k <= n-2, the angle is (k * 180) / n. We need to find the k that makes this angle as close as possible to a.\n\n    # Now, find the optimal k:\n    # The angle for k is angle_k = (k * 180) / n\n    # We want to minimize |angle_k - a|\n    # So we can compute for each k in 1 to n-2, compute the difference and find the minimum.\n\n    # However, since n can be up to 1e5, iterating through all k is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.\n\n    # Find the best k:\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    for k in range(1, n-1):\n        angle = (k * 180) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k or any, since the problem says any is acceptable\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n\n    # Now, once best_k is found, we need to choose three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 is formed by k steps between v1 and v3.\n\n    # Let's choose v2 as 1. Then, v1 is 2 (since there is 1 step from v2 to v1?), wait no. Let me think about how to arrange the vertices.\n\n    # For example, in a square (n=4), best_k could be 1 (angle 45) or 2 (angle 90). Let's say best_k is 1.\n\n    # If v2 is vertex 1, then v1 and v3 should be such that there are k steps between them along the arc not containing v2. How to arrange this?\n\n    # Let's fix v2 as 1. Then, v1 can be 2, and v3 can be 2 + k steps from v1, but this might not be correct. Alternatively, for k steps between v1 and v3, we can place v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between them when going around the polygon not passing through v2.\n\n    # Let's imagine v2 is vertex 1. Then, v1 can be vertex 2 (adjacent), and v3 can be vertex 2 + k steps away. Wait, perhaps the easiest way is to have v2 as vertex 1, v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + k) mod n, but need to adjust for the numbering.\n\n    # Wait, in a regular n-gon, the vertices are numbered 1 to n clockwise. So, for example, if v2 is vertex 1, then v1 can be vertex 2 (next vertex), and v3 can be vertex 2 + k steps away from v1, but in the direction that skips v2.\n\n    # Alternatively, for a given k, the angle is formed by choosing v2 as any vertex, and then v1 and v3 such that there are exactly k steps between them along the arc that does not contain v2.\n\n    # To construct such a triple, let's choose v2 as vertex 1. Then, v1 can be vertex 2 (the next vertex), and v3 can be vertex (2 + k) mod n. However, since the polygon is numbered from 1 to n, we need to handle the modulo correctly.\n\n    # For example, if n=4 and k=1, then v1 is 2, v3 is 2+1=3. So the triple is 2, 1, 3. Which is one of the examples given.\n\n    # So the general approach is: set v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k. But if 2 + k exceeds n, then wrap around.\n\n    # Wait, but 2 + k can be up to n-1 + k? No, because k ranges from 1 to n-2. For example, n=5, k=3: 2 + 3 = 5, which is valid. If k=4, then 2+4=6, which is larger than n=5. So perhaps the correct formula is v3 = (2 + k - 1) % n + 1. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\n    # The idea is that from v2 (vertex 1), moving clockwise, v1 is vertex 2. Then, from v1, moving clockwise k steps, we reach v3. However, since the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) must be k steps. Wait, but if we move k steps from v1 in the clockwise direction, then the arc between v1 and v3 would be k steps, and the arc that contains v2 would be n - k steps. So the arc that does not contain v2 is k steps, which is what we need.\n\n    # So for example, if v1 is 2, and we move k steps clockwise from v1, then v3 would be (2 + k - 1) mod n + 1. Wait, because moving k steps from 2 would be 2 + k. But if that exceeds n, then wrap around.\n\n    # For example, n=4, k=1: 2 + 1 = 3 → v3 is 3. Correct.\n    # n=4, k=2: 2+2=4 → v3 is 4. The arc between 2 and 4 is 2 steps, which is 180 degrees. The angle at v2 (1) would be 90 degrees. Which matches the example.\n\n    # So the formula for v3 is (v1 + k - 1) % n + 1? Or v1 + k? Since v1 is 2, adding k steps would be 2 + k. But if 2 + k exceeds n, then it wraps around.\n\n    # So in code, v3 = 2 + k. But if that's larger than n, subtract n. For example, if n=5, k=4, then 2+4=6 → 6-5=1. So v3 is 1. But then, the arc between v1 (2) and v3 (1) is 4 steps (from 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 1), which is k=4. The angle at v2 (1) would be 4 * 180 / 5 = 144 degrees. But wait, if v3 is 1, which is v2 itself, but the problem states that the three vertices must be distinct. So this case is invalid.\n\n    # Oh! That's a problem. So in our selection, we must ensure that v1, v2, v3 are distinct.\n\n    # So when choosing v3, we need to make sure that it's not equal to v2. Also, v1 should not be equal to v3.\n\n    # Let's think again. For the chosen k, the arc between v1 and v3 is k steps. So the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 must be k. Therefore, if v2 is fixed as 1, v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + k steps in the clockwise direction. But if 2 + k exceeds n, then wrap around.\n\n    # But if 2 + k exceeds n, then v3 would be (2 + k - n). However, this might be equal to 1 (v2), which is not allowed.\n\n    # For example, n=5, k=3. v1 is 2, v3 is 2+3=5. Which is okay. If k=4, v3 is 2+4=6 → 6-5=1, which is v2. Not allowed. So in this case, we need to avoid k values that would make v3 equal to v2.\n\n    # So perhaps the correct approach is to choose v3 as (v1 + k) mod n, but adjust to ensure that v3 is not equal to v2.\n\n    # Alternatively, for the selected k, the correct positions are v2 = 1, v1 = 2, v3 = 2 + k if it is <=n, else 2 + k - n. However, if 2 + k - n == 1, then it's invalid.\n\n    # Let's think about the maximum k. For k up to n-2. For example, when k = n-2, then v3 = 2 + n-2 = n. Which is valid. For k = n-1, but since k is up to n-2, that's not considered.\n\n    # So for k in 1..n-2, 2 + k is up to 2 + n-2 = n. Which is valid. So in that case, v3 is 2 + k, which is between 3 and n. Thus, v3 is not equal to v2 (which is 1) or v1 (which is 2). Therefore, all are distinct.\n\n    # Therefore, the triple is v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + k. Which are distinct as long as k >=1 and <=n-2.\n\n    # So for example, in the first sample input (3 15), n=3, a=15. The possible k is 1 (angle is 1*180/3 = 60). So the output is 1 2 3, but according to our selection, v2 is 1, v1 is 2, v3 is 2+1=3. So the triple would be 2 1 3. But the sample output is 1 2 3. However, the problem allows any correct triple, so this is also acceptable.\n\n    # Therefore, the code can output v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + k. However, the problem requires that the output can be any valid triple, so this approach is correct.\n\n    # So now, once best_k is found, the output is 2, 1, 2 + best_k. However, if 2 + best_k exceeds n, but since best_k is up to n-2, 2 + best_k is up to n, which is valid.\n\n    # For example, n=4, best_k=1: 2 + 1 =3 → output 2 1 3. Which is one of the sample outputs.\n\n    # So the code can output 2 1 (2 + best_k).\n\n    # But the sample input for 4 67 has output 2 1 3. Which corresponds to k=1, angle 45 degrees. Which is correct.\n\n    # However, the sample input for 4 68 has output 4 1 2. Let's see: in that case, the best_k is 2 (angle 90). So according to our method, the triple would be 2 1 4. Which is also a valid answer. So the sample output is 4 1 2, which is equivalent to 2 1 4 (since the order of v1 and v3 can be swapped).\n\n    # The problem allows any correct triple, so our approach is correct.\n\n    # Therefore, the code can output v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_k. However, the problem allows any valid triple, so this is acceptable.\n\n    # So now, implement this logic.\n\n    # Edge Cases:\n    # When n=3 (triangle), the only possible k is 1, angle is 60 degrees. So output any triple.\n\n    # Now, code:\n\n    best_k = 1\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n\n    # Find the best k\n    for k in range(1, n-1):\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n\n    # Now, construct the triple\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Finding Optimal k**: We iterate over possible values of `k` (number of steps between vertices) to find the one that results in an angle closest to `a`.\n3. **Constructing the Triple**: Once the optimal `k` is found, we construct the vertices such that the angle at vertex `v2` (chosen as 1) is formed by vertices `v1` (2) and `v3` (2 + k), ensuring they are distinct and valid within the polygon.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the closest angle using geometric properties of regular polygons and ensures the solution meets the problem constraints.",

We need to find the k that makes this angle as close as possible to a.\n\n    # Now, find the optimal k:\n    # The angle for k is angle_k = (k * 180) / n\n    # We want to minimize |angle_k - a|\n    # So we can compute for each k in 1 to n-2, compute the difference and find the minimum.\n\n    # However, since n can be up to 1e5, iterating through all k is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.\n\n    # Find the best k:\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    for k in range(1, n-1):\n        angle = (k * 180) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k or any, since the problem says any is acceptable\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n\n    # Now, once best_k is found, we need to choose three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 is formed by k steps between v1 and v3.\n\n    # Let's choose v2 as 1. Then, v1 is 2 (since there is 1 step from v2 to v1?), wait no. Let me think about how to arrange the vertices.\n\n    # For example, in a square (n=4), best_k could be 1 (angle 45) or 2 (angle 90). Let's say best_k is 1.\n\n    # If v2 is vertex 1, then v1 and v3 should be such that there are k steps between them along the arc not containing v2. How to arrange this?\n\n    # Let's fix v2 as 1. Then, v1 can be 2, and v3 can be 2 + k steps from v1, but this might not be correct. Alternatively, for k steps between v1 and v3, we can place v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between them when going around the polygon not passing through v2.\n\n    # Let's imagine v2 is vertex 1. Then, v1 can be vertex 2 (adjacent), and v3 can be vertex 2 + k steps away. Wait, perhaps the easiest way is to have v2 as vertex 1, v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + k) mod n, but need to adjust for the numbering.\n\n    # Wait, in a regular n-gon, the vertices are numbered 1 to n clockwise. So, for example, if v2 is vertex 1, then v1 can be vertex 2 (next vertex), and v3 can be vertex 2 + k steps away from v1, but in the direction that skips v2.\n\n    # Alternatively, for a given k, the angle is formed by choosing v2 as any vertex, and then v1 and v3 such that there are exactly k steps between them along the arc that does not contain v2.\n\n    # To construct such a triple, let's choose v2 as vertex 1. Then, v1 can be vertex 2 (the next vertex), and v3 can be vertex (2 + k) mod n. However, since the polygon is numbered from 1 to n, we need to handle the modulo correctly.\n\n    # For example, if n=4 and k=1, then v1 is 2, v3 is 2+1=3. So the triple is 2, 1, 3. Which is one of the examples given.\n\n    # So the general approach is: set v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k. But if 2 + k exceeds n, then wrap around.\n\n    # Wait, but 2 + k can be up to n-1 + k? No, because k ranges from 1 to n-2. For example, n=5, k=3: 2 + 3 = 5, which is valid. If k=4, then 2+4=6, which is larger than n=5. So perhaps the correct formula is v3 = (2 + k - 1) % n + 1. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\n    # The idea is that from v2 (vertex 1), moving clockwise, v1 is vertex 2. Then, from v1, moving clockwise k steps, we reach v3. However, since the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) must be k steps. Wait, but if we move k steps from v1 in the clockwise direction, then the arc between v1 and v3 would be k steps, and the arc that contains v2 would be n - k steps. So the arc that does not contain v2 is k steps, which is what we need.\n\n    # So for example, if v1 is 2, and we move k steps clockwise from v1, then v3 would be (2 + k - 1) mod n + 1. Wait, because moving k steps from 2 would be 2 + k. But if that exceeds n, then wrap around.\n\n    # For example, n=4, k=1: 2 + 1 = 3 → v3 is 3. Correct.\n    # n=4, k=2: 2+2=4 → v3 is 4. The arc between 2 and 4 is 2 steps, which is 180 degrees. The angle at v2 (1) would be 90 degrees. Which matches the example.\n\n    # So the formula for v3 is (v1 + k - 1) % n + 1? Or v1 + k? Since v1 is 2, adding k steps would be 2 + k. But if 2 + k exceeds n, then it wraps around.\n\n    # So in code, v3 = 2 + k. But if that's larger than n, subtract n. For example, if n=5, k=4, then 2+4=6 → 6-5=1. So v3 is 1. But then, the arc between v1 (2) and v3 (1) is 4 steps (from 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 1), which is k=4. The angle at v2 (1) would be 4 * 180 / 5 = 144 degrees. But wait, if v3 is 1, which is v2 itself, but the problem states that the three vertices must be distinct. So this case is invalid.\n\n    # Oh! That's a problem. So in our selection, we must ensure that v1, v2, v3 are distinct.\n\n    # So when choosing v3, we need to make sure that it's not equal to v2. Also, v1 should not be equal to v3.\n\n    # Let's think again. For the chosen k, the arc between v1 and v3 is k steps. So the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 must be k. Therefore, if v2 is fixed as 1, v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + k steps in the clockwise direction. But if 2 + k exceeds n, then wrap around.\n\n    # But if 2 + k exceeds n, then v3 would be (2 + k - n). However, this might be equal to 1 (v2), which is not allowed.\n\n    # For example, n=5, k=3. v1 is 2, v3 is 2+3=5. Which is okay. If k=4, v3 is 2+4=6 → 6-5=1, which is v2. Not allowed. So in this case, we need to avoid k values that would make v3 equal to v2.\n\n    # So perhaps the correct approach is to choose v3 as (v1 + k) mod n, but adjust to ensure that v3 is not equal to v2.\n\n    # Alternatively, for the selected k, the correct positions are v2 = 1, v1 = 2, v3 = 2 + k if it is <=n, else 2 + k - n. However, if 2 + k - n == 1, then it's invalid.\n\n    # Let's think about the maximum k. For k up to n-2. For example, when k = n-2, then v3 = 2 + n-2 = n. Which is valid. For k = n-1, but since k is up to n-2, that's not considered.\n\n    # So for k in 1..n-2, 2 + k is up to 2 + n-2 = n. Which is valid. So in that case, v3 is 2 + k, which is between 3 and n. Thus, v3 is not equal to v2 (which is 1) or v1 (which is 2). Therefore, all are distinct.\n\n    # Therefore, the triple is v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + k. Which are distinct as long as k >=1 and <=n-2.\n\n    # So for example, in the first sample input (3 15), n=3, a=15. The possible k is 1 (angle is 1*180/3 = 60). So the output is 1 2 3, but according to our selection, v2 is 1, v1 is 2, v3 is 2+1=3. So the triple would be 2 1 3. But the sample output is 1 2 3. However, the problem allows any correct triple, so this is also acceptable.\n\n    # Therefore, the code can output v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + k. However, the problem requires that the output can be any valid triple, so this approach is correct.\n\n    # So now, once best_k is found, the output is 2, 1, 2 + best_k. However, if 2 + best_k exceeds n, but since best_k is up to n-2, 2 + best_k is up to n, which is valid.\n\n    # For example, n=4, best_k=1: 2 + 1 =3 → output 2 1 3. Which is one of the sample outputs.\n\n    # So the code can output 2 1 (2 + best_k).\n\n    # But the sample input for 4 67 has output 2 1 3. Which corresponds to k=1, angle 45 degrees. Which is correct.\n\n    # However, the sample input for 4 68 has output 4 1 2. Let's see: in that case, the best_k is 2 (angle 90). So according to our method, the triple would be 2 1 4. Which is also a valid answer. So the sample output is 4 1 2, which is equivalent to 2 1 4 (since the order of v1 and v3 can be swapped).\n\n    # The problem allows any correct triple, so our approach is correct.\n\n    # Therefore, the code can output v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_k. However, the problem allows any valid triple, so this is acceptable.\n\n    # So now, implement this logic.\n\n    # Edge Cases:\n    # When n=3 (triangle), the only possible k is 1, angle is 60 degrees. So output any triple.\n\n    # Now, code:\n\n    best_k = 1\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n\n    # Find the best k\n    for k in range(1, n-1):\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n\n    # Now, construct the triple\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
