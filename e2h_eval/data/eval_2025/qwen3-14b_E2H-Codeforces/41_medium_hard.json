There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions.

The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about building houses on a street with n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. I need to maximize the total profit under these constraints.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to find the maximum possible sum of squares given all the restrictions. Since n, h, m are up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible? But even then, for n=50, trying all possibilities would be impossible because each house can have h+1 possibilities. So 50^50 is way too big. So brute force is out of the question.\n\nAlternative approach: Think about constraints. Each restriction imposes that the maximum in some interval is <= x_i. So for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum of the houses in that interval can't exceed x_i. How do I model these constraints?\n\nThis feels like a problem where we need to assign heights to each house such that all the constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nSince the constraints involve maximums over ranges, perhaps we can model this with some kind of dynamic programming or backtracking with pruning. But even with backtracking, for n=50, it's not feasible.\n\nWait, but n is small (up to 50). Maybe we can model this as a problem where for each position, we choose a height, but ensuring that all constraints are satisfied. However, how to check the constraints efficiently during the assignment?\n\nAlternatively, think about the constraints. For each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that interval must be <= x_i. So for each such interval, the maximum of the houses from l_i to r_i must be <= x_i. So, for each restriction, the maximum in that range can't exceed x_i. So, the problem reduces to choosing heights for each house, such that for every restriction, the maximum in its range is <= x_i. And then maximize the sum of squares.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother thought: For each house, the maximum possible height it can have is min(h, all the x_i's that apply to it through any restriction that includes it in their range). Wait, no. Because a restriction applies to a range. For example, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then all houses in positions 1-3 can't have a height exceeding 2. However, if there's another restriction on [2,4] with x=3, then house 2 and 3 can't exceed 2 (from first restriction) and 3 (from second), but the max in [1,3] is 2, and in [2,4] is 3. So, for house 2, the maximum allowed height is min(2,3) = 2. But for house 4, it's allowed up to 3. So perhaps for each position, the maximum height is determined by the tightest restriction that covers it. However, this is not necessarily correct because the restrictions are about the maximum in a range, not individual houses. For example, suppose there's a restriction that says the max in [1,2] is 2. Then, both houses 1 and 2 can be 2. But if there's another restriction that says the max in [1,3] is 3. Then, house 3 can be 3, but the max in [1,2] is still 2. So the individual house heights are constrained by the restrictions that apply to ranges they are part of. But how to model that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the way to approach this is to model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, where for each possible assignment of heights, we check if all the restrictions are satisfied. Then, find the assignment that gives maximum sum of squares.\n\nBut with n=50 and h=50, the number of possibilities is 51^50, which is way too big. So that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: since the constraints are about the maximum in intervals, perhaps we can find for each position the maximum possible height it can have, considering all constraints that affect it. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose for each position i, the maximum height it can have is the minimum between h and all the x_i's from restrictions that cover i in their range. But no, that's not correct. Because a restriction on [l_i, r_i] requires that the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. So, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then each house in 1-3 can be up to 2. However, if there's a restriction on [1,2] with x=3, then the maximum in [1,2] can be up to 3. However, the first restriction requires that the max in [1,3] is 2. So, the house 3 can be up to 2, but house 1 and 2 can be up to 2 (since the first restriction applies to [1,3], so their maximum can't be higher than 2. Even though the second restriction allows [1,2] to have max 3, but the first restriction is more restrictive. Therefore, the maximum height for house 1 and 2 can't be higher than 2.\n\nSo, for each position, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and all x_i's from restrictions that cover that position in their range, but also considering that if there are overlapping ranges. However, this is not sufficient. For example, consider two overlapping ranges. Suppose there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, and another on [2,4] with x=3. Then, for house 2, the max allowed is 2 (because the first restriction applies to [1,3], so the max in that range is 2, which includes house 2. So even though the second restriction allows up to 3 in [2,4], the first restriction is more restrictive. So for house 2, the max is 2. However, house 3 can be up to 2 (due to first restriction) and house 4 can be up to 3 (due to second restriction). \n\nSo, the maximum height for a house is determined by the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include that house in their range, but also considering that the restrictions may be on ranges that include the house. However, this approach may not capture all constraints. Because, for example, a restriction on [1,4] with x=5 and another on [1,2] with x=3. Then, the max in [1,2] is 3. So house 3 can be up to 5, but house 1 and 2 can be up to 3. However, the restriction on [1,4] allows up to 5, but the [1,2] restriction makes sure that the max in that sub-range is 3. So, the house 3 can be 5. So, the maximum for house 3 is min(h, 5) = 5, but for house 1 and 2, it's min(3, 5) =3. \n\nSo, perhaps for each position i, the maximum possible height is the minimum between h and the minimal x_i of all restrictions that have their interval covering i. But wait, that's not correct. Because a restriction on [l, r] with x_i implies that the maximum in that interval is <=x_i. So, the maximum of all houses in that interval can't exceed x_i. Therefore, for each house in that interval, it's allowed to be up to x_i. But if there are other restrictions that impose lower x's on that same house, then the house's maximum is the minimum of those x's. However, if there's no restriction that directly covers that house, then the maximum is h. \n\nWait, but this approach would be incorrect. Let's take an example. Suppose there are two restrictions:\n\nRestriction 1: [1,3] with x=2.\n\nRestriction 2: [2,4] with x=3.\n\nThen, for house 2, the maximum allowed is 2 (from restriction 1). Because in the [1,3] interval, the maximum can't exceed 2. So even though the second restriction allows up to 3 in [2,4], the first restriction applies to house 2 and requires that the max in [1,3] is 2. Therefore, house 2 can't be higher than 2. However, house 4 can be up to 3 (since the second restriction says that the max in [2,4] is 3. But if house 4 is 3, then the max in [2,4] is 3. However, the first restriction doesn't apply to house 4. So, for house 4, the maximum allowed is 3. \n\nBut according to the approach of taking for each house the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include it in their interval, for house 2, the x_i's would be 2 (from restriction 1) and 3 (from restriction 2). So the minimum is 2, which is correct. For house 4, only restriction 2 includes it, so the x_i is 3, so the maximum is 3. That seems to work. \n\nAnother example: Suppose there's a restriction on [1,4] with x=5, and another on [2,3] with x=3. Then, for house 2, the restrictions that include it are [1,4] and [2,3]. The x values are 5 and 3. So the minimum is 3. So house 2 can be up to 3. But the [1,4] restriction allows up to 5. However, the [2,3] restriction requires that the max in [2,3] is 3. So even if house 2 is 3, and house 3 is 3, then the max in [2,3] is 3, which satisfies the second restriction. But if house 2 is 3, then house 1 can be 5, and house 4 can be 5. So the approach of taking the minimum of x_i's for all restrictions that include the house would be correct. \n\nSo, perhaps for each house i, the maximum possible height is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include i in their interval. But then, what about when there are multiple restrictions on the same interval? For example, a restriction on [1,2] with x=3 and another on [1,2] with x=2. Then, the min x_i is 2, so the maximum allowed for each house in [1,2] is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut here's a problem: what if there are overlapping ranges where the constraints are not directly on a particular house. For example, imagine two restrictions: [1,2] with x=3, and [2,3] with x=3. Then, for house 2, the maximum allowed is 3. But suppose I set house 2 to 3, house 1 to 3, and house 3 to 3. Then, all the constraints are satisfied. Now, if there's a third restriction [1,3] with x=2. Then, the maximum in [1,3] must be <=2. So, even though house 2 is allowed by previous constraints up to 3, now this new restriction requires that all three houses are <=2. So, the maximum for each house is min(2, ...). So, the previous approach of taking the minimum x_i for all restrictions that include the house in their interval would work here. Because the [1,3] restriction includes house 2, so the x_i is 2, which is lower than the previous ones. So for house 2, the maximum is 2. \n\nTherefore, the approach of determining for each house the maximum possible height as the minimum of h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include that house in their interval would be correct. \n\nBut wait! What if a restriction is on a range that includes the house, but the house is not the maximum in that range. For example, suppose there is a restriction on [1,3] with x=2. Then, the maximum in that range must be <=2. So, each of the houses 1, 2, 3 can be up to 2. But suppose there's another restriction on [1,2] with x=3. Then, the max in [1,2] must be <=3. However, the first restriction says that the max in [1,3] is <=2. So, the max in [1,2] is automatically <=2. So the second restriction is redundant. \n\nIn this case, the approach of taking the minimum x_i for each house would be correct. For house 1, the restrictions that include it are [1,3] (x=2) and [1,2] (x=3). So the min is 2. For house 2, same thing. So the max for each house is 2. Which is correct. \n\nBut what if there is a restriction on [1,3] with x=3, and another on [1,2] with x=2. Then, the max in [1,2] must be <=2, and the max in [1,3] must be <=3. So, the max in [1,3] is the maximum between the max of [1,2] (which is 2) and house 3. So house 3 can be up to 3. So for house 3, the only restriction that includes it is [1,3] (x=3). So the max is 3. For house 1 and 2, the min between 3 and 2 is 2. Which is correct. \n\nSo, the approach of for each house, compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include that house, and then set the maximum possible height for that house to be min(h, that value) seems to work. \n\nBut wait! What if there are overlapping ranges that require that the maximum in some ranges is limited, but not directly on a particular house. For example, suppose there are two restrictions: [1,2] with x=3, and [2,3] with x=3. Now, the max in [1,2] is 3, and the max in [2,3] is 3. So, house 2 can be up to 3. House 1 can be up to 3, house 3 can be up to 3. But suppose there is no restriction on [1,3]. Then, the max in [1,3] can be up to 3. So, the approach would set for each house the maximum as 3. Which is correct. \n\nBut suppose there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2. Then, the max in [1,3] must be 2. So, all houses in that range must be <=2. So, house 1, 2, 3 can be up to 2. However, the previous restrictions on [1,2] and [2,3] are automatically satisfied. So, the approach would take for each house, the min of all x_i's of the restrictions that include it. For house 1, the [1,3] restriction (x=2) and [1,2] (x=3) → min is 2. For house 2, the same. For house 3, [1,3] (x=2) and [2,3] (x=3) → min is 2. So yes, that works. \n\nSo, the approach would be: for each house i, find the minimal x_i among all restrictions that have l_i ≤ i ≤ r_i. Then, the maximum height for house i is min(h, that value). Then, the optimal solution is to set each house to that maximum height. \n\nBut wait, is that always correct? Let me think of a case where this approach would fail. \n\nSuppose there are two restrictions:\n\nRestriction 1: [1, 2] with x=2.\n\nRestriction 2: [1, 3] with x=3.\n\nSo, for house 1: included in both restrictions. The minimal x is 2. So house 1's maximum is 2.\n\nFor house 2: included in both restrictions. Minimal x is 2. So max 2.\n\nFor house 3: included in restriction 2. So x=3. Max is 3.\n\nNow, the max in [1,2] is 2 (satisfies restriction 1), and the max in [1,3] is 3 (satisfies restriction 2). So that's correct. \n\nBut what if there's another restriction that says [2,3] with x=1. Then, for house 2, the minimal x is min(2, 1) =1. For house 3, min(3, 1) =1. So, the houses would be 2, 1, 1. Then, the max in [1,2] is 2 (which is okay for restriction 1). The max in [1,3] is 2, which is <=3 (okay). The max in [2,3] is 1 (okay). \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nAnother example. Suppose there are two restrictions:\n\nRestriction 1: [1,3] with x=2.\n\nRestriction 2: [2,2] with x=3.\n\nSo, for house 2, the restrictions that include it are [1,3] (x=2) and [2,2] (x=3). So the min is 2. So house 2 can be up to 2. However, the restriction 2 says that the max in [2,2] is 3. Which is automatically satisfied if house 2 is 2. So the approach works. \n\nBut what if the restriction 2 is [2,2] with x=1. Then, the min for house 2 is 1. So the maximum for house 2 is 1. Which satisfies the restriction. \n\nSo, the approach of setting each house's maximum height to the minimal x_i of all restrictions that cover it, and then setting each house to that maximum, seems to satisfy all the constraints. \n\nBut why is that? Because for any restriction [l_i, r_i], the maximum in that range would be the maximum of the individual house heights in that range. Since each house in that range is set to at most x_i (because that restriction covers it, so the minimal x_i for that house is <= x_i). Therefore, the maximum of the range is <= x_i. \n\nYes! Because for any restriction [l_i, r_i], x_i is one of the x's considered for each house in that range. For each house j in [l_i, r_i], the minimal x across all restrictions that include j is <= x_i (since the current restriction includes j, and x_i is one of the options). Therefore, the maximum height of house j is <= x_i. Thus, the maximum in the entire range is <=x_i. \n\nSo this approach would satisfy all the constraints. \n\nTherefore, the maximum profit is achieved by setting each house to the maximum possible value allowed by the constraints, which is min(h, the minimal x_i of all restrictions that include that house). \n\nWait, but what about when there are multiple restrictions that apply to the same range. For example, if there are two restrictions on the same range [1,2], x=3 and x=2. Then, the minimal x for each house is 2, so the maximum height for each house is 2, which satisfies both restrictions. \n\nSo, this approach would work. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each house i (from 1 to n):\n\n- Find all restrictions that include i in their [l_i, r_i] interval.\n\n- Take the minimum x_i among those restrictions.\n\n- The maximum height for house i is min(h, that minimum x_i).\n\nThen, the total profit is the sum of (height_i)^2 for each house.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no restrictions that include a particular house? Then, the minimal x_i is undefined. In that case, the maximum height for that house is h. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each house i in 1..n:\n\n   - collect all restrictions where l_i <= i <= r_i.\n\n   - if there are any such restrictions, then the max height for i is min( h, min(x_i of those restrictions) )\n\n   - else, the max height is h.\n\nOnce we have that, we can set each house to its maximum possible height, and compute the sum of squares.\n\nBut wait, this seems too easy. Let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → for house 1, min x is 1.\n\n2 2 3 → for house 2, min x is 3.\n\n3 3 2 → for house 3, min x is 2.\n\nThus, the max heights are [1,3,2], sum of squares is 1 +9 +4 =14. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → applies to houses 2 and 3.\n\n3 4 7 → applies to houses 3 and 4.\n\nFor house 1: no restrictions. So max is 10.\n\nHouse 2: restrictions are [2,3,8], so min x is 8.\n\nHouse 3: restrictions are [8 and 7]. So min is 7.\n\nHouse 4: restriction [3,4,7], so min is 7.\n\nSo the heights are [10, 8, 7,7]. Sum is 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach works for samples.\n\nAnother test case: what if a restriction is on a range, but the minimal x for a house is not the x of that restriction. For example:\n\nn=2, h=5, m=1.\n\nRestriction is [1,2] with x=3. \n\nSo for house 1 and 2, max is 3. Sum is 3² +3²= 18.\n\nBut if there's another restriction on [1,1] with x=4. Then, for house 1, the min x is min(3,4) =3. So house 1 is 3, house 2 is 3. Which is correct. \n\nAnother case: overlapping ranges. Suppose n=3, h=5, m=2. Restrictions [1,2] x=4 and [2,3] x=3. So for house 2, the min x is 3. House 1 is 4, house 3 is 3. So the heights are [4,3,3]. Now, the restriction [1,2] has max 4 (which is <=4), and [2,3] has max 3 (<=3). Correct.\n\nBut what if there's a restriction that applies to a larger range, but the minimal x is higher than some other restrictions. For example:\n\nn=3, h=5. Restrictions: [1,3] x=4, and [1,1] x=3. \n\nFor house 1: the min between 4 and 3 is 3. So house 1 is 3. House 2 and 3 are 4. So the max in [1,3] is 4, which is allowed. The [1,1] restriction is satisfied. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this approach seems to work. Therefore, the solution is to compute for each house the minimal x_i of all restrictions that include it, then set the height to min(h, that value), and sum squares.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nThe steps in code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen read m restrictions. For each restriction, l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nFor each house i (from 1 to n):\n\n   collect all x_i's from restrictions where l_i <= i <= r_i.\n\n   if there are any such x's, then the max_height[i] = min( h, min(x_list) )\n\n   else, max_height[i] = h.\n\nThen, compute sum of squares.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the restrictions? For each house, check all m restrictions to see if it's in their interval.\n\nYes, since n and m are small (up to 50), this is acceptable.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead input lines. The first line is n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first input is given as a list of two examples. But the actual input for the problem is per test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then, the output is a single integer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples. But the user's code should process a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user's code needs to read input from stdin. The sample input shows two examples, but perhaps that's just for illustration. The actual input for the code is one test case. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nSample Output: 14.\n\nSo, the code needs to read one test case. But the sample input given in the problem shows two test cases, but perhaps that's for the purpose of showing two examples. However, the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows two examples. However, perhaps in the actual code, the input is read as a single test case.\n\nBut the user's code must process the input correctly. So in the code, we need to read the input as follows: read the first line as n, h, m. Then read m lines of restrictions. Then compute the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example's input is given as a string, then the second example's input. But that's probably for the purpose of the example. The actual code will read from stdin, which for the problem is one test case. So the code needs to process one test case.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, h, m from input.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nFor each house from 1 to n:\n\n   min_x = infinity\n\n   for each restriction:\n\n      if l_i <= current_house <= r_i:\n\n          if x_i < min_x:\n\n              min_x = x_i\n\n   if min_x is still infinity (no restrictions apply):\n\n       height = h\n\n   else:\n\n       height = min(h, min_x)\n\nsum += height^2\n\nPrint sum.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple restrictions that apply to the same house, but with varying x_i's. For example, two restrictions on [1, 2] with x=3 and x=4. Then, the min_x is 3. So the house can be 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, testing the code on the sample input:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nrestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → applies to house 1.\n\n2 2 3 → applies to house 2.\n\n3 3 2 → applies to house 3.\n\nSo for each house, min_x is 1, 3, 2. So heights are 1,3,2. Sum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nrestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → applies to houses 2 and 3.\n\n3 4 7 → applies to houses 3 and 4.\n\nFor house 1: no restrictions. So height is 10.\n\nhouse 2: only restriction is 8. So min_x=8. height 8.\n\nhouse 3: restrictions are 8 and 7 → min is 7. height 7.\n\nhouse 4: restriction is 7. height 7.\n\nsum is 10² +8² +7² +7² = 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if there are no restrictions. Then all houses are h. Sum is n * h².\n\nAnother test case: if a house is covered by multiple restrictions. For example, two restrictions on [1,1], x=2 and x=3. Then the min_x is 2. So house 1's height is 2.\n\nBut what if a restriction says [1,2] x=3, and another [1,1] x=2. Then for house 1, min_x is 2, and house 2 is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines. For each line, store l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nThen for each house in 1..n:\n\n   min_x = something large.\n\n   for each restriction in the list:\n\n      if l_i <= current_house <= r_i:\n\n          if x_i < min_x:\n\n              min_x = x_i\n\n   if min_x is still something large (no restrictions applied):\n\n       height = h\n\n   else:\n\n       height = min(h, min_x)\n\n   add height^2 to the sum.\n\nSo code in Python:\n\nRead input:\n\nProbably, the code can read from stdin via input().split().\n\nBut for multiple lines, perhaps:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\nThen, for each house in 1..n:\n\nsum_profit = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    min_x = float('inf')\n\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n        if l <= i <= r:\n\n            if x < min_x:\n\n                min_x = x\n\n    if min_x == float('inf'):\n\n        height = h\n\n    else:\n\n        height = min(h, min_x)\n\n    sum_profit += height * height\n\nprint(sum_profit)\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's check the case where a restriction's x_i is larger than h. For example, suppose h=3, and a restriction on [1,1] with x=5. Then, the min_x is 5, but the height is min(3,5) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: if there are multiple restrictions on the same house, but some x_i is larger than h. For example, h=3, and two restrictions on [1,1], x=4 and x=2. Then min_x is 2. So height is 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThis seems to handle all cases. \n\nSo this code should work. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor house 1:\n\ncheck all restrictions. Only first applies. min_x is 1. height is min(3,1)=1.\n\nSame for others. Sum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nProcessing:\n\nhouse 1: no restrictions. height 10.\n\nhouse 2: check restrictions. first restriction (2<=2<=3 → yes. x=8. min_x=8. second restriction (3<=2? no. So min_x is 8. height 8.\n\nhouse 3: check both restrictions. first: 2<=3<=3 → yes. x=8. second: 3<=3<=4 → yes. x=7. min_x is 7. height 7.\n\nhouse4: check second restriction. 3<=4 <=4 → yes. x=7. min_x=7. height 7. \n\nSum 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for samples.\n\nWhat about the case where a restriction has x_i larger than h?\n\nFor example, n=1, h=2, m=1, restriction [1,1,3]. Then min_x is 3. height is min(2,3) → 2. sum is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case where there's a restriction that is not covering a house. For example, n=2, m=1, restriction [1,1, 1]. Then house 1's height is 1, house 2's height is h. \n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct. Therefore, the code should be written as such.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height, and each restriction imposes a limit on the tallest house within a specific range. The goal is to determine the optimal heights for each house to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the house heights.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of spots (n), maximum height (h), and the number of restrictions (m).\n2. **Restrictions Processing**: Store all the restrictions in a list for later processing.\n3. **Determine Maximum Heights**: For each house, determine the maximum allowable height by considering all restrictions that apply to it. The maximum height for each house is the minimum value of the restrictions that cover it, adjusted to not exceed the global maximum height (h).\n4. **Profit Calculation**: Calculate the total profit by summing the squares of the determined maximum heights for each house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    min_x = float('inf')\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    if min_x == float('inf'):\n        height = h\n    else:\n        height = min(h, min_x)\n    total += height * height\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is parsed to get the number of spots (n), maximum height (h), and number of restrictions (m). Each subsequent line contains the details of a restriction.\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: Each restriction is stored as a tuple of (start, end, maximum height allowed in the range).\n3. **Determining Heights**: For each house position from 1 to n, check all restrictions to find the minimum allowable height imposed by any restriction that includes this house. If no restrictions apply, the house can be built up to the global maximum height (h).\n4. **Calculating Profit**: The profit for each house is the square of its height, summed up for all houses to get the total maximum profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the constraints efficiently. The solution is efficient given the small constraints (up to 50 spots and restrictions), making it feasible to check each restriction for each house.",
