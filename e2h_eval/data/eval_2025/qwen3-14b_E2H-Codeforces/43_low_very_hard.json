He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine whether a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's, and the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the 'c's could be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the final string must satisfy certain conditions. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Because A and B made sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b', and C adds at least one 'c' (since he appends some number, which must be at least 1? Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. But the problem says that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. But the original string before adding 'c's has some 'a's and 'b's. So, for example, if the original string (after B's appending) has 2 a's and 3 b's, then C can add 2 or 3 c's. So the number of c's must be equal to either the count of a's or the count of b's in the string before adding the c's. But after adding the c's, the counts of a and b remain the same as before, right?\n\nSo the final string's counts are:\n\ncount_a = original a's (from A)\ncount_b = original b's (from B)\ncount_c = either count_a or count_b (from C's appending)\n\nBut wait, when C appends the c's, the count of a and b in the string remains the same as before adding the c's. So the count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original).\n\nSo, for the final string, the count of c's must be equal to either the count of a's or the count of b's in the final string. Because the count of a and b didn't change when adding c's.\n\nWait, no. Because the count of a's and b's in the final string is the same as before adding the c's. So when C appends the c's, the count of a's is still the same as the original count from A, and the count of b's is same as original from B. So the count_c must be equal to either count_a or count_b in the final string.\n\nSo for the final string, the count of c's must be equal to count_a or count_b. But also, the count of a's must be at least 1, count of b's must be at least 1, and count of c's must be at least 1.\n\nSo the first thing to check is that the string has at least one of each character. If any of a, b, or c is missing, then it's automatically a NO.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after B appends the 'b's, there's at least one a and one b. Then C appends some c's. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. So if the input string is missing any of these, the answer is NO.\n\nSo first step: check that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If not, return NO.\n\nThen, we need to check that the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\nBut wait, what about the order of the characters?\n\nThe string must be such that all a's come first, followed by b's, then c's. Because A created a string of a's, then B added some b's, then C added some c's. So the string should be in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo for example, the string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. If there's any c before a or b, or any a after a b, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the order of characters is important. The string must consist of a block of a's, followed by a block of b's, followed by a block of c's. So the string must be in the form of a...ab...bc...c.\n\nSo even if the counts are correct, if the order is wrong, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the steps for the solution would be:\n\n1. Check that the string contains at least one a, one b, and one c. If not, return NO.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The string must be composed of some number of 'a's followed by some number of 'b's, and then some number of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Presence of Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must follow the order of all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n3. **Check Count Conditions**: The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef check_string(s):\n    # Check if all required characters are present\n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Check the order: all a's first, then b's, then c's\n    # Find the first occurrence of 'b' and check if there's any 'a' after it\n    first_b = s.find('b')\n    if first_b != -1:\n        if 'a' in s[first_b:]:\n            return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence of 'c' and check if there's any 'a' or 'b' after it\n    first_c = s.find('c')\n    if first_c != -1:\n        if 'a' in s[first_c:] or 'b' in s[first_c:]:\n            return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Now check counts\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    print(check_string(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Presence Check**: The function first checks if the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, it returns \"NO\".\n2. **Order Check**: The function ensures that all 'a's come before 'b's and all 'b's come before 'c's. This is done by checking for any 'a' after the first occurrence of 'b' and any 'a' or 'b' after the first occurrence of 'c'.\n3. **Count Check**: Finally, the function verifies if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If it does, the function returns \"YES\"; otherwise, it returns \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints of the problem are checked efficiently and correctly.",
