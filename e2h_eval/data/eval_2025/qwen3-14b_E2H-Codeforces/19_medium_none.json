The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is to maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute way more than lower ones. So the optimal strategy would be to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nWait, but how do I ensure connectivity? Because if I just take the top (n -k) districts, they might not form a connected component. So I need to find a way to select the districts with the highest possible numbers, but also make sure that they are connected.\n\nSo maybe the approach is to start from the highest-numbered districts and select them, but then check if they are connected. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a tree. The districts form a tree structure. We need to choose a connected subtree with (n -k) nodes, and maximize the sum of 2^i for those nodes. Then the problem reduces to selecting the subtree with maximum sum of 2^i, which is equivalent to selecting the nodes with the highest possible numbers, but connected.\n\nBut since 2^i increases exponentially, the optimal solution would be to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and exclude lower ones. However, the tree structure may require that some lower-numbered nodes are included to connect the higher ones.\n\nWait, but for example, if we have a tree where node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 1. Suppose we need to remove 2 nodes. Then we can't just take nodes 5,6, but maybe need to take node 2, 5, 6, but that depends on the structure.\n\nBut given that higher-numbered nodes have exponentially larger values, perhaps the best approach is to select the nodes with the largest numbers, but ensure that they form a connected subtree. So the problem becomes: find a subtree with (n -k) nodes, which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAn alternative idea: Since the sum is maximized by including the highest possible nodes, we can think of it as trying to keep the nodes with the largest numbers, and removing the smallest ones. However, the problem is that the nodes must form a connected component.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to remove k nodes, but the remaining nodes must form a connected component. To maximize the sum, we want to remove the nodes with the smallest numbers, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nBut how to do that? Because if you remove some small nodes, but their removal disconnects the tree, then you can't do that.\n\nSo maybe the approach is to find a way to remove the k smallest nodes, but only those that are not necessary for connectivity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a tree where we need to keep the nodes with the highest possible numbers. Let's consider that the optimal set is the set of all nodes except the k smallest ones, but only if that set is connected. Otherwise, we need to adjust.\n\nBut how to check if the set of nodes with numbers greater than some value is connected? Well, perhaps not. For example, if the tree is a chain 1-2-3-4-5-6, and we need to remove 3 nodes. The optimal is to keep 4,5,6. Which is connected. But if the tree is structured such that node 6 is connected to node 2, node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 2 is connected to node 3, node 3 connected to 4, etc. Then if we want to remove 3 nodes, keeping 4,5,6, but if node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 3, which is connected to 4, then the nodes 4,5,6 may not be connected unless node 2 is kept.\n\nSo in that case, if we remove nodes 1, 2, 3, then the remaining nodes are 4,5,6. But if node 2 is part of the path between 6 and 4, then removing node 2 would disconnect them. So that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, the approach of simply removing the k smallest nodes may not work, because the remaining nodes may not be connected.\n\nSo, the problem requires selecting a subset of n -k nodes that is connected and has maximum sum. Since the sum is maximized by including the highest possible nodes, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to find the minimal number of nodes to remove (k) such that the remaining nodes form a connected component, and we remove the nodes with the smallest possible values.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to remove?\n\nAnother idea: Since the tree is connected, and we need to remove k nodes so that the rest is connected. The way to do that is to remove nodes that are not in the minimal spanning tree of the highest nodes. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as finding a subtree with (n -k) nodes that has the maximum sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes' values, which are 2^i, the subtree should include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we start with the highest-numbered node and then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nBut how to implement that efficiently?\n\nAnother approach: Since the sum is determined by the nodes, the optimal solution will consist of the nodes with the largest possible numbers. So perhaps we can start with the highest-numbered node (n), and then include as many of the next highest nodes as possible, making sure that they are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where we need to build a tree by adding nodes in order of their value (from highest to lowest), and ensuring that each new node is connected to the existing tree. If not, we can decide whether to include it or not, but since we need to maximize the sum, we'd prefer to include it if possible.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes to include?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting the nodes to keep, which are the ones with the largest numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected component. So, the process would be:\n\n- Start with the node with the highest number (n). Then, add the next highest node (n-1) if it's connected to the current subtree. If not, we can't add it unless we include some other nodes that connect it.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, but in a tree, any two nodes have exactly one path between them. So, for the nodes we want to keep, they must form a connected subtree. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting a subset S of size (n -k) nodes that forms a connected subtree, and S contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find such a subset?\n\nLet me think about the following approach: The optimal subset S must include all nodes from some threshold upwards, except for some nodes that are not needed to maintain connectivity. Wait, but that might not be the case. For example, if the nodes are arranged in a star shape, with node 1 connected to all others. Then, if we want to keep nodes 2,3,4,5,6, but node 1 is connected to all of them. If we remove node 1, then the remaining nodes are disconnected. So in that case, we can't remove node 1 if we want to keep the rest. But node 1 is the lowest-numbered node. So in this case, we would have to keep node 1 to connect the rest. But that would mean that even though node 1 has a low value, it's necessary to include it in the subset S.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial idea that we want to keep the highest-numbered nodes. So how can we reconcile that?\n\nIn this case, if we have to include node 1 to connect the rest, then we can't avoid including it. So the optimal subset would be to include node 1 and as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But that's a trade-off: including node 1 (which has a low value) allows us to include all the higher nodes. However, if we could find another way to connect the higher nodes without including node 1, then that would be better.\n\nBut in a star-shaped tree, the only way to connect all the high-numbered nodes is through node 1. Therefore, in that case, we have to include node 1. So in this scenario, the optimal subset would be {1} plus the (n -k -1) highest nodes. But since node 1 is included, but the rest are higher, the sum is 2^1 + sum(2^i for the highest nodes).\n\nSo the problem is that sometimes we have to include lower-numbered nodes to connect higher ones.\n\nSo the challenge is to find which nodes to include in the subset S, which has (n -k) nodes, such that the sum of 2^i is maximized, and the subset is connected.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe maximum sum is achieved when we include the highest possible nodes. However, the inclusion of lower nodes is required if they are on the paths between higher nodes.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find a way to select the nodes with the highest numbers, but ensure that the subset is connected. To do that, we can model the problem as follows:\n\nWe need to select (n -k) nodes. Let's imagine that we want to select the nodes with the highest numbers possible. So we start with the highest node (n), and then include as many of the next highest nodes as possible, ensuring that they are connected to the existing set.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nThis seems similar to Kruskal's algorithm, but instead of edges, we are considering nodes. Alternatively, think of it as building a tree where we add nodes in order of their value (highest first), and whenever adding a node connects it to the existing tree, we include it.\n\nBut how to do that in practice?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in descending order of their numbers (so n, n-1, ..., 1).\n\n2. Start with an empty set. We need to select (n -k) nodes. We will greedily add nodes in order of their value, but only if they are connected to the current set.\n\nWait, but how to check if a node is connected to the current set? Because the tree is given, but the current set may not be connected yet. So perhaps we need to track the connected components of the nodes that we have selected so far.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a spanning tree for the subset S. But since the original graph is a tree, any subset S that forms a connected component must be a subtree. So, perhaps we can use a BFS or DFS approach, but starting from the highest nodes.\n\nWait, here's a possible plan:\n\nWe need to select (n -k) nodes. Since we want the maximum sum, we want to select the highest possible nodes. So, the idea is to include the nodes with the highest numbers, and exclude the lowest ones, but ensuring that the selected nodes form a connected component.\n\nTo do that, we can perform the following steps:\n\n- We start with the highest-numbered node (node n). This is our initial connected component.\n\n- Then, for each next node in descending order (n-1, n-2, ...), we check if it is connected to the current component. If yes, we include it. If not, we skip it (for now), but maybe later we can include it if we can connect it via other nodes.\n\nBut how do we check if the node is connected to the current component? Because the current component is a subset of the nodes. But since the original graph is a tree, the connection between the node and the current component depends on whether there exists a path from the node to the current component that doesn't go through any nodes that are excluded (i.e., not in the current component).\n\nWait, but how can we check that efficiently?\n\nAnother Idea: For each node, we can think of whether it is connected to the current set. Since the tree is static, we can model this with a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure. However, the problem is that we are not adding nodes in arbitrary order. We need to add nodes in such a way that the DSU can track the connected components.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to process the nodes in order of descending value (from highest to lowest), and for each node, we check if it is connected to the current set. To do that, we can use a DSU structure where initially all nodes are not in the set. As we process each node, we check if any of its adjacent nodes are already in the set. If so, we can add this node to the set and merge it with the DSU. Otherwise, we leave it out for now.\n\nWait, but how to track which nodes are already in the set? Let's think:\n\nInitially, the set is empty. We process nodes in order from n down to 1. For each node, we check if any of its neighbors are already in the set. If yes, then we add this node to the set. Otherwise, we don't add it (for now). Once we have added enough nodes (n -k nodes), we stop.\n\nBut why would this work? Because adding higher-numbered nodes first ensures that we include as many high-value nodes as possible, and only include lower-numbered nodes when necessary to connect the higher ones.\n\nFor example, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n6 3\nEdges:\n2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3\n\nThe nodes are numbered 1-6. Processing in order 6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nStart with node 6. It's added. Now, the set has 6. Next is node 5. Check its neighbors. The edge between 5 and 6. Since 6 is in the set, we add 5. Now set has 5,6. Next node is 4. Check its neighbors. Node 4 is connected to 2. But 2 is not in the set. So we can't add 4. Next node is 3. Its neighbors are 2. Not in the set. So can't add. Next node is 2. Check its neighbors. 1,6,4,3, etc. 6 is in the set. So add 2. Now the set is 6,5,2. Next is node 1. Neighbors are 2. 2 is in the set. So add 1. Now the set has 6,5,2,1. But we need to have 6 -3 = 3 nodes. Wait, n is 6, k is 3. So n -k is 3. So we need to collect 3 nodes. So after adding 6,5,2, that's 3 nodes. So we stop. So the set is {6,5,2}. The sum is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2 = 64 +32 +4= 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the removed districts are 1,3,4. Which means the kept districts are 2,5,6. Which matches this approach.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for the sample.\n\nAnother example: if the tree is a star with node 1 connected to 2,3,4,5,6. Suppose n=6, k=3. So we need to keep 3 nodes. The approach would process nodes 6,5,4, etc.\n\nProcessing node 6. Add it. Then node 5. Check neighbors: connected to 1 (not in set). So cannot add. Node 4: same. Node 3: same. Node 2: same. Node 1: check neighbors. None are in the set except none. So cannot add. So after processing node 6, we have only 1 node. Need to collect 3. Then, the next step would be to add nodes that are connected to the current set. But since the current set is {6}, and the next nodes are 5,4, etc. How do we proceed?\n\nWait, in this scenario, the current set is {6}. The next node is 5. It is connected to node 1, which is not in the set. So cannot add. Then node 4, same. Node 3, same. Node 2, same. Node 1, same. So the algorithm would only have 1 node, but needs to collect 3. So this approach would not work. But what's the correct way here?\n\nIn this case, the optimal subset would be {1, 6, 5} (assuming that we can connect them through node 1). But according to the algorithm, node 1 is processed last. So in this case, the algorithm would not add 5, 6, and 1, because when processing 5, the current set is {6}, but node 5 is connected to 1, which is not in the set. So the algorithm would not add node 5. Then, when processing node 1, the neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6. 6 is in the set. So node 1 can be added. Now the set is {6,1}. Then, the next nodes are 5,4, etc. When processing node 5, the neighbors are 1 (which is in the set). So node 5 can be added. Now the set has 3 nodes: 6,1,5. Which is correct. So the algorithm would add node 1 after node 6, then add node 5. Thus, the algorithm would collect 3 nodes.\n\nAh, I see. Because the algorithm processes the nodes in descending order. So node 6 is processed first. Then node 5. But node 5's neighbor is 1 (not in the set). So it can't be added. Then node 4, same. Node 3, same. Node 2, same. Then node 1. Its neighbor 6 is in the set. So it can be added. Now the set has 6 and 1. Then, when processing node 5 again? Wait, no. The algorithm processes nodes in order 6,5,4,3,2,1. So once node 1 is processed, the loop ends. So after processing node 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, the set is {6, 1}? But that's only 2 nodes, and we need 3. So the algorithm would fail here.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the algorithm would not collect enough nodes. So what's wrong?\n\nAh, the algorithm is supposed to collect (n -k) nodes. In this case, n=6, k=3. So (n -k)=3. The algorithm processes nodes in order from 6 down to 1, and adds a node if any of its adjacent nodes are already in the set.\n\nSo let's retrace:\n\nStart with node 6. Add to the set. Current count is 1.\n\nNext node is 5. Check neighbors. Let's say node 5 is connected to node 1. Since node 1 is not in the set, can't add. So not added.\n\nNext node is 4. Same as 5. Not added.\n\nNext node is 3. Same. Not added.\n\nNext node is 2. Same. Not added.\n\nNext node is 1. Check its neighbors. Node 1 is connected to 6 (which is in the set). So add node 1. Now count is 2.\n\nNow, we have processed all nodes. The set has only 2 nodes, but need 3. So the algorithm would not have collected enough nodes. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, because the algorithm adds nodes in order of descending value, but in this case, the nodes 5, 4, 3, 2 can't be added unless node 1 is in the set. Once node 1 is added, then node 5 can be added. But in the processing order, node 5 is processed before node 1. So when node 5 is processed, node 1 is not in the set. But when node 1 is processed, it is added, and then after that, the algorithm has already passed node 5. So the algorithm would miss adding node 5.\n\nThus, this approach is flawed. It would not collect enough nodes in this case.\n\nSo the problem is that the algorithm processes nodes in descending order, but when a lower-numbered node (like node 1) is added later, it can allow higher-numbered nodes (like node 5) to be added. However, since node 5 was processed earlier, the algorithm missed the chance.\n\nSo this suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of processing nodes in descending order, we need to process them in a way that allows us to add nodes that can connect to the existing set. But how?\n\nPerhaps we need to use a priority queue (max-heap) approach. We start with the highest node. Then, for each node in the heap, we look at its neighbors and add them to the heap if they haven't been processed yet. But this sounds like BFS or DFS. However, the goal is to collect as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nWait, here's a different idea inspired by Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees. We want to select a connected subset of nodes with maximum sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes, we can model this as a problem where we greedily select the nodes with the highest values, and expand the connected component by adding neighboring nodes that have the highest possible values.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe need to select (n -k) nodes. Let's imagine that we start with the highest node. Then, we need to expand the connected component by adding the highest possible nodes that are adjacent to the current component.\n\nThis is similar to a priority queue approach where we always add the highest available node that is adjacent to the current component.\n\nHere's how it could work:\n\n- Use a max-heap (priority queue) that contains the nodes that are adjacent to the current component but not yet included.\n\n- Initially, the current component is {n}. The heap contains all neighbors of n that are not in the component.\n\n- While the current component has less than (n -k) nodes:\n\n   - Take the highest-numbered node from the heap.\n\n   - Add it to the component.\n\n   - Add all its neighbors that are not in the component to the heap.\n\nThis way, we are always adding the highest possible nodes that are connected to the current component.\n\nBut wait, this approach ensures that the component is connected and consists of the highest possible nodes.\n\nLet me test this approach with the previous example where the tree is a star with node 1 connected to all others.\n\nExample:\n\nn=6, k=3. Need to select 3 nodes.\n\nStart with node 6. Current component: {6}. The heap contains neighbors of 6, which is node 1. Push node 1 into the heap.\n\nNow, the heap has [1]. Pop the highest node (1). Add to component. Now component is {6,1}. Now add neighbors of 1: nodes 2,3,4,5. Push them into the heap. The heap now contains 5,4,3,2.\n\nNow, the component has 2 nodes, need 1 more. Pop 5. Add to component. Now component is {6,1,5}. Done. So the selected nodes are 6,1,5. Which gives sum 2^6 + 2^1 + 2^5 = 64 + 2 + 32 = 98. But what if we had selected 6,5,4? That would be sum 64+32+16= 112. But how can we get that?\n\nAh, but in the star structure, nodes 5 and 4 are connected to node 1, but not to each other. So if the component is {6,5}, that's not connected. Because node 5 is connected to node 1, but node 6 is connected to node 1. So the component {6,5} is not connected unless node 1 is included. Therefore, the component {6,5} is not connected. Hence, the selection must include node 1 to connect 6 and 5. Thus, the sum of 64+32+2 is 98, but the alternative is to select 6,1,5. But in this case, the algorithm works correctly.\n\nBut what if we could select nodes 5,6, and 4? Well, they can't be connected without node 1. So the algorithm's selection is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose the tree is a chain 1-2-3-4-5-6. We need to remove 3 nodes (keep 3). The optimal selection is 4,5,6. The algorithm would start with 6. Then, the heap has 5. Add 5. Then heap has 4. Add 4. Now component is 6,5,4. Correct. So the algorithm would select them.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for both cases.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input. Let's see.\n\nSample input 1: the tree is structured as:\n\nEdges: 2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3.\n\nThe tree structure is:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. Node 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\n1 is connected to 2. 2 is connected to 3, 4, 6. 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the nodes are arranged with 2 as a central hub.\n\nn=6, k=3. Need to select 3 nodes.\n\nStart with node 6. Current component {6}. Heap contains neighbors of 6: 2 and 5. Push them into the heap. The heap has 5, 2.\n\nTake the highest (5). Add to component. Now component is {6,5}. Add neighbors of 5: 6 (already in component). So nothing added to heap.\n\nHeap now has 2. Take 2. Add to component. Now component is {6,5,2}. Done. So the selected nodes are 6,5,2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works here.\n\nAnother example where the star-shaped tree requires adding node 1 to connect higher nodes. So the algorithm works.\n\nSo this approach seems promising.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Select the nodes to keep, which form a connected component of size (n -k), by greedily adding the highest possible nodes adjacent to the current component.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n- We need to build a graph (adjacency list) for the tree.\n\n- Initialize a priority queue (max-heap) that holds the candidate nodes to be added to the component. Initially, the component starts with the highest node (n), and the heap contains all its neighbors.\n\n- Also, need to track which nodes are in the component. Let's have a boolean array 'in_component'.\n\n- While the size of the component is less than (n -k):\n\n   - Extract the node with the highest value from the heap.\n\n   - If it's already in the component, skip.\n\n   - Else, add it to the component.\n\n   - Then, add all its neighbors that are not in the component to the heap.\n\nBut wait, the heap may contain duplicates. For example, a neighbor may be pushed multiple times. But when we extract it, we check if it's already in the component. If it's not, we add it. Otherwise, we ignore.\n\nThis way, the algorithm ensures that the highest possible nodes are added first.\n\nOnce the component is built, the nodes not in the component are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python efficiently?\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, using a priority queue (heapq) may be feasible, but with some optimizations.\n\nBut heapq in Python is a min-heap, so to simulate a max-heap, we can insert negative numbers.\n\nBut for n=1e6, and with O(n log n) operations, it's manageable?\n\nLet's think about the time complexity. Each node is added to the heap once for each neighbor. But in the worst case, each edge is processed twice (once for each node). However, the heap can have O(n) elements. For each node, we may push O(1) entries. The total number of operations would be O(n log n), which for 1e6 is acceptable.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nBuild adjacency list.\n\nInitialize a max-heap. Since Python's heapq is a min-heap, we can insert negative values.\n\nInitialize in_component as a boolean array of size n+1 (since nodes are 1-based). Initially, all are False.\n\nStart with the highest node, n. Mark it as in_component. Add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nThen, while the size of the component is less than (n -k):\n\n   - Pop the node with the highest value (using negative values in the heap).\n\n   - If it's already in the component, skip.\n\n   - Else, add it to the component.\n\n   - For each neighbor of this node, if not in component, add to the heap.\n\nBut how to track the size of the component? We can have a variable 'count' that starts at 1 (since we start with node n), and increment when adding a node.\n\nOnce the count reaches (n -k), we stop.\n\nOnce the component is built, the nodes not in the component are the ones to be removed. We collect all the nodes not in the component, sort them, and output the first k of them? No, wait: the nodes not in the component are exactly k in number, since (n -k) are kept. So collect all nodes not in the component, sort them, and output them.\n\nWait, but what if during the process, the heap is empty before the component reaches size (n -k)? That would imply that the tree is disconnected, but the original tree is connected. So that can't happen. Because the original tree is connected, and the component is built by expanding from the initial node. So eventually, the component can reach all nodes. But since we need to collect exactly (n -k) nodes, the algorithm should always be able to find enough nodes.\n\nBut in the case where the initial component is n, and we need to collect (n -k) nodes, which is larger than 1, the algorithm will expand the component by adding nodes.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut for Python, using a priority queue with negative numbers.\n\nBut for large n (up to 1e6), the standard heapq may be too slow. However, given that each node is processed once, and each edge is considered once, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nLet's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=6, k=3. So target component size is 3.\n\nStart with node 6. in_component[6] = True. count =1.\n\nAdd neighbors of 6: 2 and 5. Push -2 and -5 into the heap. Heap is [-5, -2].\n\nNow, pop the smallest (which is -5 → value 5). Check if in_component[5] is False. Add it. count becomes 2. Add its neighbors (6 is already in component, and 5's other neighbors? According to the sample input, 5 is connected to 6. So neighbors of 5 are 6. So nothing added to the heap.\n\nHeap now has -2.\n\nNext iteration: pop -2 → value 2. Check if in_component[2] is False. Add it. count becomes 3. Now, the component is full. Stop.\n\nThe nodes in the component are 6,5,2. The nodes not in component are 1,3,4. Which is the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: the star-shaped tree with node 1 connected to 2-6.\n\nn=6, k=3. Need component size 3.\n\nStart with node 6. in_component[6] = True. count=1. Add neighbors of 6, which is node 1. Push -1 into the heap.\n\nHeap is [-1].\n\nPop -1 → value 1. Add to component. count=2. Add neighbors of 1: 2,3,4,5,6. But 6 is already in component. Push 5,4,3,2 into the heap (as negatives).\n\nHeap now has -5, -4, -3, -2.\n\nPop -5 → value 5. Add to component. count=3. Done.\n\nComponent is 6,1,5. Nodes not in component are 2,3,4. Output them sorted as 2 3 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works here.\n\nAnother example: if n=3, k=1. Need to keep 2 nodes. Tree is 1-2-3.\n\nStart with node 3. Add to component. count=1. Neighbors is 2. Push -2 into heap.\n\nPop -2. Add to component. count=2. Done. Component is 3,2. Removed is 1. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, and with O(n) operations, the code must be efficient. However, using heapq with O(n log n) time is acceptable.\n\nBut for the adjacency list, we need to read n-1 edges. Each edge is bidirectional.\n\nImplement steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead n-1 edges. Build adjacency list as a list of lists.\n\nInitialize in_component as a list of booleans, size n+1 (since districts are numbered 1..n).\n\nInitialize a priority queue (heap). Since Python's heapq is min-heap, we push negative node numbers.\n\nInitially, add node n to the component. in_component[n] = True. count =1.\n\nFor all neighbors of node n, add them to the heap (as negative numbers).\n\nThen, while count < (n -k):\n\n   current = heappop(heap). The actual node is -current.\n\n   if in_component[node] is True: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      add to component. in_component[node] = True. count +=1.\n\n      for each neighbor in adj[node]:\n\n         if not in_component[neighbor], push -neighbor into the heap.\n\nOnce done, collect all nodes not in component. Sort them, and output the first k (but since there are exactly k nodes not in component, just output them sorted).\n\nBut wait, what if during the process, the heap is empty? That's impossible since the original tree is connected. So the component will eventually reach the required size.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, and with Python's heapq, which is O(log n) per insertion and extraction, it's feasible?\n\nBut for n=1e6, and each node being pushed and popped once, it's O(n log n) operations, which should be manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input has multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the user provided an example input that seems to have two test cases. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input contains two integers n and k...\n\nThen, n-1 lines of edges.\n\nSo the code must process a single test case. However, the example input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's just a formatting error. The user probably pasted two examples. But the actual problem expects a single test case per run.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. So in the code, the input is read as follows:\n\nRead the first line as n and k.\n\nThen read n-1 lines of edges.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is:\n\nInput:\n\n6 3\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, for handling large n (up to 1e6), it's better to read the input quickly. Using sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the code, here's the plan:\n\nImport sys.\n\nRead n and k.\n\nBuild adjacency list as a list of lists.\n\nThen, proceed with the algorithm.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\nfor _ in range(n-1):\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj[a].append(b)\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\nin_component = [False]*(n+1)\nheap = []\n\n# Start with node n\nstart_node = n\nin_component[start_node] = True\ncount = 1\n\n# Push all neighbors of start_node into the heap\nfor neighbor in adj[start_node]:\n    heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nwhile count < (n - k):\n    # Get the node with highest value\n    current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n    if in_component[current]:\n        continue\n    # Add to component\n    in_component[current] = True\n    count +=1\n    # Push all neighbors into the heap\n    for neighbor in adj[current]:\n        if not in_component[neighbor]:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n# Collect all nodes not in component\nremoved",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts' contestants should be removed such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is to prioritize keeping districts with higher numbers since their fan counts grow exponentially.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, which means there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: To maximize the sum of fans, we should aim to keep the districts with the highest numbers. However, we must ensure these districts form a connected component.\n3. **Priority Queue (Max-Heap)**: Use a max-heap to always expand the connected component by adding the highest-numbered districts that are adjacent to the current component. This ensures we greedily select the highest possible nodes while maintaining connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n    \n    in_component = [False] * (n + 1)\n    heap = []\n    \n    start_node = n\n    in_component[start_node] = True\n    count = 1\n    \n    for neighbor in adj[start_node]:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n    \n    while count < (n - k):\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if in_component[current]:\n            continue\n        in_component[current] = True\n        count += 1\n        for neighbor in adj[current]:\n            if not in_component[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n    \n    removed = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not in_component[i]:\n            removed.append(i)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(removed))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in an adjacency list to represent the tree structure.\n2. **Initialization**: Start with the highest-numbered district (district `n`) as the initial component.\n3. **Max-Heap Usage**: Use a max-heap (simulated with negative values in a min-heap) to always process the highest-numbered districts that can be added to the current component.\n4. **Component Expansion**: Continuously expand the component by adding the highest-numbered adjacent districts until the component size reaches `n - k`.\n5. **Collecting Removed Districts**: After forming the component, collect all districts not in the component, sort them, and print them as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maintain connectivity while maximizing the sum of fans by prioritizing higher-numbered districts. The use of a priority queue ensures efficient expansion of the component in terms of both time and space complexity.",
