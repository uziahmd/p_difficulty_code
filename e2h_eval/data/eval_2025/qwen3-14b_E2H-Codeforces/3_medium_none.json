Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Vanya is walking on a street with lanterns, and I have to find the minimum radius d such that the entire street is lit. Hmm.\n\nSo the problem says that each lantern can light up points within a distance d from it. The street is from 0 to l. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. My task is to find the minimal d that covers the entire street.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. The key idea is that between two adjacent lanterns, there's a gap. The maximum distance between consecutive lanterns would determine the required d. But wait, not exactly. Because for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the worst case is the middle point between them. Because if the lanterns are spaced more than 2d apart, then there's a gap in the middle. So for each pair, the required d is half of the distance between them. But then, also need to check the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nWait, right. Let me think. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1. Then the leftmost part of the street (from 0 to a1) needs to be covered. The maximum distance here is a1 - 0. But since the lantern's light can cover up to d, so the distance from the lantern to 0 must be <=d. So the required d for the left end is a1. Similarly, for the right end, if the last lantern is at a_n, then the distance from a_n to l is l - a_n. So that's another candidate for d.\n\nBut for the middle parts, between two lanterns. Suppose two lanterns are at positions x and y, with x < y. The maximum distance between them is y - x. The middle point is at (x + y)/2. The distance from each lantern to this middle point is (y - x)/2. So the required d for this segment is (y - x)/2. So the overall minimal d is the maximum of all these values: the left end, the right end, and all the middle gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions. Because we need to check consecutive positions.\n2. Check the left end: the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. So the required d here is a[0].\n3. Check the right end: the last lantern's position. The distance from l to a[-1] is l - a[-1]. So required d here is l - a[-1].\n4. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them, divide by 2. Take the maximum of these values.\n5. The answer is the maximum among all these values (left end, right end, and the max of the consecutive gaps).\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the left end is a[0], the right end is l - a[0]. And the max between those two. Because there are no consecutive pairs. So that case is covered.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array of ai.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as the maximum between the first lantern's position (a[0]) and (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through each consecutive pair in the sorted array, compute (current - previous) / 2, and take the maximum of these values. Then compare that with the initial max_d, and the overall maximum is the answer.\n\nYes. That makes sense.\n\nLet me test this against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nLeft end is 0, so the first lantern is at 0. So the left end distance is 0. The right end is l - a[-1] = 15-15=0. Then between consecutive lanterns:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: (3-0)/2=1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and 5: (5-3)/2=1.\n\nBetween 5 and 7: 1.\n\nBetween 7 and 9: 1.\n\nBetween 9 and 14: (14-9)/2=2.5.\n\nBetween 14 and 15: 0.5.\n\nSo the maximum among these is 2.5. The initial max_d was 0. So overall answer is 2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 5\n\npositions 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5].\n\nLeft end is 2, right end is 5-5=0. Then between 2 and 5, (5-2)/2=1.5. So the maximum is 2.0? Wait, no. Wait the initial max_d is max(2, 0) = 2. Then the consecutive pair gives 1.5. So the maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: if the lanterns are at 0 and l. Then the max is max(0, l - l, (l-0)/2) → l/2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the left end is 5, right end is 5. So the max is 5. So the answer is 5. Which makes sense because the lantern is in the middle, so the radius needs to be 5 to cover both ends.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then between them is 10-0=10. Divided by 2 is 5. Left end is 0, right end is 0. So answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 5]. Then the left end is 0, right end is 5. The consecutive gap is (5-0)/2 = 2.5. So the maximum is 5. So answer is 5. Because the right end is 5 units away from the lantern. So the radius needs to be 5.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\n   current_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   current_max = current_gap / 2\n\n   if current_max > max_d:\n\n       max_d = current_max\n\nAt the end, output max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if n=0? Oh no, the input constraints say n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nBut in code, when n is 1, then the loop from 1 to n-1 (which is 0) won't run. So the code will handle that.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i. Then sort it.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each consecutive pair in the sorted list, compute the difference divided by 2, and take the maximum.\n\nSo code in Python:\n\nBut wait, for the input, the second line is n integers. So in Python, for example, for the first sample input, the second line is \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\", which when split into integers becomes [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. Then sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nSo code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the maximum is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nBut in the second sample input, the code would process:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. After sorting, [2,5].\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.\n\nThen for i=1, gap is 5-2=3. current is 1.5. Which is less than 2. So max_d remains 2. So output is 2.0000000000. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. No loop. Output 5. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. max_d is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. Then the gap is 10-0=10, divided by 2 is 5. So max_d is 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,5]. max_d is max(0, 10-5=5) → 5. Then the gap is 5-0=5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So max_d remains 5. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple lanterns but some are overlapping?\n\nLike n=3, l=10, a = [0, 0, 10]. Sorted as [0,0,10]. Then the max_d is max(0, 10-10=0). Then between first two, 0-0=0. Then between 0 and 10, 10-0=10, divided by 2 is 5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a = [0, 2, 3, 5], l=5. Then the max_d is max(0, 5-5=0). Then between 0 and 2: 1.0. Between 2 and 3: 0.5. Between 3 and 5: 1.0. So the max is 1.0. So answer is 1.0. But what about the end? The last lantern is at 5. So the right end is 0. So the answer is 1.0. Correct.\n\nBut what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street? For example, if there is a gap between two lanterns that's larger than 2d. But the code is supposed to find the minimal d that covers everything.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer must be printed with 10 decimal digits. So in Python, using the format string with .10f.\n\nBut in Python, when you print a float, sometimes it may have trailing zeros. But the problem says that the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error is within 1e-9. So using the format with 10 decimals should be sufficient.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the code against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, a becomes [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15].\n\nmax_d starts as max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen between consecutive elements:\n\n3-0 =3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5. So the final max_d is 2.5. Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then between 5-2=3 → 1.5. So the max is 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for samples.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where all lanterns are at 0. For example, n=3, l=10, a = [0, 0, 0]. Then the max_d is max(0, 10-0=10). So answer is 10.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case where lanterns are spread out. Like n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the max_d is max(0, 10-10=0). Then between 0 and 5: 2.5, between 5 and 10: 2.5. So the answer is 2.5.\n\nAnother case where the maximum is in the middle. For example, n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. Then the max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. Then between 0 and 3: 1.5. Between 3 and 10: 7/2=3.5. So answer is 3.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when reading the input, for the second line, the input is n integers. So for example, in the first sample input, the second line is \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\" which has 7 numbers, which is correct for n=7.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and l from input. Then read the next line as list of integers. Then sort.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the first line as n and l. Then the second line as list of a_i.\n\nBut in Python, for the input, sometimes the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but splitting with split() handles that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n, l = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the length of a is n. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nSo code is okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you have a list with one element, the for loop doesn't run. So that's handled.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → after sorting [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n\nmax_d starts as max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nLoop for i from 1 to 6:\n\ni=1: gap 3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d=1.5\n\ni=2: 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\ni=3: 7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\ni=4: 9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\ni=5: 14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max.\n\ni=6: 15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nThus, output is 2.5 → correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d = max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.\n\nThen i=1: gap 5-2=3 → 1.5. Which is less than 2. So output 2.0 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then code outputs max(5, 10-5=5) → 5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then max_d is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. Then between 0 and 5: 2.5. Between 5 and 10: 2.5. So max_d is 2.5. Output is 2.5.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, what about if the lanterns are not sorted? For example, the input is [5, 0, 15], then sorted becomes [0,5,15]. The code handles that.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street. The key insight is to consider the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street, as these will dictate the minimum radius needed.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading and Sorting**: Read the number of lanterns and the length of the street, followed by the positions of the lanterns. Sort these positions to facilitate checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial Maximum Distance Calculation**: Calculate the initial maximum distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n3. **Gap Analysis**: Iterate through the sorted positions of the lanterns to determine the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The radius required to cover this gap is half the gap's width.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the maximum value obtained from the initial distances and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, `n` (number of lanterns) and `l` (length of the street). The second line contains the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Distances**: The initial maximum distance (`max_d`) is determined by considering the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, compute the gap between them. The radius required to cover this gap is half the gap's width. Track the maximum of these values.\n5. **Output**: The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to ensure precision as required by the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required to illuminate the entire street by considering both the gaps between lanterns and the edges of the street.",
