Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered in those gaps. Because the worst case is between two adjacent lanterns. Also, we have to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive ones can't be checked properly. For example, if lanterns are at positions 5, 3, then after sorting they are 3,5. The gap between them is 2, so the required d would be half of that (since each lantern covers up to d distance. So the middle point between them would require d to be 1, but wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose two lanterns are at positions a and b, with a < b. The distance between them is b - a. The maximum distance from either lantern to the middle point is (b - a)/2. So for the entire street to be covered, the maximum of these gaps divided by two is part of the answer. But also, the first lantern's position might be after 0, so the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a candidate. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Sort the array of ai.\n- Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. That's a candidate for d (since the first lantern's coverage must reach 0, so if the first lantern is at a1, then d must be at least a1 - 0. But wait, no. Wait, the lantern's coverage is a radius d. So the first lantern's coverage starts at a1 - d and ends at a1 +d. But since the street starts at 0, the leftmost point is 0. So if the first lantern is at position a1, then to cover 0, the distance between 0 and a1 must be <=d. So d must be >= a1 - 0. Similarly, the last lantern's position is an. The street ends at l, so the distance between an and l must be <=d. So d must be >= l - an. \n\nThen, between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap is (ai+1 - ai). The required d for that gap is (gap)/2. Because the middle of the gap is (ai + ai+1)/2. The distance from ai to that middle is (ai+1 - ai)/2. So the maximum of all these (gap/2) values is part of the answer.\n\nSo the overall answer is the maximum between:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if it's not 0)\n- the last lantern's position (if it's not l)\n- the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nWait, but the first lantern's position could be zero, so the first part (distance from 0 to first lantern) is zero. Similarly for the last lantern. So the steps would be:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. If it's greater than 0, then the required d is a[0] - 0. So compare that with current max_d.\n\nSimilarly, check the last lantern's position. If it's less than l, then required d is l - a[-1]. Compare with max_d.\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference (a[i+1] - a[i]). Take half of that, compare with max_d.\n\nThe maximum among all these is the answer.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then, the lantern is at a certain position. Then the max_d would be the maximum between (a[0] - 0), (l - a[0]), and (since there are no consecutive lanterns, the other part is not considered). So that's covered.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array a.\n\nmax_d = 0\n\nif a[0] > 0: max_d = max(max_d, a[0] - 0)\n\nif a[-1] < l: max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\nfor i from 0 to n-2:\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    current = gap / 2\n\n    if current > max_d: max_d = current\n\nreturn max_d\n\nYes. That seems correct.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 15, and the lanterns are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, the array is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nCheck first lantern is 0, so no contribution. Last lantern is 15, which is equal to l=15. So no contribution. Now check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nBetween 0 and 3: gap is 3. Half is 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and 5: gap 2 → 1.\n\nBetween 5 and 7: 2 → 1.\n\nBetween 7 and 9: 2 → 1.\n\nBetween 9 and 14: 5 → 2.5. This is larger than previous max (which was 1.5). So now max_d is 2.5.\n\nBetween 14 and 15: gap is 1 → 0.5.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5. Lanterns are 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. \n\nFirst lantern is at 2, so the distance from 0 is 2. So initial max_d is 2. Last lantern is at 5, which is l. So no contribution. Then check the gap between 2 and 5: 3. Half is 1.5. So the max_d is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10. Lantern at 5. Then the first part is 5-0=5, the last part is 10-5=5. The max between them is 5. The gap between consecutive lanterns is none, so the answer is 5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10. Lanterns at 0 and 10. Then the first part is 0, last part is 0. The gap between them is 10, so 5. So answer is 5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10. Lanterns at 0 and 5. Then first part is 0, last part is 10-5=5. The gap between 0 and 5 is 5 → 2.5. So the max is 5. So answer is 5.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nIn Python, read n and l. Then read the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.\n\nCheck if the first element is greater than 0. If so, compute a[0] - 0, compare with max_d.\n\nCheck if the last element is less than l. If so, compute l - a[-1], compare with max_d.\n\nThen iterate through consecutive elements, compute their difference, divide by 2, compare with max_d.\n\nFinally, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? No, according to the problem statement, n is at least 1. Because input constraints say 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. So no problem.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase when all lanterns are at 0. For example, n=3, l=5, a = [0,0,0]. Then the first check is 0, the last check is 5-0=5. The gaps between consecutive lanterns are 0, so max_d is 5.\n\nAnother case: l=0? No, because according to the problem statement, l is ≥1. Wait input says l is 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when the lanterns are not sorted. For example, input is n=2, l=5, a=[5,0]. After sorting, [0,5]. Then the code works.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l from input. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them.\n\nNow compute the initial max_d.\n\nThen loop through consecutive pairs.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead input: first line is n and l. Second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a string like '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', but in actual code, the input comes from stdin. So in code, we need to read two lines. First line is n and l. Second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif a[0] > 0:\n    max_d = a[0] - 0\nif a[-1] < l:\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but for the first part, if a[0] is 0, then the first check is 0. So the initial max_d is 0. Then, for example, if the last lantern is at l, then the second check is 0. So the max_d remains 0. But then, if there are gaps between lanterns, like if there's only one lantern at 0, and l is 5. Then the code would compute the first part as 0, the last part as 5-0=5, so max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nBut in code, the initial max_d is 0.0. Then, for the first check, if a[0] is 0, then the code does nothing. Then, for the last check, if a[-1] is less than l, then compute l - a[-1], compare with max_d. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the code above, the first check is:\n\nif a[0] > 0: then set max_d to a[0] - 0. But if a[0] is zero, then that part is skipped. Then, for example, if the first lantern is at 0, but the last is at l, then the code checks the gaps between lanterns. But if there are no gaps (n=1), then the code would have max_d as 0.0. But that's wrong. Because in that case, the lantern is at 0, and l is say 5. Then the code would compute the first part (a[0] is 0, so no change). The last part is l - a[-1] = 5 - 0 = 5. So max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nBut in code, the first check is:\n\nif a[0] > 0: then set max_d to a[0] - 0. Else, no. So for the case where a[0] is 0, the code proceeds to check the last part.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1: after sorting, a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The first element is 0. So the first check is skipped. The last element is 15, which is equal to l=15. So the second check is skipped. Then, the gaps between consecutive elements are 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1. The maximum of (3/2=1.5, 2/2=1, etc.) is 5/2=2.5. So the code returns 2.5.\n\nSample 2: after sorting, a is [2,5]. The first element is 2, so the first check is 2-0=2. The last element is 5, which is l=5. So the second check is skipped. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d is 2. So output is 2.0.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the code checks a[0] is 5>0: yes. So max_d is 5. Then the last check is 10 -5=5. So max_d is 5. Then there are no consecutive pairs. So the answer is 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then the first check is 0, the last check is 0. The gap is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So answer is 5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,5]. Then first check is 0, last check is 10-5=5. The gap is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So max_d is 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. The first check is 0, last check is 0. Gaps are 5 and 5. Each gives 2.5. So max_d is 2.5. But the code would return 2.5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. Then first check is 0. Last check is 0. The gaps are 3 and 7. The first gives 1.5, the second gives 3.5. So answer is 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. Also, note that in Python, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nBut for the input, the second line is the list of a_i. For example, in the first sample input, the second line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0' which is split into integers and sorted.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, the code uses a[0] and a[-1], but when n=0? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i, sort it.\n\nCompute the initial max_d.\n\nThen process the consecutive elements.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the initial max_d can be 0.0, but for the first check, if a[0] is 0, then the first part is not considered. Then, for example, if the first lantern is at 0, and the last is at l, then the max_d is the maximum of the gaps between consecutive lanterns. But if there are no gaps (n=1), then the max_d is 0.0. But in that case, the code would have the first check (a[0] is 0, so no change), the last check (a[-1] is l, so no change). Then, the code would return 0.0, which is correct. Because if the lantern is at 0 and l is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, l is at least 1. So if n=1, l=5, and a is [0], then the code would check the first part (a[0] is 0, no change), the last part (5-0=5, so max_d is 5. So code returns 5.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=5, a=[5]. Then the first check is a[0] is 5>0: yes. So max_d is 5. The last check is l - a[-1] is 5-5=0. So max_d is 5. So correct.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list, sort.\n\nCompute max_d.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for floating point numbers, division is done with /, which returns a float.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif a[0] > 0:\n    max_d = a[0]\nif a[-1] < l:\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first check, the code is a[0] - 0, which is a[0]. So yes.\n\nBut for example, if a[0] is 3, then the first part is 3.0, which is the required d. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the first check is:\n\nif a[0] >0: max_d = a[0]. But what if a[0] is 0? Then the code leaves max_d as 0.0. Which is correct, because the distance from 0 to the first lantern is zero. So no problem.\n\nBut for example, if a[0] is 0, and the next lantern is at 5, then the code checks the gap between 0 and 5, which is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. But also, if the last lantern is at 5, and l is 10, then the code would check l - a[-1] = 5. So the maximum between 2.5 and 5 is 5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input:\n\nSample 2: input is 2 5, and the list is 2 5. After sorting, [2,5].\n\na[0] is 2>0 → max_d is 2.0.\n\na[-1] is 5, which is equal to l=5. So no change.\n\nThen, the loop runs for i=0 (n-1 is 1, so range(1) is 0 to 0).\n\ngap = 5-2=3. current is 1.5. Which is less than 2.0. So max_d remains 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when the first lantern is at 0, but the last is at l. Then the code checks the gaps between the lanterns. For example, n=3, l=10, a = [0, 5, 10]. The gaps are 5 and 5. The max_d is 5/2=2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code must be written with proper formatting. Also, note that in Python, when you print, you need to format it with 10 decimal digits. So using the format string as .10f.\n\nBut what about when the maximum is an integer? Like 2.0. The code outputs 2.0000000000, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nWhat if all lanterns are at the same position? For example, n=3, l=10, a = [3,3,3]. Then after sorting, [3,3,3]. The first check is 3>0 → max_d =3. The last check is 10-3=7 → max_d is 7. Then, the gaps between consecutive lanterns are 0, 0. So the maximum is 7. So the answer is 7.0. Which is correct, because the lanterns are at 3, so the distance from 0 to 3 is 3, and from 3 to 10 is 7. So the required d is 7.0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 0]. Then first check is 0. Last check is 10-0=10. So the answer is 10.0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 0, 10]. The first check is 0. Last check is 0. The gaps between 0 and 0 is 0, then between 0 and 10 is 10. So the current is 5. So the max_d is 5. Which is correct. Because the first lantern is at 0, which covers from 0 -d to 0 +d. The second lantern is also at 0. The third is at 10. So the gap between 0 and 10 is 10, so d must be 5. So the code returns 5.0. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the Python code should be as written.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to ensure that the entire street is illuminated. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and considering the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check the Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the gap between them. The maximum radius required to cover this gap is half the size of the gap, as the light from each lantern can cover up to a distance `d` on both sides.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif a[0] > 0:\n    max_d = a[0]\nif a[-1] < l:\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(n - 1):\n    gap = a[i + 1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in easily determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial Distance Checks**: The initial checks for the distances from the start and end of the street to the nearest lanterns ensure that these edges are covered by the light radius.\n3. **Gap Analysis**: By iterating through the sorted list of lantern positions, we compute the gaps between each consecutive pair. The largest gap determines the minimum radius needed to cover the entire street, as the worst-case scenario for coverage is the midpoint of the largest gap.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required minimum radius with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), followed by a linear scan of the sorted list, making it efficient even for the upper constraint limits.",
