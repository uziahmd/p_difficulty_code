    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the task is to compute the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees, modulo 998244353. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nA good tree is an edge-weighted tree where each edge has weight 1 or -1. Additionally, for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Oh right, so every vertex has this condition. \n\nSo for each vertex, the product of the weights of its adjacent edges is -1. Let me think about what that implies. For example, if a vertex has degree k, then the product of its edges' weights is -1. Since each edge is either 1 or -1, the product is -1 if there are an odd number of -1s in the edges connected to that vertex. Wait, because multiplying 1s and -1s: the product is -1 if there's an odd number of -1s. Because each -1 contributes a factor of -1, and the product is (-1)^m where m is the number of -1 edges. So for the product to be -1, m must be odd. So each vertex must have an odd number of edges with weight -1.\n\nBut how can this be possible? Let's think about the degrees. For example, consider a tree. Each tree has n-1 edges. Each edge connects two vertices. Let's think about the sum over all vertices of the number of -1 edges adjacent to them. Each edge contributes to exactly two vertices. Let me denote for each edge, if it's a -1, then it contributes 1 to the count of both its endpoints. If it's a 1, then it contributes 0. So the total sum over all vertices of the number of -1 edges adjacent to them is 2 * (number of edges with weight -1). \n\nBut for each vertex, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it must be odd. Let's say there are n vertices. The sum of all these odd numbers for each vertex must be equal to 2 * (number of -1 edges). But the sum of n odd numbers is even if n is even, and odd if n is odd. However, 2 * (number of -1 edges) is even. Therefore, for the sum to be even, the sum of n odd numbers must be even. Which requires that n is even. Because the sum of n odd numbers is n mod 2. So if n is even, then sum is even. If n is odd, sum is odd. But 2k is even. Therefore, when n is odd, the sum of the odd numbers would be odd, which cannot equal 2k. Hence, there are no good trees when n is odd. \n\nWait, that's a crucial observation. So for n odd, there are zero good trees. Therefore, the answer is zero. Let's check the sample input. For example, the second test case is n=1. Wait, n=1? Well, the problem says n is positive integer. For n=1, there's only one vertex, but a tree with one vertex has zero edges. So for each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it (which are none) is 1? Because the product of zero terms is 1. But the condition requires that the product is -1. So for n=1, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer is zero. Which matches the second sample input where n=1 gives output 0.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, the sample input says that there's one good tree. Let's see. For n=2, the tree is just a single edge between 1 and 2. The product for vertex 1 is the weight of the edge. Similarly for vertex 2. So the product must be -1. Therefore, the edge's weight must be -1. So the sum d(1,2) is -1. Which matches the first sample.\n\nSo this suggests that when n is odd, the answer is zero. Because the sum of the odd numbers (each vertex's count of -1 edges) would be n mod 2, which is 1, but the total sum must be even. Hence, no solution. Therefore, for n odd, the answer is zero. So we can immediately return zero if n is odd. \n\nSo the first thing to check is whether n is even. If n is odd, output 0. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for even n, we need to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nLet me think about the structure of good trees. Since each vertex has an odd number of -1 edges. Let's consider that for each vertex, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it is odd. So for each vertex, the degree of the vertex (number of edges) must be at least 1, but since it's a tree, all vertices have degree ≥1 except when n=1. But for n≥2, all vertices have degree ≥1.\n\nBut how can we model the constraints on the edges?\n\nAlternatively, since each edge contributes to two vertices. Let me think about the parity conditions. For each vertex, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it must be odd. Let me model this as variables. Let me think of the edges as variables x_e ∈ {1, -1}. Then, for each vertex v, the product of x_e for e adjacent to v is -1. \n\nBut taking the product over all edges adjacent to v gives -1. So, if I take the product of all x_e for edges adjacent to v, that's -1. \n\nBut since each x_e is ±1, the product is equivalent to (-1)^{number of -1 edges adjacent to v} = -1. Therefore, the number of -1 edges adjacent to v must be odd. \n\nSo for each vertex, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it is odd. \n\nNow, considering that each edge is counted in exactly two vertices. Let me think of this as a system of equations. For each vertex, the sum (mod 2) of the variables (where each variable is 1 if the edge is -1, 0 otherwise) is 1. \n\nBut since each edge is part of two vertices, the system is over GF(2). Let me denote for each edge e, a variable y_e which is 1 if the edge is -1, else 0. Then, for each vertex v, the sum of y_e over edges adjacent to v is equal to 1 mod 2. \n\nThis is a system of equations. How many solutions are there? \n\nThe system is for a tree. Let me think about the system. Since the tree has n-1 edges and n vertices. The system has n equations (one per vertex), but they are not independent. Because the sum of all equations (sum over all vertices of the sum of y_e for edges adjacent to v) equals the sum over all edges of 2y_e (since each edge is counted twice, once for each endpoint). Therefore, the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2. But each equation is 1 mod 2. So sum of equations is n mod 2. Therefore, for the system to be consistent, n mod 2 must be 0. Which is exactly our case when n is even. \n\nTherefore, when n is even, the system has solutions. The number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - rank}, where rank is the rank of the system. \n\nBut how many solutions are there? Let's think. The system has n equations, but they are dependent. The sum of all equations is 0 mod 2, and since n is even, the sum of the RHS is n * 1 mod 2 = 0 mod 2. So the system is consistent. The rank of the system is (n-1), since the equations are dependent. So the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? No, wait. The system has n equations, but the rank is (n-1). So the number of solutions is 2^{(number of variables) - rank} }, which is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? That can't be right. Wait, for example, when n=2, the system has 2 equations. Each equation is y_1 = 1 mod 2. So the solution is y_1=1. Which is one solution. Which matches 2^0=1. So yes, in this case, the number of solutions is 1. \n\nBut for larger trees, how many solutions are there? Let me think. Suppose the tree is arbitrary. The system of equations is that the sum of y_e around each vertex is 1 mod 2. How many solutions are there? \n\nSince the system has rank (n-1), the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? Wait, no. The number of variables is (n-1). The rank is (n-1) - 1 = n-2? Or what is the actual rank? Let me think again. \n\nThe system is for a tree. Let me think about the system. The equations are that for each vertex, the sum of the y_e for edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. \n\nThe sum of all equations is 0 mod 2. So the system has rank n-1. Because the sum of all equations is zero, so there's one dependency. So the rank is n-1. \n\nSo the number of solutions is 2^{ (number of variables) - rank }, which is 2^{ (n-1) - (n-1) } } = 1. Wait, that would mean that there's exactly one solution for the system. But that seems impossible. For example, take a tree with three vertices. Wait, n=3 is odd, which is not allowed. Let's take n=4. Suppose we have a tree. Let me imagine a star-shaped tree with root 1 connected to 2,3,4. Then, the equations are:\n\nFor vertex 1: y1 + y2 + y3 = 1 mod 2 (assuming edges are 1-2 (y1), 1-3 (y2), 1-4 (y3)).\n\nFor vertex 2: y1 = 1 mod 2.\n\nFor vertex 3: y2 = 1 mod 2.\n\nFor vertex 4: y3 = 1 mod 2.\n\nSolving these equations: from vertex 2's equation, y1=1. From vertex 3's equation, y2=1. From vertex 4's equation, y3=1. Then for vertex 1's equation: 1+1+1 = 3 mod 2 = 1. Which satisfies the equation. So this is a valid solution. \n\nBut suppose I have another tree structure. Let's take a chain: 1-2-3-4. The edges are e1 (between 1-2), e2 (2-3), e3 (3-4). The equations are:\n\nVertex 1: e1 = 1 mod 2.\n\nVertex 2: e1 + e2 = 1 mod 2.\n\nVertex 3: e2 + e3 = 1 mod 2.\n\nVertex 4: e3 = 1 mod 2.\n\nSolving:\n\nFrom vertex 1: e1=1.\n\nFrom vertex 4: e3=1.\n\nThen, vertex 2: 1 + e2 = 1 → e2=0.\n\nVertex 3: 0 + 1 = 1 → OK.\n\nSo the solution is e1=1, e2=0, e3=1. \n\nSo this seems unique. So for any tree, the system has exactly one solution. Therefore, the number of possible assignments of y_e (i.e., the choice of which edges are -1) is exactly 1. \n\nWait, but that would imply that for each tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights to satisfy the conditions. But the problem says that the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1} ... but no, wait. Wait, the problem says that the total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}, but the good trees are those that satisfy the product condition. But according to our previous analysis, for each tree structure (i.e., each possible tree, regardless of edge weights), there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights (i.e., choose which edges are -1 and which are 1) to satisfy the product conditions. \n\nBut that would mean that the number of good trees is equal to the number of trees (n^{n-2}) multiplied by 1 (the unique way to assign the edge weights). So the total number of good trees is n^{n-2}.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input for n=2, the number of trees is 1 (since Cayley's formula says 2^{0}=1). And there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights (as discussed), so the total is 1. Which matches the first sample. For n=4, the sample says that there are 16 good trees. Let's check. Cayley's formula for n=4 is 4^2 = 16. So the number of trees is 16. And for each tree, exactly one assignment of edge weights. So total good trees is 16. Which matches the third sample's note. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is: for even n, the number of good trees is n^{n-2}, since each tree has exactly one way to assign the edge weights. \n\nSo now, the problem reduces to computing the sum of d(1,n) over all such good trees. \n\nBut how do we compute this sum? Because for each tree, there's exactly one way to assign the edge weights. So the sum is equal to the sum over all trees T of d_T(1,n), where d_T(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n in T, with the edge weights chosen uniquely for T.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the sum over all trees T of the value of the path from 1 to n, where each tree T is equipped with the unique edge weights that make it good.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, note that for each tree, the edge weights are determined uniquely by the constraints. So perhaps we can find some properties of this edge weight assignment. \n\nLet me think again about the system of equations. For each tree, the variables y_e (whether the edge is -1 or 1) are determined uniquely. Let me think of the variables y_e as 0 or 1, where 0 represents edge weight 1 and 1 represents -1. Then, the system is that for each vertex, the sum of y_e for edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. \n\nBut solving this system for a tree. How can we find the values of y_e?\n\nLet me think of the tree as a graph. Since it's a tree, there's a unique path between any two nodes. Let me think of the system of equations. For example, in the case of a chain, the solution was forced. Perhaps there's a way to assign the variables based on some traversal.\n\nAlternatively, since the system is over GF(2), and the tree is connected, maybe we can fix some variables and solve accordingly.\n\nAnother approach: Let me think of the system as follows. For each vertex, the sum of y_e around it is 1. Let me pick a root, say node 1, and perform a traversal. Let me think recursively. For example, in a tree rooted at 1, each child has an edge. Let me think of the variables for each edge. \n\nSuppose we have a tree rooted at node 1. For each node u, except the root, there is a parent edge. Let me consider the parent edge of u as e_u. Then, for the node u, the sum of the y_e's for edges adjacent to u is 1. The edges adjacent to u are the parent edge and the edges to children. However, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to express the variables in terms of the tree's structure.\n\nAlternatively, since the system is over GF(2), and the tree is connected, perhaps the solution is determined by choosing the variables for all edges except those in a spanning tree. But wait, the tree itself is the spanning tree. \n\nWait, the system is for the tree. Let me think again. The system is that for each vertex, the sum of y_e (for edges adjacent to it) is 1. Since the tree has n vertices and n-1 edges, and the system has n equations with one dependency, the solution is unique.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let me pick an arbitrary root, say node 1. For each node u, except the root, let me define the edge between u and its parent as e_u. Then, the variables y_e for the edges can be determined recursively. \n\nLet me think of the root node 1. For node 1, the sum of all y_e for edges adjacent to it is 1. These edges are the ones connecting to its children. Let's say node 1 has children v1, v2, ..., vk. Then, the sum of y_{e_vi} (for each child vi) is 1 mod 2. \n\nNow, for each child vi, the sum of y_e for edges adjacent to it is 1. The edges adjacent to vi are the edge e_vi (connecting to parent) and the edges to its children. Let me denote the variables for the edges from vi to its children as y_{e_vi_child}, etc. \n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern. Let me think recursively. For each node u, the sum of y_e for all edges adjacent to u is 1. Let me assume that for each node except the root, the value of y_e (the edge from u to its parent) is determined by the constraints of the subtree. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach. Since the tree is connected, we can perform a traversal and set the variables accordingly. Let me think of the tree as rooted at node 1. For each node u, except the root, let me define the edge between u and its parent as e_u. Let me assign variables to these edges. \n\nFor the root node 1, the sum of all y_e for its adjacent edges must be 1 mod 2. Let's say that the root has degree d. Then, the sum of the y_e's for these d edges is 1 mod 2. However, for each of the other nodes, their adjacent edges include their parent edge and their children edges. \n\nLet me think for a leaf node. Suppose u is a leaf (other than the root). Then, the only edge adjacent to u is the edge to its parent. So the sum for u is y_e = 1 mod 2. Hence, y_e must be 1. \n\nSo, for all leaves (except possibly the root), their parent edge must have y_e = 1. \n\nNow, let's think of a non-leaf node. Suppose u is not a leaf, and not the root. Then, the sum of the y_e for all edges adjacent to u must be 1. The edges adjacent to u are the edge to its parent (say, e_p) and the edges to its children (say, e_1, e_2, ..., e_k). So, the sum is y_p + sum_{i} y_i = 1 mod 2. \n\nBut for each child v of u, the edge e_v (from v to u) is part of the variables. For each such child v, since v is not the root, we can process it recursively. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to determine the variables. Let me think of the following approach: for each node u, after processing all children, we can determine the value of the parent edge's y_e. \n\nLet me think of a post-order traversal. For example, starting from the leaves. For each node u (not the root), after processing all children, we can compute the sum of the y_e for the edges from u to its children. Let's call this sum s. Then, since the sum of y_p (parent edge) + s = 1 mod 2, we have y_p = 1 - s mod 2. \n\nBut how does this work? Let's take an example. \n\nTake the chain 1-2-3-4, rooted at 1. The children of 1 is 2. The children of 2 is 3. The children of 3 is 4. \n\nStarting with node 4 (a leaf). It has no children. So the sum of the edges from 4 to children is 0. Then, the parent edge (edge between 3 and 4) must satisfy y_p = 1 - 0 = 1 mod 2. So y_34 = 1. \n\nThen, moving to node 3. Its children are 4. The sum of edges to children is 1. Then, the parent edge (edge between 2 and 3) must satisfy y_p + 1 = 1 → y_p = 0. So y_23 = 0. \n\nNext, node 2. Its children are 3. Sum of edges to children is 0. So the parent edge (edge between 1 and 2) must satisfy y_p + 0 = 1 → y_p = 1. So y_12 = 1. \n\nFinally, the root node 1 has children 2. The sum of edges to children is 1. Since the root's equation is that the sum of edges adjacent to it is 1. The root has only one edge (to 2), so 1 = 1 mod 2. Which holds. \n\nThus, the variables are y_12=1, y_23=0, y_34=1. Which corresponds to edge weights: 1-2 is -1, 2-3 is 1, 3-4 is -1. The path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4, with sum -1 + 1 + (-1) = -1. Which in the third sample for n=4, this would contribute -1. But according to the sample, for n=4, the sum of d(1,4) across all good trees is -10. But there are 16 good trees (each tree has one assignment of edge weights). So each tree contributes some value, and the sum is -10. \n\nBut how do we find the sum over all trees of the path sum from 1 to n?\n\nHmm. So the key is to find, for each tree, the value of the path sum from 1 to n, given the unique edge weights determined by the constraints, and then sum all these values over all possible trees.\n\nBut considering that for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined, perhaps we can find a way to compute the expected value of the path sum multiplied by the number of trees, or find a formula that allows us to compute the total sum.\n\nBut how? Let's think of the problem in terms of linearity of expectation. Suppose we imagine that each tree is chosen uniformly at random among all possible trees (but with the unique edge weights assigned). Then, the total sum would be equal to the number of trees multiplied by the expected value of d(1,n) for a random tree. \n\nBut perhaps there's a clever way to model this. Let me think about the contribution of each edge to the total sum. For each edge e, how often does it appear on the path from 1 to n in some tree, multiplied by its weight (either 1 or -1) under the constraints.\n\nBut since each tree has exactly one assignment of weights, and for each tree, the weight of the edge depends on the tree's structure and the constraints. However, the problem is that the weight of an edge depends on the entire tree's structure, not just the presence of the edge. \n\nBut perhaps we can find for each edge e, the expected value of its contribution (weight * indicator that it's on the path from 1 to n) across all trees. Then, multiply by the number of trees and sum over all edges. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the weight is determined by the constraints. Let me think about how to find the weight of an edge e in a tree T. \n\nIn the earlier example, for a tree T, the weight of each edge is determined by the system of equations. For example, in the case of the chain, the edge between 1 and 2 had weight -1 (y=1), the edge between 2 and 3 had weight 1 (y=0), and between 3 and 4 had weight -1 (y=1). \n\nBut how can we find a general formula for the weight of an edge e in the tree T? \n\nLet me think again about the system of equations. For each node u, the sum of the y_e's (edges adjacent to u) is 1 mod 2. \n\nIf we consider the tree as a graph, and think of the variables y_e as being determined by the system, then for any edge e between u and v, the value of y_e is determined by the parity conditions. \n\nLet me think of the tree as a rooted tree at node 1. For each node u, let me define the depth of u as the number of edges on the path from 1 to u. Then, for each node u, the number of edges on the path from 1 to u is its depth. \n\nBut how does that help? \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each node u, the value of the sum of y_e along the path from 1 to u. Let me denote this as S(u). Then, since each edge on the path contributes its y_e, which is 0 or 1. But the sum S(u) is the number of edges on the path from 1 to u that have y_e = 1. \n\nBut since the weight of an edge is -1 if y_e=1, and 1 otherwise, the actual sum d(1,u) would be (number of edges with y_e=0) * 1 + (number of edges with y_e=1) * (-1) = (total edges on path) - 2 * (number of edges with y_e=1). \n\nBut total edges on path is depth(u). Let's denote the number of edges with y_e=1 on the path as c(u). Then d(1,u) = depth(u) - 2c(u). \n\nBut how can we find c(u)? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of S(u) as the number of edges on the path from 1 to u with y_e=1. Then, d(1,u) = sum_{e in path} (-1)^{y_e} = sum_{e in path} [1 - 2y_e] = (depth(u)) - 2S(u). \n\nBut what is S(u)? \n\nLet me think of the system of equations. For each node u, the sum of y_e for all edges adjacent to u is 1 mod 2. Let me denote this as equation for u. \n\nFor the root node 1, the sum of y_e for all edges adjacent to it is 1. Those edges are the ones leading to its children. \n\nFor any other node u, the sum of y_e for all edges adjacent to it is 1. The edges adjacent to u are the edge to its parent and the edges to its children. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a tree rooted at 1, and for each node u, we can define S(u) as the number of edges on the path from 1 to u with y_e=1. Then, for the root, S(1) = 0. \n\nFor any node u, let's say that the parent of u is p. The edge between p and u has y value y_pu. Then, S(u) = S(p) + y_pu. \n\nNow, for node u, the sum of y_e for all edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. The edges adjacent to u are the edge to its parent (y_pu) and the edges to its children (y_uv for each child v of u). Let's denote the sum of y_uv for children as sum_children. Then, the equation is y_pu + sum_children ≡ 1 mod 2. \n\nBut how can we relate this to S(u)? \n\nLet me think about the sum_children. For each child v of u, the sum_children includes y_uv. Also, for each child v, the sum of y_e for edges adjacent to v is 1. For node v, the sum is y_uv (the edge to parent) plus the sum of y_vw for its children w. This is equal to 1 mod 2. \n\nThis seems recursive. But perhaps we can find that for any node u, the sum of y_e for edges adjacent to u is 1 mod 2. \n\nBut how does that relate to S(u)?\n\nAlternatively, think about the entire tree. For the root node 1, the sum of its adjacent edges' y_e is 1 mod 2. For any other node u, the sum of y_e for adjacent edges is 1 mod 2. \n\nNow, let's consider the sum over all edges of y_e multiplied by 2 (since each edge is counted in two nodes). But earlier we saw that the sum of all equations is zero mod 2. \n\nBut perhaps we can find a relationship between the values of y_e and the structure of the tree. \n\nAlternatively, since the system is uniquely solvable, perhaps there's a way to express the y_e in terms of the tree's structure. For example, in the case of the rooted tree, each node u (except the root) has a parent p(u), and the y value of the edge between u and p(u) can be determined based on the subtree of u. \n\nLet me think again about the post-order traversal approach. For a node u (non-root), after processing all its children, we can compute the sum of the y values of the edges from u to its children. Let's call this sum s. Then, since the sum for node u's adjacent edges is 1 mod 2, and the adjacent edges are the parent edge (y_p) and the children edges (sum s), we have y_p + s = 1 mod 2. So y_p = 1 - s mod 2. \n\nThis suggests that for each node u (non-root), the value of the parent edge's y is determined by the sum of the y values of the edges from u to its children. \n\nBut how does this help us find the value of the edge between u and its parent?\n\nLet me think of the following: for each node u, the value of the edge from u to its parent is 1 minus the sum of the y values of the edges from u to its children. \n\nThis seems like a recursive relation. For example, for a leaf node (other than root), the sum of the edges from u to its children is 0, so the parent edge has y_p = 1. \n\nSo, if we can find for each node u, the sum of the y values of edges from u to its children, then we can compute the parent edge's y. \n\nBut how can we find this sum? It seems to depend on the children's subtrees. \n\nLet me think of this as a function. Let me define for each node u, a value f(u), which is the sum of the y values of the edges from u to its children. Then, the parent edge of u has y value equal to (1 - f(u)) mod 2. \n\nBut what is f(u)? For node u, f(u) is the sum of the y values of the edges from u to its children. For each child v of u, the edge from u to v has a y value of y_uv. \n\nBut for the child v, its parent edge (u to v) has y_uv = (1 - f(v)) mod 2. So f(u) is the sum over all children v of u of (1 - f(v)) mod 2. \n\nWait, no. Because for each child v of u, the edge between u and v has y value determined by the formula for v. Since v is a child of u, the edge between u and v is the parent edge of v. So for node v, the parent edge's y value is (1 - f(v)) mod 2. \n\nThus, for node u, the sum of the y values of edges from u to its children is the sum over all children v of u of (1 - f(v)) mod 2. \n\nBut since we are working mod 2, the sum can be represented as the number of children v of u for which (1 - f(v)) is 1 mod 2, i.e., the number of children where f(v) is 0 mod 2. \n\nBut how does this help us compute f(u)? \n\nLet me think recursively. For a leaf node (non-root), it has no children, so f(u) = 0. Then, the parent edge's y value is 1 - 0 = 1 mod 2. \n\nFor a node u with children, f(u) is the sum (mod 2) of (1 - f(v)) for each child v of u. \n\nBut since the sum is mod 2, this is equal to the number of children v of u where f(v) is 0 mod 2, modulo 2. \n\nBut this seems complex. However, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me think about the parity of the number of children with certain properties. \n\nAlternatively, since the tree is arbitrary, and we need to find the sum over all trees of the value of the path from 1 to n, which depends on the y values of the edges along that path, perhaps we can find that for each edge e, the probability that it is on the path from 1 to n in a random tree, multiplied by the expected value of its y_e (which is either 0 or 1, depending on the constraints) and then multiplied by the number of trees. \n\nBut this seems abstract. Let me think differently. \n\nThe value d(1,n) for a tree T is equal to the sum of (-1)^{y_e} for all edges e on the path from 1 to n. Since each edge's y_e is determined by the tree's structure and the constraints. \n\nBut how to find this sum across all trees?\n\nLet me think about the contribution of each edge e to the total sum. For each tree T, if e is on the path from 1 to n, then it contributes (-1)^{y_e(T)} to d(1,n). Otherwise, it contributes nothing. \n\nSo the total sum over all trees is the sum over all edges e of [ (-1)^{y_e(T)} * (number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n) ].\n\nBut this seems promising. Because if I can compute for each edge e, the number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the expected value of (-1)^{y_e(T)} for those trees, then sum over all e. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nFirst, for each edge e, how many trees contain e and have e on the path from 1 to n. \n\nBut the number of trees that contain edge e and have e on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees where e is part of the tree and lies on the path between 1 and n. \n\nBut since the tree is arbitrary, perhaps we can compute this count. \n\nBut for a given edge e between u and v, the number of trees where e is present and lies on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees where e is present and the tree is such that u and v are connected in the tree, and in the tree, the path from 1 to n passes through e. \n\nBut this seems complicated. However, there's a known formula for the number of trees containing a specific edge. \n\nIn Cayley's formula, the number of trees on n labeled nodes is n^{n-2}. For any specific pair of nodes u and v, the number of trees that contain the edge between u and v is n^{n-3} * 2. Wait, no. Let me recall that the number of trees containing a specific edge (u, v) is n^{n-3} * 1? Or something else. \n\nActually, the number of trees on n labeled nodes that contain a specific edge (u, v) is (n-1)^{n-3} * 2? No. Let me think. \n\nThe number of trees containing a specific edge (u, v) can be calculated by considering that the edge (u, v) is part of the tree. To form such a tree, we can consider u and v as a single node, and then count the number of trees on n-1 nodes (the merged node plus the rest). But this is similar to the concept of contraction. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula that the number of trees containing a specific edge is n^{n-3} * 2? Or perhaps not. \n\nActually, there's a theorem that says that for any two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees on n labeled nodes that contain the edge uv is n^{n-3} * 2? Or no. \n\nWait, Cayley's formula says that the number of trees is n^{n-2}. For each tree, there are n-1 edges. So the total number of edges across all trees is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the distance $d(1, n)$ for all good edge-weighted trees with $n$ vertices.

Hence, the result is 0 for odd $n$.\n2. **Tree Structure and Constraints**: For even $n$, each tree structure has exactly one valid way to assign edge weights to satisfy the constraints. This is derived from solving a system of linear equations over GF(2).\n3. **Contribution of Each Edge**: For each edge in the tree, determine its contribution to the path from vertex 1 to vertex $n$.
