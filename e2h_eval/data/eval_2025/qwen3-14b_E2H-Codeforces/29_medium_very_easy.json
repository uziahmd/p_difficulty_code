Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The main challenge is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If I try to process each substitution naively by replacing all occurrences in the string each time, that would be O(n * m) where m is the length of the string, which might be too slow for large inputs. Because for each query, replacing every occurrence of a digit could take O(len(s)) time, and with n queries, it's O(n * len(s)), which could be up to 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a certain digit with another string. But substitutions are applied in order. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', and then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's would become '00' and then each '0' becomes '1', leading to '11'.\n\nBut if I process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe I can track how each digit is transformed. Wait, but the substitutions are applied in the order given. So the first query is applied first, then the next, etc. So the substitutions are cumulative. So the problem is that when a substitution is done, it affects all subsequent substitutions. For example, if I have a substitution for '2' and later a substitution for '0', then the original '2's would be replaced by whatever was in the first substitution, and then if that substitution's result includes '0's, they would be replaced in later steps.\n\nSo, the key here is to model the transformations in a way that allows us to compute the final value without actually building the entire string. Because building the entire string could be impossible for large substitutions (like if each substitution replaces a digit with a long string, leading to exponential growth).\n\nSo perhaps we can model each digit's transformation as a function. For example, for each digit d, we can track what it gets replaced with. However, since substitutions can be applied multiple times, we need to track the current replacement for each digit. But when a substitution is applied, say, replacing d with t, then any future substitution on digits in t would affect the result.\n\nWait, but the substitution is done in sequence. So for example, suppose we have:\n\nOriginal string s = \"123\"\n\nFirst query: 2 → \"a\" (but in reality, it's digits). Then query 3 → \"b\".\n\nThen the string becomes \"1a b\".\n\nBut if the first substitution is 2→\"ab\", then the second substitution is a→\"c\", then the original 2s would be replaced with ab, and then a's would be replaced with c's. So the order of substitutions matters.\n\nBut how can we represent this? The idea is that when processing substitutions, each substitution may affect the current mapping of digits. So, for example, if we have a mapping for digit d, and then we replace d with some string, then any future substitutions that affect digits in that string will affect the final result.\n\nBut how can we model this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about using a dictionary that maps each digit to its current replacement string. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each substitution query, we update the mapping. However, when a substitution is made, say, replacing digit d with t, then any existing references to d in the mapping would now be replaced with t. Wait, no. Because the substitution is applied to the current string. So, for example, if we first replace '2' with '00', and then replace '0' with '11', then the original '2's would be replaced with '00', which then becomes '1111'.\n\nBut if we model the mapping as a tree, where each substitution builds upon previous ones, perhaps we can represent the final expansion of each digit as a function that can be computed incrementally.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Instead of keeping track of the actual string, we can track for each digit, what it would expand to. But since substitutions can be applied in sequence, we need to ensure that when a substitution is made, all existing mappings that might have referenced the substituted digit are updated accordingly. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the substitutions as building a kind of expansion tree. For example, each substitution replaces a digit with a string. But when you substitute a digit, you need to remember that any future substitutions on the digits in the replacement string will affect the expansion.\n\nBut how can we compute the final expansion of the original string?\n\nAnother approach: Since substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution replaces all instances of a digit in the current string. So, if we can model the expansion of each digit as a string, and whenever a substitution is made, we update the expansion of that digit to be the new string. However, when a substitution is made for a digit d, any previous expansions that included d would need to be updated. But that's not feasible directly because the expansions are built from previous substitutions.\n\nWait, but perhaps the substitution is applied in such a way that when you replace d with t, then any future expansion of digits that were previously expanded to include d would now have to be updated. However, that's not possible unless we track all dependencies, which seems complex.\n\nWait, but here's a better idea. Let's think in reverse. Suppose that we process the substitutions in reverse order. For example, the last substitution is applied first. But I don't think that helps.\n\nAlternatively, think of each substitution as modifying the expansion of a certain digit. For example, suppose we have a map called 'replace', where replace[d] is the string that digit d is replaced with. Initially, replace[d] = d for all d. Then, when a query comes in that says replace d with t, we set replace[d] = t. However, when we process this, any existing digits that were mapped to include d would now be affected. But how do we track that?\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution is applied to the current string. For example, if we have a substitution that replaces '2' with '00', then any future substitution that replaces '0' with something else will affect the '2's. So the expansion of '2' would be the expansion of '00', which depends on the current expansion of '0'.\n\nTherefore, the expansion of each digit is dependent on the current state of the replacement mappings. So, for example, when you want to compute the expansion of a digit d, you need to recursively expand it according to the current mappings.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nSuppose that for each digit, we track the current expansion. However, when a substitution is made for a digit, say, d, then we need to update the expansion of d to be the new string t. However, other digits that had expansions that included d would need to be recomputed. But that seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, when we need to compute the final value of the original string, we can process each character in the original string, and for each character, compute its expansion based on the current mappings. But since substitutions are applied in sequence, the mappings are changing over time.\n\nBut here's the thing: when processing the substitutions, each substitution replaces all instances of a digit in the current string. However, the current string is not stored as a string, but as a series of substitutions. So, the problem is that the substitutions can be represented as a mapping from digits to their replacement strings. However, when you perform a substitution for a digit d, you need to replace all instances of d in the current string. But the current string is represented by the original string and the substitution mappings.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the final expansion of the original string as a combination of the substitutions. For example, each character in the original string is replaced by the expansion of that character according to the substitution rules. But the substitution rules are processed in order, so each substitution affects the expansion of digits that come after it.\n\nSo here's the plan: For each substitution query, we need to update the replacement mappings in such a way that when we process the original string, each character is expanded according to the latest mappings. However, since substitutions can overwrite previous mappings, we need to track the current mapping for each digit.\n\nBut how can we compute the expansion of each digit in the original string, considering all substitutions?\n\nFor example, suppose the original string is '123', and substitutions are:\n\nFirst, replace 2 with 'a'.\n\nThen replace a with 'b'.\n\nWait, but the substitution is for digits. So the first substitution is 2 → 'a' (assuming 'a' is a digit string). Then, the second substitution is, say, 3 → 'b'. But the first substitution's 'a' is part of the string. However, the substitution queries are only for digits. So, the substitution queries are for digits, not for arbitrary strings. Therefore, when a substitution is done, it's only for a single digit (di), and ti can be any string of digits (including empty).\n\nSo, for example, if we have a substitution '2 → 00', then any occurrence of '2' in the current string is replaced with '00'. Then, if there's a substitution '0 → 11', then all occurrences of '0's in the current string (which were created by the previous substitution) are replaced with '11'.\n\nSo, the problem is that each substitution affects the current state of the string, which is built from previous substitutions.\n\nNow, the key insight here is that for each substitution, when we replace a digit d with a string t, we need to make sure that any future substitutions on digits present in t will affect the expansion. However, if we track for each digit d, the current replacement string (which may be a combination of other substitutions), then when we need to compute the final expansion of the original string, we can recursively expand each character.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of using a memoization approach. For each digit, we can keep track of the current replacement string. However, when a substitution is made for a digit, say, d, we set replace[d] = t. However, when expanding a digit, say, d, we need to expand replace[d], which may involve other digits. But since the substitutions are processed in order, the replace map is updated as we process each query.\n\nSo, during the processing of the queries, we can maintain a dictionary that maps each digit to its replacement string. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each query, we update the mapping for di to ti. However, when we do that, any future expansion of di will use ti, which may include other digits that have their own mappings.\n\nBut when we need to compute the final string, we can't just build it directly because it could be extremely large. Instead, we need to compute the numerical value modulo 1e9+7. So, instead of building the string, we can compute the value as we process the substitutions.\n\nWait, that's a good point. The problem requires us to compute the number represented by the final string modulo 1e9+7. So, perhaps we can model the value of each substitution as a number, and compute the value incrementally.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that each substitution replaces a digit d with a string t. The value of t is a number, which can be computed modulo MOD (1e9+7). However, when we replace d with t, any occurrence of d in the original string will contribute the value of t multiplied by some power of 10 depending on its position. But since the substitutions are applied in sequence, and the replacements can be nested, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, let's model for each digit, the value that it contributes when expanded. For example, for each digit d, we can track two things: the value of the expansion of d (as a number mod MOD), and the length of the expansion (number of digits). Because when we replace a digit d with a string t, the value of d's expansion is the value of t, and the length is the length of t. However, when a digit is part of a larger number, the position (i.e., the place value) of the digits in t depends on where the original digit was placed.\n\nBut this seems challenging because the position of the digits in the original string affects their contribution. For example, if a digit is replaced by a string of length l, then the value of that string is multiplied by 10^k, where k depends on the position of the original digit in the original string. However, since the original string is being modified through substitutions, tracking the exact positions is difficult.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the entire string as a sequence of digits, and for each substitution, track the value of the entire string. However, this is not feasible for large strings.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution replaces all instances of a digit in the current string, perhaps we can model the entire process as a series of transformations on the current value and length of the string.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's say that we have a current value V and a current length L. When we replace all instances of a digit d in the current string with a string t. How does this affect V and L?\n\nBut this seems complicated because the value depends on the position of the digits. For example, replacing a digit in the middle of the string would change the value in a non-trivial way.\n\nAnother idea: Since we need to compute the final value mod MOD, perhaps we can model the entire string as a number, and for each substitution, compute how replacing a digit d with a string t affects the number.\n\nBut again, how to compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each substitution query, we can track for each digit, what is the current expansion of that digit. For example, for each digit d, we can have a function that returns the string it expands to. But since we need to compute the final value mod MOD, perhaps we can track for each digit d, two values: the value of the expansion (mod MOD) and the length of the expansion (number of digits). This is because when a digit is replaced by a string t, the value of that expansion is the value of t mod MOD, and the length is len(t). However, when a digit is part of a larger number, the way it contributes to the overall value depends on the position of the digits. But if we can model the entire string as a sequence of expansions, perhaps we can compute the total value.\n\nBut how to handle the fact that substitutions can be applied in any order, and the replacements can be nested.\n\nWait, here's a possible way. Let's consider that the original string is processed as follows: each character in the original string is replaced by its current expansion. The problem is that the expansion of each character depends on the current state of the substitution mappings.\n\nSo, for example, the initial string is s. We can process each character in s, and for each character, compute its expansion. However, the expansion of a character is determined by the substitution rules applied so far.\n\nBut how to compute this expansion efficiently.\n\nLet me think recursively. For a given digit d, its expansion is the string ti that it's been replaced with in the latest substitution. But ti may contain digits that have their own substitutions. So, the expansion of d is the expansion of each digit in ti, concatenated. So, for example, if d is replaced with \"ab\", and a is replaced with \"x\", and b is replaced with \"y\", then the expansion of d is \"xy\".\n\nSo, if we can compute for each digit d, the current expansion as a string, but since the strings can be very long, this is not feasible. However, since we need the final value mod MOD, perhaps we can compute for each digit d, the value of its expansion mod MOD and the length of the expansion.\n\nThis is similar to the approach used in some problems where you have to compute the value of a string with substitutions, and you track the value and the length.\n\nLet me formalize this. For each digit d, we can track:\n\n- val[d]: the value of the expansion of d mod MOD.\n\n- len[d]: the length of the expansion of d.\n\nInitially, val[d] = d (mod MOD), len[d] = 1 for each digit d.\n\nWhen a substitution query comes in, say, replacing digit di with ti, we need to update val[di] and len[di] based on ti's value and length.\n\nBut ti is a string. How do we compute its value and length? Well, the value of ti is the number represented by ti mod MOD, and the length is len(ti).\n\nWait, but ti can be any string of digits. So, for example, if ti is \"00\", then its value is 0 mod MOD, and length is 2.\n\nSo, when processing a substitution query \"di -> ti\", we need to compute the value of ti as a number mod MOD, and the length of ti. Then, set val[di] = value of ti mod MOD, and len[di] = len(ti).\n\nBut wait, this approach assumes that ti is a fixed string. However, ti may contain digits that have their own substitutions. For example, if ti is \"a\", and a is a digit that has been substituted. But no, in the substitution query, ti is a string of digits. So, when processing the substitution, ti is a string of digits. However, when we process the substitution, we need to compute the value of ti as a number, but that's not correct, because ti may contain digits that have been substituted in previous steps. Wait no, because the substitution is applied to the current string. So, the substitution \"di -> ti\" replaces all instances of di in the current string with ti. However, ti is a string of digits, and the substitution is applied as-is. So, ti is not expanded further. Because the substitution is applied in the order of the queries. So, if a substitution replaces di with ti, then ti is treated as a literal string. Any substitutions that happen after this will affect the digits in ti. For example, if we first replace di with ti (which contains digit dj), and then later replace dj with some other string, then the original ti's dj's will be replaced in subsequent substitutions.\n\nAh! So, the substitution replaces di with ti, but ti is not expanded at the time of substitution. It is expanded only when future substitutions are applied to the digits in ti. Therefore, the val and len for di should not be computed based on ti's current expansion, but based on ti's literal value and length. Because ti is a string that may be expanded in future substitutions.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting. Because if we process the substitution \"di -> ti\", then ti is a string of digits. However, when we compute val[di], we need to know the value of ti, but ti may be expanded in future substitutions. So, how can we track this?\n\nThis suggests that the previous approach of tracking val and len for each digit is incorrect, because ti is not expanded immediately. It's only expanded when substitutions are applied to its digits. So, for example, if we have a substitution \"2 -> 00\", and then later \"0 -> 11\", then the original \"2\" would be replaced with \"00\", which would then be replaced with \"1111\".\n\nSo, the problem is that the val and len for di (in this case, 2) should not be set to the value of ti (00) at the time of substitution, but rather, the val and len for di should be updated dynamically based on the substitutions applied to ti's digits.\n\nThis complicates things. Because the value of di's expansion depends on the substitutions that are applied after the substitution of di.\n\nSo, how can we model this? It seems like we need to track for each digit d, the current expansion as a function of the substitutions. But how?\n\nAlternative idea: Whenever a substitution is made for a digit d, we need to update the val and len of d to be based on the current val and len of the digits in ti. Because ti is a string of digits, and each of those digits may have their own expansions.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a substitution \"d -> t\", where t is a string of digits. To compute the value of d's expansion, we need to compute the value of t, but with each digit in t replaced by their current expansions. Similarly for the length.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. Let's say that for a substitution \"d -> t\", the value of d's expansion is the value of the string t, where each character in t is expanded according to the current mappings. Similarly for the length.\n\nBut how to compute this value and length efficiently?\n\nThe value of the expanded string t can be calculated as follows:\n\nInitialize a variable current_value = 0.\n\nFor each character c in t:\n\ncurrent_value = current_value * 10 + val[c]\n\ncurrent_value mod MOD.\n\nSimilarly, the length is the sum of len[c] for each c in t.\n\nSo, when we process a substitution query \"d -> t\", we can compute the new val[d] and len[d] by iterating through each character in t and using the current val and len of those characters.\n\nThis seems promising. Because, for example, when we first replace d with t, the val[d] is computed based on the current val of the characters in t. Then, if later substitutions change the val of those characters, the val of d would not automatically update. But that's a problem. Because, for example, if we have a substitution for d, then later a substitution for a character in t, the val of d should change accordingly.\n\nWait, but this approach would not capture that. Because once we process the substitution for d, the val[d] is fixed based on the current val of the characters in t. However, if later substitutions change the val of those characters, the val of d remains the same. Which is incorrect.\n\nSo this suggests that this approach is not sufficient. Because the val and len of d should be recomputed whenever any of the digits in t are modified in future substitutions.\n\nBut how can we track that? It seems like a dependency graph. Each substitution for a digit d depends on the current val and len of the digits in its ti string. So, whenever any of those digits are modified, the val and len of d need to be recomputed.\n\nThis seems computationally intensive, but perhaps manageable if we can find a way to track dependencies and recompute when necessary.\n\nBut with the constraints given (n up to 1e5), this might not be feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Since substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution replaces a digit with a new string, perhaps we can process the substitutions in such a way that when we process a substitution for a digit d, we immediately update val[d] and len[d] based on the current state of the other digits. This way, even if future substitutions modify the digits in ti, the val and len for d are not automatically updated. However, this would be incorrect, as future substitutions would affect the expansion of d.\n\nBut this is a problem. For example, if we first substitute d with t, which contains a character e. Then, later we substitute e with something else. The original substitution for d would not have taken into account the new substitution for e. Hence, the val of d would be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So, how else can we model this?\n\nPerhaps, instead of trying to track the val and len for each digit, we can process the substitutions in reverse order and build up the val and len for each digit. Wait, but the substitutions are applied in order, so the first substitution is applied first, then the second, etc. Processing them in reverse would not capture the correct order.\n\nAnother idea: The substitution process is such that when a substitution for a digit is made, it overrides any previous substitution for that digit. So, for example, if a digit d is first substituted with t1, then later substituted with t2, then the final substitution is t2. So, the latest substitution for d determines what it expands to.\n\nBut when expanding d, the ti string for the latest substitution is used, and each character in ti is expanded according to their current substitution.\n\nThis suggests that when processing substitutions, we can maintain for each digit d, the current replacement string (ti). Then, when we need to compute the final value of the original string, we can recursively expand each character according to the current substitution mappings.\n\nBut again, for large strings, this could be computationally expensive. However, since we need to compute the value mod MOD, perhaps we can compute this recursively with memoization.\n\nLet me think. Let's define a function f(d) which returns the value of the expansion of digit d mod MOD, and the length of the expansion. Then, for each substitution, when we replace d with ti, we can compute f(d) as follows:\n\nvalue = 0\n\nlength = 0\n\nfor each c in ti:\n\n    value = (value * 10 + f(c)[0]) % MOD\n\n    length += f(c)[1]\n\nSo, f(d) = (value, length)\n\nBut this function depends on the current state of substitutions. So, whenever a substitution is made, we need to recompute f(d) for the affected digits. But how can we manage this?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem, where each substitution may require recomputing the f(d) for certain digits.\n\nBut how to handle this efficiently?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a substitution for digit d. When we process this substitution, we need to update the f(d) based on the current f of the digits in ti. However, if any of those digits are later changed, then the f(d) would need to be recomputed again.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a memoization table, but with dependencies. However, given the high number of queries and substitutions, this could be computationally expensive.\n\nBut perhaps, given that each substitution for a digit d replaces its current ti, we can recompute f(d) each time a substitution is made for d. Because, when a substitution is made for d, the new ti is known, and we can compute f(d) based on the current state of the other digits.\n\nBut this approach would require that whenever we process a substitution for d, we recompute f(d) based on the current f of the digits in ti. However, this would not account for future changes to those digits. But that's okay, because when those digits are changed, their f values will be recomputed, and any substitution that depends on them would need to be recomputed as well.\n\nBut how to track which substitutions depend on which digits? That seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can assume that when we process a substitution for d, we compute f(d) based on the current state of the system, and any future changes to other digits will not affect the current f(d) until we reprocess substitutions that depend on those digits.\n\nBut this would lead to incorrect results. For example, if we first substitute d with ti (which contains e), then later substitute e with tj. The f(d) computed during the first substitution would not account for the new substitution of e, leading to an incorrect value.\n\nThus, this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's think about the fact that substitutions are applied in sequence. Each substitution replaces all instances of a digit in the current string. So, the final string is the result of applying all substitutions in order. The problem is to compute the numeric value of this final string mod MOD.\n\nBut if we can simulate the substitutions, but in a way that doesn't require storing the entire string, perhaps we can find a way to compute the value.\n\nLet me think about the following: Each substitution replaces all occurrences of a digit in the current string with a new string. So, for example, if the current string is S, and we replace all instances of d with t, then the new string is S' = S with d replaced by t. The value of S' can be computed based on the value of S and the substitutions.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the value of the string as a number mod MOD. Suppose the current value is V and the length is L. When we replace all occurrences of digit d in the string with string t, how does this affect V and L?\n\nBut this seems complicated because the positions of the digits matter. However, perhaps there's a way to model this with the help of some mathematical properties.\n\nFor example, when you replace a digit d with a string t, the contribution of each occurrence of d in the original string depends on its position. However, if we can track for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the current string and their positions, this would be complex.\n\nAlternative idea: Since we're working mod MOD, which is 1e9+7, which is a prime, perhaps we can represent the value of the string as a number mod MOD, and track for each digit d, how many times it appears in the current string, and their positions in terms of powers of 10.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's imagine that we have a way to represent the current string as a sequence of digits, but instead of storing the actual string, we store for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the string, and the contribution of each occurrence to the total value.\n\nBut this seems impractical for large numbers.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the entire string as a value and a length. For example, let's say that the current string has a value V and length L. When we replace all instances of digit d with string t, we need to compute the new value V' and length L'.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: the original string has some occurrences of d. Each occurrence of d contributes a certain amount to the value. Replacing it with t would replace that occurrence with the value of t, but multiplied by the appropriate power of 10 depending on its position.\n\nBut since the positions are not tracked, this seems impossible.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider that when we replace a digit d with string t, the value of the entire string can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each occurrence of d in the original string, replacing it with t adds a certain value. However, since the original string may have other digits, and the replacement of d affects the positions of the other digits, this is not straightforward.\n\nThis seems too difficult to model.\n\nLet me return to the initial idea of simulating the substitutions, but using the fact that we only need the final value mod MOD. Perhaps for each substitution, we can represent the current string as a value and a length, and for each substitution, calculate how it affects the value and length.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the following: when we replace all occurrences of a digit d in the current string with a string t, what is the new value and length?\n\nAssume that the current string has a value V and length L. Let's say that in the current string, there are C occurrences of d. Each occurrence of d is at some position, and replacing it with t will change the value.\n\nBut without knowing where the d's are located, this is not possible.\n\nHowever, perhaps we can track for each digit, the number of occurrences and the contribution of those occurrences to the total value. For example, for each digit d, we can track how many times it appears in the current string, and the sum of the powers of 10 that each occurrence contributes to the total value.\n\nFor example, suppose that the current string has some digits, and for each digit d, we have count[d] = number of times d appears, and pow_sum[d] = sum of 10^k for each occurrence of d, where k is the position from the right (so that the leftmost digit contributes 10^{L-1}).\n\nThen, when we replace all occurrences of d with string t, the new value would be:\n\nV_new = (V - sum_d (d * pow_sum[d])) + (sum_d (value_of_t * pow_sum[d] * 10^{len(t) - 1} ? )) \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nLet me think of a concrete example. Suppose the current string is \"12\", with value 12. Now, we replace all '2's with \"34\". The new string is \"134\", value 134. The original '2' was contributing 2 * 10^0 = 2. After replacement, the '34' contributes 3*10^1 + 4*10^0 = 34. The original value was 12, which is 1*10^1 + 2*10^0. The new value is 1*10^2 + 3*10^1 + 4*10^0 = 100 + 30 +4 = 134.\n\nSo, the change in value is due to replacing the contribution of the '2' (2) with the contribution of '34' (34), but also adjusting the positions of the digits to the right of the replaced digit.\n\nBut how to model this without knowing where the replaced digit is located?\n\nThis seems impossible unless we track for each digit, not just the count, but also the positions, which is not feasible for large strings.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints or think about the sample input.\n\nLooking at the third example in the sample input:\n\nInput is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'\n\nSo the original string is \"222\".\n\nQueries are:\n\nFirst, replace 2 with 0.\n\nThen, replace 0 with 7.\n\nSo the first substitution turns \"222\" into \"000\". The second substitution replaces each 0 with 7, resulting in \"777\".\n\nThe output is 777 mod 1e9+7 = 777.\n\nIf we model the value as follows: initially, the value is 222. After the first substitution, it's 000, which is 0. Then, after replacing 0 with 7, it becomes 777.\n\nSo, the value after the first substitution is 0, and after the second substitution, it's 777.\n\nBut how to compute this from the previous value?\n\nIn this case, the first substitution replaces all 2's with 0's. The value of the string becomes 000, which is 0. The second substitution replaces all 0's with 7's. The value becomes 777.\n\nSo, how to model this? It seems like the first substitution changes the value from 222 to 000, which is 0. The second substitution changes the value from 000 to 777.\n\nBut how to compute this change in value?\n\nMaybe the key is to realize that when you replace all instances of a digit d with a string t, the new value can be computed as follows:\n\nFor each occurrence of d in the current string, the contribution of that d is removed and replaced with the contribution of t, taking into account the position of the d in the string.\n\nBut how to track this without knowing the exact positions?\n\nPerhaps it's impossible, and the only way to proceed is to simulate the substitutions by expanding each digit in the original string, and for each substitution, keep track of the current expansion of each digit, and compute the final value by expanding the original string's characters.\n\nBut with large substitutions, this might be computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable with memoization.\n\nLet me think: For each query, when we process it, we can update a mapping from each digit to its replacement string. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a substitution is made for a digit d, we update the mapping to be the new string t. After all substitutions, we can process the original string by expanding each character according to the final mappings.\n\nBut expanding the original string character by character, recursively expanding each digit according to the mappings, and then computing the value of the resulting string mod MOD.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nFor example, if the original string is very long, and each substitution replaces a digit with a long string, then expanding it recursively could lead to an exponentially long string, which is not feasible.\n\nBut since we only need the value mod MOD, perhaps we can compute the value on the fly during the expansion.\n\nYes! This seems promising.\n\nLet me think about this. We can represent the expansion of each digit as a function that returns the value mod MOD and the length of the expansion. This way, when we need to expand a digit, we can recursively compute its value and length based on the current mappings.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n\nWe maintain a dictionary, say, replace_map, which for each digit d stores the string it is replaced with. Initially, replace_map[d] = d for all d.\n\nWhen processing a substitution query, we simply update replace_map[di] = ti.\n\nAfter all substitutions, we need to process the original string s. For each character in s, we expand it into its final string, and compute the value of the entire string mod MOD.\n\nBut expanding each character into its final string and building the entire string is not feasible for large strings, but since we need only the value mod MOD, we can compute it on the fly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each character in the original string, compute its contribution to the total value, considering the expansion of the character and its position.\n\nBut how to compute this contribution?\n\nLet me think of the following: we can process the original string from left to right, keeping track of the current value and the current length (number of digits) of the accumulated string. For each character in the original string, we expand it into its final string, and then append it to the accumulated string. But since we are only interested in the value mod MOD, we can compute the contribution of the expanded string to the current value.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's say we have a current value V and a current length L. When we append a new expanded string with value v and length l, the new value is (V * 10^l + v)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The key challenge is to avoid explicitly constructing potentially very large strings after each substitution, which would be computationally infeasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Maintain Replacement Maps**: Use a dictionary to keep track of the current replacement for each digit. Initially, each digit maps to itself.\n2. **Recursive Expansion with Memoization**: For each substitution query, update the replacement map. After processing all queries, expand each character in the original string using the current replacement map, while computing the value modulo $10^9 + 7$ on the fly.\n3. **Efficient Value Calculation**: As we process each character in the original string, recursively expand it using the current replacements and compute its contribution to the final value.
