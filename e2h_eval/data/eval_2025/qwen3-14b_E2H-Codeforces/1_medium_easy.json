    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells in, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but for each ring, how do we compute the number of cells?\n\nLet me think. For a single ring, like the first one, which is the border of the original rectangle. The number of cells in the border can be calculated as 2*(w + h - 2). Because for a rectangle of width w and height h, the perimeter in cells is 2*(w + h) - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait, maybe another way: the perimeter is (w * 2) + (h-2)*2? Or perhaps the formula for the number of cells in the border is 2*(w + h) - 4. Let me check with example.\n\nTake the first example input: 3 3 1. The output is 8. Let's compute 2*(3+3) -4 = 2*6 -4= 8. Which matches. So yes. So for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(current_width + current_height) - 4. But wait, the current_width and current_height for the i-th ring?\n\nWait, the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but for the first ring, i=1, so it's (w - 0) by (h - 0), which is the original rectangle. Then for the second ring, i=2, it's (w -4*(1)) by (h -4*(1)), which is 4 less in each dimension. But wait, the problem statement says that the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. So for example, if the original is 7x9, then the first ring is the outermost border. The second ring would be 2 cells in, which would be a rectangle of (7 - 4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3 in width, and 9-4=5 in height? Wait, but 7-4 is 3, but that's for the second ring. So for the second ring, the rectangle is 3x5. Then the number of cells in that ring would be 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12? Wait, but the example given in the third input is 7 9 2, which outputs 40. Let's see:\n\nThe first ring is for i=1: 7x9. The number of cells is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16-4= 32-4=28. Then the second ring is for i=2: (7-4*(2-1))=7-4=3, (9-4*(2-1))=9-4=5. So the rectangle is 3x5. The number of cells in that ring is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. So total is 28+12=40, which matches the third example. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut how to compute the perimeter for each ring?\n\nFor each ring i (from 1 to k), the current width is w_i = w - 4*(i-1), and current height is h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then the perimeter is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Wait, because 2*(w_i + h_i) -4 equals 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). So that's the same as 2*(width + height - 2). So for each ring, we calculate this value and add it to the total.\n\nBut wait, let me check with the first example. For 3x3, k=1. The perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8, which matches the first example. So that's correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, the constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3 +1)/4 ) = 1, so k can be 1. For that case, when i=1, current_w is 3-0=3, current_h is same. For i=2, it would be 3-4= -1. But since k is chosen such that the rings are possible, the problem says that k is up to that value. So the input will ensure that for all i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or maybe not. Wait, the constraints for k are given as 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think for example, if min(w, h) is 5. Then floor( (5 +1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, the current_w and current_h are w and h. For i=2, the current_w would be w-4*(2-1) = w-4. But if w is 5, then 5-4=1, but then current_w is 1, but then the rectangle would be 1x something. However, in that case, the perimeter calculation would be 2*(1 + h_i - 2) = 2*(h_i -1). But for h_i, if h was 5, then h_i is 5-4*(i-1) = 5-4=1. So for i=2, current_w and current_h are 1 and 1. Then perimeter is 2*(1 + 1 -2) = 0. Which would be correct, since a 1x1 rectangle has no perimeter. But according to the problem statement, the input is valid. But how does the k value ensure that the rings can be formed?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input k is such that 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think for example, when min(w, h) is 3. Then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, current_w and current_h are 3 and ... say h is 3. So 3x3. Then the perimeter is 8. Which is correct. Now, if min(w,h) is 5, then floor( (5+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. If k is 1, then the first ring is 5x5. But if k were allowed to be 2, then for i=2, the current_w and current_h would be 5-4*(2-1) = 1. But since k is constrained, that's not allowed. So the input ensures that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or perhaps not. Let me see: for example, if w=5, h=5, and k=1. Then the first ring is 5x5. For i=1, the current_w and current_h are 5 and 5. So perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct. But if k was allowed to be 2, then for i=2, the current_w would be 5-4*(1) = 1. But since the input is constrained, that's not possible.\n\nSo the input ensures that for all i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or perhaps not. Let me think about the formula for k. Let me take min(w, h) = m. Then k is up to floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's take m=5. Then floor( (5+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. For that, the first ring is m=5, so for i=1, current_w and current_h are 5. For i=2, the current_w would be 5-4*(2-1) = 1. But since k is 1, that's not considered. So the input ensures that for each ring i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Let me check for m=7. Then floor( (7+1)/4 ) = 2. So k can be 2. For i=2, current_w is 7-4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. Which is okay. So for i=2, the current_w is 3. So the rectangle is 3x (h-4*(i-1)). So in that case, if h is 7, then 3x3. So perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Which is correct. So the formula for k is ensuring that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3. Because for i-th ring, the current_w is w - 4*(i-1), and similarly for h. Since the minimum of w and h is m, and k is up to floor( (m+1)/4 ), then for i up to k, 4*(i-1) <= 4*(k-1) <= 4*( (floor( (m+1)/4 )) -1 ). Let me see for m=7, floor( (7+1)/4 ) is 2. So k can be 2. Then 4*(i-1) for i=2 is 4*(1) =4. m -4*(i-1) is 7-4=3. Which is okay. For m=6, floor( (6+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. So for i=1, 4*(i-1)=0, so current_w is 6, which is okay. For m=3, floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k=1. So current_w is 3, which is okay.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely with the formula.\n\nThus, the approach is to loop over each ring from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter for that ring, and sum them all.\n\nNow, the code. Let's see.\n\nRead input: three integers w, h, k.\n\nCompute total = 0\n\nfor i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nreturn total.\n\nBut wait, let me test the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w =3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input:7 9 1. So current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. First ring is 7,9: 28. Second ring: i=2, current_w=7-4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be 16.\n\nAnother example: w=7, h=7, k=2. First ring: 7x7. perimeter is 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2)= 8. total 24+8=32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead input line as three integers. Then compute the sum.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead input line, split into w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the constraints, the input is such that k is valid. So for example, the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for i up to k, the current_w and current_h are >= 3? Let me think for i= k.\n\nLet m = min(w, h). Let's assume that m is the minimum. Then the maximum possible k is floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let me check for i=k, the current_w and current_h would be m - 4*(k-1). Let me see for k= floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's take m=7, then (7+1)/4=2. So k=2. Then for i=2, 4*(2-1) =4. 7-4=3 >=3. For m=6, (6+1)/4=1.75, floor is 1. So k=1. For i=1, 6-0=6. For m=4, (4+1)/4=1.25, floor is 1. So k=1. For i=1, 4-0=4. For m=3, (3+1)/4=1, so k=1. For i=1, 3-0=3. So yes, for all cases, the current_w and current_h are at least 3. So the code is safe.\n\nSo that's the code. Let's test with the examples.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line. For example, in Python, the input could be read via input().split().\n\nBut the input is given as a list of inputs, but in the problem statement, the input is given as a single line. For example, the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps in the actual problem, the input is one line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is given as three integers on a single line. The sample input shows three lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single line with three integers. So the code should read one line, split into three integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the total.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting with the examples:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's take w=5, h=5, k=1. Output is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is 16.\n\nAnother case: w=7, h=7, k=2 → 24 + 8 = 32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be correct.\n",
