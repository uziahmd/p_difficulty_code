    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but how do I compute the number of cells in each ring?\n\nLet me think. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for the perimeter in terms of cells: for a rectangle with width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (H-2) each. So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for example, when i=1, it's the original rectangle. Then for i=2, it's a rectangle that's 4 units smaller in each dimension (since 4*(i-1) = 4*1=4). Wait, but how does that work? Because for the second ring, it's two cells away from the edge. So the original plate is w x h. The first ring is the outermost layer. Then the second ring is two cells in, which would mean that the rectangle for the second ring is (w - 2*2) × (h - 2*2) ? Wait, but the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w × h. For i=2, it's (w-4) × (h-4). So each ring is 4 units smaller in each dimension than the previous. But why?\n\nBecause each ring takes away two cells from each side. For example, the first ring is the outermost, so the next ring would be 2 cells inward. So for the width, the original is w. After removing two cells from both left and right, the width becomes w - 4 (since 2 cells from each side). Similarly for height. So for each ring, the dimensions decrease by 4 each time. So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\nBut then, for each of these rings, we need to calculate their perimeters. However, we need to make sure that the dimensions are valid. For example, if the current dimensions after subtracting 4*(i-1) from w and h are less than or equal to zero, then that ring can't exist. However, according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So that ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are at least 3? Or maybe not. Wait, let's think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3 +1)/4 ) is 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, the dimensions are w-0 and h-0, which is 3 and something. So that's okay. For i=2, 3-4*(2-1) = 3-4 = -1. Which is invalid. But since k is constrained, the input will ensure that for all i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but how do we calculate that? Let's take the example given.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, the dimensions are 3x3. The perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So the perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 -2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output. Third example: 7 9 2. So for i=1, the perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 28. For i=2, the dimensions are 7 -4*(2-1) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1) = 5. So the perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. Sum 28+12=40. Which matches the third example.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each ring from 1 to k:\n\n   - compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   - add to total.\n\nSo the code needs to loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter and sum them.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nRead input: w, h, k. The input is three integers on one line.\n\nThen, initialize total = 0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h is less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. So for example, the input constraints say that k is <= floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me see.\n\nLet me check for min(w, h) = m. So for i=1, the current_w and current_h are w and h. For i=k, the current_w is w -4*(k-1), current_h is h -4*(k-1). Since k is at most floor( (m +1)/4 ), then for example, if m is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So for k=1, the current_w and current_h are 3 and ... whatever. For i=1, it's okay.\n\nIf m is 7, then floor( (7+1)/4 ) = 2. So k can be 2. For i=2, 7-4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. Which is valid. For m=7, and k=2, that's okay.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then for i=1: 5x5 → perimeter is 2*(5+5-2)= 16. For i=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. The perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 2*0=0? Wait, that's a problem. But according to the input constraints, k is floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For min(w,h) =5, (5+1)/4= 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code would not be given such an input. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother example: w=7, h=7, k=2. Then for i=2, current_w =7-4=3, current_h=7-4=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. So total would be 2*(7+7-2) + 8 → 2*12=24 +8=32. So for input 7 7 2, output is 32.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead input line as w, h, k. Split into integers.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h is less than 1? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is valid. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst input: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSecond input: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird input: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3 + 5 -2) = 28 + 2*(6) = 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
