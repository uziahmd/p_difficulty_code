Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. Hmm. So the problem is essentially checking if there's a bipartite matching where the edges don't cross each other. \n\nFirst, the input gives me R spaceships and B bases. The first thing to note is that for a perfect matching to exist, the number of spaceships and bases must be equal. Wait, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so yes, R must equal B. Oh wait, looking at the input description: the first line has R and B. Wait, the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So for that to be possible, R must equal B. But in the input, maybe the code needs to check if R != B, then immediately output No. Oh right! Because if R and B are not equal, there's no way to have a perfect matching. So that's the first check. For example, in the sample input, the first case is 3 3, which is okay. The second example is 2 1, so output is No. So that's an initial check.\n\nSo step one: if R != B, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, assuming R = B. Then we need to find a perfect matching between the two sets (spaceships and bases) such that no two edges cross each other.\n\nThe challenge is to check whether such a matching exists. How can I model this?\n\nThe problem is similar to finding a non-crossing matching between two sets of points. How to approach this?\n\nOne idea is to model this as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if they don't cross any other edges. But since the matching is perfect, it's not straightforward. However, perhaps there's a way to arrange the points in a certain order and then find a matching that's compatible with that order.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the problem as a bipartite graph where edges are between ships and bases, but with the constraint that the edges in the matching do not cross. How can we check for such a matching?\n\nLet me think about the geometry. Two line segments (from ship A to base X and ship B to base Y) cross if the points are arranged in such a way that the lines intersect. How to check if two line segments cross? Well, the problem states that no three points are colinear, so any two line segments between different pairs will either cross or not. So for any two pairs (s1, b1) and (s2, b2), we need to check if the line segments s1-b1 and s2-b2 cross.\n\nBut how do I find a matching where all pairs are non-crossing?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming or backtracking, but given that R and B are up to 10, maybe a backtracking approach is feasible.\n\nWait, for R=10, the number of possible perfect matchings is 10! = 3.6 million. Which is manageable for a brute-force approach. But even better, perhaps for each possible permutation of bases, assign each ship to a base in the order of the permutation, and check if all the edges are non-crossing.\n\nWait, but how to generate all possible matchings? For example, if there are R ships and R bases, then the number of possible matchings is R! (since each is a permutation). For R=10, that's 3.6 million, which is acceptable for a brute-force approach. So for each permutation of the bases, we can check if the matching (ship i to base permutation[i]) has no crossing edges.\n\nBut how to check if any two edges cross?\n\nSo the plan would be:\n\n1. Check if R != B. If so, output No.\n\n2. Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible matching between ships and bases).\n\n3. For each permutation, check if all pairs of edges in the matching are non-crossing.\n\n4. If any permutation passes, output Yes. Otherwise, output No.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows any perfect matching, not just those that are permutations. However, in the case where the ships and bases are matched in a permutation, that's exactly all possible perfect matchings. Because for each ship, you assign a unique base. So yes, generating all permutations of the bases and checking each for crossings would cover all possibilities.\n\nBut how to check for crossings in a given permutation?\n\nFor each pair of edges (i,j) and (k,l) in the permutation, check if the line segments between ship i and base j, and ship k and base l cross.\n\nBut in the permutation, the matching is ship 1 to base perm[0], ship 2 to base perm[1], etc. So for each pair of edges in the matching, we need to check if their line segments cross.\n\nBut for a permutation, how many pairs of edges are there? For R=10, that's 10 choose 2 = 45 pairs. For each permutation, checking all pairs. For 3.6 million permutations, that's 3.6e6 * 45 = 162 million checks. Each check is a line segment intersection. But for small numbers, this is feasible.\n\nSo the key is to implement a function that checks whether two line segments cross.\n\nHow to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect?\n\nWell, there's a standard computational geometry approach. The steps are:\n\n- Check if the two segments AB and CD intersect. Since no three points are colinear, the segments can't have overlapping endpoints, but they can cross each other.\n\nThe standard method is to use the orientation method. The steps are:\n\n1. Check if the segments AB and CD intersect by checking if the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different. That's the general case.\n\nAlternatively, using the cross product to compute orientation.\n\nBut perhaps, since all points are distinct and no three are colinear, we can use the following approach:\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n- The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nBut also, we need to handle the case when one of the segments is an endpoint of the other. However, the problem says that no two points coincide, so AB and CD can't share endpoints. Because each ship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one ship. So in the matching, each line segment is between a unique ship and base. Thus, the segments cannot share endpoints. Therefore, the segments can't be overlapping in that way. So the standard line segment intersection check can be used.\n\nSo, for two segments AB and CD, they cross if the orientation of (A,B,C) is different from orientation of (A,B,D), and orientation of (C,D,A) is different from orientation of (C,D,B).\n\nSo, the code for checking if two segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    ccw1 = ccw(A,B,C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A,B,D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C,D,A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C,D,B)\n    # If the points are on opposite sides\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nWait, but this returns true only if the segments cross each other. However, there's also the case where one of the segments is collinear with the other. But the problem states that no three points are colinear, so that's not possible. So this code should work.\n\nBut wait, in our problem, the segments are between a ship and a base. Since all points are unique and no three are colinear, the line segments can't be colinear. So the above function should correctly detect whether two segments cross.\n\nSo, for a given permutation, we need to check all pairs of edges in the matching. For example, if the permutation is [b1, b2, b3], then the edges are (s1, b1), (s2, b2), (s3, b3). We need to check all pairs of these edges. For each pair (s_i, b_i) and (s_j, b_j), where i < j, check if their segments cross. If any pair does, then this permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we generate all pairs of edges and check for intersections. If none are found, then it's a valid matching, and we can return \"Yes\".\n\nNow, considering that R and B are up to 10, this approach is feasible. Let's see:\n\nFor R=10, the permutations are 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking (10*9)/2 = 45 pairs. Each pair requires checking the segments. So total operations are around 3.6e6 * 45 = 1.6e8 operations. Which may be acceptable for Python, but perhaps tight. However, given that the constraints are small, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there are optimizations. For example, once a permutation is found that works, we can return early. So in practice, for some cases, the code may not need to check all permutations.\n\nNow, the next step is to generate all permutations of the bases. But how are the bases stored?\n\nThe input for the problem is:\n\nThe first line has R and B. Then R lines of coordinates for the spaceships. Then B lines of coordinates for the bases.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, the ships are:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nThen the bases are:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the code needs to read R and B, then read R points for ships, then B points for bases.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output No.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R ships' coordinates as a list.\n\nRead B bases' coordinates as a list.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible matching between ships and bases).\n\nFor each permutation, check if all pairs of edges in the matching are non-crossing.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nNow, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used to generate all possible permutations of the bases.\n\nBut for the code, we need to generate all permutations of the bases list. For example, if the bases are stored in a list called bases, then permutations(bases) would generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut for each permutation, the code would check for all pairs of edges.\n\nNow, the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n\n    # Read input\n\n    # parse input into R, B, ships, bases\n\n    if R != B:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        return\n\n    # else:\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n\n        if is_valid(perm, ships):\n\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut how to implement is_valid?\n\ndef is_valid(perm, ships):\n\n    # perm is a list of base points, same length as ships.\n\n    # For each pair of indices i and j, check if the segment between ships[i] and perm[i] crosses the segment between ships[j] and perm[j]\n\n    n = len(ships)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n\n            # check if the segments (ships[i], perm[i]) and (ships[j], perm[j]) cross\n\n            if segments_intersect(ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]):\n\n                return False\n\n    return True\n\nBut then, the segments_intersect function needs to be implemented.\n\nNow, implementing the ccw and segments_intersect functions.\n\nBut wait, the function segments_intersect as discussed earlier. Let me code that.\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n\n    # returns the cross product of AB and AC vectors\n\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    # A and B are endpoints of segment 1, C and D endpoints of segment 2.\n\n    # Check if the segments AB and CD intersect.\n\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n\n    # If the points are on opposite sides of AB and CD, then they cross.\n\n    # So if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0), then they cross.\n\n    # But also, if one of the segments is a point, but the problem states that no two points are same, so that's not possible.\n\n    # So return True if both products are negative.\n\n    # But wait, what if one of the segments is colinear? But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So that's not possible.\n\n    # So the code is:\n\n    return (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0)\n\nWait, but for example, if AB and CD cross, then the ccw1 and ccw2 would be of opposite signs, and same for the other pair. So the code returns True.\n\nBut what if one of the segments is entirely inside the other? Like, for example, if AB is a long segment, and CD is a segment that starts and ends on AB. But since no three points are colinear, this can't happen. Because if C is on AB, then that would make three points colinear. So the problem statement ensures that this is not possible. Hence, the segments can't be overlapping in that way. Therefore, the code for segments_intersect is correct.\n\nSo, with that, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nShips are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nBases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nOne possible permutation is the same order as the input. So perm is [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nCheck all pairs:\n\nBetween ship 0 (0,0) and base (-2,1), and ship 1 (2,0) and base (0,3).\n\nCheck if these two segments cross.\n\nLet me compute the cross products.\n\nFor AB: A=(0,0), B=(-2,1). Wait, no, for the first segment, it's A=ship[0], B=perm[0]. So the first segment is (0,0) to (-2,1). The second segment is (2,0) to (0,3). Let's compute the cross products.\n\nFor segment AB (from (0,0) to (-2,1)), and segment CD (from (2,0) to (0,3)).\n\nCheck if AB and CD cross.\n\nCompute ccw(A,B,C) where C is (2,0). Wait, the code for segments_intersect is:\n\nsegments_intersect(A, B, C, D) ?\n\nWait, in the code, the parameters are A, B, C, D. So the first segment is A to B, the second is C to D.\n\nSo in this case, the first segment is A=(0,0), B=(-2,1), and the second segment is C=(2,0), D=(0,3).\n\nSo compute:\n\nccw1 = ccw(A,B,C) = ccw( (0,0), (-2,1), (2,0) )\n\nWhich is:\n\n(B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x is -2 - 0 = -2.\n\nC.y - A.y is 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nSo first term is -2 * 0 = 0.\n\nB.y - A.y is 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nC.x - A.x is 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nSo subtract 1 * 2 = 2. So overall 0 - 2 = -2.\n\nccw1 is -2.\n\nccw2 is ccw(A,B,D) where D is (0,3).\n\nSo same A and B.\n\nC is (0,3). So:\n\n(B.x - A.x) is -2.\n\n(C.y - A.y) is 3 - 0 = 3.\n\nMultiply: -2 * 3 = -6.\n\n(B.y - A.y) is 1.\n\n(C.x - A.x) is 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nSo subtract 1 * 0 = 0. So overall -6 - 0 = -6.\n\nSo ccw1 is -2, ccw2 is -6. Their product is positive. So (ccw1 * ccw2) is positive. So the first condition (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) is false. Therefore, the segments do not cross. So this pair is okay.\n\nThen check for other pairs. For example, ship 0 and base 0, ship 2 and base 2. Let me see. But perhaps the code would find that the sample input's first case is valid.\n\nBut according to the note, the first example is possible, so the code would find at least one permutation that works.\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nBut in Python, the permutations are generated as tuples of the bases. So for the code, the ships and bases are stored as lists of tuples.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input correctly.\n\nBut the input is given as a single string. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin. Wait, the problem says that the code should read input from standard input. So in the code, we need to read lines from stdin.\n\nBut the input format is:\n\nThe first line contains R and B.\n\nThen R lines of x and y for the ships.\n\nThen B lines of x and y for the bases.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead R and B from input.\n\nThen read R lines for the ships.\n\nThen read B lines for the bases.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n\n    input_lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    R, B = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n\n    ptr += 1\n\n    ships = []\n\n    for _ in range(R):\n\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n    bases = []\n\n    for _ in range(B):\n\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n    if R != B:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        return\n\n    # Now generate permutations of bases and check\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(R):\n\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n                # check if the segments between ships[i] and perm[i], ships[j] and perm[j] cross\n\n                A = ships[i]\n\n                B = perm[i]\n\n                C = ships[j]\n\n                D = perm[j]\n\n                # check if AB and CD cross\n\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n                    valid = False\n\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if valid:\n\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, the code for checking segments_intersect is as follows. So the functions need to be defined.\n\nBut the code for the functions:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    # A and B are endpoints of segment 1, C and D endpoints of segment 2.\n\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n\n    return (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0)\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the segments_intersect function, the code returns True if both products are negative. So that's the correct condition.\n\nBut what about when the segments are overlapping? Well, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So the segments can't be overlapping except at endpoints, but since the endpoints are unique, the segments can't share endpoints. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe code would generate permutations of the bases. Let's take the permutation as the same order as the input. So the bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nCheck for all pairs:\n\ni=0, j=1:\n\nA = (0,0), B = (-2,1)\n\nC = (2,0), D = (0,3)\n\nsegments_intersect returns False, as per earlier calculation.\n\ni=0, j=2:\n\nA = (0,0) to B = (-2,1)\n\nC = (3,1) to D = (2,2)\n\nCheck if these cross.\n\nCompute ccw(A,B,C) = ( (-2-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(3-0) ) ?\n\nWait, A is (0,0), B is (-2,1), C is (3,1).\n\nccw(A,B,C) is (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x = -2 - 0 = -2.\n\nC.y - A.y = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nMultiply: -2 * 1 = -2.\n\nB.y - A.y = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nC.x - A.x = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\nMultiply: 1 * 3 = 3.\n\nSo overall, -2 - 3 = -5.\n\nccw1 = -5.\n\nccw2 is ccw(A,B,D), where D is (2,2).\n\nC is D here. So:\n\nB.x - A.x = -2.\n\nD.y - A.y = 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nMultiply: -2 * 2 = -4.\n\nB.y - A.y = 1.\n\nD.x - A.x = 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nMultiply: 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nSo overall, -4 - 2 = -6.\n\nccw1 * ccw2 is (-5) * (-6) = 30 > 0. So the first part is not satisfied. So segments do not cross.\n\nThen for i=0 and j=2, returns false.\n\nThen for i=1 and j=2:\n\nA is ships[1] = (2,0) connected to perm[1] = (0,3).\n\nC is ships[2] = (3,1) connected to perm[2] = (2,2).\n\nCheck if these two segments cross.\n\nSo AB is (2,0)-(0,3), CD is (3,1)-(2,2).\n\nCompute ccw1 = ccw(A,B,C) where A is (2,0), B is (0,3), C is (3,1).\n\nccw(A,B,C) = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) ?\n\nWait:\n\nB.x - A.x = 0-2 = -2.\n\nC.y - A.y = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nMultiply: -2 * 1 = -2.\n\nB.y - A.y = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\nC.x - A.x = 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nMultiply: 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nSo ccw1 = -2 - 3 = -5.\n\nccw2 is ccw(A,B,D) where D is (2,2).\n\nC is D here.\n\nSo:\n\nB.x - A.x = -2.\n\nD.y - A.y = 2 - 0 = 2. Multiply: -2 * 2 = -4.\n\nB.y - A.y = 3.\n\nD.x - A.x = 2 - 2 = 0. Multiply: 3 * 0 = 0.\n\nSo overall, -4 - 0 = -4.\n\nccw1 * ccw2 = (-5)*(-4) = 20>0. So first condition not met. So segments do not cross.\n\nThus, all pairs are non-crossing. So this permutation is valid, and the code would return Yes.\n\nIn the second sample input, R=2, B=1. So R != B, output is No.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, what about when R=B but no permutation is valid? For example, when two ships and two bases are arranged in a way that any matching has crossing lines.\n\nFor example:\n\nShips at (0,0) and (2,2). Bases at (0,2) and (2,0). Any permutation would have either (0,0) connected to (0,2) and (2,2) connected to (2,0), which are two lines that cross. Or (0,0) connected to (2,0) and (2,2) connected to (0,2). These two lines cross as well. So the answer is No.\n\nSo the code would generate permutations, check each, and find none valid, thus output No.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. However, in Python, permutations of a list with B elements (say 10 elements) can be expensive. But for B up to 10, it's manageable.\n\nBut what about when R=0 and B=0? According to the constraints, R and B are at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: R=1 and B=1. Then there's only one possible permutation. Check if the line between the ship and base doesn't cross with any others (there are none). So output Yes.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Ships are (0,0), (0,1). Bases are (1,0), (1,1). The possible permutations are:\n\nPerm1: [(1,0), (1,1)] → connect (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1). These lines are parallel, no crossing. So valid.\n\nThus, output Yes.\n\nAnother case: ships (0,0) and (1,1), bases (1,0) and (0,1). Any permutation would have:\n\nOption 1: (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These lines cross. So invalid.\n\nOption 2: (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0). These lines are vertical and horizontal, no crossing. So valid. So the code would find this permutation and return Yes.\n\nSo the code would generate permutations and find that this is valid.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code-wise, the functions need to be properly included. Also, in Python, the permutations function returns tuples of the elements. So for the bases list, which is a list of tuples, the permutations would generate tuples of those tuples.\n\nNow, code:\n\nPutting all together.\n\nBut need to import permutations.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    return (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0)\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    ptr = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n    ptr += 1\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n        ptr += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        ptr += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    # Generate all permutations of bases\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                A = ships[i]\n                B = perm[i]\n                C = ships[j]\n                D = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the code, the permutations are generated for the bases list. However, if there are duplicate points in the bases? But the problem says that no two points coincide. So the bases are all unique. So permutations are okay.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe code would read R=3, B=3, ships as [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)], bases as [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nThen generate permutations. One of them is the original order, which is valid. So output is Yes.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. Since R != B, output is No.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother test case where R=B=2, and the two possible permutations are both invalid. For example, ships at (0,0), (2,2), bases at (0,2), (2,0). Then any permutation would have crossing lines.\n\nPermutation 1: bases [ (0,2), (2,0) ] → ship 0 connects to (0,2), ship 1 to (2,0). The lines are (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These are vertical lines, no crossing. Wait, no, they are parallel. So they don't cross. So this is valid. So output is Yes.\n\nWait, but in this case, the code would find that the lines do not cross, so output Yes. So in that case, the code would output Yes.\n\nBut if the ships are (0,0), (1,1), and the bases are (1,0), (0,1). Then the permutation [ (1,0), (0,1) ] would have the lines (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These are two lines that cross. But another permutation is [ (0,1), (1,0) ] → lines (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0). These are vertical lines, no crossing. So the code would find this permutation and output Yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base, with the additional constraint that no two connecting paths intersect in the galaxy plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, we check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, it's impossible to have a perfect matching, so we immediately output \"No\".\n2. **Generate Permutations**: If R equals B, we generate all permutations of the bases. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of spaceships to bases.\n3. **Check for Non-Crossing Paths**: For each permutation, we check if all connecting paths (from spaceships to their assigned bases) do not intersect. This is done using computational geometry to determine if line segments intersect.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    return (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0)\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    ptr = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n    ptr += 1\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                A = ships[i]\n                B_point = perm[i]\n                C = ships[j]\n                D_point = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B_point, C, D_point):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into lists of coordinates for spaceships and bases.\n2. **Immediate Check**: If the number of spaceships and bases are not equal, we immediately print \"No\".\n3. **Permutations Check**: We generate all permutations of the bases to explore all possible assignments of spaceships to bases.\n4. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, we check if any two connecting paths intersect using the cross product method to determine the orientation of points, which helps in detecting line segment intersections efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible assignments and verify the non-crossing condition using computational geometry principles, making the solution both correct and efficient given the problem constraints.",
