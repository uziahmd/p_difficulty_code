In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The input is three tiles. We have to determine the minimum number of tiles to add so that there's at least one mentsu in the hand. The output is the minimal number of draws required.\n\nSo for each case, we need to check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut how do we check for possible mentsu after adding some tiles?\n\nLet me think about the possibilities. For example, if the three tiles can form a triplet, then no need to add anything. Or if they can form a sequence. But if not, then we need to add tiles.\n\nBut since the initial hand is three tiles, maybe adding one or two tiles can help form a mentsu.\n\nLet me think about all possibilities.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then check what's the minimal number of tiles needed to add to get a mentsu.\n\nLet's break it down into cases.\n\nCase 1: Check if the current three tiles can form a triplet. For that, all three must be same. So if the three are same, then answer is 0. Otherwise, not.\n\nCase 2: Check if the three tiles can form a sequence. For that, they must be same suit, and numbers consecutive. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But the order doesn't matter. So we need to check if the three numbers are consecutive and same suit.\n\nIf either of these cases is true, then answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the hand (original + added) contains a mentsu.\n\nSo, the possible scenarios are:\n\nAfter adding 0 tiles: already have mentsu. (already checked)\n\nAfter adding 1 tile: check if there's a mentsu in the 4 tiles.\n\nAfter adding 2 tiles: check if there's a mentsu in the 5 tiles.\n\nBut since the question asks for the minimal, we need to check for the minimal possible steps.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCheck if current hand has mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if adding 1 tile can make a mentsu. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, check if adding 2 tiles can make a mentsu. Return 2.\n\nWait, but what about adding more than 2? Well, the minimal possible is 0,1,2, or maybe even higher? But according to the problem statement, the answer is the minimal.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible answer? Let's think.\n\nFor example, if the original three tiles are such that no way to form a mentsu even with adding two tiles. Then, the answer would be 2?\n\nWait, but perhaps adding two tiles can allow forming a triplet. Let's see.\n\nFor example, suppose the original three tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Then, adding two tiles of 1m and 1p would form a triplet of 1m, 1m, 1m? No. Wait, original tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. If you add two 1m tiles, then you have three 1m. So that's a triplet. So the answer would be 2. So that's possible.\n\nBut what if the original three tiles are all different suits and numbers. For example, 1m, 2p, 3s. How can you form a mentsu? You need to add tiles. Let's think:\n\nTo form a triplet, you need three of same tile. So you need to add two of any tile. For example, adding two 1m's. Then you have three 1m's. So that's a triplet. So answer is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can form a sequence. But the original three are all different suits. So to form a sequence, you need to have three same suit. So for example, if you add two tiles of same suit as one of the existing ones. Let's say, for example, the original is 1m, 2p, 3s. Suppose you add 2m and 3m. Then you have 1m, 2m, 3m. That's a sequence. So you need to add two tiles. So answer is 2. So in this case, the minimal is 2.\n\nSo for any case, the answer can be 0, 1, 2, or maybe even higher? Wait, but what's the maximum possible?\n\nWait, suppose the original three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, adding one tile of 3m would make a sequence. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: original tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. To form a triplet, you need to add two tiles of same. So adding two 1m's. So answer is 2.\n\nBut what if the original three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, to form a sequence, you can add 3m. So answer is 1.\n\nSo, in general, the answer is 0, 1, or 2. Because even if the initial three tiles can't form any mentsu, adding two tiles is sufficient to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nWait, but is there a scenario where even adding two tiles is not enough? Let's think.\n\nSuppose the original three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Adding one tile (3m) gives 1m,2m,3m,4m. Then, there's a sequence (1,2,3) or (2,3,4). So that's possible. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: original three tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Adding one tile of 2m and 4m would give a sequence. But that requires adding two tiles. So if you add 2m and 4m, then you can have sequences like 1,2,3 (but you have 1,3,2?), but wait, you have 1,3,5, plus 2 and 4. So you can form 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5. So yes, adding two tiles. So answer is 2.\n\nBut if you can't form a triplet or sequence with adding two tiles, then what?\n\nBut I think that's impossible. Because, for example, if you have three tiles of different suits and numbers. Then, adding two tiles can form a triplet. For example, if you have tiles A, B, C. Add two copies of A. Now you have three A's. So that's a triplet. So answer is 2.\n\nThus, the answer can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking:\n\nIf current hand has mentsu → 0.\n\nElse, check if adding one tile can make a mentsu. If yes → 1.\n\nElse, answer is 2.\n\nSo the problem becomes, how to check for each possible case.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model all possible ways to form a mentsu after adding 0, 1, or 2 tiles.\n\nBut how to check for all possibilities?\n\nLet's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, process the input. For example, the input is three tiles. Let's represent them as a list of three elements. Each element is a string like '1s', etc.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles form a mentsu. How?\n\nCheck for triplet: all three are same.\n\nCheck for sequence: same suit, numbers are consecutive.\n\nIf either is true, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNext, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu. How?\n\nWe need to consider all possible tiles that can be added (each possible tile in the game), and for each possibility, check if the new set (original three + this tile) contains a mentsu.\n\nBut considering all possible tiles would be computationally feasible, since there are only 9*3=27 possible types of tiles. So for each possible tile, we can check if adding it would create a mentsu.\n\nBut since the problem allows adding any tile, including duplicates, we need to check for all possibilities.\n\nBut since the answer is 0, 1, or 2, and if adding one tile can create a mentsu, then the answer is 1. Otherwise, answer is 2.\n\nSo for the step of checking whether adding one tile can help, we can generate all possible tiles (including those already present), add each to the original three, and check if any of those combinations has a mentsu.\n\nBut how to check if a combination of four tiles (original three plus one) has a mentsu.\n\nBut when there are four tiles, how can they form a mentsu? Well, the mentsu can be formed by any subset of three tiles in the four.\n\nSo, for example, adding a tile that allows a triplet (like two existing tiles plus the new one), or a sequence.\n\nSo, for the four tiles, we need to check all possible combinations of three tiles to see if any of them form a mentsu.\n\nBut for the four tiles, the number of possible triplets is 4 choose 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for each possible tile added, we can check all 4 triplets to see if any of them form a mentsu.\n\nIf any of those checks returns true, then adding that tile would suffice. So the answer is 1.\n\nIf none of the possible added tiles can make a mentsu, then the answer is 2.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nNow, the problem is how to generate all possible tiles to add. But since the answer is 1, we can check for each possible tile, and see if adding it allows any triplet or sequence.\n\nBut generating all possible tiles is manageable.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, for the current three tiles, think about what possibilities can be achieved by adding one tile.\n\nFor example, for triplet:\n\nIf two of the current tiles are same, then adding another same tile would form a triplet. So for example, if the original has two 1m, adding one 1m gives a triplet.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences: the current three tiles may be missing one tile to form a sequence. For example, if the current three are 1m, 2m, 4m. Adding 3m would allow a sequence of 1,2,3. Or 2,3,4.\n\nSo, for the current three tiles, perhaps we can check if there's a way to form a sequence by adding one tile.\n\nBut how?\n\nSo, for the case of sequences:\n\nWe need to check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit, where the current three tiles have two of them, and adding the third.\n\nBut since the original three tiles may have different suits, but maybe two of them are in the same suit and can form part of a sequence.\n\nSo, for example, original tiles are 1m, 2m, 3p. Then, adding a 3m would allow a sequence of 1m, 2m, 3m. Or adding a 1p would allow a sequence of 1p, 2p, 3p (but the original has 3p, but not 1p or 2p. So adding 1p and 2p would be needed, but that would require adding two tiles. So that's not possible with adding one tile.\n\nSo, for the case of sequences, we need to check for each possible suit, and see if the three tiles have two in that suit, and whether adding one more can complete a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible suit, collect all the numbers in that suit in the original three tiles, then see if adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nBut perhaps for the current three tiles, the best approach is to generate all possibilities of adding one tile, and for each such case, check if there's a triplet or sequence in the four tiles.\n\nBut given that the number of possible tiles to add is 27, and for each case, checking four triplets (each of which is three tiles), this seems manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the current three tiles:\n\nCheck if any of the following is true:\n\n- There exists a triplet in the three tiles.\n\n- There exists a sequence in the three tiles.\n\nIf yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for all possible tiles that can be added (each of the 27 possible types), and for each, check if in the four tiles (original + added), there exists a triplet or sequence.\n\nIf any of these possibilities is true, return 1.\n\nElse, return 2.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead three tiles.\n\nCheck if current has mentsu → 0.\n\nElse, check for each possible tile to add (all 27 possibilities):\n\n   create a list of four tiles (original + added tile)\n\n   check if any triplet or sequence exists in this list.\n\n   if yes → return 1.\n\nIf none of the added tiles leads to a mentsu, then return 2.\n\nBut how to implement the check for triplet or sequence in a list of four tiles?\n\nFor example, for a list of four tiles, check all possible triplets (combinations of 3 tiles) to see if any of them forms a triplet or sequence.\n\nBut for each triplet, how to check?\n\nFor triplet: all three tiles have same suit and same number.\n\nFor sequence: same suit, and numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for each triplet in the four tiles:\n\nCheck if all three are same → triplet.\n\nElse, check if same suit and numbers are consecutive → sequence.\n\nIf any of these is true, then return True.\n\nSo, the code for checking a list of tiles (say, a list of n tiles) whether it contains a mentsu would be:\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check all possible triplets in tiles\n\n    for i in range(len(tiles)):\n\n        for j in range(i+1, len(tiles)):\n\n            for k in range(j+1, len(tiles)):\n\n                triplet = [tiles[i], tiles[j], tiles[k]]\n\n                if is_triplet(triplet) or is_sequence(triplet):\n\n                    return True\n\n    return False\n\nBut for the case of four tiles, this would check all 4C3 = 4 triplets.\n\nSo, for the code, this function is needed.\n\nNow, how to implement is_triplet and is_sequence.\n\nFor is_triplet:\n\nCheck if all three tiles are same. For example, '1m', '1m', '1m'.\n\nSo, for the triplet, check if all three have the same number and suit.\n\nFor is_sequence:\n\nCheck if all three have same suit, and their numbers are consecutive.\n\nBut the numbers must be in order. However, since the order of the tiles in the triplet is not important, we can sort the numbers and check if they are consecutive.\n\nFor example, triplet ['2m', '1m', '3m'] → sorted numbers are 1,2,3 → consecutive.\n\nSo, for the triplet:\n\nCheck that all three have same suit.\n\nThen, extract the numbers, sort them, check if the max - min is 2 and there are no duplicates.\n\nWait, for example, 1, 2, 3: max - min is 2. Also, the numbers are unique.\n\nBut if the numbers are 1, 1, 2 → max - min is 1, but not consecutive.\n\nSo, the condition for a sequence is:\n\nsame suit, and the sorted numbers are consecutive (i.e., numbers are x, x+1, x+2).\n\nSo, for a triplet of tiles:\n\nsuit = first tile's suit.\n\nfor all three tiles, check if their suit matches suit.\n\nthen, collect the numbers as integers, sort them. check if they are consecutive.\n\nSo, code for is_sequence:\n\ndef is_sequence(triplet):\n\n    # check if all same suit\n\n    suit = triplet[0][1]\n\n    for t in triplet:\n\n        if t[1] != suit:\n\n            return False\n\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in triplet])\n\n    return nums[2] - nums[0] == 2 and len(set(nums)) == 3\n\nWait, but len(set(nums)) == 3 ensures that there are no duplicates. Because, for example, if two numbers are same, then sorted nums would have 1,1,2. Then, nums[2] - nums[0] is 1, which is not equal to 2. But even if that's the case, the code would return false.\n\nBut for the case of 1,2,2, the difference is 1, which is not 2. So the code returns False.\n\nSo, the code for is_sequence is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for is_triplet:\n\ndef is_triplet(triplet):\n\n    return all(t[0] == triplet[0][0] and t[1] == triplet[0][1] for t in triplet)\n\nBut wait, triplet is a list of three tiles. For example, triplet is [tile1, tile2, tile3]. So, the code checks if all tiles have same number (t[0]) and same suit (t[1]) as the first tile.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, with these helper functions, we can check if any triplet in a list of tiles forms a mentsu.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead three tiles as input.\n\nCheck if the current three tiles have a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, check for each possible tile to add (all 27 possible types). For each added tile, check if the new list of four tiles has a mentsu. If any of them does, output 1.\n\nElse, output 2.\n\nBut how to generate all possible tiles to add?\n\nWell, the possible tiles are all combinations of numbers from 1-9 and suits m, p, s.\n\nSo, for each number in 1-9, and each suit in ['m', 'p', 's'], generate a string like '1m', '2m', etc.\n\nSo, in code, generate all possible tiles as:\n\npossible_tiles = [f\"{n}{s}\" for n in range(1, 10) for s in ['m', 'p', 's']]\n\nThen, for each tile in possible_tiles, create a list of original_tiles + [tile], and check if that list has a mentsu.\n\nBut since the original_tiles is three elements, adding one tile makes four elements. Then, check all combinations of three elements in that four-element list.\n\nBut in code, for each added tile, the code would check if any triplet in the four tiles is a mentsu.\n\nNow, the problem is that for the code, the original three tiles may have duplicates. For example, if the original three tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m], adding another 1m would make four tiles, which includes a triplet (three 1m's). So the code would detect that.\n\nSo, the code for the check after adding one tile would work.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nBut let's think about possible optimizations. For example, in the case of adding a tile, perhaps we can avoid checking all 27 possibilities. But given that 27 is a small number, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nFirst case: 1s, 2s, 3s → already a sequence. So 0.\n\nSecond case: three 9m → triplet. So 0.\n\nThird case: 3p, 9m, 2p. Adding 1p gives 3p, 2p, 1p. So the triplet is 1p, 2p, 3p. So the code would check adding 1p. Then, in the four tiles, the triplet would be found.\n\nSo, the code would return 1.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is a single line with three strings. But according to the example, the input is given as a list of three strings, but in reality, the input is three strings separated by spaces. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nSo, for example, the input is something like '1s 2s 3s' (as in the first example). But the sample input shows that in the input, it's given as a list of three strings, but perhaps that's just for the example. Actually, the actual input is a single line with three space-separated strings.\n\nWait, the sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nOutput:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nBut that's probably for the example. But in reality, the input is three strings on a single line. For example, for the first test case, the input is \"1s 2s 3s\", which is three tiles. So, in code, the input is read as a single line, split into three parts.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nSo, for example, input is read as a list of three elements.\n\nNow, the code needs to process each test case. Wait, but looking back, the sample input shows that the input is three different cases. But the problem says that the input is three strings. So perhaps the sample input is not the actual input. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSo, for example, for the first example, the input is three strings: '1s', '2s', '3s'.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is a list of three strings, but that's probably for the example. So, in code, the input is read as a single line, split into three parts.\n\nSo, the code will read the input as:\n\noriginal_tiles = input().split()\n\nBut the code needs to process one case, not multiple. The sample input shows three different test cases, but perhaps that's for the example. So, the code should read one line with three tiles.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three strings. So the code should read three strings from a single line. So the code reads the input as:\n\noriginal_tiles = input().split()\n\nAssuming that the input is given as three space-separated strings.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, the input is '1s 2s 3s' → split into three elements.\n\nOnce we have the original_tiles, we need to check if they have a mentsu.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check all combinations of three tiles in the list\n\n    # tiles is a list of strings.\n\n    from itertools import combinations\n\n    for triplet in combinations(tiles, 3):\n\n        if is_triplet(triplet) or is_sequence(triplet):\n\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nBut for the original three tiles, the combinations is just one triplet (the entire list). So, in code, for the original three tiles, check if any of the triplet (the only possible) is a mentsu.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif has_mentsu(original_tiles):\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    # check adding one tile.\n\n    possible_tiles = [f\"{n}{s}\" for n in range(1, 10) for s in ['m', 'p', 's']]\n\n    for candidate in possible_tiles:\n\n        new_tiles = original_tiles + [candidate]\n\n        if has_mentsu(new_tiles):\n\n            print(1)\n\n            exit()\n\n    # else, check if adding two tiles is needed.\n\n    print(2)\n\nBut wait, the code for adding one tile would check all possible candidates. If any of them works, then answer is 1. Else, answer is 2.\n\nBut how efficient is this?\n\nWell, for each candidate, the has_mentsu function would check all combinations of 3 tiles in the 4-tile list. For four tiles, there are 4 combinations. For each combination, check if it's a triplet or sequence.\n\nSo, for 27 candidates, each with 4 combinations, it's manageable.\n\nNow, the code for is_triplet and is_sequence.\n\nImplementing these functions.\n\nBut in code, the triplet is a tuple of three strings. For example, ('1s', '2s', '3s').\n\nSo, for is_triplet(triplet):\n\ndef is_triplet(triplet):\n\n    # check if all three are same.\n\n    return triplet[0] == triplet[1] == triplet[2]\n\nWait, no. Because the triplet is a list of three tiles. For example, if the triplet is ['1m', '1m', '1m'], then yes. But for the code, the triplet is passed as a tuple of three elements. So, comparing all three elements.\n\nYes, that's correct. Because for a triplet, all three must be same.\n\nBut in the case of the triplet being part of a larger list, like four tiles, the code would check all combinations of three tiles. So, for example, if the original three tiles are ['1m', '1m', '2m'], and adding a '1m' tile, then the new_tiles is ['1m', '1m', '2m', '1m']. The combinations would include (1m, 1m, 1m), which is a triplet.\n\nSo, the code for is_triplet is correct.\n\nFor is_sequence:\n\ndef is_sequence(triplet):\n\n    # check if all same suit.\n\n    suit = triplet[0][1]\n\n    for t in triplet:\n\n        if t[1] != suit:\n\n            return False\n\n    # now check numbers are consecutive.\n\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in triplet])\n\n    return nums[2] - nums[0] == 2 and len(set(nums)) == 3\n\nBut in code, triplet is a tuple of three strings.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All three tiles are same. Then, answer is 0.\n\nEdge Case 2: Three tiles are same suit, but not consecutive. For example, 1m, 2m, 4m. Adding 3m would allow a sequence. So answer is 1.\n\nEdge Case 3: Three tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Adding two tiles of 1m. So, the answer is 2.\n\nBut according to the code, when adding one tile, the code would check all possibilities. For example, adding 1m. Then the new_tiles is [1m, 1p, 1s, 1m]. The combinations of three tiles would include (1m, 1m, 1p) → not a triplet. (1m, 1m, 1s) → not. (1m, 1p, 1s) → not. (1m, 1p, 1s) again. So no. So, the code would not find any mentsu. So, the code would proceed to output 2.\n\nAnother Edge Case: original tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Adding 1m would make triplet. So, code would find this. So, answer is 1.\n\nAnother Edge Case: original tiles are 1m, 2m, 3m. Already a sequence. Answer 0.\n\nAnother Edge Case: original tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Adding 2m and 4m. But since we can only add one tile, adding 2m would allow a sequence of 1m, 2m, 3m. So answer is 1. But adding 4m would allow a sequence of 3m, 4m, 5m. So, the code would check adding 2m, which would allow the sequence. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother Edge Case: original tiles are 1m, 1m, 3m. Adding 2m gives a sequence. So answer 1.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in code, the has_mentsu function uses combinations from itertools. So, need to import itertools.\n\nBut for code submission, the code needs to be self-contained.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nRead input.\n\nCheck if current tiles have mentsu → 0.\n\nElse, check for all possible tiles to add. For each, check if adding it gives a mentsu.\n\nIf any, output 1.\n\nElse, output 2.\n\nImplementing this.\n\nBut code in Python:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef is_triplet(triplet):\n    return triplet[0] == triplet[1] == triplet[2]\n\ndef is_sequence(triplet):\n    suit = triplet[0][1]\n    for t in triplet:\n        if t[1] != suit:\n            return False\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in triplet])\n    return nums[2] - nums[0] == 2 and len(set(nums)) == 3\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n    for triplet in combinations(tiles, 3):\n        if is_triplet(triplet) or is_sequence(triplet):\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    original_tiles = input().split()\n    if has_mentsu(original_tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    # Check adding one tile\n    possible_tiles = [f\"{n}{s}\" for n in range(1, 10) for s in ['m', 'p', 's']]\n    for candidate in possible_tiles:\n        new_tiles = original_tiles + [candidate]\n        if has_mentsu(new_tiles):\n            print(1)\n            return\n    # Else, need to add two tiles\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the third example, the original tiles are ['3p', '9m', '2p'].\n\nOriginal tiles: 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\nCheck if they have mentsu: no.\n\nThen, check adding each possible tile.\n\nFor example, adding 1p:\n\nnew_tiles = ['3p', '9m', '2p', '1p']\n\nCheck all combinations of three tiles.\n\nCheck triplet (3p, 9m, 2p) → no. (3p, 9m, 1p) → no. (3p, 2p, 1p) → same suit (p). Numbers are 1, 2, 3 → sorted. So yes, sequence. So this triplet is valid. So the code would return 1.\n\nSo the code works for this case.\n\nAnother example: original tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p. Adding 4p. Then, new_tiles is [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p]. The combinations would include 2p, 3p, 4p → which is a sequence. So code returns 1.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, what about the case where adding two tiles is required?\n\nExample: original tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Then, adding one tile of 1m. The new_tiles is [1m, 1p, 1s, 1m]. Check all combinations of three tiles. None of them form a triplet or sequence. So the code proceeds to print 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: original tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Adding one tile of 1m. Now, new_tiles is [1m, 2p, 3s, 1m]. Check all triplets. None of them form a triplet or sequence. So code returns 2.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nBut what about when adding two tiles can form a triplet? For example, original is 1m, 1p, 1s. Adding two 1m tiles. But the code would not check this case because it's adding two tiles. But according to the code, the answer is 2.\n\nSo the code returns 2 in this case, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: original is 1m, 2m, 4m. Adding 3m gives a sequence. So code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about original is 1m, 2m, 3m. Already a sequence. So code returns 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: original is 1m, 1m, 2m. Adding 1m → triplet. So code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the original three tiles can form a triplet with adding one tile? For example, original is 1m, 1m, 2m. Adding 1m → triplet. So code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: original is 1m, 2m, 2m. Adding 2m. Then, triplet is 2m, 2m, 2m. So code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 3: ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nOriginal_tiles = ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nhas_mentsu: check all combinations of three tiles (only one combination). The triplet is 3p, 9m, 2p. Check if triplet: no. Check if sequence: suit must be same. 3p is p, 9m is m, 2p is p. So not same suit. So no. So returns false. So code proceeds to check adding one tile.\n\nIn the loop, for candidate in possible_tiles.\n\nWhen candidate is '1p', the new_tiles is ['3p', '9m', '2p', '1p'].\n\nCheck all combinations of three tiles:\n\ncombinations are:\n\n('3p', '9m', '2p') → no.\n\n('3p', '9m', '1p') → suit is m and p? No. 3p, 9m, 1p → suits are p, m, p → not same. So no.\n\n('3p', '2p', '1p') → same suit p. numbers 1, 2, 3 → sorted. So yes. So returns True. Thus, code prints 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother sample case: the second input is '9m 9m 9m' → has_mentsu returns True (triplet), so output 0.\n\nAnother sample case: first input is 1s, 2s, 3s. has_mentsu returns True (sequence), so output 0.\n\nThus, code works for samples.\n\nNow, think about possible errors.\n\nWhat if the original tiles have two tiles of same suit and numbers that can form a sequence with adding one tile. For example, original tiles are 1m, 3m, 2p. Then, adding 2m would allow a sequence of 1m, 2m, 3m. So code would check adding 2m. The new_tiles is [1m, 3m, 2p, 2m]. The combinations would include 1m, 3m, 2m → sorted numbers 1,2,3 → same suit m. So yes. So code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: original tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Adding 2m and 4m. But in code, when adding one tile, say 2m, the new_tiles is [1m, 3m, 5m, 2m]. The combinations include 1m, 2m, 3m → sequence. So code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: original tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Adding 3m → code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the original tiles have two tiles of same suit and same number, but not three. For example, original is 1m, 1m, 2p. Adding 1m → triplet. So code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: original is 1m, 1p, 1m. So two 1m and one 1p. Adding 1m → triplet. So code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking if the current hand already contains a mentsu, and if not, determining the minimum number of additional tiles required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Immediate Mentsu**: First, check if the current three tiles form a valid mentsu (triplet or sequence).\n2. **Check with One Additional Tile**: If no immediate mentsu is found, check all possible single tiles that can be added to the current hand. For each possible tile, check if the resulting set of four tiles contains a valid mentsu.\n3. **Default to Two Additional Tiles**: If no valid mentsu can be formed by adding one tile, the answer is 2, as adding two tiles will always allow forming either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef is_triplet(triplet):\n    return triplet[0] == triplet[1] == triplet[2]\n\ndef is_sequence(triplet):\n    suit = triplet[0][1]\n    for t in triplet:\n        if t[1] != suit:\n            return False\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in triplet])\n    return nums[2] - nums[0] == 2 and len(set(nums)) == 3\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n    for triplet in combinations(tiles, 3):\n        if is_triplet(triplet) or is_sequence(triplet):\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    original_tiles = input().split()\n    if has_mentsu(original_tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    # Check adding one tile\n    possible_tiles = [f\"{n}{s}\" for n in range(1, 10) for s in ['m', 'p', 's']]\n    for candidate in possible_tiles:\n        new_tiles = original_tiles + [candidate]\n        if has_mentsu(new_tiles):\n            print(1)\n            return\n    # Else, need to add two tiles\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Immediate Mentsu Check**: The function `has_mentsu` checks if any combination of three tiles from the current hand forms a valid triplet or sequence.\n2. **Adding One Tile Check**: We generate all possible tiles (1-9 for each suit) and check if adding any of these tiles to the current hand results in a valid mentsu.\n3. **Fallback to Two Tiles**: If no valid mentsu can be formed by adding one tile, we conclude that adding two tiles will suffice, as it is always possible to form either a triplet or a sequence with two additional tiles.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios using combinatorial checks and ensures the minimum number of tiles are drawn to achieve a valid mentsu.",
