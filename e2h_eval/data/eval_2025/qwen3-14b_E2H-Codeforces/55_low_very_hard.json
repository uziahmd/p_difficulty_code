    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible ternary string after performing allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). But we can't swap 0 and 2 directly. \n\nSo, first, I need to understand what permutations are possible with these swaps. Let's think about the movement of each character.\n\nFor example, can a '0' move past a '2'? Well, since we can't swap 0 and 2 directly, but maybe through some intermediate steps. Let's see: suppose there's a sequence like 0 1 2. Then, we can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. Wait, but maybe there's another way. Hmm. Alternatively, if there's a 0 followed by a 1, then we can swap them. Then, if there's a 1 followed by a 2, we can swap them. So perhaps the 0 can move past 1s and 2s via moving through 1s?\n\nWait, but if there's a 0 and a 2 separated by some 1s, maybe they can be rearranged. Let me think. Suppose we have 0 1 2. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2. We can swap the 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Then, can we swap the 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the 0 can move to the right by swapping with 1s, and the 2 can move to the left by swapping with 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the allowed swaps imply that the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because, for example, a 0 can't cross a 2. Because to do that, you would need to swap them, which isn't allowed. However, if there's a 1 in between, maybe they can be rearranged. Let's take an example: 0 2. Can't swap. But if there's a 0 1 2. Then, can we move the 0 to the right past the 2? Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2. We can swap 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Then, the 0 can't swap with the 2. So the 0 can't move past the 2. So in this case, the 0 is stuck to the left of the 2. Similarly, if there's a 2 and a 0, separated by some 1s, perhaps the 0 can't move past the 2. \n\nWait, but what if there's a 2 and 1 and 0. Like 2 1 0. Then, we can swap the 1 and 0 (since they are adjacent and 0 and 1 can be swapped). So that would become 2 0 1. Then, can we swap the 2 and 0? No. So the 0 is stuck. So in this case, the original order of 2 and 0 can't be changed. Therefore, perhaps the relative order of 0s and 2s cannot be changed. Because any 0 can only move past 1s, and any 2 can only move past 1s. But 0s and 2s can't pass each other. \n\nIf that's true, then the problem reduces to arranging the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, but allowing the 1s to be moved around between them. Wait, but how? Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered relative to each other. For example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2 in the original string, then in the final string, that 0 must still be before that 2. Similarly, if there's a 2 followed by a 0, then the 2 must stay before the 0. Because otherwise, they would have to cross each other, which isn't possible. \n\nIf that's the case, then the problem can be broken down into two parts: arranging the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, and then arranging the 1s in between them. But how?\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved around. For example, if there are 0s and 2s in the original string, and 1s in between, then perhaps the 1s can be moved to positions between the 0s and ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible ternary string after performing allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' or between '1' and '2', but not directly between '0' and '2'. This means that the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot be changed, but '1's can be freely rearranged among the '0's and '2's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Relative Order of '0's and '2's**: Since '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly, their relative order in the original string must be preserved.\n2. **Reordering '1's**: '1's can be moved freely between '0's and '2's. Therefore, we can collect all '1's and place them in the gaps between the '0's and '2's to minimize the lexicographical order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # Split the string into parts of 0s and 2s, and collect the 1s\n    parts = []\n    ones = []\n    current = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            parts.append(current)\n            current = [c]\n    parts.append(current)\n    \n    # Now, interleave the 1s into the parts\n    result = []\n    ones_idx = 0\n    for part in parts:\n        # Add the part (which is a list of '0's and '2's)\n        result.extend(part)\n        # Add as many '1's as possible before the next part\n        while ones_idx < len(ones):\n            result.append('1')\n            ones_idx += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and process each test case\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    test_cases = input_str.split()\n    for case in test_cases:\n        print(min_ternary_string(case))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the String**: The input string is split into segments of '0's and '2's, with '1's collected separately.\n2. **Reconstructing the Result**: The segments of '0's and '2's are kept in their original order, and the collected '1's are inserted between these segments. This ensures that '1's are placed in positions that minimize the lexicographical order while preserving the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures the resulting string is the smallest possible lexicographically. The time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the input string, making it suitable for large inputs up to 100,000 characters.",
