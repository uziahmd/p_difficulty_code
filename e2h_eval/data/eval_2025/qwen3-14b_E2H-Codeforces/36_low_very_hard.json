The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what configurations of towers are valid. Let's think about the constraints. For each tower, when you set its power, it covers some range. But the key is that every town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once, and towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered.\n\nLet me think of possible valid tower arrangements. For example, in the first sample input where n=2, the only valid case is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then setting their power to 1 each. Because then town 1 covers itself (since |1-1| < 1? Wait, wait. Wait the signal power p is such that |c - i| < p. So for a tower at i with power p, it covers all cities c where the distance is less than p. So for p=1, the distance has to be less than 1. Since the cities are integers, this means that only the city i itself is covered. Because |c - i| can be 0 (for c=i) or 1 (for c=i±1). So for p=1, the tower covers exactly its own town. So if two adjacent towers are present, each with p=1, they cover their own towns, and no others. That's why in the first example, when n=2 and both towers are built, that's valid.\n\nAnother example given is when n=5 and towers are at 2,4,5. The tower at 2 has power 2, which covers towns 1,2,3. Then the tower at 4 has power 1 (covers 4), and tower at 5 has power 1 (covers 5). So that's valid.\n\nSo the key is that the tower configuration must allow for a way to partition the towns 1..n into ranges covered by exactly one tower. Also, the towers must be arranged such that there's no overlap in coverage except for the exact coverage.\n\nWait, but how can we model this? It feels similar to some kind of tiling or dynamic programming problem. Maybe we can model it as a dynamic programming problem where dp[i] represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns.\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that for the entire sequence of towns 1..n, the towers must be arranged in such a way that there's a way to assign power levels so that each town is covered exactly once, and towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nSo for each position, perhaps the valid configurations are those where the towers form a certain pattern. For example, maybe each tower must be part of a segment where it's the only tower covering its area. Let's think about how the towers can be arranged.\n\nSuppose there's a tower at position i. To cover some towns, but not reach beyond. For instance, if a tower is placed at i, and it's the only tower in some interval. For example, if there's a tower at i, and the next tower is at j > i. Then the tower at i must cover up to some point before j's coverage starts. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the coverage ranges. Each town must be covered exactly once. So the coverage ranges must form a partition of the towns 1..n. Also, since the coverage of a tower with power p is from i-p+1 to i+p-1 (since |c-i| < p implies c is between i-p+1 and i+p-1, inclusive?), wait:\n\nWait, |c - i| < p → c is in (i - p, i + p). Since c is an integer, this is equivalent to c ∈ [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]. Because for example, if p is 2, then |c - i| can be 0, 1. So c ranges from i-1 to i+1. Which is length 3, which is 2p-1. So the coverage is a range of length 2p-1 centered at i.\n\nBut for the coverage to not reach town 0 or n+1. So for any tower at position i, the coverage must not include 0 or n+1. So for a tower at i, the maximum power p must satisfy that i - p + 1 > 0 (so that the left end of coverage is not 0) and i + p - 1 < n+1. Wait, but the coverage for a tower at i with power p is up to",

Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n2. **Transition Between States**: For each position `i`, we consider two cases:\n   - The tower at position `i` is not built.\n   - The tower at position `i` is built, and it covers some range ending at `i`.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle divisions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: no towns, one way (no towers)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at i. Then dp[i] += dp[i-1]\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        \n        # Case 2: tower at i. It must cover some range ending at i\n        # So the previous tower must be at j < i, such that the tower at j can't reach i\n        # But for the current tower at i, it can cover up to i, so it can be placed such that it starts covering from some k to i\n        # However, since the coverage of the tower at i must not reach town 0, the maximum power p is such that i - p + 1 >= 1\n        # So p can be at most i. But since the tower at i is built, and we need to ensure that the coverage doesn't reach 0 or n+1.\n        # However, for the DP approach, we need to find the number of ways where the tower at i is the last one in its segment.\n        # This is similar to the tiling problem where we can have a tower at i covering from k to i, and the previous part is valid.\n        # For the current tower at i, the maximum possible coverage is up to i, but we need to ensure that the previous tower does not cover i.\n        # Hence, the previous tower must be placed at i-1, and the current tower is placed at i, but that's not necessarily true.\n        # Wait, perhaps we can think of the tower at i as being responsible for covering a segment ending at i. To do that, it must be the only tower in its coverage area.\n        # So for the tower at i, the previous tower must be placed at j < i - 1, and the tower at i covers from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. But to avoid overlapping with previous towers, we need to ensure that the previous tower's coverage ends before i - p + 1.\n        # Alternatively, considering that the tower at i can be the end of a segment. For example, the tower at i could be the only one covering from i - k + 1 to i. But how to model this?\n        # Another approach is inspired by the tiling problem. For the current position i, the tower can be placed such that it covers the last position. So the number of ways to have a valid configuration ending at i with a tower is equal to the sum of dp[j] for all j from 0 to i-1, but multiplied by 1/2^(i-j) ? No, not sure.\n        # Wait, the key observation is that for a valid configuration, the towers must be placed such that there's a way to assign power levels. This is equivalent to the towers forming a partition of the towns into intervals where each interval has exactly one tower, and the tower's coverage spans the entire interval.\n        # For example, if there is a tower at position i, then it must be the only tower in the interval [a, i], and the tower's power is set to i - a + 1. So the tower at i can cover from a to i, and the length of the interval is (i - a + 1). Thus, the tower's power is i - a + 1, which must be at least 1.\n        # Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to partition the sequence of towns into segments where each segment contains exactly one tower, and the tower is at the end of the segment.\n        # This is similar to the problem of counting the number of valid tilings where each tile is a segment ending with a tower.\n        # So for the DP approach, the recurrence is:\n        # dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-1] * 1 / 2 ? No, because when we add a tower at i, we need to ensure that the previous segment is valid.\n        # Wait, here's a better idea: For each i, the number of valid configurations can be determined by considering whether there is a tower at i or not.\n        # If there is no tower at i, then the number of configurations is dp[i-1].\n        # If there is a tower at i, then we need to ensure that the tower at i is the last in its segment. So the previous segment must end at some j < i, and the tower at i is added to form a new segment. But since the tower at i can be placed, and the segment from j+1 to i must have exactly one tower (which is at i). So for any j < i, if the first j towns are valid, then adding a tower at i would be valid. However, we need to make sure that the tower at i's coverage does not reach beyond i. But since the tower is placed at i, and the coverage is set to exactly cover the segment from j+1 to i. For that, the power of the tower would be i - (j+1) + 1 = i - j. So the coverage is from j+1 to i, and the power is i-j. But for the coverage to not reach town 0, the leftmost town covered by the tower is j+1, which is ≥1. And the rightmost is i, which is ≤n. So this is valid.\n        # Therefore, the number of ways where there is a tower at i is equal to the sum of dp[j] for all j from 0 to i-1.
