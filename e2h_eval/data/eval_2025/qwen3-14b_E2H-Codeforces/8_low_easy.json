Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that we have an undirected graph with given flows on each edge, and we need to assign directions to these edges such that the flow is valid. The conditions are that for every vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the incoming flow equals outgoing flow. Also, the source has no incoming edges, and the directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to find a way to direct the edges such that all the flow conservation laws are satisfied, and the graph is acyclic. Since the graph is connected and there's a solution, we need to find a way to assign directions.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each vertex v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows entering must equal the sum leaving. But since each edge has a fixed flow value, directing it in one direction contributes to the outflow of one node and inflow of another. So, for each node, the total flow going out minus the total flow coming in should be zero, except for source and sink.\n\nWait, but the source has no incoming edges. So the source's outflow is equal to the total flow. Similarly, the sink's inflow is equal to the total flow.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe we can think of this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the net flow at each node (except source and sink) is zero.\n\nBut how to assign the directions?\n\nAnother thought: since the graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. For example, if we can arrange the nodes in a linear order where all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes, then there's no cycle. But how does that help with the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow is a maximum flow, but the problem says that the flow values are already given. So maybe the problem is not about computing the maximum flow but about assigning directions correctly once the flow values are known.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges leaving v must equal the sum of flows on edges entering v. Let me denote for each node, the net outflow (outflow - inflow) must be zero. Except for the source, which has net outflow equal to the total flow, and the sink which has net inflow equal to the total flow.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of it as a directed graph. Each edge contributes +ci to one node's outflow and -ci to the other's. Wait, no. If an edge is directed from u to v, then for u, it's an outflow of ci, and for v, it's an inflow of ci. So for each node, the sum of outflows minus sum of inflows equals zero (for non-source/sink). For source, sum of outflows minus inflows equals total flow (which is the same as the sum of all edges leaving the source minus those entering it). Similarly for sink.\n\nBut how can we assign directions so that this is satisfied?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a directed graph where the net outflow for each node (except source and sink) is zero. But how?\n\nAnother approach: think of each edge as contributing to the balance of the nodes. For each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards it must be zero (except for source and sink).\n\nLet me consider the balance for each node. Let's say for node v, the balance is (sum of flows on edges going out) - (sum of flows on edges going in). For non-source/sink nodes, this must be zero. For the source, it's equal to the total flow (since it has no incoming edges). For the sink, it's -total flow.\n\nBut how to compute this? Well, the total flow is the sum of all flows leaving the source. Which is also the sum of flows entering the sink.\n\nBut how to model the directions. Maybe this can be transformed into a problem of finding a directed graph where the balance of each node (excluding source and sink) is zero.\n\nBut how to find such directions?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a system of equations. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum over all edges incident to v of (direction * ci) = 0. Wait, no. Because for each edge, if it's directed from u to v, then for u, it's +ci, and for v, it's -ci. So for each node v, the sum over all edges adjacent to it of (direction contribution) is zero. For example, if an edge between u and v is directed from u to v, then for u's balance, it adds +ci, and for v's balance, it",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies the flow conservation laws and is acyclic.

This helps in creating a topological order.\n2. **Topological Order**: Nodes are ordered based on their finishing times in the DFS traversal. This order ensures that edges can be directed from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order, preventing cycles.\n3. **Edge Direction Assignment**: For each edge, we compare the positions of its endpoints in the topological order. The edge is directed from the node that appears earlier in the topological order to the one that appears later, ensuring acyclicity.\n\nThis approach efficiently assigns directions to edges while ensuring the flow conservation and acyclicity constraints are met.",
