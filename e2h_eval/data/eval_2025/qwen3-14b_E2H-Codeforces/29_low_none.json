Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The main challenge is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If I try to process each substitution naively by replacing every occurrence in the string, that could be O(n * m) where m is the length of the string, which might be too slow for large cases. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, thinking about this, maybe we can model the substitutions using some kind of replacement rules, but track them in a way that allows us to compute the final value without expanding the entire string. Since each substitution replaces a digit with another string, perhaps we can represent the transformations as a mapping from digits to their replacement strings. But since substitutions can be applied in sequence, and each substitution affects the current state of the string, we need to process the queries in order.\n\nWait, but if we process the queries in reverse order, maybe we can find a way to compute the value. Because when you replace a digit with another string, that substitution affects all future substitutions. For example, if a query replaces '2' with '00', and then later a query replaces '0' with '1', then the original '2's would become '00' and then each '0' becomes '1', resulting in '11'.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe we can track for each digit, what it expands to, considering all the substitutions that have been applied so far. However, since substitutions can overwrite previous ones, we need to keep track of the current mapping for each digit.\n\nWait, but if we process the queries in reverse order, maybe we can compute the value. Let me think: suppose that each substitution is applied in order. So the first query is applied first, then the next, etc. But if we want to compute the final value, perhaps we can model the substitutions as a tree or some kind of recursive expansion. However, directly expanding the string would be too slow for large cases.\n\nAlternative idea: Since each substitution replaces a digit with another string, perhaps we can represent the value of each digit as a number (mod 1e9+7) and the length of the string (mod something?), but that seems tricky because when you substitute a digit with a string, the value depends on the digits in that string. However, since the substitutions are applied in order, maybe we can track for each digit, the current expansion as a function that can be evaluated.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by dynamic programming. Let's consider that for each digit d, we can track what it expands to. Initially, each digit d expands to itself. Then, when a substitution is done, say d -> t, we update the expansion of d to be t. However, when t contains digits that have their own expansions, those would be expanded recursively. But how do we compute the value of the entire string after all substitutions?\n\nBut if we can represent the expansion of each digit as a value (mod MOD) and the length (mod MOD-1?), perhaps we can compute the value of the string efficiently. Wait, because when you replace a digit with a string, the contribution of that substitution to the overall number depends on the digits in the replacement string. But since numbers are built digit by digit, the position of each digit matters. However, since we're working mod 1e9+7, which is a prime, perhaps we can find a way to compute the value based on the expansions.\n\nWait, here's a thought. Let's think of each digit's expansion as a pair (value, length), where value is the numeric value of the expansion mod MOD, and length is the number of digits in the expansion. Then, when we have a substitution that replaces d with a string t, we can compute for d's new value and length based on t's digits. However, since t may contain other digits which themselves have expansions, we need to process substitutions in a way that allows us to compute these pairs correctly.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a substitution for digit 'd' with a string t. The value of t is computed by expanding each digit in t, then combining them into a number. Let's think: if t is \"abc\", then the value of t is (a's value * 10^{length of bc} + b's value * 10^{length of c} + c's value). Similarly, the length of t is the sum of the lengths of each digit in t.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently? Because when we process substitutions, we need to know the current expansion of each digit. So, perhaps we can maintain for each digit d, two values:\n\n- val[d]: the numeric value of",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly applying each substitution step-by-step would be too slow for large inputs due to potential exponential growth in string length. Instead, we can use dynamic programming to track the value and length of each digit's expansion.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the final result is taken modulo $10^9 + 7$, we can represent the numeric value of any expanded string modulo this number.\n2. **Length Tracking**: When replacing a digit with a string, the number of digits in the replacement affects the positional weight of digits during the modulo calculation.\n3. **Recursive Expansion**: Each digit can be replaced by a string, which may contain other digits that are also replaced. We can model this using dynamic programming by maintaining for each digit the value and length of its current expansion.\n\n---\n\n### Approach:\n\n- Use two arrays, `val` and `len`, where:\n  - `val[d]` stores the numeric value of the expansion of digit `d` modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n  - `len[d]` stores the length (number of digits) of the expansion of digit `d`.\n\n- Initialize `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1` for all digits `d`.\n- Process queries in reverse order, updating the `val` and `len` arrays based on the replacement strings.\n- After processing all queries, compute the final value of the original string using the updated `val` and `len` mappings.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\n- **Modular Exponentiation**: To compute the contribution of each digit's expansion when building up the number, we need to calculate powers of 10 modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n- **Efficient Computation**: For each query, compute the value and length of the replacement string using the current mappings and update the corresponding digit's values accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    s = data[0]\n    n = int(data[1])\n    queries = data[2:2+n]\n    \n    # Initialize val and len for digits 0-9\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    len_ = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Precompute powers of 10 mod MOD up to 1e5\n    max_len = 10**5 + 10\n    pow10 = [1] * max_len\n    for i in range(1, max_len):\n        pow10[i] = (pow10[i-1] * 10) % MOD\n\n    # Process queries in reverse\n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        if not q:\n            continue\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d = int(parts[0])\n        t = parts[1]\n        \n        # Compute value and length of the replacement string\n        v = 0\n        l = 0\n        for ch in t:\n            c = int(ch)\n            v = (v * pow10[len_[c]] + val[c]) % MOD\n            l += len_[c]\n        \n        # Update the value and length for digit d\n        val[d] = v\n        len_[d] = l\n    \n    # Compute the result from the initial string\n    res = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        c = int(ch)\n        res = (res * pow10[len_[c]] + val[c]) % MOD\n    \n    print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The code reads input and processes the queries in reverse order to ensure that earlier substitutions are applied correctly.\n- It uses precomputed powers of 10 to efficiently compute the numeric value of expansions.\n- The final value of the original string is computed using the updated mappings, taking care of leading zeros and large numbers through modular arithmetic.\n\nThis approach ensures that we process all substitutions in linear time relative to the total length of the input, making it efficient even for large inputs.",
