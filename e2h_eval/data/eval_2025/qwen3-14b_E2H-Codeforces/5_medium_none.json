Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors have to be compatible. The question marks can match any color, including other question marks. \n\nFirst, I need to think about how to maximize the pairs. Let's see. The challenge is to pair left and right boots optimally. Since each boot can be used only once, we need a way to assign them without overlaps.\n\nLet me break down the problem. For each left boot, we can try to pair it with a right boot that matches. But since there are question marks, which are flexible, maybe we should handle specific colors first and then use the wildcards.\n\nWait, here's an idea: for each color (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. Then, the maximum possible pairs for that color is the minimum of the two counts. Those pairs can be made directly. Then, the remaining left and right boots (those with '?') can be paired among themselves. But wait, the '?' can also pair with other '?'s. However, perhaps the optimal approach is to first pair as many specific colors as possible, then use the remaining '?'s.\n\nBut there's a catch. Because some of the '?'s could be used to pair with specific colors. For example, if there's a left boot with 'a' and a right boot with '?', they can be paired. Similarly, a left '?' can pair with a right 'b'.\n\nSo maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Pair all specific colors first. For each color c (not '?'), pair left c's with right c's. The number of such pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nBut how to do that? Well, we need to track which left and right boots are used. So perhaps we can create a list for each color, storing the indices of left boots and right boots. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut after that, we have some left and right boots that are not yet paired. These would be the ones with '?' or those that couldn't be paired because their specific color had more on one side than the other. For example, if there are more left 'a's than right 'a's, the extra left 'a's can't be paired with right 'a's, but they can be paired with right '?'s.\n\nSo the next step is to handle the remaining boots. Let's think about the remaining left boots (those that are not yet paired) and the remaining right boots. These include:\n\n- Left boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired (because there were not enough on the other side)\n- Right boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired (same reason)\n- Left and right boots with '?'\n\nNow, for these remaining boots, we can pair them in any way, as long as their colors are compatible. Since the '?' can match anything, we can pair them in any way. But how to maximize the number of pairs?\n\nThe maximum possible pairs here would be the minimum of the total number of remaining left boots and remaining right boots. However, we need to make sure that the pairing is done correctly.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think: for the remaining left and right boots, we can pair each left with any right. However, since we want to maximize the count, we can pair as many as possible. But how to track which ones are available.\n\nSo the approach might be:\n\n- For each color (excluding '?'), pair left and right boots of that color. This is the first phase.\n- Then, collect all the unpaired left boots and unpaired right boots. These can be either:\n   - Left boots with specific colors (but their color didn't have enough on the other side)\n   - Right boots with specific colors (same)\n   - Or '?'s on either side.\n- Now, for the second phase, pair the remaining left and right boots. Here, any left can be paired with any right, as long as their colors are compatible. But since '?' can match anything, we can pair any left with any right.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the pairs here. Because the number of remaining boots could be up to n*2, but n is 150,000. We need an efficient way.\n\nWait, but in the second phase, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of the number of remaining left boots and remaining right boots. Because each left can be paired with exactly one right and vice versa. So, if there are L left and R right boots remaining, the max possible is min(L, R).\n\nSo the problem is to pair them in such a way that their colors are compatible. But since the '?' can be matched with anything, the only time when a pair is invalid is when both are specific colors and different. But in this phase, the remaining left and right boots may have specific colors that are not compatible with each other. How to avoid that?\n\nWait, no. Because in the first phase, we already paired all possible same-color specific pairs. So in the remaining left and right boots, the specific colors may not have their counterparts. For example, suppose there are left boots with 'a' and right boots with 'a' but the counts were unequal. So after pairing, there are some left 'a's left. But the right 'a's are all used up. So the remaining left 'a's can be paired with right '?'s, or left '?'s can be paired with right 'a's. But if there's a left 'a' and a right 'b', they can't be paired. However, in this case, how can we avoid that?\n\nAh, but in the second phase, we can't pair them. So the problem is that in the second phase, there are some left and right boots that can't be paired. However, how can we ensure that we pair as many as possible?\n\nHmm, perhaps the second phase is not just pairing any left and right, but pairing in such a way that their colors are compatible. However, how to do that optimally?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first phase is not the best approach. Maybe we should consider all possibilities, including using '?'s to pair with specific colors. Because if we have a left 'a' and a right '?', that's a valid pair. Similarly, a left '?' and a right 'b' can be paired. Also, a left '?' and a right '?' can be paired.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy is:\n\n1. First, pair all left and right boots that have specific colors and match. That's straightforward.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right boots, collect all the left '?'s and right '?'s. Pair them with each other. Because that's the easiest way.\n\n3. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are specific colors that couldn't be paired with others), pair them with the opposite side's '?'s.\n\nBut how to manage that.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- Create a mapping for each color (excluding '?') for left and right boots. For example, left_colors[c] is a list of indices of left boots with color c. Similarly for right_colors[c].\n\n- For each color c (not '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. So, take the min of len(left_colors[c]) and len(right_colors[c]). For each such pair, pair them. Then, remove those from the lists.\n\n- After that, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either '?', or specific colors that couldn't be paired), we can proceed to pair them.\n\nBut how to handle the '?'s. Let's say, collect all the left '?'s into a list, and all the right '?'s into another list. Then, pair them with each other. That's min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) pairs. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those not paired yet), which are specific colors, but their counts may not have been matched. But how to pair them with the remaining '?'s.\n\nWait, after pairing the left and right '?'s, the remaining left and right boots would be specific colors. But for these, we can pair them with the '?'s on the other side. For example, a left boot with color 'a' (unpaired) can be paired with a right boot with '?'. Similarly, a right boot with 'b' can be paired with a left '?'.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- First, pair specific colors (non '?') between left and right. For each color c, pair left and right c's.\n\n- Then, collect all remaining left and right boots (including those with '?').\n\n- Then, collect all the left '?'s and right '?'s. Pair them with each other.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left boots (specific colors) and right boots (specific colors), we can pair them with the '?'s on the opposite side.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, after pairing the '?'s with each other, we have left some left boots with specific colors and some right boots with specific colors. But perhaps there are still some '?'s on the left or right that haven't been used yet. Wait, no. Because in the previous step, we paired all the '?'s between left and right. So after that, the remaining left and right boots are those with specific colors that couldn't be paired in the first step. And the remaining left and right boots have no '?'s. Because the '?'s have been used in the second step.\n\nWait, no. Suppose there are more left '?'s than right '?'s. Then, after pairing all right '?'s with left '?'s, there will be left '?'s left. But those can't be paired with anything else except other '?'s, but they are already paired. Wait, but in this case, the remaining left '?'s can't be paired with anything else. So they are left unpaired.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nPhase 1: Pair specific colors. For each color c (not '?'), pair left and right c's. So for each left in left_colors[c], pair with right in right_colors[c]. Take as many as possible.\n\nPhase 2: Collect all remaining left boots and right boots. Now, these are:\n\n- Left boots with specific colors (could be any, but not paired in phase 1)\n- Right boots with specific colors (same)\n- Left and right boots with '?'\n\nNow, for phase 2a: Pair left '?'s with right '?'s. Take min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\nThen, phase 2b: Pair the remaining left '?'s with right boots that have specific colors (but not yet paired). Similarly, pair the remaining right '?'s with left boots that have specific colors.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, after phase 2a, any remaining left '?'s can be paired with any right boot (specific color) that hasn't been paired yet. Similarly for the right '?'s.\n\nBut how to track which boots are available.\n\nAlternatively, after phase 1, collect all the unpaired left boots (left_remaining) and unpaired right boots (right_remaining). Then, for phase 2:\n\n- Pair left_remaining's '?' with right_remaining's '?'.\n\n- Then, pair left_remaining's specific colors with right_remaining's '?'.\n\n- Then, pair right_remaining's specific colors with left_remaining's '?'.\n\nWait, but this seems like a way to maximize the pairs. Because any left '?' can pair with any right (specific or ?) that is not yet paired. Similarly for right '?'.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of data structures. For example, after phase 1, we have:\n\nleft_remaining = list of all left boots not yet paired.\n\nright_remaining = list of all right boots not yet paired.\n\nWe can process them as follows:\n\n- Create a list of left_question_marks (from left_remaining) and right_question_marks (from right_remaining). Pair them first. Then, the remaining left_question_marks can be paired with right_remaining (specific colors). Similarly, the remaining right_question_marks can be paired with left_remaining (specific colors).\n\nBut how to track which boots are used.\n\nAlternatively, during phase 1, we can track which left and right boots are used. Then, for the remaining, we can collect all left and right boots not used.\n\nBut how to collect them.\n\nLet me think of an approach where we track for each left and right boot whether it's been used. Then, for phase 1, we can iterate through each color, and for each left and right boot of that color, pair them up.\n\nBut for large n (like 150,000), we need an efficient way. Using lists for each color, and then taking the min of the counts.\n\nFor example, for color c:\n\nleft_list = list of left boots with color c (indices)\n\nright_list = list of right boots with color c (indices)\n\nnumber of pairs is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)).\n\nFor each i in 0 to (min-1), pair left_list[i] with right_list[i].\n\nThen, mark those as used.\n\nOnce that's done, for the remaining left and right boots, collect them.\n\nNow, the problem is how to collect the remaining left and right boots. Let's think of using lists for each color. For example, for left boots, we can have a dictionary where for each color (including '?'), we have a list of indices. Similarly for right.\n\nThen, for phase 1, we process each color (excluding '?') and pair left and right as much as possible.\n\nAfter that, for the remaining left and right boots, we can collect all the left and right boots that are not yet paired. For example, for left, the remaining would be all the left boots in their color lists that weren't used in phase 1. Similarly for right.\n\nOnce we have the remaining, we can process them in phase 2.\n\nPhase 2a: Pair left '?' with right '?'.\n\nWe can collect all left '?'s and right '?'s from the remaining. Then, pair them as many as possible. For example, take the first k elements from left '?'s and pair with first k elements from right '?'s, where k is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nPhase 2b: Now, for the remaining left '?'s (if any) and right '?'s (if any), we can pair them with the specific color boots.\n\nWait, but after phase 2a, the remaining left '?'s can be paired with any right boots (specific colors) that are not yet paired. Similarly for the remaining right '?'s.\n\nSo, for example, after phase 2a, we have left_remaining_q = [left boots with '?'] not yet paired, and right_remaining = [right boots not yet paired (specific colors)].\n\nWe can pair each left_remaining_q with any right_remaining. Similarly for the right_remaining_q.\n\nSo, the way to proceed is:\n\nCollect all the left_remaining (including those with '?') and right_remaining (including those with '?').\n\nBut after phase 1, the left_remaining includes those that were not paired. For example, for a color c, if there were more left boots than right, the excess left boots remain in the left_remaining.\n\nSo, after phase 1, for phase 2, we can collect all left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nThen:\n\n- For phase 2a: pair left '?' and right '?'.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left '?'s, pair them with right_remaining (specific colors).\n\n- Then, for the remaining right '?'s, pair them with left_remaining (specific colors).\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, after phase 2a, for the remaining left boots (which may be '?' or specific colors) and right boots (same), we can pair them as follows:\n\nFor each left in left_remaining (not yet paired), if it's a '?', pair it with any right in right_remaining (not yet paired). Similarly for right '?'.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nOnce all phase 1 is done, collect all left and right boots that are not yet paired. Let's call them left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nThen, for each left in left_unpaired, and each right in right_unpaired, check if they are compatible. But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=150,000.\n\nSo we need a better way.\n\nBut since the question marks can be matched with anything, the only pairs that are incompatible are when both are specific colors and different.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs in phase 2 is the minimum of the number of left_unpaired and right_unpaired, but we have to avoid pairing incompatible pairs.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally.\n\nWait, but in phase 2, after phase 1, the left_unpaired and right_unpaired have some specific colors. However, the only way that a pair is not compatible is when both are specific and different. So, to maximize the number of pairs, we can pair all left_unpaired with right_unpaired, but ensuring that for each pair, their colors are compatible.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: collect all left_unpaired and right_unpaired. Then, for the left_unpaired, create a list of their colors, and same for right_unpaired. Then, pair as follows:\n\n- Pair all left '?' with any right (since they can match any).\n\n- Then, pair all right '?' with any left (since they can match any).\n\n- Then, pair the remaining left and right (specific colors) that have the same color.\n\nBut this is similar to phase 1.\n\nWait, but in phase 1, we already paired all possible same color pairs. So, after phase 1, the remaining left and right boots with specific colors cannot be paired with each other (since that would have been done in phase 1). Therefore, the remaining left and right boots with specific colors are such that their colors are not present in the opposite side. So, for example, there is a left boot with color 'a' but no right boots with 'a' left. Or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, after phase 1, any left and right boots with specific colors cannot be paired with each other. Thus, the only way to pair them is by using the '?'s.\n\nSo, for phase 2, the only compatible pairs are:\n\n- Left '?' with any right (specific or ?).\n\n- Right '?' with any left (specific or ?).\n\n- Left and right with same color (but that was handled in phase 1).\n\nBut since phase 1 has already handled same-color pairs, the remaining left and right boots with same color can't be paired because they were not available. Wait, no. For example, suppose there are multiple left 'a's and right 'a's. In phase 1, we paired as many as possible. Suppose there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's. Then, in phase 1, 2 pairs are made. One left 'a' remains. But the right 'a's are all used. So, this left 'a' can't be paired with any other right 'a's. But if there are right '?'s, this left 'a' can be paired with a right '?'.\n\nSo, after phase 1, the left_unpaired and right_unpaired contain:\n\n- Some left and right boots with specific colors that can't be paired with each other (due to phase 1's pairing).\n\n- Some left and right '?'s.\n\nSo, the way to proceed is to pair all possible '?'s with others, and then for the remaining specific color boots, they can't be paired with anyone else. Thus, the maximum number of pairs is the sum from phase 1 plus the number of pairs from phase 2a (pairing '?'s) plus the number of pairs from phase 2b (pairing left '?'s with right specific, and right '?'s with left specific).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nPhase 1: Pair same color (non '?') left and right boots.\n\nPhase 2a: Pair left '?'s with right '?'s.\n\nPhase 2b: Pair left '?'s with right specific color boots (that are unpaired).\n\nPhase 2c: Pair right '?'s with left specific color boots (that are unpaired).\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about the data structures again. For phase 1, after pairing, we can collect all the left and right boots that are unpaired. Let's say we have:\n\nleft_unpaired = list of left boots (indices) that are not yet paired.\n\nright_unpaired = list of right boots (indices) that are not yet paired.\n\nThen, for phase 2a, we can separate left_unpaired into left_q (those with '?') and left_others (others). Similarly for right_unpaired into right_q and right_others.\n\nThen, the number of pairs in phase 2a is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)). We can pair each left_q with a right_q.\n\nAfter that, the remaining left_q (if any) can be paired with right_others. Similarly, the remaining right_q can be paired with left_others.\n\nBut how to do this pairing. For example, for the remaining left_q (say, there are m of them) and right_others (say, there are p of them), we can pair m of them. Similarly for the other way around.\n\nBut since the right_others have specific colors, and the left_q can be paired with any of them, we can pair each left_q with any right_other. Similarly for the other direction.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- After phase 1, collect left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\n- Split left_unpaired into left_q and left_others.\n\n- Split right_unpaired into right_q and right_others.\n\n- Pair as many left_q and right_q as possible. For example, for i in 0 to min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) - 1, pair left_q[i] with right_q[i].\n\n- Then, take the remaining left_q (if any) and pair them with the right_others. For each left_q, pair with any right_other (e.g., take the first available).\n\n- Then, take the remaining right_q (if any) and pair them with the left_others.\n\nThis way, all possible pairs are made.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think of code steps.\n\nWe can represent the left_unpaired and right_unpaired as lists. Then, split into q and others.\n\nFor example:\n\nleft_unpaired = [list of indices]\n\nleft_q = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] == '?']\nleft_others = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nThen, for phase 2a:\n\npair_count = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(pair_count):\n    pair left_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\nThen, the remaining_left_q = left_q[pair_count:]\nremaining_right_q = right_q[pair_count:]\n\nThen, for the remaining_left_q, we can pair them with right_others. How many can we pair? All of them, since each left_q can be paired with any right_other.\n\nSo for each left in remaining_left_q, take the first available right_other (if any). Similarly for remaining_right_q and left_others.\n\nBut how to track which right_other are available. Since right_others is a list of indices, we can iterate through them and pair with the left_q's.\n\nFor example:\n\nremaining_left_q = [indices]\nremaining_right_others = [indices]\n\nfor i in range(len(remaining_left_q)):\n    if there are remaining_right_others:\n        pair remaining_left_q[i] with remaining_right_others[0]\n        remove that from remaining_right_others\n\nSimilarly for the remaining_right_q and left_others.\n\nBut this requires that we have access to the remaining_right_others and left_others as lists that can be modified. However, since we can process them in order, perhaps we can just iterate through them and pair as much as possible.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, after phase 2a, the remaining_left_q can be paired with the right_others. The number of possible pairs is min(len(remaining_left_q), len(right_others)). So, for each of the first min(...) elements, pair them.\n\nSame for the remaining_right_q and left_others.\n\nBut since the right_others are specific colors, but the left_q is '?', which can match any, so all of them can be paired.\n\nThus, for example, for the remaining_left_q and right_others:\n\ntake as many as possible pairs. For each pair, pair the left_q with a right_other.\n\nSimilarly for the remaining_right_q and left_others.\n\nThus, the code steps would be:\n\nAfter phase 2a:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[pair_count:]\nremaining_right_q = right_q[pair_count:]\n\n# Pair remaining_left_q with right_others\npair_count2 = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(right_others))\nfor i in range(pair_count2):\n    pair remaining_left_q[i] with right_others[i]\n\n# Now, the remaining_right_q can be paired with left_others\npair_count3 = min(len(remaining_right_q), len(left_others))\nfor i in range(pair_count3):\n    pair remaining_right_q[i] with left_others[i]\n\nBut how to track which elements in right_others and left_others are used. Because after pairing, we need to remove them from the lists.\n\nWait, but in this approach, we can process the lists in order, and just pair the first elements. For example, the right_others list is a list of indices. For the first pair_count2 elements in remaining_left_q, pair them with the first pair_count2 elements in right_others. Then, the remaining right_others after that can be ignored (as they can't be paired with anything else).\n\nSimilarly for the other pairing.\n\nBut this requires that the right_others list is processed in order, and that we can take the first elements.\n\nBut how to collect the right_others. For example, during phase 1, we have the left_unpaired and right_unpaired. Then, during phase 2a, we split into q and others. For example, right_others is the list of right boots in the right_unpaired that are not '?'. So, during phase 2b, we can process them in order.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used. Since we are just pairing them once, and not needing to track further, we can pair the first elements.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows.\n\nNow, the main challenge is to implement this in Python efficiently, given the constraints of n up to 150,000.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the data.\n\nFirst, read n, l, r.\n\nThen, for each left boot, track whether it's used. Similarly for right. But for efficiency, perhaps we can track for each index whether it's used. But for the initial phase, we can collect for each color, the list of indices.\n\nBut for phase 1:\n\nWe can create dictionaries for left and right, mapping color to list of indices.\n\nFor example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n    right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map, if c is not '?', and exists in right_color_map, then pair as many as possible.\n\nBut we need to process each color, and pair the left and right boots.\n\nBut how to track which ones have been used. For example, for color 'a', we can pair the first min(len(left_a), len(right_a)) boots.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used. Because once paired, they should not be considered again.\n\nSo, perhaps during phase 1, for each color c (not '?'), we process it as follows:\n\nfor c in left_color_map:\n    if c == '?':\n        continue\n    if c in right_color_map:\n        left_list = left_color_map[c]\n        right_list = right_color_map[c]\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n        # Now, remove the used ones from the left and right color maps?\n        # Or, mark them as used.\n\nBut this approach would not work, because the left and right color maps are being modified. Alternatively, perhaps we can create a used array for left and right boots.\n\nLet me think. We can have two arrays: left_used and right_used. Initially, all are False. When a boot is paired, we mark it as True.\n\nSo, during phase 1:\n\nfor each color c in left_color_map:\n    if c == '?':\n        continue\n    if c in right_color_map:\n        left_list = left_color_map[c]\n        right_list = right_color_map[c]\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n            if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n                add this pair to the result\n                left_used[left_idx] = True\n                right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, the left_color_map and right_color_map are built from the original strings. So, for example, if a left boot has color 'a', it's in left_color_map['a'], but once it's used in phase 1, it's marked as used and not considered again.\n\nBut this approach is not correct. Because for example, if a left boot is in left_color_map['a'], but after being paired, it's marked as used, but the left_color_map still contains all the indices. So, in subsequent processing of other colors, we might re-process the same boot again.\n\nWait, but during phase 1, we are processing each color once. For example, for color 'a', we pair as many as possible between left and right 'a's. Once that's done, the left and right boots that are used are marked as used, and during the processing of other colors, they are skipped.\n\nBut how to process all colors. For example, if we process color 'a', then color 'b', etc. But in this case, the left_used and right_used arrays prevent reusing the same boots.\n\nBut this approach would require that for each color, we process all possible pairs. However, this could be time-consuming for large n. But since each boot is processed once, the total time would be O(n).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during phase 1, for each color c (excluding '?'), we can collect the list of left and right boots not yet used. Then, pair as many as possible between them.\n\nBut how to collect the lists. For example, for color c, left_list is all indices in left_color_map[c] that are not used. Similarly for right_list.\n\nBut that would require checking for each element in the list whether it's used, which could be O(n) per color. Which would be O(n^2) in worst case. Not acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is better, but we need to build the left_color_map and right_color_map, and then process each color once, pairing as many as possible between left and right of that color, and then mark them as used.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, for color 'a', the left_list is all the left boots of color 'a', and right_list is all the right boots of color 'a'. We pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) of them. But once they are paired, they are marked as used. So, during phase 1, we can process each color once, and pair the first possible pairs.\n\nBut this approach may not pair all possible pairs. For example, suppose there are left boots with color 'a' and right boots with color 'a', but some are already used in other color pairings. But since we are processing each color once, and for each color, the left and right lists are built from the original string, not considering used status. So, this approach may not work.\n\nWait, no. Because the left_color_map and right_color_map are built based on the original strings. So, for example, if a left boot has color 'a', it's in left_color_map['a'], regardless of whether it's used. So, during phase 1, when we process color 'a', we may pair some of the left and right boots of 'a', but others may be paired later when processing other colors. Which is not correct.\n\nSo, this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative idea: during phase 1, for each color c (excluding '?'), process the color once, and pair as many as possible between left and right of that color. However, once a boot is paired, it's marked as used, so it's not considered again in other color pairings.\n\nBut how to collect the left and right boots of color c that are not yet used.\n\nSo, during phase 1, for each color c (excluding '?'):\n\nleft_candidates = [i for i in left_color_map[c] if not left_used[i]]\nright_candidates = [i for i in right_color_map[c] if not right_used[i]]\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_candidates), len(right_candidates))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    left_idx = left_candidates[i]\n    right_idx = right_candidates[i]\n    add to result\n    mark left_used[left_idx] = True\n    mark right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this approach would require, for each color, to generate the list of candidates, which is O(n) per color. Which could be O(n^2) in the worst case. For example, if all colors are unique, and for each color, we generate O(n) lists.\n\nWhich is not feasible for n=150,000.\n\nThus, this approach is not efficient enough.\n\nAlternative approach: during phase 1, for each color c (excluding '?'), we can process the left and right boots of color c in their original order, and pair them as long as they are not used.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think. For example, for color 'a', we have a list of left boots (in their original order). We can iterate through them, and for each left boot not used, try to find a right boot of color 'a' not used, and pair them.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently. For example, for each color c, we can have a pointer for left and right.\n\nFor example, for color c:\n\nleft_ptr = 0\nright_ptr = 0\n\nfor each left boot in left_color_map[c], in order:\n    if not used:\n        while right_ptr < len(right_color_map[c]) and right_used[right_color_map[c][right_ptr]]:\n            right_ptr += 1\n        if right_ptr < len(right_color_map[c]):\n            pair left boot with right_color_map[c][right_ptr]\n            mark both as used\n            right_ptr += 1\n\nThis way, for each color, we process the left and right boots in order, and pair them as long as possible.\n\nThis approach would be O(n) overall, because each boot is processed once.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as arrays of False.\n\nFor each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map (excluding '?'):\n\n    left_list = left_color_map[c]\n    right_list = right_color_map[c]\n\n    left_ptr = 0\n    right_ptr = 0\n\n    while left_ptr < len(left_list) and right_ptr < len(right_list):\n        left_idx = left_list[left_ptr]\n        if left_used[left_idx]:\n            left_ptr += 1\n            continue\n        right_idx = right_list[right_ptr]\n        if right_used[right_idx]:\n            right_ptr += 1\n            continue\n        # pair them\n        add to result\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n        left_ptr += 1\n        right_ptr += 1\n\nThis way, for each color c, we pair as many as possible between left and right boots of color c, skipping those already used.\n\nBut how to get all colors. For example, we need to process all colors that are present in either left or right. But perhaps we can iterate over all possible colors (from 'a' to 'z') and process them.\n\nBut since the colors are lowercase letters, there are only 26 possible letters. So, this is manageable.\n\nSo, for phase 1, we can loop through each character from 'a' to 'z', and process each color.\n\nThis way, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = list of left boots with color c (original order)\n    right_list = list of right boots with color c (original order)\n\n    left_ptr = 0\n    right_ptr = 0\n\n    while left_ptr < len(left_list) and right_ptr < len(right_list):\n        left_idx = left_list[left_ptr]\n        if left_used[left_idx]:\n            left_ptr += 1\n            continue\n        right_idx = right_list[right_ptr]\n        if right_used[right_idx]:\n            right_ptr += 1\n            continue\n        # pair them\n        add to result\n        mark used\n        left_ptr += 1\n        right_ptr += 1\n\nThis is O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce phase 1 is done, we collect all the left and right boots that are not used.\n\nThen, phase 2a to 2c as discussed earlier.\n\nSo, after phase 1, the left_used and right_used arrays indicate which boots are used. Then, we can collect the left_unpaired and right_unpaired as:\n\nleft_unpaired = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i]]\nright_unpaired = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i]]\n\nThen, split these into q and others.\n\nOnce we have left_unpaired and right_unpaired, we can process phase 2a, 2b, 2c as described.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nImplementing phase 1:\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as lists of booleans.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = list of indices where l[i] == c\n    right_list = list of indices where r[i] == c\n\n    left_ptr = 0\n    right_ptr = 0\n\n    while left_ptr < len(left",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots based on their colors. Each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'), which can match any other color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Phase 1 - Specific Color Pairing**: First, pair all left boots with specific colors that have matching right boots of the same color. This is done by iterating through each possible color (from 'a' to 'z') and pairing as many as possible between left and right boots of that color.\n\n2. **Phase 2 - Indefinite Color Pairing**: After handling specific color pairs, we handle the remaining boots which include those with indefinite colors ('?'). We first pair the remaining indefinite left boots with remaining indefinite right boots. Then, we pair any remaining indefinite left boots with specific right boots and vice versa.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    left_used = [False] * n\n    right_used = [False] * n\n    result = []\n\n    # Precompute lists for each color\n    left_color = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_color[l[i]].append(i)\n        right_color[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    # Phase 1: Pair specific colors\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        left_list = left_color.get(c, [])\n        right_list = right_color.get(c, [])\n        left_ptr = 0\n        right_ptr = 0\n        while left_ptr < len(left_list) and right_ptr < len(right_list):\n            left_idx = left_list[left_ptr]\n            if left_used[left_idx]:\n                left_ptr += 1\n                continue\n            right_idx = right_list[right_ptr]\n            if right_used[right_idx]:\n                right_ptr += 1\n                continue\n            # Pair them\n            result.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n            left_used[left_idx] = True\n            right_used[right_idx] = True\n            left_ptr += 1\n            right_ptr += 1\n\n    # Collect unpaired left and right boots\n    left_unpaired = []\n    right_unpaired = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not left_used[i]:\n            left_unpaired.append(i)\n        if not right_used[i]:\n            right_unpaired.append(i)\n\n    # Split into q and others\n    left_q = []\n    left_others = []\n    for i in left_unpaired:\n        if l[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_others.append(i)\n    right_q = []\n    right_others = []\n    for i in right_unpaired:\n        if r[i] == '?':\n            right_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            right_others.append(i)\n\n    # Phase 2a: Pair left_q with right_q\n    min_q = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(min_q):\n        result.append((left_q[i] + 1, right_q[i] + 1))\n    # Remaining left_q and right_q after phase 2a\n    remaining_left_q = left_q[min_q:]\n    remaining_right_q = right_q[min_q:]\n\n    # Phase 2b: Pair remaining_left_q with right_others\n    min_b = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(right_others))\n    for i in range(min_b):\n        result.append((remaining_left_q[i] + 1, right_others[i] + 1))\n\n    # Phase 2c: Pair remaining_right_q with left_others\n    min_c = min(len(remaining_right_q), len(left_others))\n    for i in range(min_c):\n        result.append((left_others[i] + 1, remaining_right_q[i] + 1))\n\n    print(len(result))\n    for pair in result:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Phase 1**: We iterate through each possible color (from 'a' to 'z') and pair left and right boots of the same color.
