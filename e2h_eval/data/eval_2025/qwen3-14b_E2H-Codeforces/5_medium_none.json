Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which is a lowercase letter or a question mark. The goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nCompatibility rules: two specific colors are compatible if they are the same. A question mark can be compatible with any color, including another question mark. So, for example, a '?' on left and 'a' on right is okay. Also, two '?'s are okay.\n\nThe output needs to be the maximum number of such pairs, followed by their indices. Each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find the maximum possible pairs. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. For each left boot and right boot, we can pair them if their colors are compatible. But since we want maximum pairs, it's a matching problem. However, with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like maximum bipartite matching (like using Hungarian algorithm) would be way too slow. So we need a greedy approach here.\n\nSo, what's the optimal way to pair them?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. The question marks can be used as wildcards. So perhaps we can first pair the specific colors, then use the question marks.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me consider that each left boot can be matched with a right boot. Let's think of the following approach:\n\n- For each color (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. For each color c, the number of pairs possible here is the minimum of left[c] and right[c]. Then, after pairing those, the remaining left and right boots (with either color or '?') can be paired with each other using the question marks.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used to pair with any. So maybe the optimal approach is:\n\nFirst, pair all the non-question marks that can be matched directly. Then, use the remaining question marks to pair with the remaining non-question marks (if any) and also with each other.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nWe can first process all the pairs where both are not '?', and their colors match. For example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a', pair them. Then, for the remaining boots, which have either '?' or some color that doesn't have a match, we can use the '?' to pair with others.\n\nBut how to track which ones are already used?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as two parts:\n\nPart 1: Pairing specific colors (non-?) with each other. For example, for each color c, we can pair as many left c's with right c's as possible.\n\nPart 2: Pairing the remaining boots (which include ? and any leftover specific colors) using the ? as wildcards.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. Count the number of left boots for each color (excluding ?), and same for right boots. For each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_c, right_c). Then, subtract those from left and right counts.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that we have to pair specific boots, not just counts. Because each boot can be used once.\n\nBut perhaps, for the first part, we can collect all left boots with color c and right boots with color c, and pair them. However, since the order might affect the overall maximum, perhaps we need to process this in a way that maximizes the pairs.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, for each color c (not ?), we can pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for color c, the number of pairs is min( number of left c's, number of right c's ). Once those are paired, we can subtract those from the counts.\n\nThen, the remaining left and right boots are those with color ? or those that couldn't be paired in the first step.\n\nNow, for the second part, we can pair the remaining left ? with the remaining right ? and the remaining non-? boots.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: after the first step, the remaining left boots are:\n\n- Those with color ?, or\n\n- Those with color c where the number of left c's was more than right c's.\n\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nSo, for the second part, the remaining left and right boots can be paired using the ?.\n\nLet me think of the remaining left and right boots. Let's collect all the left boots that are not yet paired (they could be ? or specific colors) and same for right. Now, the idea is to pair them as follows:\n\n- For each left boot that is not ?, try to pair it with a right boot that is ?.\n\n- For each right boot that is not ?, try to pair it with a left boot that is ?.\n\n- Then, pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter the first part (pairing specific colors), we have:\n\nleft_remaining: list of left boots that are not yet paired. These can be either '?' or specific colors that couldn't be matched.\n\nright_remaining: same for right boots.\n\nNow, for the second part:\n\nWe can first pair all left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that are '?'.\n\nSimilarly, pair all right boots with specific colors with left boots that are '?'.\n\nThen, pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me think:\n\nWe can collect all the left boots that are not ? and not paired yet (call them left_fixed), and all the right boots that are not ? and not paired yet (right_fixed).\n\nFor each left_fixed boot, we can pair it with any right ? boot. Similarly, for each right_fixed boot, pair with any left ? boot.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining ? boots can be paired with each other.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs would be:\n\nnumber of pairs from part1 + (number of left_fixed + number of right_fixed) ??? No, not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the steps:\n\nSuppose after part1, we have:\n\nleft_fixed = number of left boots with specific colors not yet paired.\n\nright_fixed = number of right boots with specific colors not yet paired.\n\nleft_question = number of left ? not yet paired.\n\nright_question = number of right ? not yet paired.\n\nNow, for each left_fixed (specific color), we can pair with a right_question. Similarly for each right_fixed with left_question.\n\nSo, the number of such pairs would be min( left_fixed, right_question ) + min( right_fixed, left_question )\n\nBut after that, the remaining left_question and right_question would be (left_question - ...) and (right_question - ...). But since those are ?s, they can be paired with each other. The number of such pairs is min( left_question_remaining, right_question_remaining )\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet me take the example where after part1, there are:\n\nleft_fixed = x, right_fixed = y, left_q = a, right_q = b.\n\nThen, first, pair as many left_fixed with right_q as possible. Let's say we can pair x pairs (if x <= b). Then, after that, the remaining right_q is b - x. Then, pair right_fixed (y) with left_q (a). Suppose y <= a, then we pair y pairs, and left_q becomes a - y. Then, the remaining left_q and right_q are (a - y) and (b - x). Then, the number of pairs between them is min(a - y, b - x).\n\nBut wait, the total pairs from this would be x + y + min( ... )\n\nBut what if x is larger than b? For example, left_fixed is 5, right_q is 3. Then, we can pair 3 pairs of left_fixed with right_q. Then, left_fixed is 5 - 3 = 2. Then, for the right_fixed and left_q, suppose right_fixed is 1, left_q is 4. Then, pair 1 of right_fixed with left_q, and then left_q is 3. Then, the remaining left_fixed (2) can't be paired with anything else, because they are fixed and the right_q is already used. Wait, no. Wait, after pairing left_fixed with right_q and right_fixed with left_q, the remaining left_fixed and right_fixed can't be paired with anything else. Because they are specific colors and the other side has only ?s that are already used. So, the remaining left_fixed and right_fixed can't be paired. So, the total pairs from this part would be:\n\nmin(left_fixed, right_q) + min(right_fixed, left_q) + min( (left_q - min(right_fixed, left_q)), (right_q - min(left_fixed, right_q)) )) ?\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because after pairing left_fixed with right_q, and right_fixed with left_q, the remaining left_q and right_q are (a - min(right_fixed, left_q)) and (b - min(left_fixed, right_q))? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible pairs in this second phase is:\n\nTake all left_fixed and right_fixed and pair them with the ?s. Then, pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nWe can pair all left_fixed with right_q, and all right_fixed with left_q, as much as possible. Then, the remaining ?s can be paired between left and right.\n\nSo, the total pairs in this phase would be:\n\nnumber of left_fixed paired with right_q: let's say l = min(left_fixed, right_q)\n\nnumber of right_fixed paired with left_q: r = min(right_fixed, left_q)\n\nthen, after that, the remaining left_q is (left_q - r), and the remaining right_q is (right_q - l).\n\nThen, the number of pairs between these remaining ?s is min( (left_q - r), (right_q - l) )\n\nSo, the total pairs in this phase is l + r + min( ... )\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBut how do I track which specific boots are being paired?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because in practice, we need to track which left and right boots are available for pairing.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFirst, collect all the left and right boots, and for each, track their positions and their colors.\n\nThen, for the first part, pair all the specific colors (non-?) between left and right.\n\nHow to do this?\n\nFor example, for each color c (excluding '?'), collect all left boots with color c, and all right boots with color c. Then, pair them as much as possible. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, pair 3 of them.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nMaybe:\n\nWe can create dictionaries for left and right, mapping color to a list of indices (positions). For example, left_dict['a'] is a list of indices where the left boot has color 'a'.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_dict and right_dict, we can pair as many as possible.\n\nBut since the same color can be present in both, and the order may matter, perhaps we can process each color c (excluding '?') and pair the left and right boots of that color.\n\nBut how to do this in code efficiently?\n\nOnce that's done, we can collect the pairs for that.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those that were not paired in the first step), we can proceed to the second phase.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already paired?\n\nSo, perhaps we can have two arrays, used_left and used_right, which are boolean arrays indicating whether a boot is already used.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, that's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as all False.\n\nFirst, for each color c (not '?'), process all left and right boots of that color.\n\nFor each color c:\n\n   get all left indices with color c and not used.\n\n   get all right indices with color c and not used.\n\n   pair as many as possible. For example, take the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs.\n\n   for each pair, mark them as used and add to the result.\n\nBut how to collect these lists?\n\nWe can pre-process for each color, the list of left and right indices.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can iterate through each color in the left and right, but that's O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, for the first step, we can loop through each left boot and check if it's not used and is not a '?'. Then, for each such left boot, find a right boot with the same color that's not used. But that might be O(n^2) in worst case.\n\nWait, but that's not feasible for n up to 1.5e5.\n\nSo, the better approach is to pre-process for each color, the list of left and right indices.\n\nFor example:\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map, we can pair the left and right boots of that color.\n\nBut we need to process each color once.\n\nBut how to avoid processing the same color multiple times?\n\nFor example, for color 'a', if there are left and right boots, process them once.\n\nSo, for each color c in the set of all colors present in left and right (excluding '?'), we can process.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, for each color in left_color_map:\n\n   if the color is present in right_color_map:\n\n       then, take the minimum of the lengths of left and right lists for this color, and pair them.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For example, for color c, left_list = left_color_map[c], right_list = right_color_map[c].\n\nWe can pair the first k elements of left_list with the first k elements of right_list, where k is the minimum of the two lengths.\n\nBut how to track which ones are already used? Because, once we pair them, they are marked as used.\n\nWait, but during this first phase, we are processing all pairs of same color. So, for example, for each color c, we can pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut if we process all colors, and for each color, pair the left and right boots of that color, then this would be O(n) time.\n\nSo, here's the code outline:\n\nused_left = [False]*n\n\nused_right = [False]*n\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in all colors except '?':\n\n    if c is not in left_color_map or c not in right_color_map:\n\n        continue\n\n    left_list = left_color_map[c]\n\n    right_list = right_color_map[c]\n\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(k):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, this would pair the first k elements of each list. However, the order in which we process the colors may affect the total number of pairs. But since we are trying to pair as many as possible for each color, this approach should be correct.\n\nBut how to collect all the colors that are present in either left or right? Well, perhaps we can collect all unique colors in the left and right (excluding '?'), but that's not necessary. Because, for example, if a color exists in left but not in right, then nothing is done for that color.\n\nOnce this first phase is done, then we can move to the second phase, which involves pairing the remaining boots with '?'.\n\nSo, for the second phase:\n\nWe have to collect all left boots that are not used and have color '?', and all right boots that are not used and have color '?'.\n\nAdditionally, there may be some left boots that are not used and have specific colors (but their corresponding right boots were not available in the first phase). Similarly for right boots.\n\nSo, for the second phase, we need to pair:\n\n- Left boots with specific colors (not used) with right boots with '?'\n\n- Right boots with specific colors (not used) with left boots with '?'\n\n- Then, pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nCollect all left boots that are not used and are '?': left_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nCollect all right boots that are not used and are '?': right_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nAlso, collect all left boots that are not used and are not '?': left_fixed = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly, right_fixed = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nNow, for the left_fixed and right_fixed, we need to pair them with the opposite side's '?'.\n\nSo, for each left_fixed boot, we can pair it with a right_q boot. Similarly for each right_fixed boot with left_q.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nWe can pair as follows:\n\nFor each left_fixed boot, if there are any right_q boots not yet used, pair them.\n\nSame for right_fixed.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nWe can take the left_fixed list and the right_q list, and pair them as much as possible. Then, take the right_fixed list and the left_q list, and pair as much as possible. Then, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the code:\n\nleft_fixed = [i for i in ... ]\n\nright_fixed = [i for i in ... ]\n\nleft_q = [i for i in ... ]\n\nright_q = [i for i in ... ]\n\nThen:\n\n# Pair left_fixed with right_q\n\nfor i in range( min( len(left_fixed), len(right_q) ) ):\n\n    left_idx = left_fixed[i]\n\n    right_idx = right_q[i]\n\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n# Then, pair right_fixed with left_q\n\nfor i in range( min( len(right_fixed), len(left_q) ) ):\n\n    right_idx = right_fixed[i]\n\n    left_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n# Then, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not used_left[i]]\n\nremaining_right_q = [i for i in right_q if not used_right[i]]\n\nk = min( len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q) )\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n    left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n\n    right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, the code above for left_fixed and right_q may not be correct. Because, when you take left_fixed and right_q, you need to pair each left_fixed with a right_q. However, the left_fixed list is built as all the left boots that are not used and have non-? color. Similarly for right_q.\n\nBut when you pair them, you have to make sure that the right_q is not used. But in the code above, the right_q list is built before any pairing, so when you loop through the first min(...) elements, those are the ones not yet used.\n\nBut after pairing, the used flags are set. So, the remaining left_fixed and right_q are not processed again.\n\nBut this approach may not work, because the left_fixed list is built once, and the right_q list is built once. However, during the pairing, some elements of right_q may be used, so the remaining elements are not considered. However, the code as written would pair the first min(...) elements of left_fixed and right_q.\n\nBut this is correct, because the left_fixed and right_q lists are built before any pairing. So, the code would pair as many as possible between them.\n\nBut the problem is that the left_fixed and right_q lists are not ordered in any particular way. For example, if there are 5 left_fixed and 3 right_q, then the code pairs the first 3 left_fixed with the first 3 right_q. That's acceptable, since any pairing is allowed.\n\nSo, this approach seems correct.\n\nBut how to collect these lists efficiently?\n\nIn Python, for large n (up to 1.5e5), building these lists may take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for the first phase, the code for collecting the left and right color maps may be O(n) time.\n\nSo, putting this together, the steps are:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as False arrays.\n\nCreate left_color_map and right_color_map as defaultdict(list) for colors other than '?'.\n\nFor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   if l[i] != '?', add i to left_color_map[l[i]]\n\n   if r[i] != '?', add i to right_color_map[r[i]]\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map:\n\n   if c is in right_color_map:\n\n       left_list = left_color_map[c]\n\n       right_list = right_color_map[c]\n\n       k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n       for i in 0..k-1:\n\n           pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n           mark used_left and used_right as True.\n\nThen, collect all left_fixed, right_fixed, left_q, right_q.\n\nThen, pair left_fixed with right_q as much as possible.\n\nThen, pair right_fixed with left_q as much as possible.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q with right_q.\n\nBut how to collect left_fixed, etc.?\n\nWait, after the first phase, some of the left and right boots are already used. So, for the second phase:\n\nleft_fixed = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nright_fixed = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nBut this is O(n) time for each of these steps.\n\nOnce these lists are built, proceed as above.\n\nBut in Python, for n=1.5e5, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem is that the code may not pair all possible pairs. For example, there may be cases where pairing left_fixed with right_q and then right_fixed with left_q is not optimal. But given that the code pairs as much as possible, this approach should be optimal.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause the first phase pairs all possible same-color pairs. Then, the second phase uses the ?s to pair with the remaining fixed colors, and then pairs the remaining ?s.\n\nThis should maximize the number of pairs.\n\nBut let's test with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=10\n\nl = codeforces\n\nr = dodivthree\n\nBut the sample output is 5.\n\nBut perhaps the code would handle that.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where pairing left_fixed with right_q and then right_fixed with left_q is not the best approach. For example, if there are more left_fixed than right_q, but some of the right_fixed can be paired with left_q.\n\nBut the code pairs left_fixed with right_q first, then right_fixed with left_q.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nSuppose left_fixed has 2 elements, right_q has 1 element, right_fixed has 1 element, left_q has 2 elements.\n\nPairing left_fixed with right_q: 1 pair. Then, right_fixed with left_q: 1 pair. Then, remaining left_q is 1, right_q is 0. So total is 2 pairs. Which is optimal.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example:\n\nleft_fixed has 1, right_q has 1, right_fixed has 1, left_q has 1.\n\nPairing left_fixed with right_q: 1 pair. Then, right_fixed with left_q: 1 pair. Total 2 pairs. Which is optimal.\n\nBut if we had paired right_fixed with left_q first, then left_fixed with right_q, same result.\n\nSo the order is not important here.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut how to collect the color maps?\n\nIn Python, for the first phase, we can do:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn = int(input())\n\nl = input().strip()\n\nr = input().strip()\n\nused_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n\n    if r[i] != '?':\n\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color in left_color_map:\n\nBut we need to process all colors that are present in both left and right.\n\nBut how to get all colors that are in left_color_map and right_color_map?\n\nBut perhaps, for each color in left_color_map:\n\n   if the color is in right_color_map:\n\n       process.\n\nBut in Python, for each key in left_color_map:\n\nfor c in left_color_map:\n\n    if c in right_color_map:\n\n        left_list = left_color_map[c]\n\n        right_list = right_color_map[c]\n\n        k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n        for i in range(k):\n\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n            pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, this may not be correct. Because, for example, if a color is present in both left and right, but the code processes it once. But in this approach, for each color in left_color_map, we check if it's in right_color_map. So, for example, color 'a' is in left and right, and processed once. But if there are multiple entries in left_color_map and right_color_map for the same color, but that's handled by the code.\n\nBut this approach may miss colors that are in right_color_map but not in left_color_map. But since we are checking for colors in left_color_map, and processing only those that are also in right_color_map, that's okay. Because for those colors that are in right but not in left, nothing is done. Which is correct.\n\nBut this approach will process each color once. However, what if the same color is present in both left and right, but the code processes it once, but after that, there are still some left and right boots of that color that are not used. For example, if the left list is longer than the right list. But in that case, during the first phase, the code pairs as many as possible, and the remaining left boots of that color are left in the left_fixed list, which are processed in the second phase.\n\nYes.\n\nBut the code as written would process each color once, but what if the same color appears in left and right again? Well, no, because the left_color_map and right_color_map are built once, and for each color in left_color_map, we process once. So, for example, if there are multiple entries for a color, but the code is processing all of them once.\n\nBut in reality, the code is processing all the left and right boots of color c in the first phase, and pairing them as much as possible.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining ones are handled in the second phase.\n\nNow, after that, collect the four lists: left_fixed, right_fixed, left_q, right_q.\n\nThen, pair them as per the steps.\n\nBut in code:\n\nleft_fixed = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nright_fixed = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, pair left_fixed with right_q:\n\nfor i in range( min( len(left_fixed), len(right_q) ) ):\n\n    left_idx = left_fixed[i]\n\n    right_idx = right_q[i]\n\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for the right_fixed and left_q:\n\nfor i in range( min( len(right_fixed), len(left_q) ) ):\n\n    right_idx = right_fixed[i]\n\n    left_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not used_left[i]]\n\nremaining_right_q = [i for i in right_q if not used_right[i]]\n\nk = min( len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q) )\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n    left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n\n    right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, the code for the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q may not be needed. Because, after pairing left_fixed with right_q and right_fixed with left_q, the left_q and right_q lists have some elements that are already used. So, perhaps the code can be optimized by using pointers instead of creating new lists.\n\nBut for code simplicity, perhaps it's better to create new lists.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, creating these lists may be time-consuming. However, given that the code is O(n) time, it's acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about the example where after pairing left_fixed with right_q, some elements in right_q are already used, so when we create the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q, we need to check which ones are not used.\n\nBut in the code above, the left_q and right_q are built before any of the pairing steps. So, for example, the left_q list contains all the left boots that are not used and are '?'. Then, during the pairing of left_fixed with right_q, some elements in right_q are marked as used. So, the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q would need to be filtered again. However, the code above is not doing that correctly. Because the left_q and right_q lists are built once, and the code uses them again for the remaining steps. But during the first pairing steps, some elements in right_q are marked as used. So, when building the remaining_right_q, we need to check which elements in the original right_q list are not used.\n\nBut in the code above, the code for remaining_left_q is [i for i in left_q if not used_left[i]], which is correct. Because left_q is the list of left boots that are '?', not used before the second phase. However, during the pairing of left_fixed with right_q, some of the right_q elements are marked as used, but the left_q elements are not modified. So, in the next step, when pairing right_fixed with left_q, the left_q elements are still available (since they were not used in the first step). So, the code for the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be optimized. For example, during the pairing of left_fixed with right_q, we can iterate through the right_q list and mark them as used. Then, for the next steps, the remaining elements are those not used.\n\nBut regardless, the code as written should work.\n\nNow, testing this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut the sample outputs are given for different inputs. However, the code needs to handle all cases.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All boots are '?'. Then, the maximum number of pairs is n. Each left can be paired with a right. The code would pair them in the third phase.\n\nCase 2: All left are 'a', all right are 'a'. Then, first phase pairs all, and the rest is zero.\n\nCase 3: Left has some 'a's, right has some 'a's and some '?'. Then, first phase pairs the 'a's, and then the remaining '?'s can be paired.\n\nAnother case: left has 'a' and '?', right has 'a' and '?'. First phase pairs the 'a's. Then, the '?'s can be paired.\n\nAnother case: left has 'a', right has '?'. Then, in the second phase, the left_fixed is ['a'], right_q is ['?'], which is paired.\n\nAnother case: left has '?', right has 'a'. Then, in the second phase, right_fixed is ['a'], left_q is ['?'], which is paired.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in code, the first phase processes each color in left_color_map. However, for example, if a color is present in both left and right, but the code processes it once. But in the code, for each color in left_color_map, we check if it is in right_color_map. So, if the color is in both, then process.\n\nBut what if the color is in right_color_map but not in left_color_map? Then, nothing is done. Which is correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nThen, process the first phase.\n\nThen, collect the four lists.\n\nThen, process the second phase.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut the problem is that the code for the first phase may not pair all possible same-color pairs. For example, if the same color is present in both left and right, but the code processes it once, but in the left_color_map and right_color_map, the lists are stored. However, the code pairs the first k elements of each list. But that's correct, because any pairing is allowed.\n\nBut what if the same color is processed again? No, because the code loops through each color in left_color_map once.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    # Read the next line? Wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line contains l.\n\nThird line contains r.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem statement, there are multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut this is probably a mistake in the problem description. Because in the actual problem, the input is one test case. However, the sample outputs show multiple outputs, which suggests that the problem may have multiple test cases, but the original problem statement says that the input is for a single test case.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains l.\n\nThe third line contains r.\n\nSo, the code should read three lines: n, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem seems to have multiple test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut this is probably a formatting error. For example, perhaps the user intended to show multiple test cases, but in reality, the code must read one test case per input.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code should read one test case. So, the code should read n, l, r.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is a list of multiple test cases. However, the code must process one test case at a time. So, the code must read n, then l, then r.\n\nBut the sample outputs also have multiple outputs. So, perhaps the problem has multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains l.\n\nThe third line contains r.\n\nSo, the code should read three lines: n, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. For example, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input and output are given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbam",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors. The colors can be specific lowercase letters or question marks ('?'), which act as wildcards that can pair with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Color Matching for Specific Colors**: First, we pair left boots with specific colors with right boots of the same specific color. This is done by maintaining mappings of indices for each color on both left and right sides.\n2. **Wildcard Pairing**: After handling specific color pairs, we handle the remaining boots using wildcard ('?') characters.
