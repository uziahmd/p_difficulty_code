Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from the first two lines (guest and host), they should exactly match the letters in the third line (the pile). If there are any extra letters in the pile or missing letters, then the answer is NO.\n\nSo, the approach here is to check if the combined letters of the first two strings are exactly equal to the letters in the third string. How can I do that?\n\nHmm. One way is to count the frequency of each character in the first two strings combined, and compare that with the frequency in the third string. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for example, if the guest is \"SANTA\" and host is \"CLAUZ\", then combining their letters gives S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, Z. Then the pile should have exactly those letters. So if the pile is \"SANTACL... etc.\" but with the same counts.\n\nSo how to implement this in Python?\n\nWell, I can use the collections.Counter class. Because Counter allows us to count the occurrences of each character in a string. Then, if I create a Counter for the concatenation of the first two strings, and another Counter for the third string, and compare them, if they are equal, then output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each element. So if the counts are the same, the order doesn't matter.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read three lines from input. Let's call them guest, host, pile.\n\n2. Combine guest and host into a single string, say combined = guest + host.\n\n3. Create a Counter for combined and a Counter for pile.\n\n4. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length is different from the pile's length? For example, if the combined length is 10 and the pile is 9 letters, then obviously it's impossible. But the Counter comparison would automatically catch that, since the counts would differ. So that's handled automatically.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nThen, read the three lines. But how to read them? Because the input is given as three lines. So in Python, perhaps:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, for example the first case:\n\nInput lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count the letters. Let me see:\n\nBut the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Wait, maybe the counts are same.\n\nBut the code would handle that.\n\nBut let me test for the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nguest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' — let's count letters.\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet me count letters in combined:\n\nS: let's see:\n\nIn guest: SANTACLAUS — S appears once, A appears 3 times (S A N T A C L A U S — yes, A is in positions 2, 5, 7?), then host is D E D M O R O Z — D appears twice, E once, M once, O twice, R once, Z once.\n\nSo combined letters:\n\nLetters from guest: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S → S: 2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\nHost: D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nCombined counts: adding all these.\n\nNow the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nLet me count letters here. Let's see:\n\nBreaking down the pile string: S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S.\n\nLet me count each letter:\n\nS: 2 (positions 0 and 18?)\n\nA: 3 (positions 1, 4, 16)\n\nN: 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the character counts of the combined names match exactly with the character counts of the pile of letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Character Counting**: Use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string of the guest and host names and the pile of letters.\n3. **Comparison**: Compare the character counts of the combined names with the character counts of the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure that we handle any potential leading or trailing whitespace correctly.\n2. **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to form the combined string.\n3. **Character Counting**: Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile of letters.\n4. **Comparison**: By comparing the two counters, we check if the combined string and the pile have the same characters with the same frequencies. If they do, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of characters required, leveraging the properties of the `Counter` class for simplicity and performance.",
