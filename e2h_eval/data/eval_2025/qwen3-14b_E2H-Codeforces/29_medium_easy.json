Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle the substitutions efficiently, especially since directly applying each substitution step-by-step could be computationally expensive if done naively, especially with large input sizes.\n\nLet me think. The initial string is s, and each query replaces all occurrences of a digit di with ti. But if we process each query by replacing every occurrence in the current string, that could be O(n * len(s)) time, which might not be efficient for large n and large s. For example, if the original string is 1e5 characters and there are 1e5 queries, each replacing a digit, then this approach would be O(1e10), which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Let's think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. However, substitutions are applied in order, and each query affects all instances of di in the current string. So, if we have multiple substitutions for the same digit, later substitutions would override previous ones. Wait, no. Because each query replaces all instances of di in the current string. So, for example, if first we replace 2 with 'a', then replace 2 with 'b', but since after the first substitution, there are no 2s left (they were replaced by 'a'), the second substitution would have no effect. But if the first substitution was replacing 2 with 'a', and the second is replacing 'a' with something else? Wait no, the queries are about replacing digits. The di in each query is a single digit. So, each query is about replacing a digit (like 2) with some string. So, if you have a query that replaces 2 with 'a', then another query that replaces 2 with 'b', then the second query will replace all existing 2s in the current string. But after the first substitution, there are no 2s left. So the second substitution would do nothing. However, if the first substitution replaces 2 with 'a', then a query replacing 'a' with something else isn't possible because the queries are only about digits. So the problem is that each substitution is for a digit, and the replacement can be any string (including empty).\n\nSo, the key here is that substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution affects the current state of the string. But if we try to model the entire string after each substitution, it's going to be too slow for large inputs.\n\nAlternative approach: think in terms of building a mapping for each digit, which represents what it should be replaced with. However, since substitutions can be applied in sequence, and each substitution can affect the current mappings, perhaps we can track for each digit, what it expands to, considering all previous substitutions.\n\nWait, but substitutions are applied in order. For example, suppose we have a substitution for digit d1, then later a substitution for d2. If d1 is replaced by a string containing d2, then when the substitution for d2 is processed, those instances of d2 in the expansion of d1 will be replaced. However, if we have a substitution for d1 first, then for d2, then for d1 again, then the later substitution for d1 would replace any existing d1's in the string, including those generated by previous substitutions.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like we need to track for each digit, the current expansion. But if we have a substitution that replaces a digit d with some string, then for any subsequent substitution, any occurrence of d in the expansion of other digits would be replaced as well.\n\nWait, but the problem is that each substitution replaces all instances of di in the current string. So, when processing a substitution, the current string is modified by replacing all instances of di with ti. However, if we model the substitutions as a series of transformations, perhaps we can represent the final string as a result of expanding each original character through all substitutions.\n\nBut how can we model that? For example, suppose we have the original string s. Each character in s is a digit. Each substitution for a digit di changes what that digit is replaced with. However, if a substitution is made for a digit di, then any occurrence of di in the current string is replaced with ti. But when you have substitutions that happen later, they can affect the expansion of earlier substitutions.\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model the substitutions in reverse order. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet's think of the substitutions as a series of replacements. Suppose we have a mapping for each digit, which tells us what it is currently replaced with. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each query, when we have a substitution di → ti, we need to update the mapping for di to be ti. However, when we do that, any existing expansions that included di would now be replaced with ti. But how do we track that?\n\nWait, but if we process substitutions in order, and for each digit, track what it's currently expanded to, then when we process a substitution di → ti, we can update the mapping for di to ti. However, this would not account for the fact that previous expansions may have included di. For example, suppose initially, digit '2' is mapped to '2'. Then, a substitution replaces '2' with '3', so now '2' maps to '3'. Then, a substitution replaces '3' with '4'. Now, when we look at the original '2's, they would expand to '3', which then expands to '4'. But if we process substitutions in the order they are given, and for each substitution, we update the mapping, then how do we handle the expansion of previous mappings?\n\nAh, here's the key insight: when a substitution is performed, it replaces all instances of di in the current string. But if we model the substitutions as a mapping, where each digit is replaced by its current expansion, then the problem is that when we perform a substitution for di, we need to replace all instances of di in the current string, which includes any expansions that were previously done. However, if we track for each digit what it's currently expanded to, then when we process a substitution di → ti, we need to update the mapping for di to ti. However, any previous expansions that included di would now be replaced with ti. But how can we track that?\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution replaces all instances of di in the current string. So, if the current string has some characters that were generated by previous substitutions, including di, then those would be replaced. But if we model the substitutions as a mapping, then each time a substitution is done, the mapping for di is updated. However, when we process the substitution, the current string is being modified. But if we don't track the actual string, but instead track for each digit, the expansion that it would undergo, then perhaps we can compute the final expansion of each original digit.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think of the substitutions as building a tree of expansions. For example, each digit starts with itself. When a substitution is made for digit d, it's replaced with ti. However, any future substitutions for digits that appear in ti would affect the expansion of d. But if we track for each digit, the current expansion string, then when a substitution is made, we can update the expansion of di to be ti, but also, any other digits that have expansions that include di would need to be updated. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the substitutions as being applied in reverse order. Let me think. Suppose we process the substitutions in reverse order. For example, the last substitution is the first one we process. But I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAnother approach: Since each substitution replaces all occurrences of di in the current string, the order of substitutions matters. However, if we can find for each original digit in the initial string, what it would expand to after all substitutions, then we can compute the final string by expanding each original character and concatenating them.\n\nBut how to compute that expansion for each original digit?\n\nLet's consider that each substitution for a digit di affects the expansion of di. However, if a substitution is made for di later, then any previous expansions of di would be overwritten. For example:\n\nOriginal mapping: d → d.\n\nSubstitution 1: d → a.\n\nNow, the expansion of d is a.\n\nSubstitution 2: a → b.\n\nBut since substitution 2 is for a digit (a is not a digit, but the substitution is for a digit. Wait, no. The substitution is for a digit di. So the substitution is for a digit, like 2 → something. So the ti can contain any digits (including digits that have been substituted before). So, for example, if we have substitution 2 → 3, then substitution 3 → 4. Then, the original 2 would expand to 3, which then expands to 4. But how do we track that?\n\nAh, here's the key: when a substitution is made for a digit di, it replaces all instances of di in the current string. So, if a substitution is made for di, then in the current string, any occurrence of di is replaced with ti. But ti can contain digits that may be substituted later. However, when we process the substitutions in order, each substitution affects the current string. Therefore, the expansion of the original digits depends on the order of substitutions.\n\nBut trying to model this directly is difficult. However, perhaps we can track for each digit, what it expands to after all substitutions. Let's think recursively. For example, suppose we have a function expand(d) that returns the string that d would expand to after all substitutions. Initially, expand(d) = d. When a substitution is made for di → ti, then expand(di) is set to ti. However, when we process this substitution, any previous expansions that included di would now have their expansions changed. Wait, but that's not the case. Because the substitution replaces all occurrences of di in the current string. So, if the current string has some digits that were generated by previous expansions, and di is part of that, then they are replaced. But how to model this with the expand function?\n\nWait, perhaps the expand function is such that when you apply all substitutions, the expansion of a digit is the result of applying all substitutions in order. So, if a substitution for di occurs, then the expand(di) becomes ti, but ti may contain digits that are themselves expanded. However, since substitutions are processed in order, when a substitution for a digit is processed, the ti is fixed as per the current state of substitutions. For example:\n\nInitially, expand(2) = \"2\".\n\nThen, substitution 2 → \"3\": expand(2) = \"3\".\n\nThen, substitution 3 → \"4\": expand(3) = \"4\". So, the expand(2) is \"3\", which would expand to \"4\" if we process the substitution for 3. But how does this affect the expand(2)?\n\nAh, here's the problem. If we have expand(2) = \"3\", and then we process a substitution for 3 → \"4\", then the expand(2) should now be \"4\", because when you apply the substitution for 3, any occurrence of 3 (which was generated from the expansion of 2) would be replaced with 4. But how to track this?\n\nThis suggests that whenever a substitution is made for a digit d, we need to update the expand function for all digits that have their expansion containing d. But that seems computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model expand(d) as the current string that d is replaced with, considering all substitutions up to the current point. However, when a substitution is made for a digit d, we need to update expand(d) to ti. However, any digits that have their expansion include d would need to be updated as well. But that seems impossible unless we track dependencies.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of an example. Suppose we have the following substitutions:\n\n1. 2 → 3\n2. 3 → 4\n\nInitially, expand(2) is \"2\". After substitution 1, expand(2) is \"3\". Then, substitution 2: expand(3) is \"4\". Now, when we expand 2, we get \"3\", which would expand to \"4\". But how do we track that in our expand function? Well, perhaps expand(2) should be \"4\" after substitution 2. But how do we know that?\n\nAh, here's the key: when we process substitution 2 (3 → 4), we need to update all existing expand functions that include 3. But how can we track that? For example, if expand(2) is \"3\", then after substitution 3 → 4, expand(2) should be \"4\". But how to compute that?\n\nThis suggests that whenever we process a substitution for a digit d, we need to go through all other digits whose expansion contains d and update their expansion accordingly. But this seems computationally expensive, especially for large numbers of substitutions.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think of expand(d) as a string that represents the current expansion of digit d. When we process a substitution for digit d_old → t, we need to update expand(d_old) to t. However, t may contain digits that are themselves expanded. So, the actual expansion of d_old after this substitution is t, but during substitution processing, any digits in t that are subject to future substitutions would be handled by their own expand functions.\n\nWait, but when we process substitutions in order, the substitution for d_old is applied immediately. So, when we replace d_old with t, the t is fixed as per the current state of substitutions. That is, when we process substitution d_old → t, the t is a string that may contain digits that have already been substituted. But since substitutions are processed in order, any digits in t that are later substituted would not affect the current substitution. For example:\n\nSuppose substitution order is:\n\n1. 2 → 3\n2. 3 → 4\n\nWhen substitution 1 is processed, the expand(2) is set to \"3\". At that moment, expand(3) is still \"3\". Then substitution 2 is processed, which sets expand(3) to \"4\". Now, if we want to compute the expansion of 2, we take expand(2) which is \"3\", and then expand that to \"4\".\n\nBut how do we model this? If we have a function that, for a given digit, returns the expansion string after applying all substitutions, then the expansion of 2 is the expansion of \"3\", which is \"4\".\n\nTherefore, the expand function must be recursive. For example, expand(d) = t, where t is the string from the latest substitution for d, and each character in t is expanded recursively.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAh! This sounds like a memoization problem. For each digit, we can store its current expansion, and when we need to compute it, we recursively expand each character in the expansion string.\n\nBut since substitutions can be processed in sequence, and each substitution for a digit overrides the previous expansion, we can manage this with memoization.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- We maintain a dictionary (let's call it mappings) where each key is a digit (as a string, perhaps?), and the value is the current expansion string for that digit. Initially, mappings[d] = d for each digit d.\n\n- For each substitution query, say di → ti, we update mappings[di] to ti. However, when we do this, the ti may contain digits that are themselves mapped. But when we need to compute the expansion of di, we need to expand ti recursively.\n\nWait, but when we process the substitution, we need to store ti as the new expansion for di, but ti may contain digits that are subject to future substitutions. However, when we later compute the expansion of di, we would recursively expand each character in ti according to the current mappings.\n\nBut how does this work with the order of substitutions?\n\nLet me take the example again:\n\nInitially, mappings for 2 is \"2\", 3 is \"3\".\n\nSubstitution 1: 2 → 3. So mappings[2] is set to \"3\".\n\nSubstitution 2: 3 → 4. So mappings[3] is set to \"4\".\n\nNow, when we compute the expansion of 2, we take mappings[2] = \"3\", and then expand each character in \"3\" (which is just 3). Expanding 3 gives mappings[3] = \"4\". So the expansion of 2 is \"4\".\n\nSo, the way to compute the expansion of a digit is recursively: for each character in the current expansion string, expand it again.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently, especially since the same digits may be expanded multiple times?\n\nWe can memoize the expansion of each digit. For example, for each digit d, we can compute the expanded string once, and cache it. However, when a substitution is made for any digit, the cached expansions of other digits may become invalid. For example, if we have a substitution for 3, then any digit whose expansion includes 3 would need to have their cached expansions recomputed.\n\nThis seems tricky. But perhaps we can avoid memoization and compute the expansion on the fly, using dynamic programming. However, with the possibility of cycles (like substituting 2 → 3, 3 → 2), we need to avoid infinite recursion.\n\nBut the problem says that the substitutions are processed in order. However, the problem allows for ti to be any string, including those that contain digits that are being substituted again. However, in practice, for the expansion, when we process substitutions, we need to ensure that the expansion is computed correctly based on the current mappings.\n\nBut perhaps we can use memoization with a cache that is invalidated when a substitution occurs. However, this could be complex.\n\nAlternative idea: for each substitution, when we process it, we update the mapping for di to ti. However, when we need to compute the expansion of a digit, we recursively expand the current mapping for that digit, using the current mappings for all digits. This is similar to a recursive function.\n\nBut for efficiency, we can memoize the expansion of each digit. However, whenever a substitution is made, we need to clear the memoization cache for any digits that could be affected. But how to track that?\n\nAlternatively, since substitutions are processed sequentially, and each substitution only affects the mapping for a particular digit, we can compute the expansion of each digit on the fly, recursively, without memoization. However, this might lead to exponential time in the worst case.\n\nBut given that the sum of lengths of ti across all queries is up to 1e5, and the number of substitutions is up to 1e5, perhaps this approach is feasible with memoization.\n\nWait, but for each substitution, the expansion of a digit can be represented as a string. So, for example, when processing a substitution, we can precompute the expansion of the digit as the current ti, but with all digits in ti expanded as per the current mappings.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because when we process substitution di → ti, we need to store ti as the new expansion for di. However, the ti may contain digits that are themselves mapped. For example, if ti is \"3\", and 3 is mapped to \"4\", then the expansion of di would be \"4\". But when we process the substitution, we can't know what ti will expand to in the future. However, the substitution replaces di with ti in the current string. Therefore, during substitution processing, the ti is stored as-is, and when we expand di, we have to expand ti recursively according to the current mappings.\n\nSo, the expansion of di is the expansion of ti, which is computed recursively.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\nFor each digit, when you need to expand it, you take the current mapping (which is a string) and expand each character in that string recursively.\n\nSo, to compute the expansion of a digit, we can use memoization. Let's define a function expand(d) which returns the expanded string for digit d. The function works as follows:\n\n- If d is already memoized, return the memoized value.\n- Otherwise, take the current mapping for d (say, s), and for each character c in s, recursively expand(c), then concatenate the results.\n- Memoize the result and return it.\n\nBut when a substitution is made for a digit, say d, the memoization cache for all digits that depend on d may be invalid. However, since we can't track that, perhaps we need to clear the memoization cache every time a substitution is made. But that could be expensive.\n\nWait, but if we have a memoization cache that is cleared every time a substitution is made, then for each substitution, the expand function will recompute the expansions from scratch. However, this could lead to O(k) time per expansion, where k is the length of the expansion string.\n\nBut with the constraints given, perhaps this approach is manageable.\n\nLet me think about the example. Suppose we have n substitutions, and for each substitution, the expand function is called for each character in the original string. Let's see.\n\nThe original string is s, of length up to 1e5. For each character in the original string, we need to expand it into its final form. The total length of all ti across substitutions is up to 1e5. So, the total expansion length could be up to O(1e5 * something), but modulo operations need to be handled.\n\nBut even with that, for each character in the original string, we need to compute its expansion. If each expansion takes O(L) time, where L is the length of the expansion, then the total time could be O(1e5 * average expansion length). However, if the expansion is done with memoization, then once a digit's expansion is computed, it's stored, and subsequent calls are O(1).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Maintain a dictionary for mappings, where each digit maps to its current substitution string (initially, each digit maps to itself).\n- Maintain a memoization cache for the expanded strings of each digit.\n- For each substitution query, update the mapping for di to ti. Also, clear the memoization cache for that digit, since the expansion may change. However, other digits that depend on di may also have their expansions changed, but tracking that is complicated. So, perhaps, when a substitution is made, we clear the entire memoization cache. That way, the next time expand is called, it recomputes everything with the new mappings. However, this would be O(1) per substitution for clearing the cache, but the expand function may take longer.\n\nBut with this approach, the memoization cache is invalidated whenever any substitution is made. So, for each substitution, after updating the mapping, we reset the memoization cache.\n\nBut how often is the expand function called? For each character in the original string, we need to expand it once. So, for the original string of length up to 1e5, we call expand once per character, and each expand call may take O(L) time, where L is the length of the expansion.\n\nBut with memoization, once a digit's expansion is computed, it's stored. So, even if there are multiple substitutions, once the expansion is computed, it's stored until the next substitution.\n\nBut if we clear the entire memoization cache on every substitution, then each expand call would need to recompute from scratch. However, that could be expensive.\n\nAlternative approach: don't use memoization. Instead, for each expand call, compute the expansion recursively. However, this would lead to repeated computations. For example, expanding digit 2 may require expanding 3, which requires expanding 4, etc. So, with memoization, we can avoid redundant computations.\n\nBut how can we manage the memoization cache properly? Let's think again. Whenever a substitution is made for a digit d, the expansion of d may change. However, other digits whose expansions include d may also change. But it's impossible to track all of them. Therefore, the safest way is to invalidate the entire memoization cache every time a substitution is made. Because, for example, if a substitution is made for digit 3, then any expansion that includes 3 (like digit 2's expansion) may have changed. Thus, invalidating the entire cache ensures that the next time expand is called, the correct expansion is computed.\n\nBut what is the cost of this approach?\n\nEach substitution invalidates the cache. For each character in the original string, we call expand once. Each expand call computes the expansion of that digit, recursively. However, since the cache is cleared after each substitution, the expand function will have to recompute the expansion for each digit each time. However, with the number of substitutions being up to 1e5 and the original string being up to 1e5 characters, this could be O( (n + m) * L ), where m is the number of original characters, and L is the average expansion length.\n\nBut perhaps this is manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input. For example, in the third sample input:\n\nInput string is 222, and two substitutions: 2->0, then 0->7. Let's see how the expand function would work.\n\nInitially, mappings are {'2': '2', '0': '0'}.\n\nFirst substitution: 2 → '0'. So, mappings['2'] = '0'. Then, the cache is cleared. When expanding '2', it's '0', which expands to '7' (since after the second substitution, mappings['0'] is '7').\n\nSecond substitution: 0 → '7'. So, mappings['0'] = '7'. Cache is cleared again. Now, expanding '2' would expand to '0', which expands to '7'.\n\nSo, the original string is 222 → each '2' expands to '7', resulting in 777.\n\nBut if the cache is cleared after each substitution, then during the first substitution (2→0), the expand function for 2 would return '0', and during the second substitution (0→7), the expand function for 0 would return '7'.\n\nBut how does the expand function work when the cache is cleared?\n\nLet me think of the code structure.\n\nWe can have a memo dictionary, which is a cache for the expanded strings of each digit. Initially, it's empty.\n\nFor each substitution, we update the mapping, and then clear the memo dictionary.\n\nThen, when expanding a digit, we check if it's in memo. If not, we compute it recursively, and store it in memo.\n\nBut wait, if we clear the memo after every substitution, then for each substitution, the memo is empty again. So, for example, after the first substitution (2→0), the memo is cleared, and when we expand 2, it's computed as the expansion of '0', which is '0' (since the memo is empty, and the mapping for 0 is '0'). Then, after the second substitution (0→7), the memo is cleared again, and when expanding 2, it's computed as expansion of '0' (which is now '7').\n\nYes, this would work. However, the problem is that during the processing of substitutions, the expand function is not called until after all substitutions are processed. Wait, no. The substitutions are processed in order. The expand function is called only once after all substitutions are processed, when we need to compute the final string.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that after all queries, we need to compute the number represented by the final string. So the substitutions are processed in order, and then the final string is generated by expanding each character of the original string s according to the current mappings.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the original string s.\n\n2. Read n substitutions.\n\n3. Process each substitution in order, updating the mappings.\n\n4. After all substitutions, generate the final string by expanding each character in s.\n\nSo, the memoization cache can be invalidated after each substitution, but during the expansion phase, the expand function is called once for each character in s. Therefore, during the expansion phase, the memoization cache is built, and once built, it's used for all subsequent calls.\n\nBut if the substitutions are processed first, and then the expansion is done, then during the expansion phase, the memoization cache can be built once. However, during substitution processing, the memoization cache is cleared after each substitution.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\nInitialize mappings as {d: d for d in '0' to '9'}\n\nmemo = {}\n\nfor each query in queries:\n\n    parse di and ti\n\n    mappings[di] = ti\n\n    memo = {}  # clear memoization cache\n\nOnce all queries are processed, generate the final string by expanding each character in the original string s.\n\nBut how to expand each character in s?\n\nFor each character c in s:\n\n    expand(c) \n\nBut expand(c) is a function that uses the current mappings and memoization.\n\nBut how to implement this expand function with memoization?\n\nLet's think of it as a recursive function with memoization.\n\ndef expand(c):\n\n    if c in memo:\n\n        return memo[c]\n\n    # get the current mapping for c\n\n    s = mappings[c]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        res += expand(ch)\n\n    memo[c] = res\n\n    return res\n\nBut this is a recursive approach. However, for cases where there are cycles (like 2 → 3, 3 → 2), this would cause infinite recursion. However, the problem allows for ti to be any string, including those that can create cycles.\n\nBut in such cases, the expansion would be infinite. However, the problem statement says that after all queries, we need to compute the number. How to handle that?\n\nWait, the problem says that ti can be an empty string. So, if there is a substitution that creates a cycle, like 2 → 3, 3 → 2, then expanding 2 would result in an infinite loop. But the problem says that the queries are given as per the input, and we need to process them. However, in practice, such cycles would result in an infinitely long string, which is impossible to process. However, the problem likely expects that the code handles this by considering that the expansion is done as per the substitution rules, even if it leads to an infinite string. However, since the problem requires to compute the number mod 1e9+7, which is a finite number, perhaps the code can handle this by detecting cycles and breaking them, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut given the problem's sample inputs and the fact that the problem says that the sum of ti lengths is up to 1e5, perhaps the test cases are designed such that there are no cycles. Or perhaps the code can proceed with the recursive approach, assuming that the expansion terminates.\n\nBut for the purposes of solving the problem, perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that the expansion terminates. However, in reality, the code may crash due to infinite recursion. So, how to handle that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution process is such that the expansion for a digit is a finite string. But how?\n\nWell, the substitution process replaces a digit with a string. If the substitution process creates a cycle, then the expansion of that digit would be infinite. For example, substitution 2 → 3, 3 → 2. Then, expanding 2 would be 3, which expands to 2, which expands to 3, etc. So, the expansion is infinite. However, the problem says that after all substitutions, we need to compute the number. How can that be possible?\n\nBut the problem statement says that the initial string is s, and the queries are applied. So, during the substitution processing, if the expansion leads to an infinite string, the code would not be able to compute it. However, in practice, the problem may not include such test cases, or the code may need to handle it somehow.\n\nBut given that the problem is from a programming competition, and the sample inputs don't have such cases, perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that the expansion is finite. However, for the code to be correct, we need to avoid infinite recursion.\n\nTo prevent infinite recursion, we can track the visited digits during expansion. For example, during the expand function, if we encounter a digit that is already being processed, we can detect a cycle and return an empty string or raise an error. However, the problem statement doesn't specify what to do in such cases, but the sample inputs don't have such cases.\n\nBut given that the problem requires us to output the number modulo 1e9+7, perhaps the code can assume that the expansion is finite. Therefore, we can proceed with the recursive approach and memoization, and hope that there are no cycles.\n\nBut in practice, how to handle cycles? Well, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the code can proceed as described, and in the case of cycles, the code will crash. However, given that the problem's examples don't have such cases, and that the problem may not have them in the test cases, we'll proceed.\n\nNow, back to the code structure. Once the substitutions are processed, we need to generate the final string by expanding each character in the original string. However, the problem is that the expansion can be very long. For example, if the original string is 1e5 characters, and each expands to a string of length 1e5, the final string could be up to 1e10 characters, which is impossible to handle directly.\n\nBut since we need to compute the number mod 1e9+7, we can't store the entire string. We need to compute the value modulo 1e9+7 efficiently.\n\nAh! That's a critical point. Storing the entire expanded string is impossible for large cases. So, we need to compute the value mod 1e9+7 on the fly, without generating the entire string.\n\nSo, the problem is not to generate the string, but to compute the number it represents mod 1e9+7. Therefore, we need to find a way to compute this value without actually building the string.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nLet's think about the process of building the number. Each substitution replaces digits with other strings. The final number is formed by the concatenation of the expansions of each original digit. The value of the number is equal to the sum over all digits in the final string of (digit_value * 10^power), where power depends on the position of the digit.\n\nBut calculating this directly is not feasible for large strings. However, we can model this with dynamic programming, keeping track of the current value modulo MOD and the current power of 10.\n\nLet me explain. For example, suppose we have a string that is built incrementally. Each time we add a new digit (or a sequence of digits), we can compute how it contributes to the overall value.\n\nLet's say the current value is V, and we append a new string S. The new value is V * (10^len(S)) + value_of_S.\n\nBut how to compute value_of_S mod MOD?\n\nYes. So, the idea is to compute for each expansion of a digit, not only the string, but also its numeric value mod MOD and the length of the string (since appending it to another string requires multiplying by 10^length).\n\nTherefore, instead of expanding each digit to a string, we can compute two things for each digit's expansion:\n\n- The numeric value mod MOD.\n\n- The length of the expansion (number of digits).\n\nThis way, when we process the original string s, we can compute the total value by combining the contributions of each character's expansion.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each digit d, we compute two values:\n\n- val[d]: the numeric value mod MOD of the expansion of d.\n\n- len[d]: the length of the expansion of d.\n\nThen, when we process the original string s, we can compute the total value by iterating through each character in s, and for each character c, we compute how adding its expansion affects the current total value.\n\nFor example, suppose the current total value is current_val, and the current length is current_len. When we add a new expansion with value v and length l, the new current_val is (current_val * pow(10, l, MOD) + v) % MOD, and the new current_len is current_len + l.\n\nThis way, we can compute the total value without ever generating the entire string.\n\nThis is crucial because otherwise, for large expansions, the string would be impossible to handle.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing val and len for each digit, considering the substitutions.\n\nNow, how to compute val and len for each digit, given the substitutions?\n\nAgain, we can use memoization. For each digit d, val[d] is the value of the expansion of d mod MOD, and len[d] is the length of the expansion.\n\nThe base case is when the expansion of d is a string. For example, if the expansion of d is \"123\", then val[d] is 123 mod MOD, and len[d] is 3.\n\nBut how to compute val and len recursively?\n\nFor a given digit d, its expansion is the string s = mappings[d]. For each character in s, we recursively compute the val and len of that character. Then, the value of the entire expansion is the sum of each character's contribution, considering their position in the string.\n\nWait, but the value of the entire expansion is the numeric value of the concatenated string. For example, if the expansion of d is \"ab\", where a is the expansion of some digit and b is the expansion of another, then the numeric value is (value of a) * 10^{length of b} + value of b.\n\nSo, for the expansion string s, which is a concatenation of the expansions of each character in mappings[d], we can compute val and len as follows:\n\nval[d] = (val_part_1 * 10^len_part_2 + val_part_2) ... etc.\n\nBut how to compute this for the entire expansion of d?\n\nThis suggests that for each digit d, when we compute its val and len, we need to process each character in mappings[d], and for each of those characters, compute their val and len, and combine them.\n\nFor example, let's say mappings[d] is \"abc\", and the expansion of a is (va, la), expansion of b is (vb, lb), expansion of c is (vc, lc). Then, the expansion of d is the concatenation of a's expansion,",
