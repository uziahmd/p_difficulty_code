Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. Let's look at the examples. For example, 'ababa' has substrings like 'aba' which appears twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4). So the output is 3. For 'zzz', the substrings are 'z' (appears 3 times), 'zz' (twice), 'zzz' (once). So the longest is 2, which is the output.\n\nSo the approach should be to check for all possible substrings, track their occurrences, and find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check all possible substrings?\n\nThe brute force way would be to generate all possible substrings for all possible lengths, then check if they appear at least twice. But since the string length is up to 100, maybe this is feasible.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible substring lengths, starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length L, check if there's any substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer.\n\nBecause we want the maximum possible length, checking from largest to smallest makes sense. Once we find the first L where such a substring exists, we can return it immediately.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\nFor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n   For each starting index i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       Take substring s[i:i+L]\n\n       Check if this substring appears again in the string (at least once more)\n\n       If yes, return L as the answer.\n\nIf no such substring is found for any L, return 0.\n\nBut how to check if a substring appears again? For each substring of length L, we can collect all occurrences and see if there are at least two.\n\nBut for each substring of length L, we can check if it occurs more than once.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nFor example, for a given L, generate all possible substrings of that length, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\nBut for each L, we can collect all substrings of that length and count their frequency.\n\nBut for L= len(s), there's only one substring, so can't have duplicates. For L= len(s)-1, there are two substrings, but they may be same. Like for 'aaa', len is 3. For L=2, substrings are 'aa' (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So they are same. So count is 2, so answer is 2.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop L from the maximum possible (n) down to 1:\n\n   For each L, collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\n   If yes, return L.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, none found, return 0.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead the input string. Let's say s = input().strip()\n\nThen n = len(s)\n\nThen for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n   seen = set()\n\n   for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in seen:\n\n           return L\n\n       else:\n\n           seen.add(substr)\n\n   So, for each L, we check all substrings of that length. If any substring is found again, return L.\n\nWait, but this approach would miss cases where a substring occurs more than once. For example, if a substring appears three times, the first occurrence is added to the set, then when the second occurrence comes, it's found in the set, so return L. So that's correct.\n\nBut for example, in the case of 'zzz' with L=2:\n\nsubstrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), then 'zz' (positions 1-2). When the first is added to the set, then the second is checked and found in the set. So returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nBut what about overlapping occurrences? For example, 'ababa' with L=3. The substrings are:\n\ni=0: aba\n\ni=1: bab\n\ni=2: aba\n\nSo when i=0, substr is aba added to the set. Then when i=2, substr is aba again. So during the loop, when i=2, we check if substr is in the set. It is, so return 3. Which is correct.\n\nYes",
