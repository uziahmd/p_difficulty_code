Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question marks can match any color. I need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair is a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, the key is to pair as many as possible. Let's think about how to maximize the pairs. The idea is to match specific colors first, then use the question marks for remaining ones.\n\nLet me think: For each color (excluding '?'), we can count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. The maximum possible pairs for that color is the minimum of the two counts. But since a boot can't be used more than once, we need to track which ones are used.\n\nBut wait, the question marks can be matched with any. So maybe the strategy is:\n\n1. Match all the specific colors first. For example, for each color c (not '?'), pair left boots with c and right boots with c. The number of such pairs is the minimum of the count of c in left and count in right. Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots (including those with '?') can be paired using the question marks.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks? Because they can be matched with any, but we need to pair them optimally.\n\nWait, but after pairing specific colors, the remaining left and right boots can be paired using the question marks. However, the question marks can also be used to pair with other question marks.\n\nBut perhaps the way to maximize is:\n\n- For each color c (excluding '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, collect all remaining left and right boots (which may include '?') and pair them as much as possible. Since the '?' can match anything, the maximum possible pairs here would be the minimum of the number of remaining left boots and remaining right boots.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. For example, if there are some left '?' and right '?', we can pair them. But also, if there are left '?' and right 'a', we can pair them. So maybe the best way is to first pair all the specific colors, then pair the remaining left and right boots using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots with the same specific color. For each color c (a-z), find the number of left boots with c and right boots with c. Take the minimum of the two, and pair them. But how to track which ones are used?\n\nBut for the purpose of counting, maybe we can process each color, and pair as many as possible. However, when we pair them, we need to track which left and right boots are already used.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 150,000, we need an efficient way to do this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can first process all specific colors, and then use the question marks.\n\nAnother idea: Let's create two dictionaries for left and right boots, counting how many of each color (excluding '?') there are. Then, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Then, subtract these from the counts. Then, the remaining left and right boots (including '?') can be matched. But how?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the actual positions (indices) of the boots matter. Because we need to output the pairs. So just counting isn't enough. We need to actually select which left and right boots to pair.\n\nSo the approach needs to be:\n\n- For each color (non '?') in left and right, pair them. For example, for color 'a', take all left 'a's and pair them with right 'a's. Once that's done, the remaining left and right boots (including those with '?') can be paired using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nLet me think of data structures. For example, for each color, we can have a list of indices where that color occurs. For example, for left boots, we can have a dictionary where key is the color, and value is a list of indices (positions) where that color appears. Similarly for right boots.\n\nThen, for each color c (not '?'), we can take the left list and right list. The number of pairs is the minimum of len(left_list) and len(right_list). Then, we can pair the first min elements. For example, pair left_list[0] with right_list[0], etc. But once we do that, we need to remove those elements from the lists. However, since we can't modify the original lists (because we need to process other colors), perhaps we need to track which indices have been used.\n\nAlternatively, we can track used arrays for left and right. For example, for each left index, mark whether it's used. Similarly for right.\n\nBut for large n, this would be feasible.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nInitialize two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, all False. These track whether the boot at that index is already paired.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   get the list of left indices where color is c and not used.\n\n   get the list of right indices where color is c and not used.\n\n   the number of possible pairs is the min of the two lists.\n\n   for i in 0 to min-1:\n\n       pair left_indices[i] with right_indices[i]\n\n       mark both as used.\n\nOnce that's done, we have the remaining left and right boots (those not used yet) which are either '?' or some colors that couldn't be paired because their counterparts were already used.\n\nThen, for the remaining boots, we can pair as many as possible. Since any left '?' can pair with any right (even '?'), and vice versa. So the maximum possible pairs here is min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\nBut how to pair them?\n\nWe can collect all remaining left indices (those not used and with color '?') and all remaining right indices (those not used and with color '?').\n\nBut also, the remaining left indices could have non '?' colors, but their counterparts in the right are already used. So for example, a left 'a' that couldn't be paired with a right 'a' because all right 'a's were already used. But since the left 'a' is not used, but there's no right 'a' left. So in this case, the left 'a' can't be paired with any right boot except a '?'. But the same applies for right boots.\n\nSo, for the remaining boots, we can pair any left (whether '?' or not) with any right (whether '?' or not) as long as their colors are compatible. But since the left and right boots are not used yet, and the only way to pair them is if they are compatible.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally?\n\nWait, but the remaining left and right boots can be paired as follows: for each left boot not used, and each right boot not used, check if their colors are compatible. But with n up to 150,000, this would be O(n^2) in worst case, which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nBut here's the thing: after processing all specific colors, the only remaining left and right boots are those that couldn't be paired. So for example, if a left boot has color 'a', but all right 'a's were already used. So this left 'a' can be paired with a right '?', but not with a right 'b' or other.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally?\n\nThe problem is that the remaining left and right boots can have specific colors and '?'. So for the remaining, the maximum number of pairs is the minimum between the total number of remaining left and right boots. But how to pair them?\n\nBecause any left '?' can be paired with any right. Also, any left specific color can be paired with a right '?'. Similarly for right specific and left '?'.\n\nSo the idea is to first pair the left '?' with the right '?', then pair the left '?' with the right non-? (if possible), and the right '?' with left non-? (if possible), and finally pair the left non-? with right non-? only if they are same color. But since we already processed the same color pairs earlier, perhaps that's not possible anymore. Wait, no. Because during the first phase, we processed all same color pairs. So in the remaining phase, for the same color, there are not enough in one side.\n\nSo during the second phase, the only possible compatible pairs are:\n\n- left '?' with any right (specific or ?)\n\n- right '?' with any left (specific or ?)\n\n- left and right with same color (but that was already processed in the first phase, so perhaps there are none left?)\n\nWait, no. Because suppose there are multiple left and right boots with same color. For example, say there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's. In the first phase, we pair the first 2 left 'a's with the 2 right 'a's. The third left 'a' remains. Then, during the second phase, this left 'a' can be paired with a right '?', but not with another right 'a' (since they were already used). So in the second phase, the left and right boots with same color can be paired only if they are not already paired. But since the first phase already took as much as possible, perhaps during the second phase, there are no more same color pairs. Or maybe there are some. For example, if during the first phase, for a certain color, we had left count 2 and right count 3. So during first phase, we pair 2 left with 2 right. Then the remaining 1 right is left. But during the second phase, if there are other left boots with same color, they can be paired with that right.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps during the second phase, we can ignore same-color pairs, because the first phase would have already taken as many as possible. But perhaps not. For example, if there are left boots with color 'a' and right boots with color 'a' that weren't paired during the first phase because they were not processed in order.\n\nWait, no. The first phase processes all colors in order. For example, for each color c in a-z, we process them. So for color 'a', we pair as many as possible. So during the first phase, all possible same-color pairs are processed. Therefore, during the second phase, there are no same-color pairs left. Because if there was a left and right with same color, they would have been processed in the first phase.\n\nWait, no. Because suppose during the first phase, we process color 'a', but there are some left 'a's and right 'a's. But during that processing, we pair them. But suppose that some left 'a's and right 'a's are left unpaired. How?\n\nAh, no. Because for each color c, during the first phase, we process all left and right boots of color c. For example, for color 'a', we collect all left 'a's and right 'a's. Then pair them as much as possible. So the number of pairs is min(left_a_count, right_a_count). So after that, the remaining left 'a's and right 'a's would be (left_a_count - min(...)) and (right_a_count - min(...)), respectively. But since min is the smaller of the two, one of them would be zero. So after that, there are no more left 'a's or right 'a's left. Because for example, if left has 5, right has 3, then after pairing 3 pairs, left has 2 left 'a's and right has 0. Those left 'a's are left, but they can't be paired with any right 'a's.\n\nTherefore, during the second phase, there are no same-color pairs left. So during the second phase, the only compatible pairs are those involving at least one '?'.\n\nSo during the second phase, the remaining left and right boots can be paired as follows:\n\nEach left boot can be paired with any right boot if either is a '?'. So how to pair them optimally.\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the minimum of the number of remaining left and right boots. So the idea is to pair as many as possible, regardless of their colors (as long as they are compatible, which they are because of the '?'s).\n\nBut how to find which pairs to make?\n\nWell, for the remaining left and right boots, we can collect all the left indices not used yet and all the right indices not used yet.\n\nThen, for each left index in the remaining left list, and each right index in the remaining right list, we can pair them if compatible. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nBut since we know that any left can be paired with any right, because the left and right may have '?', or one of them has '?'. So the only way they are incompatible is if both are specific colors and different.\n\nBut since during the first phase, all same-color pairs were processed, so in the remaining phase, there are no same-color pairs. So during the second phase, if a left and right have same color, that would have been processed in the first phase. Therefore, during the second phase, any left and right that have same color must have been processed in the first phase. So during the second phase, the remaining left and right boots cannot have same color. Wait, no. Suppose that during the first phase, for color 'a', we have left count 3 and right count 3. So we pair all of them. Now, suppose there is a left boot with color 'a' that was not processed? No, because in the first phase, we process all left and right boots of color 'a'.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose during the first phase, for color 'a', we have left list [L1, L2, L3], and right list [R1, R2, R3]. Then, we pair each Li with Ri. All are used. So during the second phase, no left or right 'a's are left.\n\nBut suppose that during the first phase, for color 'a', left has 3 and right has 4. Then, we pair 3 pairs. The remaining right has 1 'a' left. But that right 'a' can't be paired with any left 'a' (since all left 'a's are used). So during the second phase, this right 'a' is in the remaining list. Now, if there is a left '?' in the remaining list, it can be paired with this right 'a'.\n\nSo during the second phase, the only way for a left and right to be compatible is if at least one of them is a '?'. Because otherwise, they have different colors (since same colors were processed in first phase).\n\nSo during the second phase, the way to pair them is to pair any left with any right, as long as at least one is '?'. But how to find such pairs?\n\nBut since the maximum number of pairs is min(remaining_left, remaining_right), we can just pair the first k lefts with the first k rights, regardless of their colors. Because if any of them is '?', they will be compatible. However, if both are specific colors, then they are incompatible. But how can that happen?\n\nWait, during the first phase, all same-color pairs were processed. So if two boots are left in the second phase, and they have same color, that would imply that during the first phase, there were more left and right boots of that color than could be paired. Which is impossible. Because during the first phase, for each color, we paired as many as possible.\n\nWait, for example, suppose there are two left boots with color 'a', and three right boots with color 'a'. Then during the first phase, we pair the two left with two right. The remaining right has one 'a' left. So during the second phase, that right 'a' is in the remaining list. But if there is a left boot with color 'a' that is not used, then during the first phase, it would have been processed. But in this scenario, there were two left 'a's, which were all paired. So during the second phase, there are no left 'a's left. Hence, the remaining right 'a' is in the second phase. If there are any left boots with color 'a' in the second phase, then during the first phase, there must have been more left 'a's than right 'a's, and during the first phase, all right 'a's were paired with left 'a's. So the remaining left 'a's would be left. But during the second phase, those left 'a's would be in the remaining list. However, since the right 'a's are all used, the remaining left 'a's can't be paired with any right 'a's. But they can be paired with right '?', or left '?' can be paired with right 'a's.\n\nSo during the second phase, if a left boot and a right boot have same color, that implies that during the first phase, there were more of one than the other, and the remaining is in the other side. So for example, left has 3 'a's, right has 2 'a's. During the first phase, we pair 2 left 'a's with 2 right 'a's. The remaining left 'a's (1) are in the second phase. But there are no right 'a's left. So pairing that left 'a' with a right 'a' is not possible. But during the second phase, the left 'a' can be paired with a right '?', and the right 'a's are already used. So during the second phase, if a left and right have same color, they can't be paired (since the other side's same color boots are already used). So during the second phase, the only compatible pairs are those where at least one is a '?'.\n\nThus, during the second phase, we can pair any left and right boots as long as at least one is a '?'. But how to find such pairs?\n\nBut the problem is, how to pair them efficiently. Because if we have a lot of left and right boots, but some have specific colors, and others have '?', how to pair them optimally.\n\nBut since the maximum possible is min(remaining_left, remaining_right), we can just pair the left and right boots in any order, as long as they are not already used. But how to ensure that the pair is compatible.\n\nWait, but if we pair them in any order, then perhaps some pairs are incompatible. For example, suppose there is a left 'a' and a right 'b', and neither is a '?'. Then, they can't be paired. But how can that happen during the second phase?\n\nBecause during the first phase, all same-color pairs were processed. So during the second phase, the left 'a' and right 'b' can't be paired unless one is a '?'. But if they are both specific, then they can't be paired. So in this case, pairing them would be invalid.\n\nBut how can this situation happen?\n\nSuppose that during the first phase, the left 'a' and right 'b' were not paired. But during the first phase, we processed all same-color pairs. So the left 'a' would have been paired with any right 'a's. Similarly, the right 'b' would have been paired with any left 'b's. But if there are no such pairs, then they remain.\n\nSo during the second phase, the left 'a' and right 'b' are in the remaining list. But they can't be paired. So if we just pair them arbitrarily, we might end up with invalid pairs.\n\nThis is a problem. So the previous approach is incorrect. Because during the second phase, we can't just pair any left and right, since some pairs may be incompatible.\n\nSo what's the correct way to handle the second phase?\n\nHmm. So the problem is that after the first phase, the remaining left and right boots can't be paired in arbitrary ways. So how can we pair them optimally?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe second phase is to pair all remaining left and right boots, considering that:\n\n- A left boot can be paired with a right boot if:\n\n   (left is '?' OR right is '?') OR (left == right and both are not '?')\n\nBut since during the first phase, all same-color pairs were processed, the last condition (left == right and not '?') can't happen. Because if there are any left and right boots with same color, they would have been processed in the first phase.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose that during the first phase, for a color 'c', we have left count = 3 and right count = 2. Then, during the first phase, we pair 2 left 'c's with 2 right 'c's. The remaining left 'c' is left. So during the second phase, this left 'c' can't be paired with any right 'c's (since all are used). But there might be a right 'c' that wasn't processed? No, because during the first phase, all right 'c's were processed. So in the second phase, there are no right 'c's left. Thus, during the second phase, if a left boot and a right boot have same color, then it's possible that one is left and the other is right, but the other side has no more of that color. So they can't be paired. So during the second phase, the only compatible pairs are those where at least one is '?'.\n\nSo, in the second phase, when pairing the remaining left and right boots, we can only pair them if at least one is a '?'. Thus, the problem becomes: find as many pairs as possible between the remaining left and right boots, where each pair satisfies that condition.\n\nHow to do this efficiently?\n\nAn idea is:\n\nCollect all the left boots that are not used and have color '?', call them left_q.\n\nCollect all the right boots that are not used and have color '?', call them right_q.\n\nCollect all the left boots that are not used and have specific color (non '?'), call them left_s.\n\nCollect all the right boots that are not used and have specific color (non '?'), call them right_s.\n\nNow, the possible pairs are:\n\n- left_q with right_q (compatible)\n\n- left_q with right_s (compatible)\n\n- left_s with right_q (compatible)\n\n- left_s with right_s (incompatible, since they have different colors)\n\nSo the maximum possible pairs is:\n\nWe can pair all left_q with right_q, then pair the remaining left_q with right_s, then pair the remaining right_q with left_s, then pair the remaining left_s and right_s (but they can't be paired).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nBut since the total number of pairs is min(remaining_left, remaining_right), we can try to pair as much as possible.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor the second phase:\n\nWe can first pair all left_q with right_q. Then, for the remaining left_q and right_s, pair them. Then for the remaining right_q and left_s, pair them. Finally, any left_s and right_s can't be paired.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nBut since the problem is to find the maximum number of pairs, and the maximum is the minimum of remaining_left and remaining_right, we can proceed as follows:\n\nTake all left and right boots not used yet.\n\nWe can iterate through all left boots (not used) and pair them with right boots (not used) as long as at least one is '?'. How to do this efficiently.\n\nBut for large n, we can't check each pair. So we need a way to greedily pair them.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nWe can collect all left boots not used, and all right boots not used.\n\nThen, for each left boot in left_not_used, try to find a right boot in right_not_used that is compatible. Once found, pair them and mark as used.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut given that the time constraints are tight (n up to 1.5e5), we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nAnother idea: since the only incompatible pairs are between left_s and right_s with different colors, but during the second phase, we can pair any left with any right if at least one is '?'.\n\nThus, the maximum number of pairs is min(number of left_remaining, number of right_remaining).\n\nSo the problem reduces to pairing as many as possible, ensuring that each pair is compatible.\n\nBut how to find such pairs.\n\nHere's a possible way:\n\nWe can collect all the left boots that are not used and have '?', and all the right boots that are not used and have '?'. Let's call them left_q and right_q.\n\nWe can pair as many left_q with right_q as possible. The number is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nThen, the remaining left_q can be paired with right_s, and the remaining right_q can be paired with left_s.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nAlternatively, for the second phase, collect all left_remaining and right_remaining. Then, for each left in left_remaining, pair it with the first available right in right_remaining that is compatible.\n\nBut how to find that quickly.\n\nAn efficient way could be:\n\nWe can have two lists: left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nWe can iterate through each left in left_remaining, and try to find a right in right_remaining that is compatible.\n\nTo make this efficient, perhaps we can have for the right_remaining, a list that includes all the right boots, and for each left, we can pick the first right that is compatible.\n\nBut for this, perhaps we can process the left_remaining and right_remaining in any order, and pair them greedily.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe can have two pointers, i and j, going through left_remaining and right_remaining. For each left in left_remaining, we check if it can be paired with the current right in right_remaining. If yes, pair them. Else, move to the next right.\n\nBut this may not work. Alternatively, we can loop through all left_remaining, and for each left, find the first right_remaining that is compatible.\n\nBut how to find that right quickly.\n\nBut given that the maximum number of pairs is min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining)), perhaps we can do this in O(n) time by using two queues.\n\nFor example:\n\nCreate two queues: left_queue and right_queue.\n\nFor the left_queue, we can have all left_remaining. For the right_queue, all right_remaining.\n\nThen, while both queues are not empty:\n\n   take the first left from left_queue.\n\n   take the first right from right_queue.\n\n   if they are compatible, pair them, and remove both from the queues.\n\n   else, check if the left is '?': then pair it with the first right in right_queue (since the right can be any, as the left is '?').\n\n   else, check if the right is '?': pair with the left.\n\n   else, they are incompatible. So, we need to put back the right into the queue and move to the next left?\n\nWait, but this may not work. For example, if the first left is 'a' and the first right is 'b', which are incompatible. Then, perhaps there's a right '?' that can be paired with the left 'a'.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAn alternative approach is to separate the right_remaining into those with '?' and those without.\n\nLet me think of this:\n\nIn the second phase, for the remaining left and right boots, we can:\n\n- Collect all left boots with '?', call them left_q.\n\n- Collect all left boots with specific color, call them left_s.\n\n- Collect all right boots with '?', call them right_q.\n\n- Collect all right boots with specific color, call them right_s.\n\nNow, the maximum number of pairs can be calculated as:\n\nnumber of pairs = min(len(left_q) + len(left_s), len(right_q) + len(right_s)).\n\nBut how to pair them.\n\nWe can first pair all left_q with right_q. Then, for the remaining left_q, pair with right_s. Then, for the remaining right_q, pair with left_s. Finally, pair left_s and right_s if they are compatible (but that's not possible, as discussed earlier).\n\nBut since during the first phase, all same-color pairs were processed, any left_s and right_s would have different colors. So pairing them would be invalid.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nPair as many as possible between left_q and right_q.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q with right_s (each left_q can be paired with any right_s).\n\nThen, pair the remaining right_q with left_s (each right_q can be paired with any left_s).\n\nThe total pairs would be:\n\nmin(len(left_q), len(right_q)) + min(remaining_left_q, len(right_s)) + min(remaining_right_q, len(left_s)).\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of code steps.\n\nAfter the first phase:\n\nCollect all left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nleft_q = list of left indices not used and color is '?'\n\nleft_s = list of left indices not used and color is not '?'\n\nright_q = list of right indices not used and color is '?'\n\nright_s = list of right indices not used and color is not '?'\n\nThen:\n\npairs = []\n\n# Pair left_q and right_q\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_q))):\n\n   pair left_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\n   add to pairs.\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[min(...):]\n\nremaining_right_q = right_q[min(...):]\n\n# Now pair remaining_left_q with right_s\n\nfor i in range(min(len(remaining_left_q), len(right_s))):\n\n   pair remaining_left_q[i] with right_s[i]\n\n   add to pairs.\n\nremaining_left_q = ... \n\n# Now pair remaining_right_q with left_s\n\nfor i in range(min(len(remaining_right_q), len(left_s))):\n\n   pair remaining_right_q[i] with left_s[i]\n\n   add to pairs.\n\nThis way, we pair as much as possible.\n\nBut this approach may not capture all possibilities. For example, if there are more right_s than left_q, but some of the right_s can be paired with left_s, but in this case, they can't be paired.\n\nBut according to our earlier analysis, the left_s and right_s can't be paired because they have different colors. So the above approach is correct.\n\nBut how to collect left_q, left_s, right_q, right_s.\n\nSo, this seems manageable.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nSo the overall steps are:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as arrays of False.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used.\n\n   pair them as min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs.\n\n   for each pair, mark left and right as used.\n\nOnce this is done, collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nThen, collect left_q, left_s, right_q, right_s.\n\nPair as per the steps above.\n\nNow, the problem is how to collect the left and right indices for each color.\n\nBut for each color c, we can pre-process the indices for left and right.\n\nBut for large n, we can't process all colors in a loop for each character. Instead, we can process for each color c in 'a' to 'z', and for each, collect the indices.\n\nBut in Python, for each string, we can create a dictionary mapping colors to list of indices.\n\nFor example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i, ch in enumerate(l):\n\n    left_color_map[ch].append(i)\n\nSimilarly for right_color_map.\n\nBut during the first phase, we need to process each color c, and for each, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut during this process, we need to track which indices have been used. So we can't just process the entire list of left and right for each color, because once some are used, they should not be considered again.\n\nSo the initial approach of creating the color maps is not sufficient, because the color maps contain all indices, including those that may have been used already.\n\nTherefore, perhaps during the first phase, for each color c, we need to iterate through the left and right boots, and pair them as long as they are not used.\n\nBut this would be O(n * 26) time, which for n=1.5e5 is 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nAlternative idea:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices with color c, not yet used.\n\n   collect all right indices with color c, not yet used.\n\n   pair them as min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the left indices with color c not used.\n\nBut for this, we can iterate through the entire left array, and for each index, check if it's not used and has color c. But this would be O(n) per color, leading to O(26n) time.\n\nWhich is acceptable.\n\nBut this is not efficient. For example, for each color c, we can iterate through the entire left array. For n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 = 3.9e6, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to pre-process for each color, the list of indices, and then during the first phase, for each color c, process the list, and pair the first k elements, and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to track which elements are used.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   get the list of left indices with color c (precomputed as left_color_map[c]).\n\n   get the list of right indices with color c (precomputed as right_color_map[c]).\n\n   then, for each of these lists, we can iterate through and collect the indices that are not yet used.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, during the first phase, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   create a list of left indices with color c, not used.\n\n   create a list of right indices with color c, not used.\n\n   pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs.\n\nBut to collect the left indices with color c not used, we can loop through the entire left array once for each color. Which is O(n) per color.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, this is O(26n) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut this approach would be very slow for large n. Because for each color, looping through the entire array.\n\nAlternative idea: during the first phase, for each color c, we can have a pointer to the next available index in the left and right lists.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nAlternatively, precompute for each color, a list of indices. Then, for each color, during the first phase, process the left and right lists, and pair as many as possible, marking them as used.\n\nFor example:\n\nprecompute for each color c, left_indices[c] = list of indices (0-based) where l[i] == c.\n\nSimilarly for right_indices.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_ptr = 0\n\n   right_ptr = 0\n\n   while left_ptr < len(left_indices[c]) and right_ptr < len(right_indices[c]):\n\n       left_idx = left_indices[c][left_ptr]\n\n       right_idx = right_indices[c][right_ptr]\n\n       if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n\n           pair them, mark as used, increment both pointers.\n\n       else:\n\n           # if one is used, skip it.\n\n           if left_used[left_idx]:\n\n               left_ptr += 1\n\n           elif right_used[right_idx]:\n\n               right_ptr += 1\n\n           else:\n\n               # both are used? Not possible, since we have not processed them before.\n\n               # probably not.\n\n               pass\n\nBut this approach may not work, because the left_indices[c] may contain indices that are already used. So we need to skip them.\n\nBut this would require checking each index in the list for being used. Which for each color, may take O(k) time, where k is the number of indices in the list for that color.\n\nBut overall, this is O(n) time across all colors, since each index is checked once.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nPrecompute for each color, the list of indices in left and right.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = left_indices[c]\n\n   right_list = right_indices[c]\n\n   i = 0\n\n   j = 0\n\n   while i < len(left_list) and j < len(right_list):\n\n       left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n       right_idx = right_list[j]\n\n       if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n\n           # pair them\n\n           pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n           left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n           right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n           i += 1\n\n           j += 1\n\n       elif left_used[left_idx]:\n\n           i += 1\n\n       elif right_used[right_idx]:\n\n           j += 1\n\n       else:\n\n           # both are not used, but somehow the code didn't pair them. Should not happen.\n\n           # Maybe due to a bug. But for now, assume that this won't happen.\n\n           i += 1\n\n           j += 1\n\nThis way, for each color c, we process all possible pairs between left and right of color c, pairing them as long as they are not used.\n\nOnce this is done, we move to the second phase.\n\nNow, the second phase.\n\nCollect all left indices not used, and right indices not used.\n\nThen, separate them into left_q, left_s, right_q, right_s.\n\nThen, proceed to pair as described.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nOnce the first phase is done, for the second phase:\n\nleft_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i]]\n\nright_remaining =",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility is determined by specific colors or the use of wildcard characters ('?') which can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing**: First, we preprocess the given strings to map each color (including '?') to the indices where they appear in both left and right boots.\n2. **Pairing Specific Colors**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), we pair as many left and right boots as possible. This is done by iterating through each color and matching available indices that haven't been used yet.\n3. **Handling Wildcards**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots which may include wildcards.
