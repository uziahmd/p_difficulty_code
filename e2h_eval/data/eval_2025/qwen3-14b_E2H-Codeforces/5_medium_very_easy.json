Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to pair left and right boots based on their colors. The colors can be letters or question marks, which are wildcards. The goal is to find the maximum number of compatible pairs. Each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to think about is how to match the left and right boots optimally. Let's think about the approach.\n\nLet me consider that each left boot can be paired with a right boot if their colors are compatible. The question marks can match anything. But how do I maximize the number of pairs?\n\nI think the best way is to first match the specific colors. For example, if there's a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with color 'a', they can be paired. But since question marks can be matched with anything, maybe we need to handle them carefully.\n\nWait, but how to manage the matching? Maybe the steps could be:\n\n1. Match all left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same specific color. For example, for each color c (not '?'), count how many left boots have c and how many right boots have c. The number of pairs here would be the minimum of the two counts. But then, after that, the remaining left and right boots (with question marks) can be matched with each other.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. Because question marks can be used as wildcards. So perhaps the optimal approach is:\n\n- First, pair as many specific color matches as possible. For example, for each color c (excluding '?'), take the left boots with c and right boots with c. Pair them up. Then, the remaining left and right boots (which may include question marks) can be matched with each other, considering that question marks can be matched with any.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should first pair the left and right boots with specific colors, and then use the question marks to fill in the gaps.\n\nAnother idea: Let's process the specific colors first. For example, for each color c (not '?'), we can pair as many left and right boots as possible. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which have '?'), we can pair them with each other, but also possibly with the remaining specific colors. Wait, no, because after pairing the specific colors, the remaining ones are those that couldn't be paired. But maybe that's not the optimal way.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that if we have a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with '?', we can pair them. Similarly, if we have a right boot with 'b' and a left with '?', we can pair them. But if we pair the specific colors first, we might miss some opportunities. For example, if there's a left 'a' and a right '?', but also a left '?' and a right 'a'. If we pair the left 'a' with the right 'a', that would be better than pairing the left 'a' with the right '?', but maybe in some cases, it's better to leave some specific pairs unpaired to allow more matches.\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we model this optimally?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- For each color c (not '?'), the minimum between the number of left c's and right c's.\n\nPlus the number of remaining question marks (but considering that each left '?' can be paired with any right (including '?') and vice versa).\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's think about the total possible pairs. Suppose after pairing all specific colors, we have some left and right boots left. Those left boots can be either '?' or some colors that couldn't be matched (like if there were more left boots of color 'a' than right boots of color 'a'). Similarly for the right boots.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots, the question marks can be matched. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose after handling the specific colors, we have L_left_question = number of left boots with '?', and R_right_question = number of right boots with '?'. Also, there might be some left boots with specific colors that couldn't be matched (say, L_remaining) and similarly for right boots (R_remaining). However, these specific colors can't be matched with each other unless they are the same. But since we already handled the specific color pairs, maybe these remaining are such that for each color c, the number of left and right boots with c is zero except for those that couldn't be matched. Wait, no. For example, suppose there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's. Then, we pair 2 of them, leaving 1 left 'a' and 0 right 'a's. That left 'a' can't be paired with any other right boots except those with 'a' or '?'. But since the right boots have no 'a's left, but maybe there are some question marks. So, in that case, the left 'a' can be paired with a right '?', which would be allowed.\n\nSo the problem is that after pairing the specific colors, we have some left and right boots that are either specific colors or '?'s. For those, we need to pair them in a way that uses as many as possible.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each color c (not '?'), pair as many left and right boots as possible. This is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs.\n\n2. Then, collect the remaining left boots (those that couldn't be paired in step 1, including those with '?') and the remaining right boots (same). Then, pair as many as possible between them, using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. After step 1, the left boots that remain are:\n\n- For each color c (not '?'), the left_count[c] - matched_pairs (which is min(left_count[c], right_count[c])).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to track for each color, how many are left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can track for the left and right boots, which ones are available to be paired. For example, after step 1, we have:\n\n- For left boots, some are left with specific colors (could be zero if they were all matched), and some are '?', which can be matched with any right.\n\nSimilarly for the right boots.\n\nBut how to pair the remaining left and right boots.\n\nLet me think of the remaining left and right boots as follows:\n\nLeft_remaining: list of left boots that are not yet paired. These can be:\n\n- Specific colors (like 'a', 'b', etc.) or '?'.\n\nRight_remaining: same for right.\n\nNow, for these, we can pair:\n\n- Any left '?' with any right (specific or '?').\n\n- Any right '?' with any left (specific or '?').\n\nBut since each boot can be used once, we need to find a way to pair them optimally.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn optimal approach here would be:\n\nWe can pair all the left '?' with right '?' first, then pair the remaining left '?' with right specific, and the remaining right '?' with left specific, but that may not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs here is the minimum of the number of left_remaining (total) and right_remaining (total). But how to achieve that?\n\nWait, because any left can be paired with any right. So the maximum number of pairs is the minimum of the number of left_remaining and right_remaining. But how to pair them?\n\nBut perhaps that's not correct. For example, if there are 3 left_remaining (all '?') and 2 right_remaining (one 'a' and one '?'). Then, we can pair the left '?' with the right '?', and another left '?' with the right 'a'. So total 2 pairs, which is the min(3, 2) = 2.\n\nSo yes, in this case, the maximum is min(total left_remaining, total right_remaining). So the total pairs would be:\n\nstep1_pairs + min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each color c (not '?'), pair as many left and right as possible. So for each c, take the min of left_count[c] and right_count[c]. Sum these up.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots, collect all the left boots that are not paired (either because they were '?', or their color had more left than right, etc.), and same for right. Then, the number of pairs possible is min(number of remaining left, number of remaining right). But how to pair them?\n\nBut how do we track which left and right boots are available for this step?\n\nAh, the problem is that we need to not only count the number of pairs, but also output the actual indices of the pairs. So the above approach is not sufficient, as it gives the count, but not the actual pairs.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the approach needs to be:\n\n1. For each color c (not '?'), pair the left and right boots of color c. For example, for each left boot with color c, pair it with a right boot with color c. We need to collect these pairs.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently, given that we need to track which boots are already used.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 150,000, we need an efficient method.\n\nSo perhaps, we can create for each color c (not '?'), a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, pair them up by taking the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. For example, for color 'a', we can pair the first k left 'a's with the first k right 'a's, where k is the min.\n\nOnce that is done, we can mark those left and right boots as used.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those that are not yet paired), we can collect all the left boots that are either '?', or have a color that couldn't be matched with a right boot of same color. Similarly for the right.\n\nThen, for these remaining, we need to pair them. Since any left can be paired with any right, but each can be used once.\n\nSo for this step, we can collect all the remaining left boots (as a list) and remaining right boots (as a list), and pair them in any way, as long as each is used once.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left and right boots?\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Initialize two arrays (or sets) to track whether a left or right boot has been used.\n\n- For each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   - collect all left boots with color c that are not yet used.\n\n   - collect all right boots with color c that are not yet used.\n\n   - pair as many as possible (min of the two lists), and mark them as used.\n\nThen, after processing all colors, collect the remaining left boots (those not used) and remaining right boots (those not used). Then, pair them in any way, as long as each is used once.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left and right boots?\n\nBut in this approach, the remaining left and right boots would consist of:\n\n- All left boots with color '?' that were not used in step 1.\n\n- All left boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired (because the right boots with that color were all used up).\n\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nSo, for the second step, we can collect all remaining left boots and remaining right boots. Then, pair them in any way. For example, pair the first remaining left with the first remaining right, etc.\n\nBut how to collect those remaining left and right boots?\n\nLet me think of data structures. For example, for the left boots, we can have a list of indices, and for each color, we can collect the indices. But perhaps during the first step, when we process each color, we can pair the left and right boots.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can have two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for each color c (from 'a' to 'z'):\n\n   left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n\n   k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for j in 0 to k-1:\n\n       pair left_list[j] with right_list[j]\n\n       mark left_used[left_list[j]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_list[j]] = True\n\nOnce that is done, for the remaining left and right boots (those not marked as used), collect them into two separate lists: remaining_left and remaining_right.\n\nThen, pair them as much as possible. The number of pairs here is min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right)). So for each i from 0 to min(len(...))-1, pair remaining_left[i] with remaining_right[i].\n\nBut how to collect the remaining_left and remaining_right?\n\nYes, for example, after processing all the colors, we can loop through all the left boots, and collect those not used. Same for the right.\n\nBut this approach would work, but for large n, it's O(n * 26), which is acceptable since 150,000 * 26 is around 3.9 million operations. Which is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for each color, generating the lists of left and right indices may be expensive. So perhaps, for each color, we can precompute the list of left and right indices, and then process them.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices.\n\nBut for code, perhaps the following steps:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as lists of False.\n\nCreate a list of pairs.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used.\n\n   pair them up, as many as possible.\n\nOnce that is done, collect the remaining left and right indices (those not used). Then, pair them in any way.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left and right indices?\n\nAfter the first step, for the remaining, we can loop through all the left boots and check if they are not used. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut this would be O(n) time.\n\nOnce we have the remaining_left and remaining_right lists, then for each i in 0 to len(remaining_left) - 1 and same for remaining_right, we can pair them.\n\nBut for example, if len(remaining_left) is 5 and len(remaining_right) is 7, then we can pair the first 5 of the remaining_left with the first 5 of remaining_right.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining_left and remaining_right?\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nl = input().strip()\n\nr = input().strip()\n\nleft_used = [False]*n\n\nright_used = [False]*n\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    # collect left indices with color c not used\n\n    left_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n\n            left_list.append(i)\n\n    # collect right indices with color c not used\n\n    right_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c:\n\n            right_list.append(i)\n\n    # pair them up\n\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for j in range(k):\n\n        a = left_list[j]\n\n        b = right_list[j]\n\n        pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n        left_used[a] = True\n\n        right_used[b] = True\n\n# Now collect remaining left and right\n\nremaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i]]\n\nremaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i]]\n\n# pair as much as possible\n\nk = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right))\n\nfor j in range(k):\n\n    a = remaining_left[j]\n\n    b = remaining_right[j]\n\n    pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n    left_used[a] = True\n\n    right_used[b] = True\n\nprint(len(pairs))\n\nfor a, b in pairs:\n\n    print(a, b)\n\nWait, but this code would not work correctly. Because in the first step, for each color, we collect the left and right indices. But the code for collecting left and right indices is O(n) per color, which is 26 * O(n) time. For n=150,000, that's 3.9 million steps, which should be manageable.\n\nBut in practice, for Python, this may be slow. However, given that the constraints are up to 150,000, perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about the example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output is 5.\n\nLet me see what the code would do.\n\nFor each color in a-z, process.\n\nFor example, let's look at the first sample input:\n\nl = \"codeforces\"\n\nr = \"dodivthree\"\n\nLet me think about the letters.\n\nBut perhaps the code would pair the specific colors first, and then the remaining question marks. Wait, but in this case, there are no question marks in the input. So the code would pair as many as possible.\n\nBut the sample output is 5. So perhaps the code would find 5 pairs.\n\nBut I think the code would work for that.\n\nBut what about the case where there are question marks?\n\nAnother example: suppose a left boot is '?', and a right boot is 'a'. Then, during the first step, when processing color 'a', the code would collect the left boots with color 'a' (none) and the right boots with color 'a' (some). So the left '?' would not be processed here. Then, in the remaining step, the code would pair the '?' with the 'a' (since they are in the remaining lists).\n\nYes. So the code would pair them.\n\nBut in the code, the first step processes all colors except '?', so the '?' are left for the remaining step.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where a left boot is '?' and a right boot is '?'. They would be paired in the second step.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple possibilities. For example, a left '?' and a right 'a' can be paired, and a left 'a' and a right '?'. Which one to pair first?\n\nIn the code, during the first step, the code would process color 'a' and pair left 'a's with right 'a's. The left '?' would not be considered here. So during the first step, the left 'a's and right 'a's are paired. Then, during the second step, the remaining left '?' and right '?' would be paired.\n\nBut suppose there is a left 'a' (unpaired) and a right '?'. Then, during the second step, the code would pair them.\n\nYes. So the code would handle that.\n\nBut the code is correct?\n\nYes. Because the first step pairs as many specific color matches as possible. Then, the remaining are paired in any way, which includes using the '?'s as wildcards.\n\nBut why is this approach optimal?\n\nBecause the first step pairs all possible specific color matches, which are required for maximum pairs. Then, the remaining can be paired in any way, which is optimal because the number of pairs is the minimum between the remaining left and right.\n\nBut is this approach optimal?\n\nSuppose there's a scenario where pairing some specific color with a '?' would allow more pairs overall. For example:\n\nLeft: [a, ?]\n\nRight: [?, a]\n\nIn the first step, the code would process color 'a' and pair the left 'a' with the right 'a' (if possible). But in this case, the right 'a' is in the right list. So the code would pair left[0] with right[1]. Then, the remaining left is [1], and right is [0]. Then, they are paired. So total 2 pairs. Which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the code didn't pair the left 'a' with the right 'a' and instead paired left 'a' with right '?', and left '?' with right 'a', then also 2 pairs.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nAnother example: Left has two 'a's, right has one 'a' and one '?'. The code would pair one 'a' with 'a', then in the remaining step, the left 'a' and the right '?' would be paired. Total 2 pairs. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code must be written in Python, and handle the input and output.\n\nBut in the code, for the first part, for each color in 'a' to 'z', we loop through all n elements each time. For n=150,000, and 26 letters, that's 3.9 million steps. Which should be acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way. For example, precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices. But for code simplicity, perhaps the code as written is acceptable.\n\nNow, considering the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor each color, process. For example, 'c' appears in l (position 0?), and in r?\n\nBut perhaps the code would find some matches.\n\nBut the output is 5, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the third one, which outputs 0. For example, perhaps the left and right strings have no compatible pairs.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code must read from stdin. But note that the input for the problem is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user provided an example input with multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains n, then the second line is l, third is r.\n\nBut in the sample input provided by the user, the first input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nWhich seems like four separate test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is one test case. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but the actual problem expects that each input is a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains l.\n\nThe third line contains r.\n\nSo the sample input given by the user is probably incorrect. However, in the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output:\n\n5\n\n...\n\nBut the user's example shows multiple inputs. However, in the actual programming problem, the code must read one test case per run.\n\nBut in the code, the user's code must read from stdin. So the code must read n, then l, then r.\n\nBut in the sample input given by the user, perhaps they provided multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects one per run.\n\nSo the code must read n, then l, then r.\n\nThus, the code should read:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead l from input.\n\nRead r from input.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nl = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nr = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut need to be careful with leading/trailing whitespaces, but the problem says that the strings are of length n, so the input lines for l and r are exactly of length n.\n\nSo, the code would be as follows.\n\nBut the code must be written to read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nNow, the code as outlined before would be:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as lists of False.\n\nCollect pairs.\n\nLoop over each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left indices with that color and not used.\n\n   collect right indices with that color and not used.\n\n   pair them up.\n\nThen collect remaining left and right, and pair them.\n\nBut in Python, for each color, looping through all n elements each time is O(26n) time.\n\nBut for n=150,000, that's 3.9 million steps, which is manageable.\n\nNow, testing for the case where there are '?'.\n\nBut in the first step, the code ignores the '?', since the loop is over 'a' to 'z'.\n\nSo, the code for the first step would process all specific colors. Then, the remaining left and right boots include the '?'s.\n\nIn the second step, the code pairs the remaining left and right boots.\n\nBut for example, if there are 3 left '?' and 2 right '?', then 2 pairs are formed.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the pairs is stored as (a+1, b+1), since the problem uses 1-based indices.\n\nNow, the code will generate the pairs correctly.\n\nBut what about the order of the pairs? The problem says that any correct answer is acceptable.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input given in the problem.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output is 5.\n\nBut how does the code compute that?\n\nLet me think. For example, the l string is 'codeforces' which is c o d e f o r c e s.\n\nThe r string is 'dodivthree' which is d o d i v t h r e e.\n\nLet me think about the colors.\n\nFor each color, the code would pair as much as possible.\n\nFor example, for color 'c':\n\nl has positions 0 and 7 (assuming 0-based index). r has position 0 (d?), no. Let me check the r string.\n\nWait, r is 'dodivthree' which is:\n\nIndices 0: d\n\n1: o\n\n2: d\n\n3: i\n\n4: v\n\n5: t\n\n6: h\n\n7: r\n\n8: e\n\n9: e.\n\nSo for color 'c', the right string has no 'c's. So during the first step, for color 'c', the left has two entries, but right has none. So nothing is paired here.\n\nFor color 'o' in l:\n\nIn l, 'o' is at positions 1 and 5 (assuming codeforces is c o d e f o r c e s).\n\nIn the right string, 'o' is at position 1. So during processing color 'o', left_list has 1 and 5 (assuming not used yet), and right_list has 1. So min(2, 1) = 1 pair. So pair left 1 with right 1. Then, left 5 remains.\n\nSimilarly for other colors.\n\nBut regardless, the code would generate the pairs.\n\nNow, the code's output is correct.\n\nAnother test case is when there are question marks. For example, the fourth input in the sample:\n\nn=10\n\nl = code??????\n\nr = ??????test\n\nThe output is 10 pairs. Which makes sense, because all left and right can be paired. The code would pair the specific colors first, but since l is code followed by 6 '?', and r is 6 '?' followed by test. So the code would pair the 'c', 'o', 'd', 'e' in l with the corresponding letters in r (if any). But in r, the first 6 are '?', so during the first step, for each color in 'a' to 'z', the code would process. For example, 'c' in l is present. The r has no 'c's. So during the first step, no pairs. Then, after that, all left and right are in the remaining lists. So the code would pair them all, giving 10 pairs.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut in Python, for each color, looping through all n elements for left and right is O(n) per color, which is O(26n) time. For n=150,000, that's acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize this by precomputing for each color, the list of indices. For example, for each color c, have a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, during processing, we can iterate through these lists. However, in Python, for the initial code, it's easier to process as written.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the code would be:\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as lists of False.\n\npairs = list()\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_list.append(i)\n    right_list = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c:\n            right_list.append(i)\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for j in range(k):\n        a = left_list[j]\n        b = right_list[j]\n        pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n        left_used[a] = True\n        right_used[b] = True\n\nremaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i]]\nremaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i]]\n\nk = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right))\nfor j in range(k):\n    a = remaining_left[j]\n    b = remaining_right[j]\n    pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n    left_used[a] = True\n    right_used[b] = True\n\nprint(len(pairs))\nfor a, b in pairs:\n    print(a, b)\n\nBut in Python, for n=150,000, this code may be too slow, because for each color, we are looping through all n elements. For example, for 26 colors, that's 26 * 150,000 * 2 = 7.8 million operations. Which may be acceptable, but perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternative approach: precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices. Then, for each color, process the lists.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can precompute for each color c, a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, during the first step, for each color, we can process the left and right lists, and pair them up.\n\nBut even with that, the code would have to process all colors.\n\nBut perhaps, for the first step, we can process the colors in a way that for each color, we have the list of left and right indices.\n\nBut perhaps in Python, the code as written is acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about the code for the first part. For example, for each color, we can collect the left indices and right indices. However, during the first step, the left_used and right_used are updated. So for each color, when we process it, we have to collect only the indices that are not used yet.\n\nBut the code as written does that.\n\nAnother optimization: for each color, collect all the left and right indices once, and then during the first step, process them. However, since the code is written as per the current approach, perhaps it's better to proceed.\n\nBut for Python, perhaps the code is too slow for n=150,000. Let's think about how to optimize.\n\nAlternative approach: for each color, collect all the left indices and right indices, and then during the first step, process them. But during the processing, we can track which ones are used.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative idea is to use pointers. For example, for each color, we have a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, during the first step, for each color, we pair the first k elements of the left and right lists, where k is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)), and mark them as used. But how to track which ones are used? Well, perhaps we can have for each color, a pointer indicating how many have been used so far.\n\nBut this requires pre-processing for each color.\n\nBut perhaps this is more efficient.\n\nFor example, for each color c, precompute left_indices[c] = list of indices where l[i] == c. Similarly for right_indices[c].\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_ptr = 0\n\n   right_ptr = 0\n\n   while left_ptr < len(left_indices[c]) and right_ptr < len(right_indices[c]):\n\n       if left_used[left_indices[c][left_ptr]] is False and right_used[right_indices[c][right_ptr]] is False:\n\n           pair them, mark as used.\n\n           left_ptr += 1\n\n           right_ptr += 1\n\n       else:\n\n           # move the pointer which is already used.\n\n           if left_used[left_indices[c][left_ptr]] is True:\n\n               left_ptr +=1\n\n           else:\n\n               right_ptr +=1\n\nBut this seems more complex, and perhaps not better.\n\nAlternatively, during the first step, for each color, we can process all left and right indices for that color, and pair them up, but only if they are not used yet.\n\nBut in the original code, for each color, we loop through all n elements. Which for each color is O(n) time. For 26 colors, O(26n) time.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, for Python, this is too slow. For example, for n=150,000, 26*150,000 = 3.9 million steps. For each step, checking if not used and l[i] == c.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize this by precomputing for each color, the list of indices. For example:\n\npre_left = defaultdict(list)\n\npre_right = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    pre_left[l[i]].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    pre_right[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = pre_left[c]\n\n   right_list = pre_right[c]\n\n   for j in range(min(len(left_list), len(right_list))):\n\n       a = left_list[j]\n\n       b = right_list[j]\n\n       if not left_used[a] and not right_used[b]:\n\n           pairs.append( ... )\n\n           mark as used.\n\nBut this is not correct, because during the processing of color c, some of the left_list[j] may have already been used in previous steps. For example, if a left boot was processed for color 'a' and paired, then during processing color 'b', the same left boot is not considered again.\n\nBut the code for this approach would be:\n\npre_left = defaultdict(list)\n\npre_right = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    pre_left[l[i]].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    pre_right[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = pre_left[c]\n\n   right_list = pre_right[c]\n\n   # Now, for each element in left_list and right_list, check if they are not used.\n\n   # Pair as many as possible.\n\n   # But how?\n\n   # We can have two pointers, i and j, starting from 0.\n\n   i = 0\n\n   j = 0\n\n   while i < len(left_list) and j < len(right_list):\n\n       a = left_list[i]\n\n       b = right_list[j]\n\n       if not left_used[a] and not right_used[b]:\n\n           pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n           left_used[a] = True\n\n           right_used[b] = True\n\n           i +=1\n\n           j +=1\n\n       elif left_used[a]:\n\n           i +=1\n\n       elif right_used[b]:\n\n           j +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           # both are used? Not possible.\n\n           pass\n\nThis approach would avoid looping through all n elements for each color. Instead, for each color, we process the precomputed list of left and right indices, and check if they are used. This may be faster.\n\nBut for example, if a color c has a lot of indices, but many of them are already used, this approach would skip them quickly.\n\nBut for the worst case, it's still O(n) per color. But perhaps in practice, it's faster.\n\nBut for the code, this approach may be better.\n\nLet me think about the code.\n\npre_left and pre_right can be built once.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = pre_left.get(c, [])\n\n   right_list = pre_right.get(c, [])\n\n   i = 0\n\n   j = 0\n\n   while i < len(left_list) and j < len(right_list):\n\n       a = left_list[i]\n\n       b = right_list[j]\n\n       if not left_used[a] and not right_used[b]:\n\n           pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n           left_used[a] = True\n\n           right_used[b] = True\n\n           i += 1\n\n           j += 1\n\n       elif left_used[a]:\n\n           i += 1\n\n       elif right_used[b]:\n\n           j += 1\n\n       else:\n\n           # both are not used, but somehow not compatible? No, because we are checking for same color.\n\n           # Wait, no. The left and right lists are for color c. So, the a is color c, and b is color c. So, they are compatible. So, why are they not paired?\n\n           # Because perhaps the left_used[a] is False and right_used[b] is False, but the code is not pairing them? No, the code checks if they are not used, and if so, pairs them.\n\n           # So this else case shouldn't happen. So perhaps the code can be simplified.\n\nBut in any",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to pair left and right boots based on their colors, where each boot can either have a specific color or be an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The goal is to maximize the number of compatible pairs, where a specific color is compatible with itself, and an indefinite color is compatible with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing**: First, we preprocess the input strings to collect indices of each color for both left and right boots. This helps in efficiently accessing the indices for each color.\n2. **Color Matching**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), we attempt to pair left boots with right boots of the same color. This ensures that all specific color matches are made first.\n3. **Wildcard Matching**: After handling specific color matches, we handle the remaining boots that could not be paired. These include boots with indefinite colors ('?') and any leftover boots from specific colors that couldn't find a match. We pair these remaining boots in any order since indefinite colors can match any other color.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    left_used = [False] * n\n    right_used = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n    \n    # Preprocess left and right indices for each color\n    pre_left = defaultdict(list)\n    pre_right = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(n):\n        pre_left[l[i]].append(i)\n    for i in range(n):\n        pre_right[r[i]].append(i)\n    \n    # Process each color from 'a' to 'z'\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        left_list = pre_left.get(c, [])\n        right_list = pre_right.get(c, [])\n        i = j = 0\n        while i < len(left_list) and j < len(right_list):\n            a = left_list[i]\n            b = right_list[j]\n            if not left_used[a] and not right_used[b]:\n                pairs.append((a + 1, b + 1))\n                left_used[a] = True\n                right_used[b] = True\n                i += 1\n                j += 1\n            elif left_used[a]:\n                i += 1\n            elif right_used[b]:\n                j += 1\n            else:\n                # This case shouldn't happen as both are unused\n                i += 1\n                j += 1\n    \n    # Collect remaining left and right boots\n    remaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i]]\n    remaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i]]\n    \n    # Pair remaining boots\n    k = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right))\n    for j in range(k):\n        a = remaining_left[j]\n        b = remaining_right[j]\n        pairs.append((a + 1, b + 1))\n        left_used[a] = True\n        right_used[b] = True\n    \n    print(len(pairs))\n    for a, b in pairs:\n        print(a, b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Preprocessing**: We use dictionaries to store indices of each color for both left and right boots.
