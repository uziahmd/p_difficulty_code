Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. But wait, the problem says both diagonals must have the same letters. So, for example, all cells in both diagonals must be the same as each other? Or each diagonal can have their own letter, but both diagonals must have the same letters?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So that means all the cells in the two diagonals must be the same. So for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the other diagonal also has 'x', then that's okay. But if one diagonal has 'x' and the other has 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo first step: collect all the cells in the two diagonals. Check that they are all the same character.\n\nThen, check all the other cells (not on the diagonals) are the same character, and that this character is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check that all diagonal cells are the same. Let's call this char D.\n2. Check that all non-diagonal cells are the same. Let's call this char N.\n3. Check that D != N.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal cells and non-diagonal cells?\n\nLet me think about the indices. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if either of these conditions is true, it's part of the diagonals. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo for all cells (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1 → part of diagonals.\n\nElse → part of non-diagonals.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters in the diagonals. Check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters, check they are all same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think about the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\n- Collect all the diagonal characters. For each cell (i,j) where i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\n- Collect all the non-diagonal characters.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck that all diagonal characters are the same. Let's say the first diagonal character is D. Then all others must be equal to D.\n\nSimilarly for non-diagonal: first non-diagonal character is N, all others must be equal to N.\n\nAlso, D must not equal N.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal characters? Well, since n is at least 3. For example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells (since the center cell is in both diagonals). Wait, for n=3, the number of cells in the diagonals is 2n - 1. Because for each diagonal, there's n cells, but the overlapping cell is counted once. So total is 2n - 1.\n\nSo for n=3, 2*3 -1 =5 cells in diagonals. The total cells is 9, so non-diagonal is 4 cells.\n\nSo in any case, for n >=3, there are some non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead the grid.\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nCollect all the characters in diagonals. Let's get the first character (say, first cell (0,0)), then check that all other diagonal cells are same as this.\n\nThen collect all non-diagonal characters. Check that all are same as each other, and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think of code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            # part of diagonal\n\n        else:\n\n            # part of non-diagonal\n\nSo, first, collect all diagonal characters. Let's take the first one as D. Then check that all others are same as D.\n\nBut what if the grid is empty? Well, n is at least 3, so there are cells.\n\nBut for example, for the first diagonal cell (0,0), if the grid is empty? No, n is at least 3, so grid is not empty.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nInitialize diagonal_chars as a set. Or perhaps, check that all are same as the first one.\n\nBut perhaps better to collect all the diagonal characters and check that they are all the same.\n\nSame for non-diagonal.\n\nSo:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, if len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars → return YES.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient. Because for example, if the diagonals have all same letters, and non-diagonals have all same letters, but the two are same. Then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n- All diagonals are same (len(diagonal_chars) == 1)\n\n- All non-diagonals are same (len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1)\n\n- The two sets are different.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1:\n\n    if diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n ≥3, the non-diagonal cells exist. For example, when n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, the non_diagonal_chars will have at least one element.\n\nSo, this approach should work.\n\nBut wait, how about the case where the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3, and for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So no, the non_diagonal_chars can't be empty.\n\nSo, the code can proceed with this logic.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal and non-diagonal chars?\n\nBut in Python, for the grid, each row is a string. So, for grid[i][j], it's the j-th character of the i-th row.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nLet's check the diagonals.\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\ni=0, j=0 → diagonal (i==j)\n\ni=0, j=4 → i + j = 4 → n-1 is 4 (since n=5). So yes.\n\nSimilarly, for i=1, j=1 → diagonal. i=1, j=3 → 1+3=4 → yes.\n\ni=2, j=2 → yes. i=2, j=2 → yes. Also, for i=2, j=2 is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo for the diagonals, the characters are:\n\nRow 0: x (0,0), x (0,4)\n\nRow 1: x (1,1), x (1,3)\n\nRow 2: x (2,2)\n\nRow 3: x (3,1), x (3,3)\n\nRow 4: x (4,0), x (4,4)\n\nWait, but looking at row 2, the cell (2,2) is 'x'? Let me check the input:\n\nThe third line is 'soxoo' → row 2 is s o x o o. So (2,2) is x. Yes.\n\nSo the diagonals are all x's. So diagonal_chars is {'x'}.\n\nNow, the non-diagonal cells. Let's look for any cell not on the diagonals.\n\nFor example, cell (0,1): o. Cell (0,2): o. Cell (0,3): o. Cell (1,0): o. Cell (1,2): o. Cell (2,0): s. Cell (2,1): o. Cell (2,3): o. Cell (2,4): o. Cell (3,0): o. Cell (3,2): o. Cell (4,1): o. Cell (4,2): o. Cell (4,3): o.\n\nWait, but in row 2, cell (2,0) is 's' (from 'soxoo'). So that's a non-diagonal cell. So non_diagonal_chars includes 's' and 'o'?\n\nSo the non-diagonal characters would have 's' and 'o', so len(non_diagonal_chars) is 2, which is more than 1. So the answer would be NO, which matches the first sample output.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0) → w, (0,2) → w.\n\ncells (1,1) → w.\n\ncells (2,0) → w, (2,2) → w.\n\nSo all diagonals are 'w'.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are:\n\ncells (0,1) → s.\n\ncells (1,0) → s.\n\ncells (1,2) → s.\n\ncells (2,1) → s.\n\nSo non_diagonal_chars is {'s'}, which is different from 'w'. So the answer is YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) → x, (0,2) →x.\n\ncells (1,1) →x.\n\ncells (2,0) →x, (2,2) →e.\n\nWait, for cell (2,2), i=2, j=2. i+j=4, which for n=3 is 2+2=4, which is not equal to n-1 (which is 2). Wait, n=3, n-1 is 2. So for cell (2,2), i + j = 4? No, 2 + 2 = 4? No, 2 + 2 is 4? Wait n is 3, so i and j are 0-based. For i=2 and j=2, i + j = 4. But n-1 is 2. So 4 != 2. So this cell is not on the diagonal. Wait, but for n=3, the other diagonal is from (0,2) to (2,0). So for cell (i,j) in that diagonal, i + j = 2 (since n-1 is 2). For example, (0,2) → 0+2=2. (1,1) → 2. (2,0) → 2. So cell (2,2) is not part of the diagonal. So for the third sample input, the diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)? Wait no. (2,2) is not part of the diagonals. Let me recheck.\n\nFor cell (i,j) to be on the main diagonal (i == j) or on the other diagonal (i + j == n-1).\n\nFor n=3, n-1 is 2.\n\nSo for cell (2,2): i == j → yes (2 == 2). So it's on the main diagonal. So that cell is part of the diagonals. Oh right! So (2,2) is part of the main diagonal. So in the third sample input, the diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) → x, (0,2) →x, (1,1) →x, (2,0) →x, (2,2) →e. So the diagonals have x, x, x, x, e. So the diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2. So the code returns NO, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code approach seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the third sample input, the diagonals have x and e. So the code would collect the diagonal characters as {x, e}, so len is 2. So the code returns NO.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\nIn Python, for each cell, check if i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nSo:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n ≥3, the non-diagonal cells exist. For example, when n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So the non_diagonal_chars will have at least one element.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 5, with the grid as described. The diagonal_chars is {'x'}, non_diagonal_chars has 's' and 'o' (because in row 2, cell (2,0) is 's' which is non-diagonal). So len(non_diagonal_chars) is 2, so returns NO.\n\nSample 2: 3, grid is wsw, sws, wsw. The diagonals are all 'w's. The non-diagonal chars are 's's. So returns YES.\n\nSample 3: 3, grid is xpx, pxp, xpe. The diagonals include (2,2) which is e. So diagonal_chars is {'x', 'e'}, len is 2. So returns NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nBut what about cases where the diagonals are all same, but non-diagonal has same as diagonals?\n\nLike, for example, a grid where all cells are same. Then diagonals and non-diagonal are same. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are all 'a', non-diagonal are all 'a' → returns NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are all 'a', non-diagonal are all 'b' → returns YES.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Then n lines follow, each with n letters.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nWait, but in the actual input, the user would input each test case. However, the problem says that the code should read from standard input. However, the sample input shows that the code is given multiple test cases. Wait, no. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but in reality, the code should process a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, the actual code needs to read from stdin. So for example, for the first test case, the input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen for the second test case, the input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nAnd third test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nBut the problem says that the code must read from stdin. So the code is supposed to process one test case. So the sample input shows three test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case per run.\n\nWait, but the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So the code is supposed to process a single test case. So the sample input is for multiple test cases, but in the actual programming competition problem, each input is a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Then n lines follow.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. The sample input shows three test cases, but perhaps that's for the example of multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So for example, in the sample input, the code would process each of the three test cases, but the problem's actual input is one test case.\n\nWait, no. The sample input shows that the code is given multiple test cases. But in the problem statement's input description, it's not clear. However, looking at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nWhich suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement's input description, it says that the first line contains n. Which implies that each test case is processed separately.\n\nBut this is conflicting. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents three separate test cases. For example, the first input is for the first test case, the second is for the second, etc. But in practice, the code should read a single test case. But how?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. So the sample input is presented as three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. However, in the sample input, the code is given three test cases, and the output is three answers. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But that's not clear from the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the sample input and output show that the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem may not be like that. Wait, looking back at the problem's input and output description:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nThe output is to print \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, but the sample output shows three answers. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, this is not clear. But in the problem statement's sample input, the first line is a list of inputs. But perhaps the original problem is such that each test case is given in the input, and the code should process all test cases.\n\nBut this is conflicting with the problem's input description. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list of multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. However, in the problem's sample input and output, the code is given multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to know?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of three inputs. The sample output is a list of three outputs. But in the problem's actual input, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original source (if any), perhaps it's from Codeforces or similar. For example, in Codeforces, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not mention it. However, in this problem's input description, the code is supposed to read one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is the first test case. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich is the first input in the list. Then the second test case is 3 followed by three lines, etc.\n\nBut how can the code process multiple test cases? The problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input may not specify that. This is a problem.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement:\n\nThe user says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code must read from stdin, which for the sample input, would be multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual input is one test case. For example, the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. But then why does the sample output have three entries?\n\nThis is confusing. However, the original problem's sample input and output may be in the format where multiple test cases are provided. For example, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, but the problem's input description didn't mention it. However, looking at the sample input and output, it's possible that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how can we know? Let's look at the problem's sample input and output again:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nThis looks like the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, which suggests that it's a single test case.\n\nBut this is a contradiction. How to resolve it?\n\nWell, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the number of test cases, but that's not mentioned in the problem statement. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as a separate input, but the code is supposed to read one test case. But then the sample output would have three entries. That's impossible unless the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's sample input is incorrect. But given that the user provided the sample input and output, and the code must pass those tests, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me check the original problem's source. However, I don't have access to that. So perhaps the problem is from Codeforces. Let me think of similar problems.\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of inputs. For example, the first input is for a 5x5 grid, then another for 3x3, etc. And the output is for each of these.\n\nBut in programming competition problems, the input is usually given as a single test case. Unless the problem says that there are multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nWhich implies that the input is one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut the user's note says that the sample input is given as a list, but the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, but the problem statement didn't mention it. However, the sample input and output suggest that.\n\nBut how can we know?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the number of test cases. For example, the first line is 3, then three test cases follow. But the sample input shows that the first line is '5', which is n for the first test case.\n\nSo this is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is three answers. So the code should process multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n. So perhaps the code should process one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as a separate input, but the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample output has three entries, which suggests that the code is supposed to process three test cases. But how?\n\nThis is a critical point. If the code is supposed to process one test case, then the sample input and output are not matching. However, the user's note says that the sample input is given as a list of inputs, and the output as a list of outputs. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, and for each, output the result.\n\nBut how to read multiple test cases.\n\nIn programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. But the problem's input description may not mention it. However, given the sample input and output, it's likely that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them?\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from stdin, split into test cases.\n\nBut how to parse that?\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThen third:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the code should read until there is no more input.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nThe code can read all lines from stdin, and process them as per test cases.\n\nBut how to split them into test cases?\n\nEach test case starts with an integer n, then n lines of n characters.\n\nSo, for example, the code can read all lines into a list, then process them sequentially.\n\nFor example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen, process the lines as follows:\n\ncurrent = 0\n\nwhile current < len(lines):\n\n    n = int(lines[current])\n\n    current += 1\n\n    grid = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        grid.append(lines[current])\n\n        current += 1\n\n    # process grid\n\nBut this would handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, it's not mentioned. However, given the sample input and output, this is the only way to make sense of it.\n\nBut the user's problem says that the code should read from standard input, and the sample input is given as a list of test cases. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, perhaps it's not the case. However, based on the sample input and output, this is the only way to proceed.\n\nBut the user's problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\".\n\nSo the input is one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut the user's sample input and output shows that the code should process multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem statement is missing that information. Or perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to resolve this?\n\nWell, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. Because the sample input has three test cases and the output has three answers. So the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle that in code.\n\nSo, assuming that the code must process multiple test cases, the code should read all test cases from input, and for each, output YES or NO.\n\nSo, the code will read all lines from stdin, and process them as per the test cases.\n\nSo, the code will read n, then read n lines for the grid, then repeat until all input is processed.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n\n            idx += 1\n\n        # process grid here\n\n        # compute diagonal and non-diagonal chars\n\n        diagonal_chars = set()\n\n        non_diagonal_chars = set()\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n                    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n                else:\n\n                    non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        if len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1:\n\n            if diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n            else:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, the code for the sample input would process each test case.\n\nLet's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nThe code processes the first test case, which returns NO. Then the second test case returns YES, third returns NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this code would handle the sample input correctly.\n\nBut what if the input is only one test case?\n\nYes, the code would handle that.\n\nBut what about the case where the code reads a line that is not a number? Well, the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n ≥3, there are non-diagonal cells. For example, n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4.\n\nBut for n=1, but n is at least 3, so no.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, test the second sample input:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0) = 'w', (0,2) = 'w'; (1,1) = 'w'; (2,0) = 'w', (2,2) = 'w'.\n\nSo diagonal_chars is {'w'}, non-diagonal cells are (0,1) 's', (1,0) 's', (1,2) 's', (2,1) 's'. So non_diagonal_chars is {'s'}, which is different. So output is YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0) = x, (0,2) = x; (1,1) = x; (2,0) = x, (2,2) = e. So diagonal_chars is {'x', 'e'}, so len is 2 → output NO.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all cells are 'a'. Then diagonal and non-diagonal are 'a', so output is NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'b' → output YES.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nSo, the code should be written as such.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, it says that the first line contains n. So why is the sample input showing multiple test cases? Perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement didn't mention it. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, perhaps it's a single test case. But the user's sample shows multiple test cases. So the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code as written above should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The grid must have all letters on both diagonals the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same but different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all input lines at once and process them sequentially.\n2. **Grid Processing**: For each test case, read the grid dimensions and the grid itself.\n3. **Diagonal and Non-diagonal Check**: \n   - Collect all characters from the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where the sum of row and column indices equals the grid size minus one).\n   - Collect all characters that are not on these diagonals.\n4. **Validation**: \n   - Ensure all characters on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Ensure all non-diagonal characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n            idx += 1\n        diagonal_chars = set()\n        non_diagonal_chars = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n                else:\n                    non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        if len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1:\n            if diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing.\n- **Grid Processing**: Each test case starts with reading the grid size `n`, followed by reading `n` lines representing the grid.\n- **Character Collection**: We use sets to collect characters from the diagonals and non-diagonals. This helps in efficiently checking if all characters in each set are the same.\n- **Validation Checks**: By checking the length of the sets, we ensure all characters in the diagonals and non-diagonals are uniform. If both sets have exactly one unique character and they are different, the grid forms an \"X\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently validate the grid structure with minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
