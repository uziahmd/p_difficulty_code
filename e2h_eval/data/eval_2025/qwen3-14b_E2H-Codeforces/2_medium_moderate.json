Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check if all the cells in both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check if all the non-diagonal cells are the same and not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal cells. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, check if it's on either of the two diagonals. For a cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if either of those conditions is true, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think:\n\nLoop through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it is on a diagonal. If yes, add to diagonal_chars. Else, add to other_chars.\n\nOnce I have these two lists, check:\n\n- All elements in diagonal_chars are the same.\n- All elements in other_chars are the same.\n- The two characters are different.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no other_chars? Like when n=1? But according to input constraints, n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are cells not on the diagonals. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center is on both diagonals, but the other cells are on the diagonals? Wait no. Let me think: For n=3, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The other diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the cell (1,1) is part of both. So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are the ones that are not on either diagonal. For example, (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Wait, let's check for each cell:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: main diagonal. i=0, j=1: i + j = 1, which is n-1 (since n=3, n-1=2). No. So not on any diagonal. So that cell is non-diagonal. Similarly for others.\n\nSo for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are those that are not on either of the diagonals. So for each cell, check if it is on either of the diagonals. If not, then it's part of the other_chars.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n.\n- Read the grid as a list of strings.\n- Initialize two sets: diagonal_chars and other_chars.\n- For each i in 0 to n-1:\n   for each j in 0 to n-1:\n      if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n          add grid[i][j] to diagonal_chars\n      else:\n          add grid[i][j] to other_chars\n- Then check:\n   if all elements in diagonal_chars are same, and all elements in other_chars are same, and the two are different.\n\nBut how to check that all elements in a list are same?\n\nFor example, for diagonal_chars, take the first element, then check that all others are equal to it. Similarly for other_chars.\n\nBut what if diagonal_chars is empty? Well, since n is at least 3, and for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 (since the center cell is counted twice) = 5 cells. So diagonal_chars will have at least 5 elements. So no problem.\n\nBut in code, need to handle cases where the diagonal_chars is empty? No, because n is at least 3, and for any n, the two diagonals have 2n - 1 cells (since the center cell is overlapping). For example, n=3: 2*3 -1 =5 cells. So for n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells. So diagonal_chars is not empty.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. Let's store as a list of strings, say grid.\n\nThen collect diagonal_chars and other_chars.\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) == 1 and len(set(other_chars)) == 1 and diagonal_chars[0] != other_chars[0].\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, other_chars has 4 elements (since total cells is 9, diagonals have 5, so 9-5=4). For example, in the sample input 3, the second case is 3x3 grid. So other_chars is 4 elements.\n\nBut for n=1? Not possible as per input constraints.\n\nSo code:\n\nIn Python, for each cell, check if i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines. For example, for the first sample input, the first case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo grid is a list of 5 strings.\n\nThen, collect the diagonal characters.\n\nFor each i and j:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nOnce collected, check:\n\nif all elements in diagonal_chars are same, and all in other_chars are same, and the two are different.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFor example, for diagonal_chars, check if all elements equal to the first element. Similarly for other_chars.\n\nBut what if diagonal_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3, so for n=3, the diagonals have 2*3 -1 = 5 cells. So no problem.\n\nSo code:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1: return NO\n\nelse:\n\n   d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n\nif len(set(other_chars)) != 1: return NO\n\nelse:\n\n   o_char = other_chars[0]\n\nif d_char == o_char: return NO\n\nelse: return YES\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, other_chars has 4 elements. For n=5, total cells is 25. Diagonals have 2*5 -1 =9 cells. So other_chars has 25-9=16 elements. So no problem.\n\nSo code.\n\nBut in code, how to collect the characters?\n\nIn Python:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) == 1 and len(set(other_chars)) == 1 and diagonal_chars[0] != other_chars[0]:\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, it's not. So no problem.\n\nBut in code, what if other_chars is empty? For example, n=1? But n is >=3.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: x\n\ni=0, j=4: x (since 0+4=4 = 5-1=4)\n\ni=1, j=1: o; i=1, j=3: o (1+3=4)\n\ni=2, j=2: x; i=2, j=2 (since 2+2=4? Wait n=5, n-1 is 4. So i + j =4. For i=2, j=2: 2+2=4. So yes. So (2,2) is on both diagonals.\n\ni=3, j=1: o (i=3, j=1: 3+1=4. So yes. And i=3, j=3: 3+3=6 !=4. So no. Wait, for i=3, j=3: i + j =6, which is not 4. So that cell is not on the diagonal. Wait, for n=5, the other diagonal is from (0,4) to (4,0). So for i=3, j=1: 3 +1 =4, yes. So that's part of the other diagonal.\n\nSo for the first sample input, the diagonals:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → positions (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is x. Also, (2, 2) is on both diagonals. Also, (i=2, j=2) is on main diagonal (i=j) and other diagonal (i+j=4).\n\nRow 3: o x o x o → (3,1) is x (i=3, j=1: 3+1=4). (3,3) is x (i=3, j=3: 3+3=6≠4. So no. Wait, row 3 is 'oxoxo' → indexes 0-4. So j=0: o, j=1: x, j=2: o, j=3: x, j=4: o. So for i=3, j=1: x (on other diagonal). For i=3, j=3: x. But i + j = 6, which is not 4. So that cell is not on the other diagonal. So (3,3) is not part of the diagonals. So the diagonals for row 3 would be (3,1) and (3,3)? No. Wait, for i=3, j=1 is on the other diagonal. For i=3, j=3: i == j? Yes, 3==3. So that is part of the main diagonal. So (3,3) is on main diagonal. So in this case, the main diagonal includes (3,3) and the other diagonal includes (3,1). So for the first sample input, the diagonals have:\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 → main diagonal.\n\ni=0, j=4 → other diagonal.\n\ni=1, j=1 → main.\n\ni=1, j=3 → other.\n\ni=2, j=2 → main and other.\n\ni=3, j=3 → main.\n\ni=3, j=1 → other.\n\ni=4, j=0 → other.\n\ni=4, j=4 → main.\n\nSo the diagonals have cells:\n\nx (0,0), x (0,4), x (1,1), x (1,3), x (2,2), x (3,3), x (3,1), x (4,0), x (4,4). Wait, but in row 2, the cell (2,2) is x. Row 3, j=3 is x. Row 3, j=1 is x. Row 4, j=0 is x, row 4, j=4 is x. So the diagonals have all x's? Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample input first case:\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is x.\n\nRow 3: o x o x o → (3,1) is x, (3,3) is x.\n\nRow 4: x o o o x → (4,0) is x, (4,4) is x.\n\nSo the diagonals have:\n\nLooking at all the cells in the diagonals:\n\n(0,0) x\n\n(0,4) x\n\n(1,1) x\n\n(1,3) x\n\n(2,2) x\n\n(3,1) x\n\n(3,3) x\n\n(4,0) x\n\n(4,4) x\n\nSo all of these are x. So diagonal_chars is all x's. Then the other_chars are the rest. Let's look at other cells.\n\nFor example, row 0, j=1,2,3: o, o, o. Row 1, j=0, 2,4: o, o, o. Row 2, j=0,1,3,4: s, o, o, o. Row 3, j=0,2,4: o, o, o. Row 4, j=1,2,3: o, o, o.\n\nSo other_chars includes s, o, etc. So for example, in row 2, j=0 is s. Which is not part of the diagonals. So other_chars contains s. But the other_chars should all be same. But in this case, there is an s. So the other_chars would have s and o's. So the other_chars is not all same. Hence, the first sample input returns NO, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would correctly detect that.\n\nAnother sample input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'. Let's see:\n\nn=3.\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w (since 0+2=2 =3-1=2).\n\n(1,1) w.\n\n(2,0) w, (2,2) w.\n\nSo all the diagonals are w. The other cells are:\n\n(0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So other_chars is all s. So the two characters are w and s. Different. So output is YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input is 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe.\n\nThe grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x.\n\n(1,1) x.\n\n(2,0) x, (2,2) e.\n\nWait, (2,2) is part of the main diagonal (i=2, j=2). So for the diagonals, the cells are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So the diagonal_chars are x, x, x, x, e. So the set of diagonal_chars is {x, e}, so not all same. Therefore, the code returns NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if all the diagonals are same, but other_chars are same as diagonals? For example, n=3, all cells are 'a'. Then diagonals are a, and other_chars are a. So the code returns NO, because they are same.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', other_chars are 'b'. Then returns YES.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have different letters. For example, some cells on diagonals are different. Then code returns NO.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nThe input is given as first line n, then n lines of strings.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is a list of strings, but in actual code, the input comes from stdin.\n\nBut the user says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo, in Python, read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in code, for example, in the sample input, the first case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen process.\n\nNow, collect diagonal_chars and other_chars.\n\nThen check the conditions.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) == 1 and len(set(other_chars)) == 1 and diagonal_chars[0] != other_chars[0]:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, other_chars has 4 elements. So no problem.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? For example, n=1, but n is not allowed. So code is safe.\n\nBut what if the other_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, the other_chars is 4 elements. So no.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nBut what about when the diagonals have all same characters, but other_chars have multiple characters.\n\nLike for example, in the first sample input, the other_chars has s and o's. So len(set(other_chars)) is more than 1. So code returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nThe diagonals are a, a, a, a, a (all a's). The other_chars are the middle cell (b) and others? Wait:\n\nFor n=3, the grid is:\n\nRow 0: aaa → (0,0) is a (diagonal), (0,1) is not on diagonal (i=0, j=1: 0+1=1 !=2 (n-1=2). So other_chars. (0,2) is diagonal.\n\nRow 1: aba → (1,0) is not on diagonal. (i=1, j=0: 1+0=1 !=2. (1,1) is diagonal. (1,2) is not.\n\nRow 2: aaa → (2,0) is diagonal, (2,1) not, (2,2) diagonal.\n\nSo other_chars are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So their values are a, a, b, a. So set is {a, b}. So len is 2. So code returns NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when other_chars is empty? Well, no. Because for n=3, there are 4 other cells.\n\nAnother possible case: n=5, all cells are same. Then diagonals and other chars are same. So code returns NO.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n, then read grid.\n\nBut in code, sometimes the input may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, as per problem statement. So using input().strip() is safe.\n\nBut for example, the input lines are exactly n letters. So for each line, input().strip() will get the correct string.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) == 1 and len(set(other_chars)) == 1:\n    if diagonal_chars[0] != other_chars[0]:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if diagonal_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3, and for n=3, diagonals have 5 elements. So no.\n\nBut in code, what if diagonal_chars is empty? For example, n=0? But n is at least 3.\n\nThus, code is safe.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? For example, n=1. But n is >=3.\n\nSo code is safe.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\ndiagonal_chars is all x's except for (2,2) ?\n\nWait in row 2, the third line is 'soxoo' → j=0: s, j=1: o, j=2: x, j=3: o, j=4: o.\n\nSo (i=2, j=2) is x. So yes. So all diagonal_chars are x. Then other_chars includes s, o, etc. So len(set(other_chars)) is more than 1. So code returns NO.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ndiagonal_chars:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w, (1,1) w, (2,0) w, (2,2) w → all w. other_chars: (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So set is {s} and {w}, so returns YES.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiagonal_chars:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So set is {x, e} → len(set) is 2. So code returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa → diagonals are a, a, a, a, a. other_chars are a, a, b, a → set is {a, b}. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba → diagonals: (0,0)=a, (0,2)=a, (1,1)=a, (2,0)=a, (2,2)=a. So diagonal_chars is all a. other_chars are (0,1)=b, (1,0)=b, (1,2)=a, (2,1)=b. So other_chars is [b, b, a, b]. So set is {a, b} → len is 2. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case where other_chars is all same but same as diagonal. For example, n=3:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa → diagonals are all a, other_chars are all a. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case where diagonals are same, other_chars same but same as diagonal. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case where diagonals have different letters. For example, n=3:\n\nabc\n\ndef\n\nghi → diagonals are a, f, i. So set is {a, f, i} → len is 3. So code returns NO.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
