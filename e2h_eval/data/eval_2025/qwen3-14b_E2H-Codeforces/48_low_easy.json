He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a, then b (or R), then c which is a number in base a. My job is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. Let's think about the steps involved:\n\nStep 1: Convert the input number c (given in base a) to a decimal integer.\n\nStep 2: Convert that decimal integer to the target base, which is either a regular base b or Roman numerals.\n\nSo the main challenges are:\n\n- Handling the conversion from base a to decimal. Since c can have letters (like A, B, etc.) if a is greater than 10. For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (10), B (11). But wait, the input says that c is given in base a. So when a is greater than 10, the digits in c may include letters. But how are they represented? Like, for example, in the sample input, there's a case where a is 12 and c is 'A', which would be 10 in decimal. So the code needs to parse the digits correctly.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So the input c's digits are in the same format. So for example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9, A-F.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the input string c into a decimal value. How to do that?\n\nFor example, for the input string 'A' in base 12, it's 10 in decimal. For '1111001' in base 2, it's 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + ... etc.\n\nSo the function to convert a string in base a to decimal is needed. Let's think about writing that.\n\nThen, once I have the decimal value, I need to convert it to base b. But if b is R, then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string, using letters for digits above 9.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead a and b (could be R). Then read c.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal (as an integer). Then convert that decimal to base b (or Roman).\n\nNow, let's think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c to decimal. Let's think of the input string as a sequence of characters. Each character represents a digit in base a. For example, if a is 10, then digits are 0-9. If a is 16, digits can be 0-9, A-F (uppercase?), but the problem says that the input may have leading zeros but the length is up to 10^3. So the code must handle letters in the input.\n\nBut how to parse the input string into digits. For example, the input c is a string, and each character is a digit in base a. So for each character in the string, we need to get its value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So the code can process each character by checking if it's a digit or a letter, and convert it to its numerical value.\n\nBut note that the input c may have letters in uppercase or lowercase? The problem says that in the input, the c is given as a string. But looking at the examples, for example, in the sample input, one of the cases is 'A' in base 12. So probably, the input uses uppercase letters for digits beyond 9. So the code should process the input as uppercase letters. But perhaps the input is case-insensitive? Well, the problem says that the input is given as a string, but the problem's sample input includes 'A' as a valid digit. So perhaps the code should treat the input as uppercase letters. So during processing, the code should convert the input string to uppercase, or process each character as such.\n\nSo, for each character in the input string, we can map it to its value. For example, '0' -> 0, '1' -> 1, ..., '9' ->9, 'A' ->10, 'B'->11, etc. So for a given character, we can check if it is a digit or a letter, then compute its value.\n\nSo the code for converting the input c to decimal would be something like:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    value = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        digit = int",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, where `b` could be Roman numerals. The input provides the number in base `a` as a string, and we need to output the converted number in base `b`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: First, convert the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer. This involves parsing each character of the input string, converting it to its corresponding numerical value, and then computing the decimal value using the base `a`.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Once we have the decimal value, we need to convert it to the target base `b`. If `b` is 'R', we convert the decimal value to Roman numerals. Otherwise, we convert it to the specified base `b` using standard digit representation (including letters for bases greater than 10).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        a_part = parts[0]\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        c_str = parts[2]\n        \n        a = int(a_part)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            target = 'R'\n        else:\n            target = int(b_part)\n        \n        # Convert c_str from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        \n        # Now convert to target\n        if target == 'R':\n            result = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n        else:\n            result = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, target)\n        \n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its numerical value based on the base `a`. This is done by iterating through each character and accumulating the value.\n2. **Conversion to Target Base**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal number to a specified base. For bases greater than 10, letters are used to represent values 10 and above. The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, which ensures correct formatting according to Roman numeral rules.\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads input lines, processes each line to extract the bases and the number, converts the number to decimal, and then to the target base or Roman numerals, ensuring the correct output format.",
