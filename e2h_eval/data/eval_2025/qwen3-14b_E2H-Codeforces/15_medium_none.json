They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. Each team has a unique skill level from 1 to 2^n. The tournament proceeds in phases, and each phase's matches are determined by the string s. For each phase i (starting from 1?), if s[i-1] is 0, the lower-skilled team wins; if it's 1, the higher-skilled team wins. We need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x becomes the champion.\n\nHmm. The key here is to determine for each possible x, whether there's a way to arrange the initial positions of the teams so that x ends up winning the tournament according to the rules given by s.\n\nBut how do we model the tournament structure and the selection process?\n\nLet me think about the tournament structure. It's a single-elimination bracket. Each round halves the number of teams. For example, with n=3, there are 8 teams. The first round has 4 games, then 2, then 1. The string s has length n, so for each phase (from first to nth), the rule is given.\n\nThe challenge is to find for which x there exists a permutation p (i.e., an arrangement of the teams in the initial bracket) such that x wins all its matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how can we model the path that x must take through the tournament? Because the initial bracket arrangement determines which teams x will face in each round.\n\nWait, but the problem says that p is a permutation of the skill levels. So the initial positions of the teams are arbitrary. So for x to be a winning integer, there must be some way to arrange the initial bracket so that x can win all the rounds, following the rules of each phase.\n\nSo, for each x, we need to check if there's a possible path through the tournament that allows x to reach the final, considering the rules for each phase.\n\nBut how do we model the constraints on x's path?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that in each round, depending on the phase, the winner is determined by the rule (higher or lower skill). But the initial bracket can be arranged in any way, as long as the permutation p is valid.\n\nWait, but the initial bracket arrangement is part of the permutation. So for example, in the first round, the teams are paired as (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. But the actual teams in those positions can be any of the skill levels. So the permutation p defines the order of the teams in the initial bracket.\n\nBut for x to be the winner, we need to arrange the initial bracket such that in each round, x survives according to the rules of that phase.\n\nSo perhaps we can model for each possible x, what is the minimum and maximum skill that x must have in each round to proceed. Wait, but since the rules vary per phase, maybe we can model for each round, what constraints are placed on x's opponents.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each match is a node, and the winner proceeds to the next round. The structure of the tournament is fixed (since it's a standard single elimination bracket). However, the actual teams in each position can be arranged as needed.\n\nBut the problem is to find for x, whether there's a way to arrange the initial bracket such that x can win all the required matches.\n\nLet me think about the rounds. For example, in the first phase (phase 1), there are 2^{n-1} games. Then phase 2 has 2^{n-2}, and so on until phase n (which has 1 game).\n\nEach phase corresponds to a round in the tournament. For example, phase 1 is the first round (quarterfinals if n=3), phase 2 is semifinals, etc.\n\nIn each phase i, when the matches are played, the rule is determined by s[i-1]. So during phase i, each match in that phase is decided by whether the higher or lower skill wins.\n\nNow, for x to be the champion, it must win all matches in all phases. So for each phase, the matches that x participates in must be won by x according to the rule of that phase.\n\nBut how can we model the possible opponents x could face in each phase?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. For x to reach the final, it must survive each round. In each round, x will face one opponent, and depending on the rule of that round, x must be either higher or lower than that opponent.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose which opponents x faces in each round. However, the opponents in each round are determined by the initial bracket. For example, in the first round, x is in a pair with another team. The winner of that pair proceeds to the next round, and so on.\n\nSo the problem reduces to determining for x, whether there's a way to choose opponents in each round such that:\n\n- In each round i (phase i), when x plays against its opponent, x's skill meets the condition (higher or lower) required by the rule of that phase.\n\nAdditionally, the opponents in each round must be such that they can be eliminated in previous rounds, meaning that their paths must be compatible with the rules of the tournament.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach: For each x, determine the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in each round to be able to proceed, considering the rules of each phase.\n\nBut since the rules vary per phase, perhaps we can model for each round (from the first to the nth), what constraints are placed on x's skill relative to the other teams in its path.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we want x to be the champion. Let's consider the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the rule is known (from s). Let's think about the rounds in reverse order.\n\nAlternatively, think about the path that x must take through the tournament. For example, in the first round (phase 1), x must beat one opponent. Then in phase 2, x must beat another opponent, and so on until the final phase (phase n).\n\nEach time, the opponent in phase i must be someone who can be eliminated in that phase. Also, the opponents in each phase must have been selected such that they can be eliminated in their previous rounds.\n\nBut how can we model this? For example, in phase i, the rule is either higher or lower. Let's say that during phase i, the rule is 'higher' (s[i-1] = '1'). Then, in that phase, x must have a higher skill than its opponent. So, for x to win that match, x's skill must be higher than the opponent's.\n\nBut the opponent in that phase must have survived all previous phases. So, for each phase, the opponent in that phase must have passed through the previous phases according to their rules. However, since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the opponents in each phase to be as weak as possible (or as strong as possible, depending on the rules) to allow x to proceed.\n\nWait, but the opponents in each round are determined by the bracket. For example, in the first round, x's opponent is someone else. The winner of that match proceeds to the second round. Then in the second round, x's opponent is the winner of another match from the first round, and so on.\n\nSo, for x to reach the final, in each round, the opponent must be someone that can be beaten by x according to the rule of that round.\n\nBut since the initial bracket can be arranged in any way, perhaps we can choose the opponents that x faces in each round to be as favorable as possible.\n\nFor example, in the first round (phase 1), if the rule is 'lower' (s[0] = '0'), then x must lose to the opponent. Wait no, wait: if the rule is 0, then the lower-skilled team wins. So if x is to win the first round, then x's skill must be lower than the opponent's. Wait no, that's not right. If the rule is 0, then the lower-skilled team wins. So, in that case, for x to win the match, x's skill must be lower than the opponent's. Because the lower one wins.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nIn phase i, for each match, the rule is s_i (assuming 0-based or 1-based? The problem says: \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\".\n\nSo for phase i (the i-th phase), during that phase, each match is decided by the rule s_i. So for example, in phase 1 (the first phase), the rule is s[0] (assuming the string is 0-based). For each match in that phase, the lower skill wins if s[0] is 0, or higher skill wins if it's 1.\n\nSo, for x to win a match in phase i, the following must be true:\n\nIf s[i-1] is '0', then x must have lower skill than the opponent (so x wins the match because lower skill wins).\n\nIf s[i-1] is '1', then x must have higher skill than the opponent (so x wins the match because higher skill wins).\n\nBut how can we ensure that in each phase, x's opponent is such that this condition holds?\n\nMoreover, the opponents that x faces in each phase must themselves have passed through all previous phases. For example, the opponent that x faces in phase 2 must have won their matches in phase 1, according to the rules of phase 1.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the opponents for x in each phase to be the ones that are as weak as possible (or as strong as possible) to allow x to pass.\n\nSo, the idea is to find for each x, the minimal and maximal constraints on the other teams in x's path.\n\nLet me think of this as building a set of constraints for x. For example, in each phase, the opponent must be such that:\n\nIn phase i, the opponent must have been able to reach that phase, and x must beat them according to the rule of that phase.\n\nBut how do we model the constraints on the opponents?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that for x to reach the final, in each phase i (from 1 to n), x must have a certain relationship with the opponent in that phase.\n\nLet me consider that for each round (phase), the opponent in that round must be someone that can be eliminated in that round. For example, in phase i, the opponent must have passed through the previous i-1 phases according to their rules. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the opponent in phase i to be the best possible candidate that allows x to win.\n\nSo for each phase i, the opponent must be a team that can reach phase i, and x can beat them according to the rule of phase i.\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For x to be the champion, during each phase i, x must have a certain value relative to the opponent in that phase. Let's denote the opponent in phase i as O_i.\n\nThen, for each i, the following must hold:\n\nIf s[i-1] is '0', then x < O_i (because lower skill wins).\n\nIf s[i-1] is '1', then x > O_i (because higher skill wins).\n\nMoreover, each O_i must have passed through the previous phases. For example, O_2 must have won their matches in phase 1. Similarly, O_3 must have won their matches in phase 1 and phase 2, etc.\n\nBut how do we model the constraints on O_i?\n\nLet me think for each phase. Let's think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For x to reach the final, in each round, x must have beaten an opponent. The opponents in each round must be chosen such that they are possible to reach that round given the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nSo, for each round i (phase i), the opponent O_i must be a team that can reach that round. Let's think of the constraints on O_i.\n\nLet me consider that for O_i to reach phase i, they must have passed through all previous phases. Let's think recursively. For example, O_2 must have passed through phase 1. So, during phase 1, O_2 must have beaten their opponent. What's the condition for that?\n\nWell, during phase 1, the rule is s[0]. Let's say that during phase 1, the rule is '0' (lower skill wins). So for O_2 to have won their first match, they must have been the lower-skilled team in that match. Which implies that their opponent in phase 1 had higher skill than O_2. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose O_2's first opponent to be someone stronger than O_2 (if the rule is 0). Similarly, if the rule is 1, O_2 must have been stronger than their first opponent.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps for O_i, we can choose their path through previous phases in a way that allows them to reach phase i.\n\nBut how can we model this for x's opponents?\n\nPerhaps for each phase i, the opponent O_i must satisfy certain constraints based on the rules of previous phases. For example, for O_i to reach phase i, they must have passed through the previous phases. So for each phase j (from 1 to i-1), O_i must have been able to win their matches in phase j according to the rule of that phase.\n\nBut how do we find what constraints this imposes on O_i's skill?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to model for each phase i, what is the minimal and maximal possible value of O_i, given the rules up to that phase.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the required strength of x compared to the teams in each round.\n\nLet me think about the entire path that x must take. For example, during phase 1, x must beat an opponent. Let's say the rule is '0' (lower skill wins). Then x must be lower than that opponent. So, the opponent in phase 1 must be higher than x. But that opponent must have passed through phase 1. Wait, no. Wait, in phase 1, the opponent is beaten by x. So for that opponent, during phase 1, they lost. But how did they get into phase 1? Well, they were in the initial bracket. So they didn't have to pass through any previous phases. They just started in phase 1.\n\nWait, phase 1 is the first round. All teams start here. So for O_1 (the opponent in phase 1), they are just another team in the initial bracket. So for O_1, during phase 1, they lost to x. So for phase 1, the rule determines whether x must be higher or lower than O_1.\n\nThen, for O_2 (the opponent in phase 2), they must have won their phase 1 match. So, during phase 1, they beat their opponent. The rule for phase 1 determines whether O_2 was higher or lower than their first opponent.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose O_2's first opponent to be as weak as possible (so that O_2 can pass phase 1). For example, if phase 1 rule is '0', then O_2 must be lower than their first opponent. So to allow O_2 to pass phase 1, we can arrange that their first opponent is stronger than O_2. Therefore, O_2 can be as low as possible, but that depends on the rules.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a way to model the minimal and maximal constraints on x's skill based on the rules of each phase.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the required conditions for x to be able to reach the final. For each phase i (from 1 to n), the opponent O_i must be such that:\n\n- For phase i, x beats O_i according to the rule of that phase.\n\n- For O_i to reach phase i, they must have passed through phases 1 to i-1. Which implies that for each phase j from 1 to i-1, O_i must have beaten their opponent in that phase according to the rule of phase j.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose O_i's path through previous phases in a way that allows them to reach phase i, regardless of their skill. How?\n\nFor example, suppose in phase j, the rule is '0' (lower wins). Then, O_i must have beaten their opponent in phase j. That means that O_i's skill must be lower than their opponent in that phase. So, for O_i to reach phase j+1, their opponent in phase j must be higher than them.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose for O_i's path in previous phases to have opponents that are higher than them (if the rule is '0') or lower than them (if the rule is '1').\n\nTherefore, for O_i to reach phase i, regardless of their skill, as long as there are enough teams with appropriate skills to act as their opponents in previous phases.\n\nBut how does this affect the constraints on x?\n\nLet me think recursively. For x to reach phase i, during phase i, he must have beaten O_i. But O_i's existence depends on the previous phases.\n\nBut perhaps, for each phase i, the constraints on x's skill are determined by the rules of the phases up to i.\n\nLet me think of this as follows. Let's imagine that for each phase i, there's a certain \"required\" skill level that x must have compared to the teams in that phase. For example, if the rule for phase i is '1', then x must be stronger than O_i. But O_i's strength depends on the previous phases.\n\nBut perhaps, for x to be able to reach the final, there are certain constraints on the minimal and maximal possible skill levels that x must have, based on the rules of the tournament.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the rule determines whether x must be higher or lower than the opponent. But the opponents in each round must be such that they can be beaten by x according to that rule, and also that they can reach that round according to the previous rules.\n\nLet me think about the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have. For example, if the rules in all phases require x to be higher than all opponents, then x must be the strongest possible. But if some phases require lower than opponents, then x must be weaker than those opponents.\n\nBut how do these requirements interact?\n\nLet me try to model for each phase i, what is the required relation between x and the opponents in that phase, and how that affects x's possible skill level.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The root is the final match. Each match has two children, which are the matches that feed into it. For x to reach the final, it must win all matches along its path from the leaves to the root.\n\nThe structure of the tournament is fixed, but the assignment of teams to the leaves (initial positions) can be arranged as needed.\n\nBut how can we model the possible opponents that x can have in each match along its path?\n\nPerhaps for each round, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible skill that x must have, given the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nLet me think of it recursively. Suppose that for the current round (say, round k), the rule is r (0 or 1). To win this round, x must have a certain relation to its opponent. But the opponent must have come from the other subtree of this match. For the opponent to reach this round, they must have passed through all previous rounds, which may impose constraints on their skill level.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the opponents for x in each round to be the minimal possible or maximal possible, depending on the rules.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: for x to be the champion, during each round i (from 1 to n), x must have a certain relationship with the opponent in that round. Let's call this relationship R_i (either x must be higher or lower than the opponent).\n\nMoreover, for each round i, the opponent in that round must be a team that can reach that round given the rules of the previous rounds. But how can we model that?\n\nLet me think of the constraints for the opponent in round i. Let's say that in round i, the rule is R_i. For the opponent to reach round i, they must have passed through rounds 1 to i-1. Let's think about the minimal and maximal constraints on the opponent's skill.\n\nFor example, if in round 1, the rule is 0 (lower wins), then the opponent in round 1 must be higher than x. But that opponent didn't have to pass through any previous rounds. So they can be any team except x.\n\nBut for the opponent in round 2, they must have passed through round 1. Let's say the rule for round 1 is 0. So, in round 1, the opponent in round 2 must have beaten their own opponent. Since the rule is 0, that means the opponent in round 2 must be lower than their opponent in round 1. Therefore, their opponent in round 1 must be higher than them. So, the opponent in round 2 must be lower than someone else. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, that someone else can be any team with higher skill than the opponent in round 2.\n\nSo, for the opponent in round 2, their skill can be anything, as long as there exists a team with higher skill (to be their opponent in round 1). Therefore, for the opponent in round 2, their skill can be any value, provided that there are enough teams available.\n\nBut how does this affect the constraints on x?\n\nLet me think of this as follows. For x to be able to beat the opponent in round i, according to the rule R_i, x must be either higher or lower than that opponent. But the opponent must have passed through the previous rounds, which may impose constraints on their skill.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps the constraints on the opponent's skill are that:\n\nFor each previous round j (from 1 to i-1), the opponent must have been able to pass through that round according to the rule R_j. This can be achieved by choosing the opponents in their path to be such that the required condition is met.\n\nBut what is the minimal and maximal skill that the opponent in round i can have?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that in round i, the rule is R_i. For x to beat the opponent, x must be higher or lower than them. Let's say the rule requires x to be higher than the opponent. Then, the opponent can be any team with skill less than x. But the opponent must have passed through the previous rounds, which may require that their skill is in a certain range.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. For each round i, the opponent in that round must be a team that can be beaten by x in round i, and also can reach round i by passing through the previous rounds. Let's model what constraints this places on the opponent's skill level.\n\nLet me define for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible skill level that the opponent in that round can have. But how?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of rounds. Let's process the rounds from the first to the last. For each round i, we can determine the required relationship between x and the opponent, and based on that, determine what constraints are placed on x's skill.\n\nFor example:\n\nLet's say that during round 1, the rule is '0'. So, x must be lower than the opponent in round 1. So, the opponent's skill is higher than x. But since this is the first round, there are no previous constraints on the opponent's skill. So, as long as there exists at least one team with higher skill than x, this is possible.\n\nBut for round 2, the rule is '1', which requires x to be higher than the opponent in round 2. Now, the opponent in round 2 must have passed through round 1. Let's say that round 1's rule is '0' (lower wins). So, for the opponent in round 2 to have passed round 1, they must have been the lower-skilled team in their round 1 match. Therefore, their opponent in round 1 must have been higher than them. So, the opponent in round 2's skill is less than their round 1 opponent. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose their round 1 opponent to be any team with higher skill than them. Therefore, the opponent in round 2 can have any skill, as long as there exists a team with higher skill (which is always true unless the opponent is the maximum skill team).\n\nBut for x to beat the opponent in round 2, x must be higher than them. So, the opponent in round 2 must have a skill less than x. So, combining this with the previous constraint, the opponent in round 2 must be less than x. But since the opponent in round 2 can be any team with skill less than x (provided there are enough teams), this is possible.\n\nBut how does this affect the constraints on x's skill? Well, x must be higher than the opponent in round 2. And the opponent in round 2 must have passed through round 1, which requires that they have a lower skill than someone else. But since there are many other teams, this is possible as long as x's skill is not the lowest possible.\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me think of the entire tournament as a series of rounds, and for each round, determine the constraints on x's skill based on the rules of that round and previous rounds.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. For x to reach the final, it must win all matches along its path. Each match in the path corresponds to a round. For each round i, the rule is s[i-1], which determines whether x must be higher or lower than its opponent in that round.\n\nLet me consider that for each round, the opponent must be a team that can be eliminated in that round. For example, in round i, the opponent must be such that they can be beaten by x according to the rule of round i. But also, they must have passed through all previous rounds.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose the opponents in each round to be the minimal possible or maximal possible, depending on the rules.\n\nLet me think of the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to satisfy all the constraints. For example, in the first round, if the rule is '0', then x must be lower than the opponent. So, x must be less than some value. But what is the minimal value that x can have? Well, it depends on the rules of the subsequent rounds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each round i, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible skill that x must have, based on the rules of the rounds up to i.\n\nLet me think of it recursively. Let's define for each round i, the minimal and maximal skill that x must have in order to proceed to the next round.\n\nLet me think of the rounds in order. Starting from the first round (i=1) up to the nth round (i=n).\n\nFor example, let's process the rounds from the first to the last. For each round i, based on the rule, we determine how x's skill must compare to the opponent in that round, and then combine this with the constraints from previous rounds.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model for each round i, the required condition on x's skill relative to the opponents in that round. For example, for each round i, the required condition is:\n\nIf the rule is '0', then x must be less than the opponent in round i.\n\nIf the rule is '1', then x must be greater than the opponent in round i.\n\nBut how do these conditions translate into constraints on x's skill?\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For x to be able to proceed through all rounds, the opponents in each round must be such that:\n\n- For round 1, the opponent must satisfy the condition (x < or >).\n\n- For round 2, the opponent must have passed through round 1, and satisfy the condition for round 2.\n\nBut since we can choose the opponents in each round to be the best possible (i.e., the ones that make it easier for x to proceed), perhaps we can find for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible skill that x must have.\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For each round i, the opponent in that round must be a team that can be beaten by x according to the rule of that round, and can reach that round based on the rules of previous rounds. To make it possible, we need to find for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible skill that the opponent can have, given the previous rounds' rules.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For x to be able to win the tournament, it must be possible to arrange the bracket such that in each round i, x's opponent is chosen such that:\n\n- The opponent in round i is as weak as possible (if the rule requires x to be stronger) or as strong as possible (if the rule requires x to be weaker), to allow x to win.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the required constraints for x's skill. For example, during each round i, the opponent must be such that:\n\nIf the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), then x must be lower than the opponent. So, the opponent must be higher than x. But this opponent must have passed through the previous rounds. How does that affect the opponent's skill?\n\nLet me think recursively. For the opponent in round i, to have passed through rounds 1 to i-1, what constraints are there on their skill?\n\nLet me define for each round i, a function that returns the minimal and maximal possible skill that a team must have to reach round i, given the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nFor example, let's define for a team to reach round i, what is the minimal and maximal skill they can have. This would depend on the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's say that for round i, the minimal skill required to reach it is m[i], and the maximal is M[i]. But how?\n\nLet me think of it for each round. For example:\n\n- Round 1: Any team can reach it, since it's the first round. So m[1] = 1, M[1] = 2^n.\n\n- Round 2: To reach round 2, the team must have won round 1. The rule for round 1 determines whether the team's skill must be higher or lower than their opponent in round 1.\n\nLet's say the rule for round 1 is '0' (lower wins). Then, to reach round 2, the team must have been the lower-skilled in round 1. So their skill must be less than their opponent's. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, their opponent can be any team with higher skill. So, the team can have any skill value, as long as there exists a team with higher skill. Which is always true unless the team is the maximum skill. So, for round 2, the minimal skill is 1, and the maximal is 2^n - 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the rule for round 1 is '1', then the team must have higher skill than their opponent. So the team's skill must be higher than someone else's. Which is possible as long as the team is not the minimum skill. So, for round 2, the minimal skill is 2, and maximal is 2^n.\n\nSo, for round 2, the minimal and maximal skill depends on the rule of round 1.\n\nNow, for round i, the minimal and maximal skill required to reach it depends on the rules of the previous rounds. This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where for each round i, we compute the min and max skill that a team must have to reach that round.\n\nOnce we have that, then for x to be able to reach round i, it must be within the [m[i], M[i]] range. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because the team that reaches round i may have passed through previous rounds with varying rules. For example, if in round 1 the rule is '0', then the team must be lower than their opponent. So, their skill can be anything as long as there exists a higher-skilled team. But for the next rounds, the rules may impose further constraints.\n\nBut how can we model this for each round?\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For a team to reach round i, they must have passed through rounds 1 to i-1. Let's assume that for each round j from 1 to i-1, the rule is r_j. For each round j, depending on r_j, the team's skill must be either higher or lower than their opponent in that round. \n\nTo find the minimal and maximal possible skill for a team that reaches round i, we can model it as follows:\n\nIf the rule for round j is '0' (lower wins), then in that round, the team must be lower than their opponent. So, the team's skill must be less than the opponent's. But since the opponent can be any team with higher skill, the team's skill can be as low as possible, but the opponent's skill must be higher. However, this doesn't directly constrain the team's skill, except that it must be possible to have a higher-skilled team in the bracket.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Perhaps we need to think of it in terms of the constraints imposed by the rules on the team's skill.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each round i, and for each possible rule in that round, determine the minimal and maximal skill that a team must have to reach that round. \n\nFor example:\n\nLet’s define for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible skill that a team can have to reach that round. Let's call these min_skill[i] and max_skill[i].\n\nFor round 1, min_skill[1] = 1, max_skill[1] = 2^n.\n\nFor round i >= 2, the rules of the previous rounds will determine how min_skill[i] and max_skill[i] are computed.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think recursively. To reach round i, the team must have won round i-1. So, during round i-1, the team must have beaten their opponent according to the rule of round i-1.\n\nSo, for the team to reach round i, during round i-1, their skill must satisfy the condition imposed by the rule of round i-1.\n\nLet me think of the rule for round i-1. Let's say that the rule for round i-1 is r (either 0 or 1). \n\nIf r is 0 (lower wins), then during round i-1, the team must have been the lower-skilled team. So, their skill must be less than their opponent's skill. Therefore, the team's skill must be less than some other team's skill. Since we can arrange the initial bracket, the opponent can be any team with higher skill. Thus, the team's skill can be any value as long as there exists a higher-skilled team. Which is always possible unless the team is the maximum skill. Therefore, the max_skill[i] for the current round would be the same as max_skill[i-1] minus something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the min_skill and max_skill for round i are determined based on the rule of round i-1 and the previous min/max.\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\nWhen a team reaches round i, it must have passed through round i-1. So during round i-1, the team's skill must have satisfied the rule of that round. For example, if the rule of round i-1 is '0', then the team's skill must be less than their opponent's. So, the team's skill can be any value as long as there exists a higher-skilled team. But how does this affect the min and max for the team's skill in round i?\n\nIt seems that the min and max for round i would be the same as for round i-1, except that if the rule of round i-1 requires the team to be higher or lower than their opponent, then there might be constraints.\n\nBut this line of thinking isn't yielding clear results. Let's try to look for patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n101\n\nOutput is 4 5 6 7.\n\nLet's see why. For n=3, there are 8 teams. The string is '101'.\n\nLet's break down the rules for each phase:\n\nPhase 1 (round 1): s[0] = '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nPhase 2 (round 2): s[1] = '0' → lower skill wins.\n\nPhase 3 (round 3): s[2] = '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must win all three rounds.\n\nLet's think about what constraints this imposes.\n\nRound 1: x must be higher than its opponent. So x must be higher than someone. This is possible as long as x is not the lowest (but since there are 8 teams, x can be any from 1 to 8, but the opponent must be lower than x).\n\nRound 2: x must be lower than its opponent. Wait, no! Wait, phase 2 is round 2, and the rule is '0', which means lower skill wins. So during round 2, x must be lower than its opponent to win. So, x's skill must be less than the opponent's skill in round 2.\n\nBut how can x be lower than the opponent in",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can win a single-elimination tournament based on given rules for each round. The tournament structure and rules are defined by a string `s` where each character indicates whether the lower or higher-skilled team wins in that round.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is a single-elimination bracket with $2^n$ teams. Each round halves the number of teams until one champion remains.\n2. **Rules per Round**: Each round's winner is determined by the corresponding character in the string `s`. A '0' means the lower-skilled team wins, and a '1' means the higher-skilled team wins.\n3. **Constraints for Winning**: For a team with skill level `x` to be a winner, it must be possible to arrange the initial bracket such that `x` wins all matches according to the rules of each round.\n4. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to track the minimum and maximum skill levels required for a team to reach each round. This helps us determine valid ranges for `x` based on the rules of each round.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    \n    # For each round i (from 0 to n-1), we'll compute min and max required skill\n    # dp[i] will store (min_skill, max_skill) for reaching round i+1\n    # Initially, for round 0 (first round), min and max are 1 and total_teams\n    dp = [(1, total_teams)] * n\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_rule = s[i]\n        prev_min, prev_max = dp[i-1] if i > 0 else (1, total_teams)\n        if i == 0:\n            # first round\n            if current_rule == '1':\n                # must be higher than opponent, so x can be from 2 to total_teams\n                dp[i] = (2, total_teams)\n            else:\n                # must be lower than opponent, so x can be from 1 to total_teams - 1\n                dp[i] = (1, total_teams - 1)\n        else:\n            # for i-th round (0-based), which is the (i+1)-th phase\n            # previous round is i-1\n            if current_rule == '1':\n                # must be higher than opponent in this round\n                # opponent must have passed through previous rounds, so their min and max are dp[i-1]\n                # to beat them, x must be > opponent's skill\n                # the opponent's max is dp[i-1][1], so x must be at least (opponent's max + 1)\n                # but since opponent can be as low as possible, x needs to be at least (dp[i-1][0] + 1)\n                # wait, no: the opponent can be any value in [prev_min, prev_max]\n                # to ensure x can be higher than some value in that range, x must be > prev_min\n                # because there exists a value in [prev_min, prev_max] that is less than x\n                # So, x must be >= prev_min + 1?
