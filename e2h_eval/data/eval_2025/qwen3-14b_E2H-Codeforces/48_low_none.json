He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b can be a normal base or Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and we have to convert it to base b, handling Roman numerals if needed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has a and b (or R). Second line has c as a string in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n3. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be a normal base or Roman numerals.\n\nFirst, I need to handle the conversion from base a to decimal. The input c can have digits up to a-1. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the problem says that for bases greater than 10, letters are used (like A for 10, B for 11, etc.). However, the input c may have letters? Wait, the input says that c is given in base a. So for example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9 and A (for 10) and B (for 11). But how is the input represented? The problem says that the input c is a string which may contain leading zeros. So for example, if a is 12, then the input might have letters like A or B.\n\nWait, the problem says that in the input, the second line is a non-negative integer c in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then the input could be something like 'A' which represents 10 in decimal. But how are letters represented in the input? Probably, the input uses uppercase letters for digits beyond 9. For example, in base 12, the digits would be 0-9, A (10), B (11). So when parsing the input string, each character is converted to its corresponding value.\n\nSo first, I need to parse the input string c into a decimal number. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"A\" in base 16, that's 10 in decimal. If the input is \"1A\" in base 16, that's 1*16 + 10 = 26.\n\nSo the function to convert from base a to decimal is straightforward. For each character in the string, convert it to its value (digits 0-9, letters A-Z for 10 and up?), then compute the value as sum of digit * a^position.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros. But that doesn't affect the conversion, except that the value is correct.\n\nSo for the first step, the code needs to take the string c, process each character into its numerical value, then compute the decimal value.\n\nOnce that is done, the next step is to convert that decimal number into base b. However, if b is 'R', then we need to convert it to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string, using letters for digits above 9.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Parse a and b. If b is 'R', then after converting to decimal, convert to Roman numerals. Else, convert to base b as a string.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, the code must read the input. The first line is two values, a and b. But b can be R. So for example, the first line could be '16 R' or '5 2'.\n\nThe second line is the string c.\n\nSo for each test case, process as follows:\n\nRead a and b (with possible R), then read c.\n\nNow, the first part is converting c from base a to decimal. Let's write a helper function for that.\n\nBut how to handle the digits of c? For example, if the base is 12, then digits can be 0-9 and A (for 10), B (for 11). So each character in the string is a digit in base a. So for each character in the string, we need to convert it to its numerical value.\n\nSo for example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So the code can process each character as follows: for a given character, if it's a digit, then its value is int(c). If it's a letter, then it's ord(c) - ord('A') + 10. But need to check if the letters are uppercase? Well, the problem says that in the input, the c is given in base a. But the problem says that in the input, the c may have leading",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, where `b` can either be a standard numerical base or Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting that decimal integer to the target base `b`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a` as a string. We first convert this string to a decimal integer. This involves processing each character of the string, converting it to its corresponding numerical value (digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases greater than 10).\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: After converting the input to a decimal integer, we handle two cases:\n   - If the target base `b` is a standard numerical base, convert the decimal integer to base `b` using standard digit conversion (digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases greater than 10).\n   - If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef from_decimal(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in val:\n        while num >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            num -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(input_lines), 2):\n        line1 = input_lines[i]\n        line2 = input_lines[i+1]\n        parts = line1.split()\n        a = int(parts[0])\n        b = parts[1]\n        c = line2.strip()\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n        \n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            result = from_decimal(decimal_value, base)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its corresponding numerical value based on the given base `a`. This value is accumulated into a decimal integer.\n2. **Conversion from Decimal**: The function `from_decimal` converts a decimal integer to a specified base `b`, handling both numerical bases and alphabetic digits for bases greater than 10.\n3. **Roman Numerals Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal integer to Roman numerals by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values and appending the corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion between different bases and Roman numerals, ensuring correctness and handling edge cases such as leading zeros and special Roman numeral rules.",
