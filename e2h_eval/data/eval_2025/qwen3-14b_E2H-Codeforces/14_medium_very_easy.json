Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the main idea is, given m, find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros in n!. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding a higher number can't decrease the count of 5s. So for example, when n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases.\n\nSo for a given m, there might be a range of n's where f(n) = m. But how to find that range?\n\nWait, but for example, when m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors of 5? No, wait. Wait, 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (still 1 zero), 7! is 5040 (still 1 zero?), wait no. Wait 7! is 5040, which ends with one zero. Oh right. Because 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 all contribute the same number of 5s. So the count of trailing zeros increases when n crosses multiples of 5. So for example, when you reach 10, then 10/5 is 2, plus 10/25 is 0, so total 2 zeros. So for m=1, the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) give exactly 1 zero. So that's 5 numbers. Which matches the first sample input.\n\nSo the key is to find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, there's a range of n's where f(n) = m. But how to find the lower and upper bounds of this range?\n\nLet me think about binary search. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, we can find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and the largest n where f(n) = m. Then the count is largest - smallest + 1, if there are any such numbers.\n\nBut how to find these values?\n\nWait, but for some m, there may be no n such that f(n) = m. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, let's see. Let's compute f(24) = 24/5 + 24/25 = 4 + 0 = 4. f(25) = 25/5 + 25/25 = 5 + 1 = 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where f(n) is 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the problem is, for a given m, check if there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If yes, find all such n's. Otherwise, output zero.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Let's call it low.\n\n2. Find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Let's call it high.\n\nIf such n exists, then the answer is all numbers from low to high inclusive. The count is high - low + 1.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nAlternatively, since f(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, the numbers n that satisfy f(n) = m must form a contiguous range. Because once f(n) increases beyond m, it can't come back. So if there is at least one n with f(n) = m, then there's a range of numbers where that's true.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Find the first n where f(n) = m.\n\n- Find the last n where f(n) = m.\n\nIf there is no such n, output 0.\n\nBut how to find those values?\n\nLet me think about using binary search. For example, to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if that n's count is exactly m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, find the lower bound and upper bound for n where f(n) = m.\n\nWait, here's an approach. Let's think about finding the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Let's call that value 'lo'. Then check if f(lo) is equal to m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call that 'hi'. Then the numbers from lo to hi-1 will have exactly m trailing zeros. So the count is hi - lo.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for example, in the first sample where m=1:\n\nFind the smallest n where f(n) >= 1. That is 5. Then check if f(5) is 1. Yes. Then find the smallest n where f(n) >= 2. Which is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (10-1=9) are the ones that have exactly 1 zero. So the count is 9-5+1? Or 10-5 =5 numbers. Oh right, because hi is 10, so the numbers from lo to hi-1 is 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. So the count is hi - lo.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Compute lo = the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\n- Check if f(lo) is equal to m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Else, compute hi = the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1.\n\n- The answer is the numbers from lo to hi-1 inclusive. The count is hi - lo.\n\nSo for example, m=1:\n\nlo is 5, hi is 10. So the numbers 5-9, which is 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's compute:\n\nFind lo where f(lo) >=5. Let's see:\n\nn=20: f(20) is 4 (20/5 + 20/25=4+0=4). n=25: 25/5 + 25/25 =5+1=6. So the minimal n where f(n)>=5 is 25? No. Wait, what about n=24? f(24) is 24/5=4 + 24/25=0. So 4. So the minimal n where f(n)>=5 is 25. But f(25) is 6. So that's not equal to m=5. Therefore, there are no solutions. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for a given m, find lo = the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(lo) == m. If not, return 0. Else, find hi = minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the answer is hi - lo numbers, which are lo, lo+1,..., hi-1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to implementing two binary searches: one for lo and one for hi.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search can be done over the possible n's. Let's think about the possible range. For m up to 1e5, the maximum possible n that could be needed is 5*m. Because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero. So for example, m=1e5, the minimal n is 5*1e5 = 500,000. But perhaps even higher? Well, for example, for m=5, the minimal n is 25. Which is 5*5. But maybe the upper bound can be set as 5*m. Or perhaps 5*m + 1. But perhaps for binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. Because for any m, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m is at most 5*m. Because for n=5m, count_zeros(n) is floor(5m/5) + floor(5m/25) + ... which is m + floor(m/5) + ... which is definitely >= m. So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. But maybe even 5*m is too big? For m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable for binary search.\n\nBut perhaps even better, for the binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. Let's proceed.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nSo for example, to find lo, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nSimilarly, for hi, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nOnce we have lo and hi, then if count_zeros(lo) == m, then the answer is hi - lo numbers. Else, 0.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (since 0! is 1, which has 0 zeros, but according to the problem statement, m starts from 1. So the input m is between 1 and 1e5.)\n\nSo for the given m, compute lo and hi as described.\n\nNow, implement the count_zeros(n) function.\n\nLet's code that. For example:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nLet's write a helper function for that.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target  # upper bound\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for example, for target m=1, the minimal n is 5. Let's see:\n\nlow starts at 0, high is 5*1=5.\n\nInitially, low=0, high=5. mid is (0+5)//2=2. count_zeros(2) is 0 < 1. So set low=3.\n\nNext iteration: low=3, high=5. mid is 4. count_zeros(4) is 0 <1. So low=5. Now low=high=5. return 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: target=6. Let's say for m=6. What is the minimal n?\n\nn=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So the function returns 25.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the helper function seems to work.\n\nSo for the given m, compute lo = find_min_n(m). Then check if count_zeros(lo) == m. If not, then return 0. Else, compute hi = find_min_n(m+1). Then the answer is hi - lo numbers, which are lo, lo+1,..., hi-1.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample, m=1:\n\nlo = find_min_n(1) =5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So yes. Then hi is find_min_n(2) which is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would output 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nAnother example, m=5:\n\nlo = find_min_n(5). Let's compute:\n\ntarget=5. Let's see what find_min_n(5) returns.\n\nLet's think about what's the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nn=20: count_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). So 4. Not enough.\n\nn=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6 which is not equal to m=5. So the answer is 0.\n\nThus, the code would return 0.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute lo = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(lo) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute hi = find_min_n(m+1).\n\n   the numbers are from lo to hi-1 inclusive.\n\n   the count is hi - lo.\n\n   output the count and the numbers.\n\nBut how to generate the numbers? For example, if hi - lo is 5, then output 5 followed by lo, lo+1, ..., hi-1.\n\nBut for large m, say m=1e5, and the numbers could be up to 5*m, which is 5e5. So generating the list from lo to hi-1 is feasible, since the maximum possible k is 5e5, but for m=1e5, the numbers could be up to 5e5. But for Python, generating a list of numbers from lo to hi-1 is easy.\n\nBut wait, what if hi - lo is zero? Well, that can't happen. Because if count_zeros(lo) = m, then hi is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So for lo, count_zeros(lo) = m, and for hi, count_zeros(hi) >= m+1. So the minimal hi is such that count_zeros(hi) is m+1 or higher. So the numbers between lo and hi-1 must have count_zeros equal to m. Thus, hi - lo is the count of numbers.\n\nBut how to handle cases where hi is not found? Well, the function find_min_n(m+1) would return some value. For example, if m is very large, but there's a valid lo, then hi will be found.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    ...\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    ...\n\nThen:\n\nlo = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lo) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    hi = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = hi - lo\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lo, hi))))\n\nWait, but in Python, range(lo, hi) is [lo, lo+1, ..., hi-1], which is exactly what we need.\n\nBut for the sample input, when m=1, lo=5, hi=10. range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's only one number? For example, m=6. Let's see:\n\nFor m=6, lo is 25 (count_zeros(25)=6). Then hi is find_min_n(7). Let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6. What is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7?\n\nWell, 25: 6. 26: same. 27: same. 28: same. 29: same. 30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1. Total 7. So hi is 30. So the numbers are 25 to 29. So 5 numbers. So the output would be 5 numbers. So the code would generate range(25,30) which is 25,26,27,28,29. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases. Let's think about m=0. But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case is m=1, which we've already handled.\n\nAnother case: m=2. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10? Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. So yes. Then find_min_n(3) is 15. Because 15//5=3, 15//25=0. So count_zeros(15) is 3. So the numbers from 10 to 14. Which is 5 numbers. So 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nBut let's check count_zeros(10) is 2, 11! is same as 10! multiplied by 11. So trailing zeros remain same. So yes.\n\nAnother case: m=6. As discussed earlier.\n\nNow, for the code, the problem is to read m from input, and output the required numbers.\n\nNow, considering that m can be up to 1e5, and the binary search for find_min_n is O(log (5*m)) steps. For each step, count_zeros is O(log n). So overall, the time complexity is acceptable.\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The binary search would take log2(5e5) steps, which is about 20 steps. Each step involves count_zeros which is O(log n) steps. So for each find_min_n, it's O( (log n)^2 ), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the code needs to read input from stdin. The input is a single integer m. So the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the example, the input is ['1', '5'] which probably represents two test cases. Wait, the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. But the sample shows input as ['1', '5'], which perhaps is a mistake in the problem description. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nBut the sample input is given as ['1', '5'] and output as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']. Which suggests that perhaps the original problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are given. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, or perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. But the user's note says that the problem is to read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the actual input is a single m, but the sample shows two test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. Because the original problem's input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is m=1 and m=5. But the user's problem says that the input is a single integer. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but the actual code should process a single m.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. So the code should read a single integer m from input. So the sample input is perhaps a mistake, but the code should read m from stdin.\n\nSo in the code, we need to read m from input. For example, in the first sample, input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. For input 5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code should be written to read m from stdin.\n\nNow, writing the code in Python.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nImplement count_zeros(n).\n\nImplement find_min_n(target).\n\nThen proceed as discussed.\n\nBut what if m is 0? According to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead m as int(input().strip())\n\nThen:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nThen:\n\nlo = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lo) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    hi = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = hi - lo\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lo, hi))))\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the first line is the count, then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, when m=1, the code prints k=5, then the numbers as space-separated.\n\nBut in Python, the print statement for the numbers would be ' '.join(...). However, when the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9, the code would generate '5 6 7 8 9' as the string.\n\nBut in the sample output, the first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' — but the code would print the first line as '5' and then the second line as the numbers. However, the sample output shows that for input 1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is two lines. So the code's print statements are correct.\n\nBut the code for the else part would print:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nWhich would produce two lines. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, for m=5, the output is 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the code for the else part is:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(...)) ?\n\nBut in the case where k is zero? Well, that's handled by the first condition. Because if count_zeros(lo) != m, then output 0. So the else part is only entered when there are valid numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that lo is found, but hi is not? Well, the hi is find_min_n(m+1), which will always return a value. Because for any m, there exists n such that count_zeros(n) >= m+1. For example, 5*(m+1) would have count_zeros(5*(m+1)) >= m+1.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's test with m=5.\n\nlo = find_min_n(5). Let's compute:\n\ntarget=5. Let's see what the code returns.\n\nInitially, low=0, high=5*5=25.\n\nmid = (0+25)//2 =12. count_zeros(12) is 2 (12//5=2, 12//25=0). Which is less than 5. So low becomes 13.\n\nmid = (13+25)/2 = 19. count_zeros(19) is 3. Still less than 5. low becomes 20.\n\nmid = (20+25)/2=22. count_zeros(22) is 4. Still less than 5. low becomes 23.\n\nmid = (23+25)/2=24. count_zeros(24) is 4. low becomes 25.\n\nNow, low=25, high=25. return 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to m=5. So the code outputs 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nlo = find_min_n(6). Let's see:\n\ntarget=6. Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\nn=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So the function returns 25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6, which is equal to m=6. Then find hi = find_min_n(7). Let's compute that.\n\ntarget=7.\n\nlow=0, high=5*7=35.\n\nmid=17. count_zeros(17)=3. <7. low becomes 18.\n\nmid= (18+35)/2=26.5 → 26. count_zeros(26) is 5 (26//5=5, 26//25=1 → 5+1=6? Wait, 26//5 is 5 (5*5=25, 26-25=1). Then 26//25 is 1. So total is 5 + 1 = 6. Which is less than 7. So low becomes 27.\n\nmid= (27+35)/2=31. count_zeros(31) is 31//5=6, 31//25=1 → total 7. So >=7. high becomes 31. Now, low=27, high=31.\n\nmid= (27+31)/2=29. count_zeros(29) is 5 + 1 =6 <7. So low becomes 30.\n\nmid= (30+31)/2=30.5 → 30. count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6, 30//25=1, 6+1=7. So >=7. high becomes 30. Now low=30, high=30. return 30. So hi is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So the output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so no need to handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m as input.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nm = int(sys.stdin.read().strip())\n\nlo = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lo) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    hi = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = hi - lo\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lo, hi))))\n\nBut wait, for the case when k is zero? Well, that's not possible because if count_zeros(lo) == m, then hi is the minimal n where count_zeros >= m+1. So hi must be >= lo +1. Because for lo, count_zeros(lo) = m. So for hi, count_zeros(hi) >= m+1. So hi - lo is at least 1.\n\nBut in code, for example, if m=6, and lo=25, hi=30. So 30-25=5. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's exactly one n? For example, let's imagine m= something where the next number increases the count. Like, for example, m=24. Let's see:\n\nLet me think of n= 99. count_zeros(99) is 99//5=19 + 99//25=3 + 99//125=0 → 22. Not enough. n=100: 100//5=20 + 100//25=4 + 100//125=0 → 24. So for m=24, lo is 100. Then hi is find_min_n(25). Let's see what's the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=25.\n\nn=100: count is 24. So need to go higher. n=101: same as 100. ... n=104: same. n=105: 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. 21+4=25. So hi is 105. So the numbers from 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. So the code would output 5 numbers.\n\nBut if there is a case where the count increases by more than 1. For example, m=5, which is impossible. So the code handles that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case is m=1. The code would generate 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=24. Output 5 numbers: 100, 101, 102, 103, 104.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input. Let's see:\n\nSample input is m=1. Output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. Output is 0.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code must be written in Python, reading from stdin and writing to stdout.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is ['1', '5'] — but that's probably a mistake. However, according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So the code reads a single integer.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of numbers that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: Given the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zero count function, we use binary search to efficiently find the smallest number $ n $ such that the trailing zero count is at least $ m $. Similarly, we find the smallest number where the trailing zero count is at least $ m+1 $.\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: Using the results from the binary searches, we determine the range of numbers that have exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If no such range exists, we return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.read().strip())\n    lo = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(lo) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        hi = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = hi - lo\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lo, hi))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input integer $ m $ is read from standard input.\n2. **Counting Zeros**: The `count_zeros` function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by powers of 5.\n3. **Binary Search for Minimum $ n $**: The `find_min_n` function uses binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that the trailing zero count is at least the given target.\n4. **Checking Validity**: After determining the lower bound (`lo`) for $ m $, we check if it indeed has exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, we output 0. Otherwise, we find the upper bound (`hi`) for $ m+1 $ and compute the valid range of $ n $ values.\n5. **Output**: The number of valid $ n $ values and the values themselves are printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
