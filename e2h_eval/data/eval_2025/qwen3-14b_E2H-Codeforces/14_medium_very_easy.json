He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo, for a given m, I need to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how?\n\nThe key here is to find the possible n's that would result in exactly m zeros. However, there's a catch. For some m, there might be no n that gives exactly m zeros. For example, if m is 5, let's see: Let's compute for n=24. The trailing zeros would be 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 → total 4. For n=25, it's 25//5=5 + 25//25=1 → total 6. So between 24 and 25, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo the first step is to find for a given m, whether there exists n such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. And then find all such n's.\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's?\n\nLet me think. Let's say I can find the lower and upper bounds for n that would produce exactly m zeros. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding a larger number can't decrease the count of 5s. So, for example, when n increases by 1, f(n) either stays the same or increases by 1 or more (if the new n is a multiple of 5, 25, etc.)\n\nSo for a given m, there could be a range of n's where f(n) equals m. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think: For example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check:\n\nFor n=5: f(5) = 1. For n=6, same as 5 since 6//5=1. Similarly up to 9. Then for n=10, f(10) is 2. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) give exactly 1 trailing zero. So the count is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the approach is to find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that also have f(n) = m. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the lower and upper bounds for n where f(n) equals m. For example, find the minimal n such that f(n) = m, and the minimal n where f(n) = m+1. Then the numbers between the first and second minus one would be the candidates. But how to find that?\n\nLet me think about binary search. For a given m, we can find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) equals m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and then find the largest n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers between them would be the possible answers.\n\nWait, but how to find the range of n's where f(n) equals m. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, once it reaches m, it might stay at m for some numbers, then jump to m+1.\n\nSo the idea is to find the first occurrence of m in the f(n) sequence and the last occurrence. Then the numbers between first and last (inclusive) would be the answer.\n\nSo, for example, for m=1, the first occurrence is 5, and the last occurrence is 9. Then the numbers 5-9 are 5 numbers.\n\nSo how to find the first and last occurrence?\n\nLet me think of using binary search for this. For example, to find the first n where f(n) equals m, we can find the minimal n where f(n) >= m, and check if it's exactly m. Similarly, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1, then subtract 1. Then the range between the first and the (min for m+1 -1) would be the numbers that have exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this low_n.\n\n2. Check if f(low_n) == m. If not, then there are no solutions. So return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this high_n.\n\n4. Then the numbers from low_n to high_n-1 are all the n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. So the count is high_n - low_n.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample case m=1:\n\nlow_n would be 5 (since f(5)=1). Then high_n is the minimal n where f(n) >= 2. Which is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (high_n -1) are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's see:\n\nFind low_n where f(n) >=5. Let's compute for n=25: f(25) is 6. So maybe the low_n is 25? Wait, but for n=24, f(24) is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4. So for m=5, the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 25. But f(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So in that case, there's no solution. Hence, output is 0.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n where f(n) >=m. Let's call it low.\n\n- Check if f(low) ==m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n where f(n) >=m+1. Call it high.\n\n- The answer is all numbers from low to high-1. The count is high - low.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal n where f(n) >=m?\n\nThis can be done via binary search. Because f(n) is non-decreasing. So the binary search can be used to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nSimilarly for m+1.\n\nSo the first thing is to implement the function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, implement a binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, for the given m, compute low = find_min_n(m), then check if f(low) == m. If not, output 0. Else compute high = find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers from low to high-1 are the answer.\n\nBut how to find find_min_n(target)?\n\nLet's think about the binary search. The possible range for n is from 0 to 5*target. Because for n=5*target, the number of trailing zeros is at least target (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one). But perhaps a better upper bound is needed. For example, for target=1, 5*target is 5, which is correct. For target=5, 5*5=25, which gives 6 trailing zeros. So the upper bound can be 5*target. But perhaps even higher. However, for binary search, we can set the upper bound as 5*m, but maybe even 5*m is sufficient.\n\nWait, for example, for target m, the minimal n that gives f(n) >= m is somewhere between 0 and 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count is at least m (since each 5 contributes 1, and there are m multiples of 5 in 5*m). But perhaps for some cases, the minimal n is less than 5*m. So binary search between 0 and 5*m.\n\nBut for the binary search, the upper limit can be set as 5*m, but perhaps even higher. However, for m up to 1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code for find_min_n(target):\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for example, if target is 1, then 5*target is 5. The loop will find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 1. Which is 5.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if target is 0? Well, the problem says m starts from 1, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nOnce we have find_min_n, then proceed as follows:\n\nCompute low = find_min_n(m). Check if count_zeros(low) == m. If not, then no solution. Else, compute high = find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers from low to high-1 are the answer.\n\nBut how to compute count_zeros(n)?\n\nImplementing count_zeros(n) as:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n // 5\n\n        count += n\n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor input m, compute low = find_min_n(m). Then check if count_zeros(low) == m. If not, output 0. Else, compute high = find_min_n(m+1). Then the answer is the numbers from low to high-1, inclusive. The count is high - low.\n\nBut let's test this with sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nfind_min_n(1) would be 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. Then find_min_n(2) is 10. So high is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nSample input 2: m=5. Let's compute.\n\nfind_min_n(5) would be 25? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. Which is greater than 5. So the find_min_n(5) would be 25?\n\nWait, but what is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5?\n\nLet's check for n=24: count_zeros(24) is 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 → 4 <5. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So in this case, the check would fail. So the answer is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample input's second case.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(6) would be 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) is 25? Let's check.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6, which is less than 7. So the binary search for find_min_n(7) would go higher. Let's compute:\n\nFor example, 25: 6, 26:6, ..., 29:6. 30: 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → total 7. So find_min_n(7) is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29. So high is 30. So 30-25=5 numbers. So the answer would be 5 numbers: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the find_min_n function.\n\nThen, for the given m:\n\nCheck if there exists any n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Which is done by checking if count_zeros(low) == m. If yes, then compute high, and then the answer is the list of numbers from low to high-1.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut first, the code must read m from input. Wait, the input is given as a single integer m. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: the only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5).\n\nSo, the code should read m as input, then process it.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for input ['1', '5'], the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem is that the input is multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: the only line of input contains an integer m. So the code should read one integer m, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two cases. Oh, perhaps the sample input is part of a programming competition where the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: the only line of input contains an integer m. So the code should read one m. But the sample input shows two lines. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], but perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut perhaps this is a formatting error. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. But the sample input shows two test cases. Maybe the user made a mistake here. Wait, the original problem's sample input is probably:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\nSample Output 1:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n5\n\nSample Output 2:\n\n0\n\nBut the way the sample is written is confusing. But according to the problem statement, the code should read a single m from input. So the code is supposed to process one m per run.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, output is 0. So the code should handle one m at a time.\n\nSo the code needs to read m from stdin, process it, and output the required answer.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, read m from input. Then:\n\nCompute low = find_min_n(m). Check if count_zeros(low) == m. If not, output 0. Else compute high = find_min_n(m+1). The numbers are from low to high-1. The count is high - low.\n\nBut how to handle the case where m is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nImplement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nImplement find_min_n(target):\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nBut for large targets, like 1e5, 5*target is 5e5. Which is acceptable for binary search.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead m from input. Let's say m is read as int(input().strip())\n\nThen:\n\nlow = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(low) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    numbers = list(range(low, high))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but the numbers are from low to high-1, inclusive. So the range is low to high-1. So the list is [low, low+1, ..., high-1]. So the length is high - low.\n\nBut in Python, range(low, high) gives numbers from low to high-1. So yes.\n\nBut for example, if low is 5 and high is 10, then range(5,10) gives 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nBut for the case where m=1, the code would generate the correct numbers.\n\nNow, testing for m=5:\n\nlow = find_min_n(5) → returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Which is not equal to 5. So output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. low is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). Then high is find_min_n(7) which is 30. So numbers from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what about m=6, the code would output 5 numbers: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when there's only one n that gives exactly m zeros?\n\nFor example, m=2. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10? Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. So yes.\n\nfind_min_n(3) is 15?\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3. So high is 15. So the numbers from 10 to 14. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2, 11 is 2, 12 is 2, 13 is 2, 14 is 2. Then 15 is 3. So there are 5 numbers. So the code would output 5 numbers. But wait, what's the actual count?\n\nWait, for n=10, 10//5=2, 10//25=0 → total 2. For 14, same. For 15, 15//5=3 + 15//25=0 → 3. So yes, the numbers from 10 to 14 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. So the code works.\n\nBut what if m is 3?\n\nThen low is 15 (count_zeros(15)=3). high is find_min_n(4). Let's compute that.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=4?\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=20: count_zeros(20) is 4. So find_min_n(4) returns 20. So the numbers from 15 to 19. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3. count_zeros(19) is 3. So for m=3, the code would return 5 numbers (15-19). But wait, the code would check if count_zeros(low) is 3. Yes. Then high is find_min_n(4) which is 20. So numbers from 15 to 19. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut what about the edge cases? For example, m=1e5.\n\nBut the code should handle it as the binary search is O(log(5*m)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for very large m, say 1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut for the find_min_n function, the high is set to 5*target. However, for some cases, maybe 5*target is not enough? Let's think.\n\nSuppose target is m. What if the minimal n is larger than 5*m?\n\nIs that possible? Let's think.\n\nFor example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5. 5*1 is 5. So it's okay.\n\nFor m=2, 5*2=10. Which is the minimal n.\n\nBut what about m=5?\n\nThe minimal n is 25. 5*5 is 25. So it's okay.\n\nBut for m=6, the minimal n is 25. 5*6 is 30. So 25 is within 5*6=30. So yes.\n\nAnother example: m=24. Let's compute.\n\nThe count_zeros(99) is 99//5=19 + 99//25=3 + 99//125=0 → 22. Not enough. For 100: 100//5=20 + 100//25=4 + 100//125=0 → 24. So the minimal n for target 24 is 100. 5*24=120. So 100 is less than 120. So the upper bound is okay.\n\nSo the upper bound of 5*target is sufficient.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nBut for the code, the functions need to be inside the code.\n\nBut in Python, the code will be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a single integer. So:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    low = find_min_n(m)\n\n    if count_zeros(low) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n        numbers = list(range(low, high))\n\n        print(len(numbers))\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut wait, the output requires that for the first case, the first line is the k (the count), then the next line is the numbers. But in the sample input, the output for m=1 is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nBut the code for the else part prints len(numbers) followed by the numbers. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for m=1 is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code for the first print is len(numbers), then the numbers. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the case where the numbers are empty (like when m=5), the code would print 0.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nNow, testing the code for m=5.\n\nlow = find_min_n(5) → returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Which is not equal to 5 → print 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case for m=6: low is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). Then high is find_min_n(7) → which is 30. So numbers is [25,26,27,28,29], len 5. So output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nBut what about m=24?\n\nlow = find_min_n(24). Let's see:\n\nThe minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=24 is 100. Because count_zeros(100) is 24. So the code would check if count_zeros(100) is 24. Then high is find_min_n(25). Let's compute count_zeros(100) is 24, and for 100, find_min_n(25) is 100? Or higher?\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. So for target=25, the find_min_n(25) would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=25.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=100: count_zeros is 24. So need to find higher n. Let's compute for n=105: 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0 → total 25. So find_min_n(25) returns 105. So the numbers are from 100 to 104. Which are 5 numbers. So the code would output 5 followed by 100 101 102 103 104.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about m=0? Well, the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5, so no need to handle it.\n\nBut what if m is very large, like 1e5. Let's think about the code's performance. For m=1e5, the find_min_n(m) would perform binary search up to 5e5. Each count_zeros is O(log n), which is acceptable. So the code should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, note that in Python, the code may have to handle large numbers, but since m is up to 1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nNow, considering the sample input where m=1, the code would output 5 and the numbers.\n\nAnother edge case: m=2. Let's see.\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input given in the problem statement, the first input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The code would generate that. The second input is 5, output is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut the code must read from stdin and write to stdout. Also, the code should not have any print statements other than the required outputs.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        numbers = list(range(low, high))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the output for the first case is two lines. For example, the sample input 1 would output:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is given as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'] for the two cases. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when there are zero numbers? For example, m=5, the code would print 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 → Output is 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nSample Input 2: 5 → Output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: m=6 → output is 5 numbers 25-29.\n\nAnother test case: m=24 → output is 5 numbers 100-104.\n\nAnother test case: m=25 → find_min_n(25) is 105 (count_zeros(105) is 25). Then find_min_n(26) is 110? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(105) is 25. count_zeros(110) is 110//5=22 + 110//25=4 + 110//125=0 → 26. So high is 110. So the numbers are 105-109. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nTherefore, this code should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of numbers that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: We use binary search to efficiently find the smallest number `n` such that `n!` has at least `m` trailing zeros. This helps in determining the range of numbers that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n3. **Range Calculation**: Once we find the smallest number `n` with at least `m` trailing zeros, we check if it indeed results in exactly `m` trailing zeros. If so, we then find the smallest number with at least `m+1` trailing zeros to determine the upper bound of our valid range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        numbers = list(range(low, high))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `target`. The upper bound for the binary search is set to `5 * target` which is sufficiently large to ensure we cover all possible values.\n3. **main()**: This function reads the input `m`, determines the smallest `n` where the trailing zeros count is at least `m`, checks if this count is exactly `m`, and then finds the upper bound for the valid range. The valid numbers are then printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `m` up to 100,000.",
