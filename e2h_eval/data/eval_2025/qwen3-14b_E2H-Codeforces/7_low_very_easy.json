The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the construction rules again.\n\nSo the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the previous step) get connected to k new vertices each. And this process is done at least once. So the steps are:\n\n- Initial step: 1 node.\n- First expansion: add k nodes connected to the initial. Now total nodes is 1 + k.\n- Then, each of those k nodes (which have degree 1) get k new nodes each. So adding k * k nodes. Total becomes 1 + k + k².\n- Then, again, each of the nodes added in the previous step (which are leaves) get k new nodes each. So adding k^3 nodes. Total is 1 + k + k² + k³. And so on.\n\nBut the process must be done at least once. Wait, the description says that after the initial step, the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do that once. Let me think: the initial step is creating the first node. Then, the first expansion (adding k nodes) is done. Then, the next step (adding k new nodes to each of those k nodes) is done at least once. So the minimal structure is 1 + k + k^2. For example, when k=4, the minimal is 1 +4 + 16 = 21? But the example says that for n=6, the answer is NO. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample input includes n=6. The output is NO. Let's see why. Let's think for possible k values.\n\nFor example, let's consider possible n values. For the snowflake to exist, n must be equal to 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >=1 (since the expansion step is done at least once). Wait, no. Let me re-express the construction.\n\nThe initial step is 1 node. Then, the first expansion (step 1) adds k nodes. Then, each subsequent expansion step adds k times the number of nodes added in the previous step. Because each leaf (from the previous step) gets k new nodes. So the number of nodes added in each step is k^1, then k^2, then k^3, etc. So the total number of nodes is:\n\ntotal = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps (the part where you add new nodes to the leaves) must be done at least once. So m >=1. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the expansion steps (the second part) is done once. So for example, if m is the number of expansion steps, then the total is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} }) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the structure. Let me think again.\n\nThe process starts with one node. Then, the first expansion is adding k nodes connected to it. Then, each of those k nodes must have their own k children. So the next expansion step adds k * k nodes. Then, each of those k² nodes gets k children, adding k^3 nodes, and so on. The expansion steps (after the initial step) must be done at least once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >=1. Because the first expansion (adding k nodes) is required, then the next step (adding k²) is done once. Wait, no. Let me think: the initial step is 1 node. Then, the first expansion (adding k nodes) is done. Then, the second expansion (adding k^2 nodes) is done once. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. But if we do another expansion step, adding k^3 nodes, then the total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m >= 2? No. Because sum from i=0 to m is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. But the initial step is 1 node. Then, the first expansion (adding k nodes) is step 1. Then, the second expansion (adding k^2) is step 2, etc. The problem says",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a snowflake graph based on specific construction rules. The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding $ k $ new vertices to each leaf node in subsequent steps. The challenge is to check if such a configuration exists for any $ k > 1 $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with 1 vertex. In each expansion step, every leaf node (a node with only one connection) gets $ k $ new vertices connected to it. This process must be done at least once.\n2. **Mathematical Representation**: The total number of vertices after $ m $ expansion steps can be represented as a geometric series: $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m $. For the minimum case, this series must have at least two terms (i.e., $ m \\geq 1 $).\n3. **Check for Valid $ n $**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists an integer $ k > 1 $ such that $ n $ can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series starting from 1 with ratio $ k $, for some number of terms $ m \\geq 2 $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Try different possible k values\n    # We need to check for all possible k > 1 such that 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = n\n    # For each k, find if there exists m >= 1 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n\n    # Which is equivalent to (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1) = n\n    # But since m >= 1, the sum must be at least 1 + k\n    # So for each possible k, we can try to compute the sum and see if it matches n\n    \n    # Since n can be up to 1e18, we need to iterate k up to sqrt(n) or similar\n    # Let's iterate k from 2 to some upper limit\n    # Also, check for the case where m=1: sum is 1 + k = n => k = n-1, which must be >1\n    # So for m=1, n must be >= 3 (since k >=2, 1+2=3)\n    if n >= 3:\n        k = n - 1\n        if k > 1:\n            return True\n    # Now check for m >= 2\n    # For each k >=2, compute the sum until it exceeds n\n    # We can iterate k from 2 up to cube root of n or similar\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/3)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1\n        current = 1\n        # Add k^i terms until total exceeds n\n        while True:\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            elif total > n:\n                break\n    # Also check for cases where m is large, but k is small (like k=2)\n    # For example, n could be 2^m - 1, for m >=2\n    # So we need to check for k=2, 3, etc., even if they are not in the initial loop\n    # However, the above loop might miss some cases for larger m\n    # Alternative approach: for each k from 2 to log2(n), check if n-1 is divisible by k-1 and the quotient is a power of k\n    # Let's try this approach for higher k\n    for k in range(2, 61):  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n        if k == 1:\n            continue\n        # Check if (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1) == n\n        # So (k^(m+1) - 1) = n * (k - 1)\n        # We can compute the sum for m steps\n        # We can try to find m such that sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i = n\n        # Which is equivalent to (k^(m+1) - 1) // (k - 1) == n\n        # So we can compute for m starting from 1 upwards\n        # However, for large k, this might not be efficient, but since k is small here, it's manageable\n        # Compute the sum until it exceeds n\n        total = 1\n        current = 1\n        while True:\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            elif total > n:\n                break\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        n = int(input[i])\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Checking Validity**: For each number $ n $, the function `is_snowflake` checks if there exists a valid $ k > 1 $ such that $ n $ can be represented as the sum of a geometric series starting from 1 with ratio $ k $.\n3. **Geometric Series Check**: The function iterates over possible values of $ k $ and checks if the sum of the series matches $ n $.
