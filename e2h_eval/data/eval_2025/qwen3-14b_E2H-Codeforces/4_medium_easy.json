The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. Each character is R, S, or P. The sequences are cyclic, so for each round i (starting from 0?), we take A[i % m] and B[i % k], where m and k are the lengths of A and B respectively.\n\nThe problem is to compute for each of the n rounds, who wins, and count the losses for each player.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, the key is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, and calculate the number of wins in each cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles and add the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think: The sequences A and B are periodic. So the combination of their moves will also be periodic. The overall period would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will start repeating their moves again.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it T. So, in T rounds, the pattern of moves repeats.\n\n2. For each of the first T rounds, compute how many times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose. Let's call these counts per_cycle_n and per_cycle_p.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // T.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % T.\n\n5. The total losses would be total_cycles * per_cycle_n + losses_in_rem_rounds_n, and similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nBut how do I compute per_cycle_n and per_cycle_p?\n\nWell, for each round in the first T rounds, I can compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and accumulate the counts. Since T could be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1,000,000 (since 1000 and 1000 have LCM of 1000). Wait, no, LCM(m, k) for m and k up to 1000 would be up to 1e6? For example, if m=1000 and k=1000, then LCM is 1000. But if m=999 and k=1000, then LCM is 999*1000 = 999000. So for m and k up to 1000, the maximum LCM is 1e6 (approx). So for T up to 1e6, even if n is 2e9, processing T rounds is feasible, because 1e6 is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k). Then, for each of the T rounds, compute the move for A and B, check who wins, and count the losses. Then multiply by the number of full cycles, and add the count for the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need to compute GCD of m and k. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which they are here.\n\nSo, first, compute m = len(A), k = len(B). Then compute GCD(m, k), then LCM is m*k // GCD.\n\nOnce we have T, then process all T rounds once, compute the number of losses for each player in that cycle. Then multiply by the number of full cycles (n // T) and then add the losses for the remaining rounds (rem = n % T).\n\nBut how to process the first T rounds?\n\nFor each i from 0 to T-1:\n\nA's move is A[i % m], B's move is B[i % k]. Then determine who wins.\n\nSo for each of these T rounds, we can compute the outcome.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each of these T rounds, whether Nikephoros (A) loses, or Polycarpus (B) loses, or it's a draw.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), determine the outcome.\n\nThe rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nIf same, draw.\n\nSo, for a given a and b:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif a beats b: then B loses (so Nikephoros's loss count increases by 1? No, wait. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser and gets a spot. If Nikephoros loses, he gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round, if Nikephoros's move beats B's move, then Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, and Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1? Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says the loser gets pinched. So when Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus is the loser, so Polycarpus's count increases by 1. When Nikephoros loses, his count increases by 1.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check if a beats b, or b beats a.\n\nSo, for a and b:\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\nif a beats b: then B loses (so Nikephoros's count for losses is 0, and Polycarpus's count increases by 1?)\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the loser is the one who gets a spot. So, for example, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser. So Nikephoros's red spots (his own) would not increase, but Polycarpus's would. So the variables are:\n\nnikephoros_red = number of times he lost (when B's move beats A's move)\n\npolycarpus_red = number of times he lost (when A's move beats B's move)\n\nSo for each round, we can check:\n\nif a beats b: polycarpus_red +=1\n\nelif b beats a: nikephoros_red +=1\n\nelse: nothing.\n\nSo, how to code that?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b and returns which one wins.\n\nAlternatively, we can make a lookup table. For example, for each possible pair, determine who wins.\n\nAnother approach is:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # a wins, so B loses (so polycarpus_red +=1)\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # b wins, so Nikephoros loses (nikephoros_red +=1)\n\nSo, for each pair (a, b), we check this.\n\nSo, in code, for each of the T rounds, we can compute the a and b moves, check the result, and accumulate the counts for the per_cycle.\n\nOnce we have per_cycle_n (number of times Nikephoros lost in T rounds) and per_cycle_p (number of times Polycarpus lost in T rounds), then:\n\ntotal_cycles = n // T\n\nrem = n % T\n\nThen, total_n = total_cycles * per_cycle_n + count_in_rem_n\n\nSimilarly for total_p.\n\nSo the problem now becomes, how to compute per_cycle_n and per_cycle_p, and also compute the counts for the first rem rounds.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n, read A, read B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of T rounds, the moves and count the number of losses for each player.\n\nThen, compute how many full cycles there are (total_cycles = n // T), and rem = n % T.\n\nMultiply the per_cycle counts by total_cycles, and add the counts for the first rem rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the counts for the first rem rounds?\n\nWell, for the rem rounds, we can loop from 0 to rem-1, compute the moves for each round, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut for rem up to T-1, which can be up to 1e6, that's acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the per_cycle counts and the rem counts.\n\nBut what about when T is larger than n? For example, if n is smaller than T, then total_cycles is zero, and rem is n. So we just process the first n rounds.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nCompute T.\n\nCompute the per_cycle_n and per_cycle_p by looping over T rounds.\n\nThen, compute total_cycles = n // T\n\nrem = n % T\n\nThen, compute the total for the full cycles: total_n = total_cycles * per_cycle_n, total_p = total_cycles * per_cycle_p.\n\nThen, compute the counts for the first rem rounds, add to total_n and total_p.\n\nSo, the code needs to compute the counts for any number of rounds up to T.\n\nSo, perhaps, we can precompute for all possible rounds up to T, the cumulative counts. But for the rem rounds, we can just loop through the first rem rounds and compute the counts.\n\nBut for rem rounds, how to compute them?\n\nWell, for each i in 0..rem-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen check the winner.\n\nSo, in code, for the rem rounds, we can loop from 0 to rem-1, and compute each step.\n\nBut for rem up to 1e6, that's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (length 3), B is \"RSPP\" (length 4). So m=3, k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12. So T=12.\n\nThen, for each of 12 rounds, compute the moves.\n\nBut the sample has 7 rounds. So total_cycles = 7//12 = 0, rem=7. So we process the first 7 rounds.\n\nWhich is what the example shows.\n\nSo in the sample, the code would compute for rem=7 rounds, and get the counts.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing this approach.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead A and B as strings.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute GCD(m, k), then LCM.\n\nBut how to compute LCM in Python?\n\nYes, using math.gcd.\n\nBut note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of the inputs. So for positive integers, which m and k are, it's fine.\n\nSo:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to handle when a or b is zero? Well, the constraints say m and k are at least 1, so no problem.\n\nOnce T is computed, then:\n\nCompute per_cycle_n and per_cycle_p.\n\nInitialize per_cycle_n = 0, per_cycle_p = 0.\n\nfor i in range(T):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    determine outcome.\n\n    if a wins: per_cycle_p +=1\n\n    elif b wins: per_cycle_n +=1\n\nThen, compute total_cycles = n // T\n\nrem = n % T\n\nThen, compute the counts for rem rounds:\n\nrem_n = 0, rem_p = 0\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    ... same as before, add to rem_n and rem_p.\n\nThen total_n = total_cycles * per_cycle_n + rem_n\n\ntotal_p = total_cycles * per_cycle_p + rem_p\n\nOutput total_n and total_p.\n\nBut wait, for the case when T is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, T is at least 1.\n\nBut for the case when n is 0? But the input constraints say n >=1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=7\n\nA is \"RPS\" (m=3)\n\nB is \"RSPP\" (k=4)\n\nT = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nper_cycle_n and per_cycle_p for T=12 rounds.\n\nBut in the sample, the first 7 rounds are processed. Let's see.\n\nBut for the code, in the sample, the per_cycle_n and per_cycle_p would be calculated for 12 rounds, but since total_cycles is 0, and rem is 7, the code would process the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut how does that work? Let's see.\n\nBut for the sample, the code would process the first 7 rounds, which is exactly the example.\n\nNow, let's think about the code for the first sample.\n\nBut how to compute the per_cycle counts?\n\nBut in the first sample, the code would process T=12 rounds. However, since n=7 < T, the code would not use the per_cycle counts, but only the rem rounds.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother sample is the second input given:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). So T = LCM(8,1) = 8.\n\nn=5.\n\ntotal_cycles = 5 // 8 = 0, rem=5.\n\nSo for rem=5 rounds, process each round.\n\nIn each round, A's move is R (since 0%8=0, 1%8=1, etc. but for 0 to 4, all are R. B's move is R each time. So all rounds are draws. So the output is 0 0, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the problem is to code this correctly.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n from input. Then read A and B.\n\nBut the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake. Wait, the original problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A.\n\nThird line contains sequence B.\n\nSo in code, the input is read as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut the sample input in the problem is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen another input:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nBut for very large n, like 2e9, and T up to 1e6, the code will process T rounds once (which is 1e6 steps) and rem rounds (up to 1e6 steps). So total steps are O(2e6), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the helper function to compute the outcome.\n\nBut in code, for each a and b:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so B loses (so Polycarpus's count increases by 1)\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, Nikephoros loses (so his count increases by 1)\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nWait, the function returns (nikephoros_red, polycarpus_red) for that round.\n\nSo for each round, we can compute the increments.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor each i in 0 to T-1:\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    delta_n, delta_p = get_result(a, b)\n\n    per_cycle_n += delta_n\n\n    per_cycle_p += delta_p\n\nSame for the rem rounds.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    T = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n    # Compute per_cycle_n and per_cycle_p\n\n    per_cycle_n = 0\n\n    per_cycle_p = 0\n\n    for i in range(T):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses. So polycarpus_red +=1\n\n            per_cycle_p +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, Nikephoros loses. So nikephoros_red +=1\n\n            per_cycle_n +=1\n\n    total_cycles = n // T\n\n    rem = n % T\n\n    # Now compute rem rounds\n\n    rem_n = 0\n\n    rem_p = 0\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            rem_p +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            rem_n +=1\n\n    total_n = total_cycles * per_cycle_n + rem_n\n\n    total_p = total_cycles * per_cycle_p + rem_p\n\n    print(total_n, total_p)\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the output is 3 2. Let's check:\n\nIn the first sample, n=7, T=12. So total_cycles is 0, rem=7.\n\nLet's compute the rem_n and rem_p for 7 rounds.\n\nRound 0:\n\ni=0: A[0%3]=A[0] = 'R'; B[0%4]=B[0]='R' → draw. No change.\n\nRound 1: i=1.\n\nA[1%3] = A[1] = 'P'; B[1%4] = B[1] = 'S'. So a is P, b is S. Check if a beats b: P vs S. S beats P? Wait, according to the rules, scissors beats paper. So if a is P (paper) and b is S (scissors), then b wins. So Nikephoros loses. So rem_n +=1.\n\nWait, the code checks if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'). So for a=P and b=S: none of the conditions. So else clause is triggered. So B wins. So rem_n increases by 1.\n\nWhich is correct. Because in the first sample, round 2 (the second round) is P vs S. According to the note, Nikephoros loses here. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the note, the first round was R vs R (draw). Then the second round (i=1) is P vs S. Which is the second round. So Nikephoros loses here. So rem_n increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the first sample, Nikephoros has 3 losses. Let's see.\n\nBut the code would process for rem=7 rounds:\n\nLet me list all 7 rounds:\n\nRound 0: i=0 → A[0] = R, B[0] = R → draw.\n\nRound 1: i=1 → A[1] = P, B[1] = S → B wins (S beats P). So Nikephoros loses → rem_n +=1.\n\nRound 2: i=2 → A[2%3] = A[2] = S; B[2%4] = B[2] = P. So a=S, b=P. S beats P → A wins. So Polycarpus loses → rem_p +=1.\n\nRound 3: i=3 → A[3%3=0] = R; B[3%4=3] = P. R vs P: P beats R → B wins. Nikephoros loses → rem_n +=1.\n\nRound 4: i=4 → A[4%3=1] = P; B[4%4=0] = R. P vs R → P beats R → A wins → rem_p +=1.\n\nRound 5: i=5 → A[5%3=2] = S; B[5%4=1] = S. Draw. No change.\n\nRound 6: i=6 → A[6%3=0] = R; B[6%4=2] = P. R vs P → B wins. Nikephoros loses → rem_n +=1.\n\nSo after 7 rounds, rem_n is 1 (round 1) + 1 (round 3) + 1 (round 6) = 3. rem_p is 1 (round 2) + 1 (round 4) = 2. So total_n = 0*... + 3 = 3, total_p = 0*... +2 = 2. Which matches the sample output. So the code is correct here.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nAnother test case: when n is 12, which is T. So total_cycles is 1, rem=0. So the code would compute per_cycle_n and per_cycle_p, and multiply by 1. So the code would process all 12 rounds once.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when T is larger than n? Like n=5 and T=12. Then rem is 5, which is handled.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where m=1 and k=1. Then T=1. So for each round, the same moves. So if A[0] and B[0] are same, then no loss. Else, for each round, the same outcome.\n\nAnother edge case: when n is 0. But according to input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nAnother case: when A and B have sequences that are same. For example, A is \"R\", B is \"R\". All rounds are draws. So output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: when A is \"RPS\" and B is \"RPS\", m=3, k=3. T=3. So for each round, check:\n\nRound 0: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 1: P vs P → draw.\n\nRound 2: S vs S → draw.\n\nSo per_cycle_n and per_cycle_p are 0. So for any n, output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: A is \"R\", B is \"S\". So T=1. For each round, A plays R, B plays S. So R vs S: A wins. So B loses. So per_cycle_p is 1. So for n=5, total_cycles=5, rem=0. So total_p = 5*1 =5, total_n=0.\n\nSo code would output 0 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut note that for large T (up to 1e6), the code may take some time, but for Python, 1e6 iterations are acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for 1e6 steps, it's manageable. So the code should pass within time constraints.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNeed to import math.\n\nBut the code is written as a function, but in practice, the code must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    T = lcm(m, k)\n\n    per_cycle_n = 0\n\n    per_cycle_p = 0\n\n    for i in range(T):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            per_cycle_p += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            per_cycle_n += 1\n\n    total_cycles = n // T\n\n    rem = n % T\n\n    rem_n = 0\n\n    rem_p = 0\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            rem_p += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            rem_n += 1\n\n    total_n = total_cycles * per_cycle_n + rem_n\n\n    total_p = total_cycles * per_cycle_p + rem_p\n\n    print(total_n, total_p)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut in the sample input, the first sample input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich gives 3 2.\n\nTesting this code with that input would give the correct result.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich outputs 0 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's check for the case where n is equal to T. For example, n=12, T=12. Then rem=0, and the code uses total_cycles=1, and rem_n and rem_p are 0. So the code returns per_cycle_n and per_cycle_p.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge lies in efficiently simulating the game given the potentially very large number of rounds, up to 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Nikephoros's sequence is A and Polycarpus's sequence is B. These sequences repeat indefinitely.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The key insight is that the combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the lengths of sequences A and B. This LCM period allows us to compute results for one full cycle and then extrapolate for the entire number of rounds.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By calculating the number of losses for each player over one full cycle (LCM period), we can multiply this by the number of full cycles in the total number of rounds. The remaining rounds after these full cycles are handled separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_cycle_n = 0\n    per_cycle_p = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            per_cycle_p += 1\n        else:\n            per_cycle_n += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // T\n    rem = n % T\n    \n    rem_n = 0\n    rem_p = 0\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            rem_p += 1\n        else:\n            rem_n += 1\n    \n    total_n = total_cycles * per_cycle_n + rem_n\n    total_p = total_cycles * per_cycle_p + rem_p\n    \n    print(total_n, total_p)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences A and B.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of sequences A and B to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within one LCM period, determine the outcome of each round and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles Handling**: Calculate the number of full LCM periods in `n` rounds and multiply the losses per cycle by this count.\n5. **Remaining Rounds Handling**: Handle the remaining rounds after the full cycles by simulating them individually.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle up to 2 billion rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, reducing the complexity from O(n) to O(LCM(m, k)), which is feasible given the constraints.",
