She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem says that each second she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. So, the goal is to figure out the optimal steps to do this as quickly as possible.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial state. All tabs are open, and the cursor is at pos. We need to close tabs not in [l, r]. So, the tabs that need to be closed are those less than l and those greater than r. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. For example, if the current position is already within [l, r], maybe there's no need to do anything. Wait, but maybe not. Because if l is 2 and r is 4, and the current position is 3, then maybe she can just close the tabs to the left and right. But wait, the problem says that when you close tabs, you can close all to the left or right of the cursor. But the a and b variables adjust based on which tabs are closed. So, perhaps the approach is to first move the cursor to the leftmost required tab (l) or the rightmost (r), and then close the tabs outside.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the steps needed. Let's consider two main operations: closing the left part and closing the right part. But maybe the order matters. Also, moving the cursor to the correct positions.\n\nLet me think of the cases where the current position is already in the [l, r] range. For example, in the third sample input where n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5. Then no tabs need to be closed. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example is when the initial position is such that she can close both left and right parts with minimal steps. Let's take the first sample input: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The tabs to close are 1 and 5,6. How to do that?\n\nIn the example explanation, she moves to tab 2, closes left (which would close tab 1), then moves to 3, then 4, then closes right (closing 5 and 6). The steps here are:\n\nMove from 3 to 2 (1 sec), close left (1 sec). Then move from 2 to 3 (1 sec?), then to 4 (another sec), then close right (another sec). Total steps: 1+1 + 1+1 + 1 = 5 seconds. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the key seems to be that we need to find the minimal steps to reach positions where we can close the left and right parts. But how to model that?\n\nLet me think about the necessary steps. The tabs to be closed are those < l and those > r. So, the process involves closing all tabs to the left of l and all to the right of r. However, the way to do this is by moving the cursor to a position where you can perform these closes.\n\nFor example, to close the left part (tabs < l), you need to be at position l, then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close the right part (tabs > r), you need to be at position r, then close all tabs to the right.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range? Then, perhaps you can move to l or r, and then close the respective sides. But maybe there's a way to do it in fewer steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal steps are determined by the following:\n\n- If the current position is already in [l, r], then the steps needed are:\n\n   - The steps to move to l (if we need to close left) and then close left.\n\n   - The steps to move to r (if we need to close right) and then close right.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, if you can close both left and right from the same position, but that's only possible if the current position is in [l, r].\n\nWait, but if you are at l, then closing left would close tabs to the left of l, which are already outside the desired range. Similarly for r.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nIf l == 1 and r == n, then nothing to do. Answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise:\n\nWe need to close the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r).\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThe steps required would be:\n\n- Move to the position l (if needed) and close left. The time to move to l is |pos - l| steps. Then, one second to close left.\n\n- Then, move to r (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Tabs that need to be closed are those with indices less than `l` and greater than `r`.\n2. **Determine Movement and Closing Steps**:\n   - If `l` is 1, there are no tabs to the left of `l` to close.\n   - If `r` is `n`, there are no tabs to the right of `r` to close.\n3. **Calculate Movement Time**:\n   - If the current position is not within the segment [l, r], move to either `l` or `r` and then perform the closing operations.\n   - If the current position is already within [l, r], move to `l` to close tabs on the left and then move to `r` to close tabs on the right.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the required segment is the entire list of tabs, nothing to do\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Calculate steps needed to close left and right parts\n    steps = 0\n    # Check if we need to close left part (tabs < l)\n    if l > 1:\n        # Need to move to l and close left\n        steps += abs(pos - l) + 1\n    # Check if we need to close right part (tabs > r)\n    if r < n:\n        # After closing left, move to r from current position (which is l after previous step)\n        # But if we didn't close left, current position is still pos\n        # So need to calculate based on whether we moved to l or not\n        # So better to compute the movement from the original pos to r, but if we already moved to l, then from l to r\n        # So total steps for right is (distance from current position (after left steps) to r) + 1\n        # However, since the order can be optimized, we need to consider both possibilities:\n        # 1. Close left first, then move to r\n        # 2. Close right first, then move to l\n        # But which is better?\n        # Let's consider the minimal steps between these two options\n\n        # Option 1: Close left first, then move to r\n        option1 = 0\n        if l > 1:\n            option1 += abs(pos - l) + 1\n        option1 += abs(l - r) + 1\n\n        # Option 2: Close right first, then move to l\n        option2 = 0\n        if r < n:\n            option2 += abs(pos - r) + 1\n        option2 += abs(r - l) + 1\n\n        # Also, if we don't need to close left or right, then steps is 0\n        # But in this case, since we have else clause, at least one of them is needed\n\n        steps = min(option1, option2)\n    else:\n        # Only need to close left\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    # But wait, what if we don't need to close both? Like if only left or only right\n    # For example, if l=1, then only need to close right\n    # So let's re-structure the code:\n\n    total_steps = 0\n\n    # Close left part\n    if l > 1:\n        # Move to l and close left\n        total_steps += abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    # Close right part\n    if r < n:\n        # Now, after closing left, the current position is l\n        # So move from l to r, then close right\n        total_steps += abs(l - r) + 1\n\n    print(total_steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Closing Left Tabs**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, Luba moves to `l` and closes all tabs to the left. The time taken is the distance from the initial position to `l` plus one second to close.\n- **Closing Right Tabs**: If there are tabs to the right of `r`, Luba moves from `l` to `r` and closes all tabs to the right. The time taken is the distance from `l` to `r` plus one second to close.\n- The solution ensures that the minimal steps are calculated by considering the optimal path to close both left and right tabs efficiently.",
