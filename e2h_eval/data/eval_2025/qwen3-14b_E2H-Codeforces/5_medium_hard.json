Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me understand the problem again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question mark can match any color. I have to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair is a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And also output the pairs themselves.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. How do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the steps. First, I need to pair left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. Each boot can be used only once.\n\nThe key here is to find an efficient way to match the boots. Since the question marks can be flexible, maybe we can first handle the specific colors (non-?) and then use the question marks to fill in the gaps.\n\nLet me think about the strategy:\n\n1. For each color (excluding ?), count how many left boots and right boots there are. For example, for color 'a', if there are x left boots and y right boots, the maximum possible pairs for this color is min(x, y). But since a left boot can be paired with a right boot of the same color, but also, the ? can be used as wildcards.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used as any color. So perhaps the approach is:\n\nFirst, pair all the non-? left boots with non-? right boots of the same color. Then, use the remaining ?s to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping cases?\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible plan:\n\n- For each color c (a-z), collect the indices of left boots with color c (excluding ?) and right boots with color c (excluding ?). Then, pair them as much as possible. However, since a left boot can be matched with a right boot of same color, but also, the ? can be used to match any color.\n\nWait, but the ? can be matched with any other boot. So maybe the optimal approach is:\n\nFirst, process the non-? boots. For each color c, pair as many left and right boots as possible. Then, for the remaining boots (those that couldn't be paired because of color mismatch), use the ? to pair them.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider that each left boot can be matched with a right boot if either:\n\n- Both are non-? and same color.\n\nOR\n\n- One is ?, and the other is any.\n\nBut since ? can be used in multiple ways, we need to find a way to maximize the total pairs.\n\nLet me think of it as two parts:\n\nPart 1: Pair non-? left boots with non-? right boots of the same color.\n\nPart 2: Pair the remaining left boots (including those with ?) with the remaining right boots (including those with ?).\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nFor part 1, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But we have to track which ones are actually used.\n\nWait, but maybe we can pair the left and right boots of the same color first. Then, for the leftover left and right boots (which are either ? or have colors that couldn't be matched), we can pair them using the ?.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach is to first pair as many as possible between left and right boots of the same color (excluding ?). Then, for the remaining boots (left and right), use the ? to pair them.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\n1. Create two dictionaries: left_counts and right_counts, which count the number of non-? boots per color.\n\nFor each color c, the number of possible pairs is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nBut when we pair them, we need to track which left and right boots are used. However, since the actual indices matter for the output, perhaps we need to track the indices.\n\nWait, but for the first part, maybe we can process each color and pair left and right boots of that color. For example, for color 'a', take the first few left 'a's and pair them with the first few right 'a's. Then, mark them as used.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each color, we can collect the list of left boots (indices) and right boots (indices) of that color. Then, for each color, pair them up as much as possible. For example, if there are 5 left 'a's and 3 right 'a's, we can pair 3 of them. Then, the left 'a's that are not used can be considered as leftovers, and the right 'a's are used.\n\nBut after that, the remaining left and right boots (including those with ?) can be paired using the ?.\n\nBut how to handle the ?.\n\nLet me think: After pairing all same-colored non-? boots, the remaining left boots can be those that are either:\n\n- Non-? but their color has no matching right boots.\n\n- Or, they are ?.\n\nSame for the right boots.\n\nThen, the remaining left and right boots can be paired by using ? as wildcards.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally?\n\nFor example, suppose there are some left ? and some right ?. Also, some left non-? and right non-? that couldn't be paired because their colors didn't match. How to pair them?\n\nThe idea is that for the remaining boots, any left boot can be paired with any right boot as long as at least one of them is a ?.\n\nSo, for the remaining boots, we can pair them as follows:\n\nWe can collect all the remaining left boots (including ?) and the remaining right boots (including ?), and pair them in any way as long as they are compatible.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nWell, the maximum number of pairs here would be the minimum of the number of remaining left boots and remaining right boots. Because each pair uses one from each.\n\nBut how to ensure that the pairs are compatible.\n\nWait, but since we have already paired all same-color non-? boots, the remaining non-? boots on the left and right must have colors that don't match each other. So, for example, if a left boot is color 'a' (non-?), then there are no right boots of color 'a' left (since we already paired them all in step 1). So, the remaining non-? left boots can only be paired with right boots that are ? or have different colors. But since the right boots with same color as left are already paired, the remaining left non-? can only be paired with right ? or other non-? that are not same as their color.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because suppose there's a left boot of color 'a' and a right boot of color 'b'. Then, during step 1, they were not paired. Now, in the remaining steps, the left 'a' can be paired with a right '?' or another right 'a'? Wait, no. Because during step 1, we have already paired all the same color non-? boots. So, if there is a left 'a' remaining, then there are no right 'a's left. So, the remaining left 'a's can only be paired with right boots that are either ? or of different colors. But the right boots of different colors may not have any left boots of that color. So, perhaps the best way is to pair the remaining left and right boots with ?.\n\nBut how to do this optimally.\n\nLet me think: For the remaining left and right boots, the ones that are non-? can only be paired with ? on the other side. Because otherwise, if you pair a left non-? with a right non-? of different color, that's not allowed. So, in order to pair them, they must be matched with a ? on the other side.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nAfter step 1 (pairing same-colored non-? boots):\n\nCollect all remaining left boots (left_remaining) and right_remaining.\n\nFor these, we need to pair as many as possible. The way to do that is:\n\n- Pair left ? with right ?.\n\n- Then, pair left ? with right non-? (if any left ? and right non-?).\n\n- Then, pair right ? with left non-? (if any right ? and left non-?).\n\nBut how to do this optimally.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs here is the minimum of the number of left_remaining and right_remaining, but only if we can find compatible pairs.\n\nWait, but the problem is that some of the remaining left and right boots may not be compatible. For example, if there is a left non-? (say 'a') and a right non-? (say 'b'), then they cannot be paired. However, if there is a left 'a' and a right '?', they can be paired. Similarly, a left '?' and a right 'b' can be paired. Also, a left '?' and a right '?' can be paired.\n\nSo, the idea is that for the remaining boots, the only incompatible pairs are between non-? left and non-? right boots of different colors. All other pairs are compatible.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, given a set of left_remaining and right_remaining, how to pair them as much as possible, considering that:\n\n- A left non-? can be paired with a right ?.\n\n- A right non-? can be paired with a left ?.\n\n- A left ? can be paired with a right ?.\n\n- A left non-? can't be paired with a right non-? unless they are same color (but in this case, those would have been handled in step 1).\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs here is the sum of:\n\nmin( number of left ? , number of right ? ) + \n\nmin( number of left non-? , number of right ? ) + \n\nmin( number of right non-? , number of left ? )\n\nBut wait, no. Because the left non-? can be paired with right ? and vice versa. However, the left ? can be paired with right ? as well.\n\nBut how to maximize the total.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nLet Lq be the number of left ? in remaining.\n\nRq be the number of right ? in remaining.\n\nLc be the number of left non-? in remaining.\n\nRc be the number of right non-? in remaining.\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is:\n\nWe can pair:\n\n- All Lq and Rq. But since each pair uses one from each, the maximum here is min(Lq, Rq). Let's say we pair as many as possible here. Then, the remaining Lq - min(Lq, Rq) and Rq - min(Lq, Rq) are zero (if we take min).\n\nThen, the remaining Lq' and Rq' are zero. Then, the remaining are Lc and Rc. But since Lc is left non-? and Rc is right non-? (and they can't be paired together, since they would have same color only if they were paired in step 1).\n\nSo, the remaining pairs can be formed by pairing Lc with Rq (if any) and Rc with Lq (if any). But since after pairing the ?s, the Lq and Rq are zero, so no more pairs can be made. Thus, the total pairs from this part is min(Lq, Rq) + min(Lc, Rq_remaining) + min(Rc, Lq_remaining) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nWe can first pair as many as possible between Lq and Rq. Then, use the remaining Lq and Rq to pair with the Lc and Rc.\n\nBut since after pairing the Lq and Rq, there are no more ?s left. So, the remaining Lc and Rc can't be paired with anything else. So, the total pairs from this phase is min(Lq, Rq) + min(Lc, Rq_initial) + min(Rc, Lq_initial) ?\n\nNo, that's not right. Because the initial Lq and Rq are the ones in the remaining.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to pair all possible combinations where at least one is a ?.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs here is the sum of:\n\nnumber of left ? + number of right ? - min(number of left ?, number of right ?) ?\n\nNo, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the total possible pairs as:\n\nEach left boot can be paired with a right boot if either is a ?.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs is min( (number of left boots in remaining) , (number of right boots in remaining) ), but only if we can pair them properly.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nWait, the problem is that the total number of pairs is min( (number of left_remaining), (number of right_remaining) ), because each pair uses one left and one right. But since all pairs are compatible (since any pair where at least one is a ? is compatible, and the other case is when both are non-? but that's impossible because they would have same color only if they were already paired in step 1, which they weren't).\n\nWait, no. Suppose that there are left non-? and right non-? in the remaining. Since they couldn't be paired in step 1, that implies that their colors are not same. So, if we pair them, they would be incompatible. So, we can't pair them. Therefore, the maximum number of pairs is not min( left_remaining, right_remaining ), but something less.\n\nSo, this complicates things. How to compute the maximum pairs here.\n\nSo, for the remaining left and right boots, the only compatible pairs are those where at least one is a ?. Therefore, the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nnumber of left ? + number of right ? - min( number of left ?, number of right ? ) ?\n\nNo. Wait, for example, if there are 3 left ? and 2 right ?. Then, we can pair 2 pairs (each ? with ?), and then 1 left ? remains. Then, this left ? can be paired with any right non-? (if any exist). So the maximum is 2 (from ?-?) plus min(1, number of right non-?).\n\nSo, the approach here is:\n\nFirst, pair as many ?-? as possible.\n\nThen, pair the remaining ?s with non-?s on the opposite side.\n\nSo, the steps for this second phase would be:\n\n1. Collect all the left boots in the remaining (after step 1) into two groups: left_q (those with ?) and left_c (those with non-?).\n\nSimilarly for right boots: right_q and right_c.\n\n2. Pair as many as possible between left_q and right_q. Let's say we pair x = min(len(left_q), len(right_q)). So, x pairs here.\n\n3. Now, after that, we have left_q' = left_q - x, and right_q' = right_q -x.\n\n4. Then, pair the remaining left_q' with right_c. So, the number of pairs here is min(len(left_q'), len(right_c)).\n\n5. Similarly, pair the remaining right_q' with left_c. The number of pairs here is min(len(right_q'), len(left_c)).\n\nBut wait, after step 4, we can't pair the left_q' with right_c and also right_q' with left_c, because that would require that all of them are used. But perhaps the optimal way is to first pair the left_q' with right_c as much as possible, then the remaining right_q' with left_c.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible pairs from this phase is x + min( (len(left_q) - x) + (len(right_q) -x), ... )\n\nBut perhaps the best approach is:\n\nAfter pairing x = min(left_q, right_q) pairs of ?-?, we have:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q - x.\n\nremaining_right_q = right_q - x.\n\nThen, for the remaining_left_q, we can pair them with right_c (right non-?).\n\nSimilarly, for the remaining_right_q, we can pair them with left_c.\n\nSo, the number of pairs is:\n\npairs = x + min(remaining_left_q, len(right_c)) + min(remaining_right_q, len(left_c)).\n\nBut wait, but after pairing the remaining_left_q with right_c, there's no more left_q left. Similarly for the remaining_right_q and left_c.\n\nBut what if after pairing, there are some left_c and right_c that are not paired? Those can't be paired, since they are non-? and different colors.\n\nSo, the total pairs from this phase is x + min(remaining_left_q, len(right_c)) + min(remaining_right_q, len(left_c)).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nTotal pairs is:\n\nstep1_pairs + step2_pairs.\n\nNow, the problem is how to implement this.\n\nBut how to track the indices of the boots for each step.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFirst, for step 1, pair same-colored non-? boots. For each color c (not ?), collect the list of left indices and right indices. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, we pair 3 pairs, taking the first 3 left and first 3 right.\n\nOnce these are paired, we mark them as used.\n\nThen, collect all the remaining left and right boots (those not used in step 1).\n\nThen, for step 2, process the remaining as per the above steps.\n\nNow, the challenge is to track which boots are used and which are not.\n\nBut for large n (up to 150,000), we need an efficient way to do this.\n\nBut for Python, even O(n) operations are acceptable.\n\nSo, let's think of the data structures:\n\nWe can have two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, indicating whether the boot is used.\n\nInitially, all are False.\n\nFor step 1:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used.\n\n   pair as many as possible (the min of the two lists), and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect these indices?\n\nAn alternative approach is to create for each color, a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, for each color, process the pairs.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nWe can create for each color, a list of left indices and a list of right indices. For example, for the left string, for each character (non-?), we add the index to the corresponding color's list.\n\nThen, for each color c in a-z:\n\n   left_list = list of left indices with color c.\n\n   right_list = list of right indices with color c.\n\n   pairs_possible = min(len(left_list), len(right_list)).\n\n   for i in 0 to pairs_possible -1:\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark them as used.\n\nBut this way, we can collect all the pairs for step 1.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left and right boots are those not marked as used.\n\nNow, for step 2:\n\nCollect all the left boots not used, and the right boots not used.\n\nThen, separate them into left_q (those with ?), left_c (non-?), and similarly for right.\n\nThen, proceed as per the steps above.\n\nBut how to collect these?\n\nOnce we have the lists of left and right boots not used, we can split them into:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in left_remaining if l[i] == '?']\n\nleft_c = [i for i in left_remaining if l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right_q and right_c.\n\nThen, proceed to pair them.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally.\n\nFor example, in the first step of step 2:\n\nPair as many ?-? as possible.\n\nSo, take the first min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q, pair them with right_c.\n\nThen, for the remaining right_q, pair them with left_c.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nleft_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i]]\n\nright_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i]]\n\nThen:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in left_remaining if l[i] == '?']\nleft_c = [i for i in left_remaining if l[i] != '?']\nright_q = [i for i in right_remaining if r[i] == '?']\nright_c = [i for i in right_remaining if r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, step 2:\n\npairs = []\n\n# Step 2a: pair ?-?\nx = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(x):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_q[i]) )\n    # mark them as used? Well, since they are in the remaining, they are not used yet. But since we are processing them here, we can just add them to the pairs list.\n\nWait, but once we pair them, they are used. So, for the rest of the steps, we need to make sure that they are not used again. However, since we have already collected left_q and right_q as the remaining boots, and we are processing them in order, perhaps we can take the first x elements of left_q and right_q, pair them, and then process the remaining.\n\nBut in the code, how to track which ones are used? Because once we pair them, they are used and should not be considered again.\n\nBut in the code, the left_remaining and right_remaining are lists of indices that are not used. So, when we pair them in step 2, we can just take the elements from these lists and add them to the pairs list, and not worry about marking them again, since they are already in the remaining lists.\n\nBut perhaps the code needs to process the left_q and right_q, and after pairing them, the remaining elements are those that are not paired.\n\nSo, after pairing x pairs of ?-?:\n\nleft_q_remaining = left_q[x:]\nright_q_remaining = right_q[x:]\n\nThen, pair the left_q_remaining with right_c:\n\ny = min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_c))\nfor i in range(y):\n    pairs.append( (left_q_remaining[i], right_c[i]) )\n\nThen, pair the right_q_remaining with left_c:\n\nz = min(len(right_q_remaining), len(left_c))\nfor i in range(z):\n    pairs.append( (left_c[i], right_q_remaining[i]) )\n\nWait, but the left_c and right_q_remaining are lists. So, perhaps:\n\nAfter pairing the first part, the remaining left_q_remaining and right_q_remaining are the ones that are not paired yet.\n\nThen, for the left_q_remaining, we can pair them with right_c (as much as possible), then for the right_q_remaining, pair them with left_c.\n\nBut in code:\n\nleft_q_remaining = left_q[x:]\nright_q_remaining = right_q[x:]\n\n# Pair left_q_remaining with right_c\ny = min( len(left_q_remaining), len(right_c) )\nfor i in range(y):\n    pairs.append( (left_q_remaining[i], right_c[i]) )\n\n# Now, the remaining right_q_remaining can be paired with left_c\nz = min( len(right_q_remaining), len(left_c) )\nfor i in range(z):\n    pairs.append( (left_c[i], right_q_remaining[i]) )\n\nSo, the total pairs added in step 2 is x + y + z.\n\nBut what about the remaining elements in left_c and right_c? They can't be paired, since they are non-? and their colors don't match (they were not paired in step 1).\n\nSo, the code would collect all these pairs.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python, handling the indices correctly.\n\nBut how to collect the left and right lists for step 1.\n\nLet's think about code structure.\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as boolean arrays of size n, initialized to False.\n\nCreate for each color, a list of left indices and right indices.\n\nFor example, for color in 'a' to 'z':\n\nleft_color_dict[color] = list of indices i where l[i] == color and not used.\n\nWait, but initially, all are not used. So, for each color, collect all the indices where l[i] is that color.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nBut for step 1, we need to process each color, and pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nSo, code:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn = int(input())\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\nleft_used = [False]*n\nright_used = [False]*n\n\npairs = []\n\n# Step 1: pair same color non-? boots\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_list = []\n    right_list = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]:\n            left_list.append(i)\n        if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]:\n            right_list.append(i)\n    # Now pair as many as possible\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) ) # +1 because the output uses 1-based indices\n        left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n        right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nWait, but this approach is O(26 * n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1.5e5.\n\nWait, but for each color, we are looping through all n elements. That would be O(26n) time. Which for n=1.5e5 is 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, precompute for each color the list of left and right indices.\n\nBut for code simplicity, perhaps the above approach is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each color, the code loops through all n elements. That's O(26n) time. For n=1.5e5, that's 3.9e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to precompute for each color, the list of indices.\n\nLike:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color = defaultdict(list)\nright_color = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if l[i] != '?':\n        left_color[l[i]].append(i)\n    if r[i] != '?':\n        right_color[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color and right_color:\n\nBut then, for each color c, process the left and right lists.\n\nBut this approach would avoid looping through all n elements for each color. However, the code would need to handle the used flags.\n\nWait, but the code above for step 1 is not correct. Because once a left boot is used in a pair, it's marked as used, and thus in subsequent steps, it's not considered again.\n\nBut the code I wrote earlier for step 1 loops through all n elements for each color, which is O(26n) time. However, that's not efficient. Because for each color, we are checking all n elements again.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices. Then, for each color, we can process the pairs between left and right.\n\nBut during this process, we have to track which indices are already used. However, once a boot is used, it's marked as used and not considered again.\n\nBut how to process this.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWe can create for each color, a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Initially, these are all the indices with that color. Then, for each color c, we can process the pairs between left and right.\n\nBut for example, for color 'a', we have left_a = [indices of left boots with color 'a'], and right_a = [indices of right boots with color 'a'].\n\nThen, for each pair, we can take the first min(len(left_a), len(right_a)) pairs, and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used. Because once a left boot is used, it's not available in future steps.\n\nBut in this approach, the initial lists are all the indices for each color. However, once some are used, they are removed from consideration.\n\nBut how to track this.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps for the code, we can use pointers.\n\nFor example, for each color c, we have a list of left indices and a list of right indices. We can have two pointers, left_ptr and right_ptr, which track how many have been used.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the initial approach of looping through all the elements for each color is not efficient, but for the problem constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be optimized as follows:\n\nFor step 1, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices with color c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices with color c and not used.\n\n   pair as many as possible.\n\nBut in code, how to collect those.\n\nBut for code, perhaps the following:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n    right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n        left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n        right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut this is O(26n) time again, which is acceptable for n=1.5e5.\n\nBut for each color, building left_list and right_list is O(n) time, leading to O(26n) time. However, with 26*1.5e5 being 3.9e6, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps this is too slow for Python, considering that for each color, we are scanning the entire array again.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices, and then during step 1, for each color, process the left and right lists, but track how many have been used.\n\nFor example:\n\nprecompute left_color_dict and right_color_dict, which are dictionaries mapping color to list of indices.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_dict and right_color_dict:\n\n   left_list = left_color_dict[c]\n   right_list = right_color_dict[c]\n\n   num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(num_pairs):\n       pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n       left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n       right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut this is incorrect, because the left_used and right_used arrays are not updated. For example, if a left boot was already used in a previous color's processing, it would be included again in the current color's processing.\n\nWait, no. Because during the initial processing, the left_color_dict contains all the indices for that color. But once a left boot is marked as used, it's not considered again in the same step.\n\nBut this approach would not work, because the left_color_dict contains all the indices for that color, including those that have already been used. For example, if a left boot was used in a previous color's processing, it would still be present in the left_color_dict for its color. Hence, when processing another color, the same left boot could be considered again.\n\nThus, this approach is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach of checking for each color, the current list of unused boots is necessary.\n\nBut for Python, perhaps the code can be optimized.\n\nAlternatively, for each color, during step 1, we can iterate through the left and right indices once, and pair them.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_list = []\n    right_list = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]:\n            left_list.append(i)\n        if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]:\n            right_list.append(i)\n    # pair as many as possible\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n        left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n        right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nYes, this is the same as before. For each color, we build the left_list and right_list by checking each index, but only adding those not used. Then, pair as many as possible.\n\nThis is O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, we proceed to step 2.\n\nNow, collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nleft_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i]]\nright_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i]]\n\nThen, split into q and c:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in left_remaining if l[i] == '?']\nleft_c = [i for i in left_remaining if l[i] != '?']\nright_q = [i for i in right_remaining if r[i] == '?']\nright_c = [i for i in right_remaining if r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, process step 2a, 2b, 2c.\n\nBut how to process them.\n\nAs discussed earlier:\n\nx = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(x):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[x:]\nremaining_right_q = right_q[x:]\n\ny = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(right_c))\nfor i in range(y):\n    pairs.append( (remaining_left_q[i]+1, right_c[i]+1) )\n\nremaining_right_q = remaining_right_q[y:]\n\nz = min(len(remaining_right_q), len(left_c))\nfor i in range(z):\n    pairs.append( (left_c[i]+1, remaining_right_q[i]+1) )\n\nBut this is the code for step 2.\n\nBut wait, the right_c is the list of right boots not used, with non-? colors. So, when pairing remaining_left_q with right_c, we take the first y elements of right_c.\n\nBut after that, the remaining_right_q is processed with left_c.\n\nBut in this code, after pairing y pairs, the remaining_right_q is the original remaining_right_q minus the first y elements?\n\nNo, the code as written:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[x:] (the list of left ? after pairing x pairs with right ?)\n\nremaining_right_q = right_q[x:]\n\nthen, for y pairs, we pair remaining_left_q's first y elements with right_c's first y elements.\n\nThen, remaining_right_q is now the same as before, but we need to pair them with left_c.\n\nBut the code for z is min(len(remaining_right_q), len(left_c)), and for each i in range(z), we pair left_c[i] with remaining_right_q[i].\n\nBut in this code, the left_c and right_c are lists of indices that are not used. So, the code is correct.\n\nBut in code, the left_c and right_c are lists that are not modified during the pairing steps. So, when pairing with remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q, we can take the first elements.\n\nOnce all pairs are added, the total pairs is the sum of step1_pairs and step2_pairs.\n\nNow, the code should collect all pairs.\n\nBut what about the order? For example, in step 1, when pairing left and right lists, the order may affect the remaining pairs. But since the problem says that any correct answer is acceptable, the order doesn't matter.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nWait, the sample input is given as a list of test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is:\n\nThe first line is n, then the next two lines are l and r.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the user is to read from standard input, which is probably one test case. But the sample input shows four test cases. So perhaps the user's code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains the string l.\n\nThird line contains the string r.\n\nSo, the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But perhaps that's a formatting error in the problem description. For example, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nIn the example, the first input is:\n\nInput:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nOutput:\n\n5\n\n...\n\nBut the sample input provided in the problem seems to be multiple test cases. However, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is usually a single test case.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user is to write a code that can handle multiple test cases. However, looking back, the problem says:\n\nThe input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line l.\n\nThird line r.\n\nSo, the code should read n, l, r, and process that.\n\nBut the sample input shows four different test cases, with outputs. So perhaps the sample input is given as four separate test cases, but the code is supposed to read one test case per run.\n\nBut regardless, the code should read n, l, r from stdin, and output the required answer.\n\nAssuming that, the code can proceed as written.\n\nNow, testing the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10, l=codeforces, r",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility is determined by matching specific colors or using question marks (which can match any color). The solution involves two main steps: pairing non-question mark boots with matching colors and then using question marks to pair remaining boots.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Non-Question Mark Boots**: First, we pair left boots with right boots that have the same specific color. This is done for each color from 'a' to 'z'.\n2. **Pair Remaining Boots Using Question Marks**: After pairing all possible non-question mark boots, we handle the remaining boots. We use question marks to pair with both question marks and non-question mark boots. This involves:\n   - Pairing question mark left boots with question mark right boots.\n   - Pairing remaining question mark left boots with non-question mark right boots.\n   - Pairing remaining question mark right boots with non-question mark left boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    left_used = [False] * n\n    right_used = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Pair same-colored non-? boots\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        left_list = []\n        right_list = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]:\n                left_list.append(i)\n            if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]:\n                right_list.append(i)\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            pairs.append((left_list[i] + 1, right_list[i] + 1))\n            left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n            right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\n    # Step 2: Process remaining boots\n    left_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i]]\n    right_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i]]\n\n    left_q = []\n    left_c = []\n    for i in left_remaining:\n        if l[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_c.append(i)\n\n    right_q = []\n    right_c = []\n    for i in right_remaining:\n        if r[i] == '?':\n            right_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            right_c.append(i)\n\n    # Pair ?-?\n    x = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(x):\n        pairs.append((left_q[i] + 1, right_q[i] + 1))\n\n    # Remaining left_q and right_q\n    remaining_left_q = left_q[x:]\n    remaining_right_q = right_q[x:]\n\n    # Pair remaining left_q with right_c\n    y = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(right_c))\n    for i in range(y):\n        pairs.append((remaining_left_q[i] + 1, right_c[i] + 1))\n\n    # Remaining right_q\n    remaining_right_q = remaining_right_q[y:]\n\n    # Pair remaining right_q with left_c\n    z = min(len(remaining_right_q), len(left_c))\n    for i in range(z):\n        pairs.append((left_c[i] + 1, remaining_right_q[i] + 1))\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for a, b in pairs:\n        print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and parsed into the number of boots `n`, and the strings `l` and `r` representing the colors of left and right boots respectively.\n2. **Initial Pairing**: For each color from 'a' to 'z', we collect indices of left and right boots that have this color and are not yet used. We then pair these indices as much as possible.\n3. **Handling Remaining Boots**: After initial pairing, we process the remaining boots. We separate them into those with question marks and those with specific colors. We then pair question marks with each other and with specific color boots as much as possible to maximize the number of valid pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently use both specific color matches and the flexibility of question marks to form the maximum number of compatible pairs.",
