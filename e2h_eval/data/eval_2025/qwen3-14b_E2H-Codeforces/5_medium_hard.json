Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which is a lowercase letter or a question mark. The goal is to pair them such that each pair has compatible colors. The maximum number of such pairs. And then output those pairs with their indices.\n\nCompatibility rules: two specific colors are compatible if they are the same. A question mark can be compatible with any color, including another question mark. So, for example, a '?' and a 'a' is compatible, and '?' and '?' is also compatible.\n\nThe challenge is to find the maximum number of pairs possible, and output those pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Let's think about the steps.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Each left boot can be paired with a right boot, but each can be used only once.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph matching problem. But with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like maximum bipartite matching (like Hopcroft-Karp) would be too slow. Because Hopcroft-Karp has O(E√V) time, but here E could be O(n^2), which is way too big for n=1.5e5. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nSo, we need a greedy approach that can find the maximum pairs efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of counts and possible pairings.\n\nLet me think of the following strategy:\n\nFirst, pair all the left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same specific color. Then handle the remaining ones with question marks.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nAlternatively, think about the following steps:\n\n1. For each color c (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots with color c (call it left_count[c]) and the number of right boots with color c (right_count[c]). The maximum possible pairs for these is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). However, since each boot can be used once, we need to pair them.\n\nBut if we pair them directly, that's the optimal way. So, for each color c (not ?), we can pair as many as possible between left and right boots with color c.\n\nThen, after that, we have some left and right boots with '?', and possibly some leftover boots from specific colors.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used to pair with any remaining boots. So, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFirst, process the specific colors. For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right boots of color c. Then, use the remaining question marks to pair with any available boots (either remaining specific or other question marks).\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots with the same specific color.\n\nFor example, for each color c (not ?), take the minimum between the number of left and right boots with color c. Then pair them. But how to track which ones are used?\n\nBut perhaps we can first collect all the positions where left and right have specific colors, and pair them. But for the purpose of counting, maybe we can first compute how many pairs we can make for each color, and then handle the question marks.\n\nBut the problem is that when you pair a left boot with a right boot of the same color, you can't use them again. So, perhaps we need to process the specific colors first, and then handle the question marks.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nWe can create two separate lists:\n\n- For left boots that are not '?', and for right boots that are not '?'. We can pair them based on color.\n\nBut perhaps we can first process all the color-specific pairs. For example, for each color c, we can pair left boots with color c with right boots with color c. Once that's done, the remaining left and right boots (including those with '?') can be paired using the question marks.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already used?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can:\n\n- For each color c (excluding '?'), count the number of left and right boots with color c. The number of pairs possible is min(left_c, right_c). Let's say we take that. Then, subtract that from both left_c and right_c. Then, the remaining left and right boots (with specific colors) can't be paired with any other specific colors except '?', but since they are specific, they can only be paired with '?'.\n\nBut then, after that, the question marks can be used to pair with any remaining boots (specific or '?').\n\nSo, the total pairs would be:\n\nsum over all c (min(left_c, right_c)) + min(remaining_left_question_marks + remaining_right_question_marks, ... )\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used to pair with any remaining boots, but each can be used once.\n\nSo, after pairing all same-color specific boots, we have:\n\nLeft boots that are specific (not ?) but not yet paired. Let's call them L_remaining.\n\nRight boots that are specific (not ?) but not yet paired. Call them R_remaining.\n\nPlus, left and right question marks that are not yet paired.\n\nSo, for example, for each left boot that is not ?, but couldn't be paired with a right boot of same color, it can be paired with a right boot that is '?', or a right boot that is a specific color but was not paired (but that would require that the left boot's color is same as that right boot's color, which is not the case. Wait, no. Because if the left boot is specific (say 'a'), and the right boot is specific (say 'b'), they can't be paired. So the only way to pair them is if one of them is a question mark.\n\nSo, after the initial step, the remaining specific boots (L_remaining and R_remaining) cannot be paired with each other. So they can only be paired with question marks.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the remaining specific boots with question marks.\n\nLet me think:\n\nSuppose after processing same-color pairs, we have:\n\nFor left boots: some number of left boots with specific colors (call this L_sp) and left boots with '?' (call this L_qm).\n\nSimilarly for right boots: R_sp and R_qm.\n\nNow, each L_sp can be paired with a right qm (since the right is ?). Similarly, each R_sp can be paired with a left qm.\n\nBut also, the left qm can be paired with right qm.\n\nSo, how to maximize the pairs here?\n\nThe total possible pairs is the sum of:\n\nnumber of L_sp that can be paired with R_qm (up to min(L_sp, R_qm)),\n\nplus number of R_sp that can be paired with L_qm (up to min(R_sp, L_qm)),\n\nplus the remaining (after that) of L_qm and R_qm can be paired among themselves (each pair uses one left and one right qm, so the number is min(remaining_L_qm, remaining_R_qm)).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible pairs from this phase is:\n\nmin(L_sp + R_sp + L_qm + R_qm, ... ?) Well, the total possible pairs here is the sum of all possible pairs that can be formed between L_sp and R_qm, R_sp and L_qm, and L_qm and R_qm. But how to maximize that.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is:\n\nFirst, pair as many as possible L_sp with R_qm. Then pair R_sp with L_qm. Then pair the remaining qm with each other.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the variables:\n\nLet's say after the first step (pairing same-color specific boots):\n\nleft_specific = number of left boots with specific colors not yet paired.\n\nright_specific = number of right boots with specific colors not yet paired.\n\nleft_qm = number of left boots with '?' not yet paired.\n\nright_qm = number of right boots with '?' not yet paired.\n\nSo, the maximum pairs from this phase would be:\n\npairs = 0\n\npairs += min(left_specific, right_qm) → pair each left specific with a right qm.\n\nThen, subtract that from left_specific and right_qm.\n\nThen, pairs += min(right_specific, left_qm) → pair right specific with left qm.\n\nSubtract that from right_specific and left_qm.\n\nThen, pairs += min(left_qm, right_qm) → pair the remaining qm.\n\nSo, total pairs from this phase is sum of those three.\n\nBut how to track which actual boots are being paired.\n\nBut the problem is that this approach may not be optimal. For example, suppose that pairing some left specific with a right specific (if possible?), but no, because in the first step, the same-color specific boots were already paired, so any left specific that remains has no matching right specific. Because otherwise, they would have been paired in the first step.\n\nSo, the remaining left specific and right specific can't be paired with each other. So, the above approach is correct.\n\nSo, putting this together, the overall maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\nsame_color_pairs + (the pairs from the second phase).\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nNow, the problem is not just to compute the maximum number of pairs, but also to output the actual pairs.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each left and right boot, track whether they are used or not.\n\n2. First, pair all left and right boots that have the same specific color (not ?). How to do this? For example, for each color c, collect the list of left boots with color c, and the list of right boots with color c. Then pair them in some order (like first left with first right, etc.), and mark them as used.\n\n3. Then, collect the remaining left and right boots with specific colors (not ?) and the remaining question marks.\n\n4. Then, pair as follows:\n\n   a. For each left specific boot (not used yet), try to pair with a right question mark (not used yet).\n\n   b. For each right specific boot (not used yet), try to pair with a left question mark (not used yet).\n\n   c. Pair remaining question marks between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently, given that n is up to 1.5e5.\n\nBut for the first step, pairing same-color specific boots, we can process each color, and for each color, pair the left and right boots.\n\nBut how to collect the indices for each color.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nWe can create dictionaries for left and right boots, mapping colors to lists of indices (positions) where that color occurs.\n\nFor example, for left boots:\n\nleft_colors = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i, c in enumerate(l):\n\n   if c != '?':\n\n      left_colors[c].append(i)\n\nSimilarly for right_colors.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_colors and right_colors:\n\nthe number of pairs for color c is min(len(left_colors[c]), len(right_colors[c])).\n\nBut to pair them, we can take the first k elements of each list and pair them.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used. Because once they are paired, they can't be used again.\n\nBut for the first step, we can process each color, and for each, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used. So, perhaps we can have two arrays, used_left and used_right, initialized to False. Then, for each pair, we mark them as True.\n\nSo, the first step is:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False] * n.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_colors and right_colors:\n\n   left_list = left_colors[c]\n\n   right_list = right_colors[c]\n\n   k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(k):\n\n       left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n       right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n       if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n           add this pair to the result list\n\n           mark used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n           mark used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, this is not quite correct. Because for example, if there are multiple colors, and some of them may have overlapping indices. But since we process each color separately, and for each color, we pair the left and right boots of that color, and mark them as used.\n\nBut this approach would work, but how to collect all the colors. Also, note that for a color c, we need to check if both left and right have that color. So, for each color in the union of left_colors and right_colors, but perhaps better to iterate through all possible letters (a-z), and check if both left and right have that color.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c in left_colors, check if it exists in right_colors. If so, proceed. Otherwise, skip.\n\nBut this approach may miss some colors that are in right_colors but not in left_colors. However, for those colors, the same_color_pairs would be zero.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to iterate through all possible colors (from 'a' to 'z'), and for each color c, check if there are left and right boots of that color, and then pair them.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's easier to collect all the colors present in either left or right, but that may not be necessary.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can loop through all possible colors (a-z) and process each.\n\nOnce that's done, we have the same_color_pairs.\n\nThen, for the remaining steps.\n\nNow, the remaining left and right boots are those that are not used yet, and have color not used in same-color pairs.\n\nSo, for the next steps, we need to collect:\n\nleft_specific_remaining: list of left boots with color not '?', not used yet.\n\nright_specific_remaining: list of right boots with color not '?', not used yet.\n\nleft_qm_remaining: list of left boots with '?', not used yet.\n\nright_qm_remaining: list of right boots with '?', not used yet.\n\nBut how to collect these.\n\nAlternatively, we can collect for all left boots not used yet, and their color is not '?', and same for right.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps during the first phase, we can collect all the left and right boots that are not used, and have color not '?'.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to collect all the left boots with color not '?' and not used, and same for the right.\n\nOnce that's done, the next step is:\n\nPair left_specific_remaining with right_qm_remaining.\n\nHow to do this? For each left_specific_remaining, find any right_qm_remaining not used yet, pair them.\n\nSimilarly for the other direction.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nOnce again, perhaps for the left and right, we can collect the indices of the unused boots with specific colors and question marks.\n\nSo, after the first phase, we can:\n\nCollect all left boots with color not '?' and not used. Let's call them left_sp = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nSimilarly for right_sp = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nleft_qm = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_qm = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, for the second phase:\n\nWe can first pair left_sp with right_qm.\n\nTake the minimum of len(left_sp) and len(right_qm). For each such pair, pair them.\n\nThen, pair right_sp with left_qm.\n\nTake the minimum of len(right_sp) and len(left_qm). For each such pair, pair them.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_qm and right_qm.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used. For example, during this phase, we need to mark the used_left and used_right as True once they are paired.\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_sp), len(right_qm))):\n\n   pair left_sp[i] with right_qm[i]\n\nSimilarly for the next steps.\n\nBut how to collect the left_sp and right_qm lists.\n\nBut this approach would work, but for large n, creating these lists may take O(n) time and space, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for n up to 1.5e5, this is manageable.\n\nSo, putting this all together:\n\nThe code steps would be:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as False arrays.\n\nProcess same-color pairs:\n\nfor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = list of indices i where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   right_list = list of indices j where r[j] == c and not used_right[j]\n\n   k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in 0..k-1:\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i], mark as used.\n\nBut how to collect left_list and right_list for each color.\n\nWait, but for each color, we can precompute the list of indices once, and then during the same-color pairing phase, we can iterate through them, and for each, check if they are not used yet. However, this could be time-consuming if done naively.\n\nAlternative approach: for each color c, collect all left indices with that color, and all right indices with that color. Then, during the same-color pairing phase, for each color, we can pair as many as possible between left and right, taking the first available ones.\n\nBut how to track which are used. For example, for color c, we have left_list and right_list. We can iterate through them, and for each pair, if both are not used, pair them and mark as used.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently. Let's think of the code:\n\nWe can create for each color c, a list of left indices and a list of right indices.\n\nFor example, left_color_map is a dictionary where keys are colors, and values are lists of indices (for left boots with that color). Similarly for right_color_map.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map:\n\n   left_list = left_color_map[c]\n\n   right_list = right_color_map[c]\n\n   min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(min_len):\n\n       left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n       right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n       if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n           add (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) to the answer list\n\n           mark used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n           mark used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this is not correct, because for example, some left indices in left_list may have already been used in previous pairings. For example, if color 'a' is processed first, and then color 'b' is processed, but some left indices in 'b' list may have been used in color 'a' pairing. Wait, no. Because the same-color pairing is for same color. So, if a left boot has color 'a', it can only be paired with a right boot of color 'a' during this phase. Once it is used, it can't be used again. So, during the same-color pairing phase, for each color c, we process all possible left and right boots of color c that haven't been used yet.\n\nBut the problem with the above approach is that for a color c, the left_list and right_list may contain indices that are already used. So, for example, if during the processing of color 'a', we pair some left and right boots. Then, during the processing of color 'b', the left_list for 'b' may include indices that were already used in color 'a' pairing. So, in this case, the code would check if they are not used, and skip them.\n\nBut how to collect left_list and right_list for each color. Because in the initial setup, left_color_map contains all the indices for each color. However, during the same-color pairing phase, some of these indices may have already been used. Therefore, the code would need to check for each index in the list whether it's used or not.\n\nBut this approach would be O(n * 26) in the worst case, which for n=1.5e5 is 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for each color c, we have to process all the left and right indices, and for each, check if they are not used. But that would be O(n) per color, which for 26 colors is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to process each color once, and for each, pair as many as possible between left and right of that color, using the indices that are not yet used.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor each color c from 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices with color c that are not used yet.\n\n   collect all right indices with color c that are not used yet.\n\n   pair them in some order (like first left with first right, etc.)\n\nBut how to collect these lists quickly. For example, for each color, during the same-color pairing phase, we can iterate through the entire list of left boots with that color, and check if they are not used. Similarly for the right.\n\nThis would be O(n) for each color, but with 26 colors, it's O(26n) = O(n) time.\n\nSo, for code:\n\nInitialize left_color_map as a dictionary for each color, storing all indices where the left boot has that color.\n\nSimilarly for right_color_map.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_available = [i for i in left_color_map[c] if not used_left[i]]\n\n   right_available = [j for j in right_color_map[c] if not used_right[j]]\n\n   k = min(len(left_available), len(right_available))\n\n   for i in range(k):\n\n       left_idx = left_available[i]\n\n       right_idx = right_available[i]\n\n       add the pair (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\n       mark used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this approach would generate for each color c, the list of available left and right boots, and pair them. However, this could be O(n) per color, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, this may be acceptable.\n\nBut for Python, list comprehensions are efficient. However, for each color, generating the list of available left and right indices may take O(n) time. But with 26 colors, it's O(26n) = acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nOnce that is done, the next step is to collect the remaining left and right boots with specific colors and question marks.\n\nOnce that is done, we can proceed to the next steps.\n\nSo, after that, collect the left_sp, right_sp, left_qm, right_qm.\n\nleft_sp is all left boots with color not '?', not used.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to pair left_sp with right_qm.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nleft_sp = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_qm = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?' and not used_right[j]]\n\nthen, for each i in 0 to min(len(left_sp), len(right_qm)) -1:\n\n   pair left_sp[i] with right_qm[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for right_sp and left_qm.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_qm and right_qm, pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut again, how to collect the remaining left_qm and right_qm.\n\nBut once again, for code:\n\nAfter the first phase, collect all left and right indices that are not used and have specific colors or question marks.\n\nBut for the code, after the first phase, we can collect:\n\nleft_sp = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_sp = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nleft_qm = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_qm = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, for the second phase:\n\nstep 1: pair left_sp with right_qm.\n\nTake the minimum of len(left_sp) and len(right_qm). For each pair, take left_sp[i] and right_qm[i], add to the answer, and mark them as used.\n\nstep 2: pair right_sp with left_qm.\n\nTake the minimum of len(right_sp) and len(left_qm). For each pair, take right_sp[i] and left_qm[i], add to the answer, and mark them as used.\n\nstep 3: pair the remaining left_qm and right_qm. Take the minimum of len(left_qm) and len(right_qm), and pair them.\n\nBut again, how to collect these lists.\n\nBut once we have the left_sp, right_sp, left_qm, right_qm, then during the steps, we can process them.\n\nBut during these steps, we need to mark the used_left and used_right arrays.\n\nBut the code for this would be:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_sp), len(right_qm))):\n\n    a = left_sp[i]\n\n    b = right_qm[i]\n\n    add (a+1, b+1)\n\n    used_left[a] = True\n\n    used_right[b] = True\n\nSimilarly for the next steps.\n\nBut how to get the updated left_sp and right_qm after this step. Because after this, the left_sp and right_qm may have some elements that are already used. Wait, but in the code above, the left_sp and right_qm are generated before this step. So during this step, when we pair them, we are using the original left_sp and right_qm lists. However, once we pair them, the used_left and used_right arrays are marked. So, in the next steps, when collecting the remaining left_qm and right_qm, they will not include those that were already paired here.\n\nBut perhaps the code should process the steps sequentially, and after each step, the used arrays are updated.\n\nBut for code, after collecting the left_sp, right_sp, left_qm, right_qm, we can process step 1 as follows:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_sp), len(right_qm))):\n\n   pair left_sp[i] with right_qm[i]\n\n   mark them as used.\n\nThen, collect new left_sp and right_qm (but perhaps it's not necessary, since the next steps will take into account the used arrays).\n\nBut in the code, after this step, the left_sp and right_qm lists are not modified. However, during the next steps, when we process the other parts, the used arrays are already marked. So, for example, during step 2, when we collect the right_sp and left_qm, the used arrays are already updated.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left_qm and right_qm.\n\nWait, perhaps the code after the first phase is:\n\nleft_sp = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_sp = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nleft_qm = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_qm = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_sp), len(right_qm))\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n\n   a = left_sp[i]\n\n   b = right_qm[i]\n\n   add (a+1, b+1) to the answer list.\n\n   used_left[a] = True\n\n   used_right[b] = True\n\nThen, for step 2:\n\nnew_left_sp = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]  # but this is redundant, since left_sp was already collected. However, after the step 1, some elements in left_sp may have been marked as used. So, perhaps the code should re-collect the lists again.\n\nBut this seems inefficient. However, considering that this is O(n) per step, and there are only a few steps, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during step 1, we can process the left_sp and right_qm lists, and after that, collect new lists for step 2.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's better to collect the lists again for each step.\n\nBut that would be O(n) for each step. However, for the code, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps during step 1, we can process the left_sp and right_qm lists, and then for step 2, collect new lists for right_sp and left_qm.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nAfter the first phase, collect the four lists (left_sp, right_sp, left_qm, right_qm).\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\npair as many as possible between left_sp and right_qm.\n\nOnce that is done, we need to collect new left_sp and right_sp (but since the left_sp is already processed, but after pairing, some elements in left_sp are now used. So, perhaps for the next steps, we need to re-collect the lists.\n\nBut this seems tedious. However, perhaps in practice, during step 1, we can process the left_sp and right_qm lists, and for each pair, mark them as used. Then, for step 2, collect the new right_sp and left_qm.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the first phase, after pairing, the used arrays are updated, and during the second phase, the code can collect the current state of the used arrays.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nAfter the first phase, the code proceeds to:\n\nCollect all left and right boots not used, and process them in the following steps.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's easier to collect the lists again for each step.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's better to proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the first phase is done, the code proceeds to:\n\nCollect all left and right boots not used yet.\n\nThen, for the second phase:\n\nWe can create two queues: left_sp_queue and right_sp_queue, which contain the indices of left and right boots with specific colors not used yet.\n\nSimilarly, left_qm_queue and right_qm_queue.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to collect the lists once and then process them.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the code can proceed with the following steps:\n\nOnce the first phase is done, collect the four lists (left_sp, right_sp, left_qm, right_qm) as described.\n\nThen, for step 1, pair left_sp with right_qm. For this, the code can iterate through the first min(len(left_sp), len(right_qm)) elements of left_sp and right_qm, and pair them. Then, mark them as used.\n\nThen, for step 2, collect new right_sp and left_qm lists (which are the ones not used yet), and pair them.\n\nBut how to collect them again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nAfter step 1, the code can collect the new left_sp and right_sp (but since they were already processed, perhaps not). But perhaps the code can collect the new left_sp and right_sp again.\n\nBut perhaps for code efficiency, it's better to collect the lists once and then process them.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCollect all left and right not used yet, and then process them as follows:\n\nFor step 1, pair left_sp with right_qm:\n\nfor i in range(len(left_sp)):\n\n   if i < len(right_qm):\n\n       pair left_sp[i] with right_qm[i]\n\n       mark as used.\n\nBut then, after that, the code can collect the remaining left_sp and right_qm.\n\nBut again, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can process the step 1 by iterating through all left_sp and right_qm, and pair them in a way that uses as many as possible.\n\nBut in code, perhaps the code can do:\n\nfor i in range(len(left_sp)):\n\n   if not used_left[left_sp[i]] and not used_right[right_qm[i]]:\n\n       pair them and mark as used.\n\nBut this is not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, since the left_sp and right_qm are lists of indices that are not used yet, we can safely pair them in order.\n\nBecause during the collection of left_sp and right_qm, they are lists of indices that are not used yet. So, during step 1, for each pair (left_sp[i], right_qm[i]), we can safely pair them and mark them as used.\n\nBut once that is done, the next steps can proceed.\n\nBut after that, when we collect the left_sp again, those indices that were paired in step 1 are already marked as used.\n\nSo, for step 2, collect new lists:\n\nleft_sp_new = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_sp_new = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nleft_qm_new = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_qm_new = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nBut this would be O(n) for each collection.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the first phase is done, collect the four lists.\n\nThen:\n\n# Step 1: Pair left_sp with right_qm.\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_sp), len(right_qm))):\n\n    a = left_sp[i]\n\n    b = right_qm[i]\n\n    add (a+1, b+1) to the answer.\n\n    used_left[a] = True\n\n    used_right[b] = True\n\n# Now, collect new lists for step 2.\n\nleft_sp = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_sp = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nleft_qm = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_qm = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\n# Step 2: Pair right_sp with left_qm.\n\nfor i in range(min(len(right_sp), len(left_qm))):\n\n    a = right_sp[i]\n\n    b = left_qm[i]\n\n    add (b+1, a+1) to the answer.\n\n    used_left[b] = True\n\n    used_right[a] = True\n\n# Now, collect new lists for step 3.\n\nleft_qm = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_qm = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\n# Step 3: Pair remaining left_qm and right_qm.\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_qm), len(right_qm))):\n\n    a = left_qm[i]\n\n    b = right_qm[i]\n\n    add (a+1, b+1) to the answer.\n\n    used_left[a] = True\n\n    used_right[b] = True\n\nBut this approach would work, but the code would have to collect the lists multiple times, which could be O(n) for each step.\n\nBut for the code, this seems manageable.\n\nNow, the problem is how to collect the initial left_color_map and right_color_map.\n\nIn Python, for the initial processing, perhaps we can do:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn = int(input())\n\nl = input().strip()\n\nr = input().strip()\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n\n    if r[i] != '?':\n\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\nBut wait, perhaps the code can iterate through all possible colors (a-z) and check if they are present in both left and right color maps.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nused_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\nans = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    if c not in left_color_map or c not in right_color_map:\n\n        continue\n\n    left_list = left_color_map[c]\n\n    right_list = right_color_map[c]\n\n    # Now, collect the available indices not yet used.\n\n    # But how? Because left_list may contain indices that are already used.\n\n    # So, for each index in left_list, check if it's not used.\n\n    # Similarly for right_list.\n\n    # So, create new lists:\n\n    available_left = []\n\n    for idx in left_list:\n\n        if not used_left[idx]:\n\n            available_left.append(idx)\n\n    available_right = []\n\n    for idx in right_list:\n\n        if not used_right[idx]:\n\n            available_right.append(idx)\n\n    k = min(len(available_left), len(available_right))\n\n    for i in range(k):\n\n        a = available_left[i]\n\n        b = available_right[i]\n\n        ans.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n        used_left[a] = True\n\n        used_right[b] = True\n\nBut this code would process each color c, and pair as many as possible between left and right of that color, but only for those that are not yet used.\n\nBut this is O(n) for each color, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for colors that are not present in left or right, we skip.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to the second phase.\n\nNow, collect the four lists:\n\nleft_sp = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_sp = [i for i in range(n) if",

The compatibility is determined by specific colors or the wildcard character '?', which can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Pairing by Specific Colors**: First, we pair left boots with right boots that have the same specific color. This is done by iterating through each possible color (from 'a' to 'z') and pairing available left and right boots of that color.\n2. **Handling Wildcards**: After pairing by specific colors, we handle the remaining boots that either have specific colors or are wildcards ('?').
