Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo, what's allowed? Swapping 0 and 1 if they are adjacent. Also swapping 1 and 2 if adjacent. So, for example, 0s can move past 1s, but not past 2s. Similarly, 2s can move past 1s but not past 0s. Wait, no. Because if you can swap 0 and 1, then maybe 0s can move through 1s. Like, if there's a sequence of 0s and 1s, you can rearrange them in any order? Because you can swap adjacent 0 and 1. But for example, if you have a 0 followed by a 1, you can swap them. So, for example, 01 can become 10. Then, if you have multiple 0s and 1s, you can arrange them in any order, right? Because you can bubble the 0s to the left or right as needed. But wait, maybe not. Let me think: suppose you have 010. How can you arrange them? Well, the first two characters are 0 and 1. You can swap them to get 100. Then, the next two are 0 and 0, which can't be swapped. So the 0s can be moved past 1s, but the 1s can't be moved past 0s unless you have a way. Wait, no. Because the swaps are allowed between 0 and 1. So, for example, if you have a sequence of 0s and 1s, you can arrange them in any order. Because you can swap adjacent 0 and 1. So for example, if you have 0s and 1s, you can arrange all 0s first, then 1s. Or vice versa. Because you can swap them as needed.\n\nBut what about 2s? Since 2s can only be swapped with 1s. So 2s can move through 1s. But not through 0s. So for example, a 2 can move past 1s, but not past 0s. So the 0s are fixed relative to each other? Or not?\n\nWait, let's think about the overall structure. The key here is that the allowed swaps allow us to arrange the 0s and 1s in any order (since we can swap 0 and 1), and the 1s and 2s can be arranged in any order. However, 0s and 2s cannot be swapped. Therefore, the relative positions of 0s and 2s cannot be changed. Because you can't swap them. So, for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. So the original order of 0s and 2s must remain the same. But the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Let me think again. Suppose the original string has a 0 followed by a 2. Since we can't swap them, their relative positions are fixed. So in the final string, all 0s must appear before the 2s that were originally before them, and after the 2s that were originally after them. But what about the 1s? The 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. Because 1 can swap with 0 and with 2. So, for example, a 1 can move past a 0 (by swapping with it), and also past a 2. So, the 1s can be rearranged freely between the 0s and 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't be swapped. So the order of 0s and 2s is fixed, but the 1s can be placed anywhere in between.\n\nSo the problem reduces to grouping the 0s and 2s in their original order, and placing the 1s in between them in such a way that the lex order is minimized.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Let's take an example. Suppose the original string is \"02\". We can't swap them, so the minimum is \"02\".\n\nAnother example: \"20\" can't be swapped, so the minimum is \"20\".\n\nIf the original string is \"102\", then the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. But the 1 can be moved. So the original string is 1, 0, 2. The",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed adjacent swaps on a ternary string consisting of characters '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Swaps**: \n   - '0' and '1' can be swapped.\n   - '1' and '2' can be swapped.\n   - '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The relative positions of '0's and '2's cannot be changed because they cannot be swapped directly.\n   - However, '1's can be freely moved past both '0's and '2's.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Maintain the relative order of '0's and '2's as in the original string.\n   - Insert all '1's in between the '0's and '2's in such a way that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Traverse the original string to collect all '0's and '2's in their original order.\n   - Collect all '1's separately.\n   - Insert the '1's into the positions between '0's and '2's in a way that maintains the minimum lexicographical order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    zeros = []\n    twos = []\n    ones = []\n    \n    # Split the string into parts\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append(char)\n        elif char == '2':\n            twos.append(char)\n        else:\n            ones.append(char)\n    \n    # The result will be constructed by combining zeros, ones, and twos\n    # But we need to insert the ones between zeros and twos optimally\n    \n    # Since we can arrange the ones freely between the zeros and twos\n    # We can place all ones at the beginning, but considering the positions\n    # However, the correct approach is to interleave them optimally.\n    # Wait, the correct approach is to place all ones between the zeros and twos in a way that allows minimal lex order.\n    # However, since the zeros and twos are fixed in their relative order, we can insert the ones in between them.\n    # For example, if the original order is [0, 2], then the ones can be placed between them.\n    # So, the minimal string would be 0 followed by all ones followed by 2.\n    \n    # So, the minimal string is formed by:\n    # zeros + ones + twos?
