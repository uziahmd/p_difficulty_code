Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that we have an undirected graph with given flows on each edge, and we need to assign directions to these edges such that the flow is a valid maximum flow. Additionally, the directed graph must be acyclic, the source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges, and all other vertices except the sink (vertex n) have equal in-flow and out-flow.\n\nHmm. So the key points are:\n\n1. The flow must satisfy conservation of flow for all intermediate nodes.\n2. The source has no incoming edges, so all edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The directed graph must be acyclic. So there's no cycles in the directed version of the graph.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, since the flow is already given (the ci values), the main task is to assign directions to the edges such that the flow conservation holds. But also ensuring the graph is acyclic.\n\nWait, but how does the acyclic condition come into play here? Because if the directed graph has a cycle, then that would imply that there's a loop where flow can circulate, but in a maximum flow scenario, such cycles shouldn't exist. However, the problem requires that the directed graph after assigning directions has no cycles. So the direction assignment must result in a DAG.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nAn idea: maybe we can arrange the edges in a way that forms a DAG, perhaps by topologically ordering the nodes. For example, if we can assign directions such that all edges go from earlier nodes in a topological order to later ones. Then the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order that also satisfies the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow conservation requires that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows entering equals the sum leaving. So for each node v (not source or sink), the total flow through its edges must be even? Wait, no. Because the sum of incoming equals sum of outgoing. So the total flow (sum of all edges connected to the node) must be even? Because sum_in = sum_out, so total_flow = 2*sum_in. Therefore, each node (except source and sink) must have even total flow. But the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists, so we don't have to check that.\n\nSo the first thing is to model the flow as a directed graph where the flow conservation holds. But how to assign directions?\n\nAnother thought: since the flow is a maximum flow, the residual graph must not have augmenting paths. But I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nWait, the problem states that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. So the flow is already fixed. Our job is to assign directions to the edges such that the flow is valid and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nLet me think of the flow as a directed graph. Each edge has a certain flow. For the direction, we need to decide which way the flow goes. For example, if an edge between u and v has flow c, then in the directed graph, either u→v with flow c (so the flow is from u to v), or v→u with flow c. But the sum of flows into each node (except source and sink) must balance.\n\nSo perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow is conserved. But how to assign directions?\n\nThis seems similar to finding an Euler tour or something else. But perhaps another approach is to model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has in-degree equal to out-degree (but considering the flow values, not the number of edges). Wait, no. The flow conservation is that the sum of flows into the node equals the sum of flows out. So for each node v (not source or sink), sum_{edges entering} ci = sum_{edges leaving} ci. Which implies that the sum of all ci for edges incident to v must be even. But the problem says the input is valid, so that's already ensured.\n\nSo how to assign directions? Maybe we can model this as an Eulerian trail problem. Because for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows into and out of it must be equal. So for each such node, the total flow (sum of all incident edges' ci) must be even, which is already given.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges so that for each node, the sum of flows entering equals the sum of flows leaving.\n\nWait, think of each edge as contributing to the net flow of the nodes. For example, if an edge between u and v is directed u→v, then the net flow for u increases by c (as it's outgoing), and for v decreases by c (as it's incoming). Wait, no. The net flow for a node is (out",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies the following conditions:\n1. The flow conservation property holds for all intermediate vertices (i.e., the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows).\n2. The source vertex (vertex 1) has no incoming edges.\n3. The directed graph is acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Flow Conservation**: For each intermediate vertex (not the source or sink), the sum of flows entering must equal the sum of flows leaving. This can be modeled using a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the net flow at each intermediate vertex is zero.\n2. **Acyclic Graph**: To ensure the directed graph is acyclic, we can use a topological sorting approach. We start from the source and process vertices in such a way that edges are directed away from earlier processed vertices, ensuring no cycles are formed.\n3. **Eulerian Trail Insight**: By treating the flow values as weights, we can use an Eulerian trail approach to determine directions. For each node, we maintain a balance of flow and direct edges accordingly to maintain this balance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((a, b, c, i))\n        graph[a].append((b, c, i))\n        graph[b].append((a, c, i))\n\n    # Compute the total flow for each node\n    flow = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for a, b, c, _ in edges:\n        flow[a] += c\n        flow[b] += c\n\n    # The source (1) should have all edges directed away from it\n    # The sink (n) can have any direction, but we need to make sure the graph is acyclic\n    # We will build a directed graph with topological order\n\n    # We'll use a topological sort approach, starting from the source\n    # We need to assign directions such that the graph is acyclic\n    # We can model this as a directed graph where we greedily assign directions based on the flow balance\n\n    # We'll use a modified BFS to assign directions\n    # We'll track for each node the remaining outflow\n    # Initially, for the source, all edges are outgoing\n    # For other nodes, we'll process them in a topological order\n\n    # First, build a directed graph with possible directions\n    # We'll use a priority queue to process nodes with zero \"in-flow\" balance\n    # Wait, perhaps we can use a DFS-based approach to assign directions\n\n    # Let's think differently: for each node, we can track the current net flow (out - in)\n    # For the source, all edges are directed away from it\n    # For other nodes, we can process them in a topological order, directing edges to maintain flow conservation\n\n    # Build a structure to represent the graph and track which edges are processed\n    # We'll use a queue for topological processing\n    # We need to find a topological order starting from the source\n\n    # Initialize the in-degree for each node\n    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    # Build the adjacency list for the directed graph\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    edge_direction = [0] * m  # 0 means original direction (ai -> bi), 1 means reversed\n\n    # We'll first direct all edges from the source\n    # But how?
