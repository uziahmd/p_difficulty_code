A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend, considering all the constraints.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires per friend: nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all friends have to have their own portions. So for each toast, the total drink needed is n * nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the total available drink: k * l ml.\n   The maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Because each toast requires n * nl ml in total.\n\n2. Calculate the total available lime slices: c * d.\n   Each toast requires n slices, so maximum toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\n3. Calculate the total available salt: p grams.\n   Each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values. Because all three constraints must be satisfied.\n\nSo the final answer is min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt).\n\nLet me test this logic against the first example.\n\nFirst example input:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nTotal drink: 4*5=20. Each toast needs 3*3=9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222, floor is 2. So toast_drink is 2.\n\nLimes: 10 *8 =80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 /3 is 26.666, floor 26. Wait wait, but the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, no. Wait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait in the note, they say that the limes are enough for 10 *8 =80 toasts. But according to my calculation, each toast requires n slices. So for each toast, 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 /3 = 26.666, which is 26. But the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3? Wait no, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3? Wait no, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) equals 6, then divided by 3 gives 2. Wait why is that?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait why? Because each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend? Wait no, the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends has nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl ml. So for the first example, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 *3 =9 ml. Total drink is 20 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222, so floor 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait wait the note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts\". Oh wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl ml. So for the first example, 3 friends, each needs 3 ml per toast. So per toast, 3 *3 =9 ml. Total drink is 4*5=20. 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2",
