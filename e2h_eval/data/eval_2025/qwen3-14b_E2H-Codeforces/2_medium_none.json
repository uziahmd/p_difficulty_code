Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X or not. Let me think about the conditions.\n\nThe problem says that the paper forms an X if two conditions are met. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, different from the diagonals.\n\nSo, let's break it down. For a square of size n x n, where n is odd.\n\nFirst, check the diagonals. The main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All the cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping cells? Like, in the case of odd n, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So, for example, when n=3, the center cell (1,1) is on both diagonals. So, all the cells on both diagonals must be the same. So, the first step is to check that all cells on the two diagonals are the same. Then check that all other cells are the same and different.\n\nSo, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check that they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonals?\n\nFor each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell in the grid, check if it's on either of these two diagonals.\n\nSo, first, iterate through all cells. For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal. If yes, collect the character. Then, check that all those characters are the same. Let's call this diagonal_char.\n\nThen, collect all the other characters (non-diagonal cells) and check that they are all the same and not equal to diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about steps:\n\n1. Read the input. The first line is n, then n lines of strings.\n\n2. For each of the n lines, process each character.\n\n3. Collect all diagonal characters and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut maybe I can do this with two sets. Wait, but for the diagonals, all characters must be the same. So, for the diagonal characters, check that all are equal to the first diagonal character. Similarly for the non-diagonal.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize diagonal_char as the character at (0,0). Then check that every cell on the diagonals has this same character.\n\nSimilarly, for the non-diagonal cells, collect their characters, check that all are same and different from diagonal_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, since n is at least 3, for n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the center. So total diagonal cells is 2n - 1. For n=3, 5 cells. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n- Check that all diagonal cells have the same character.\n\n- Check that all non-diagonal cells have the same character, and that it's different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to check for the non-diagonal cells?\n\nSo, first, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's a diagonal cell.\n\nElse: non-diagonal.\n\nSo, for the first part, collect all diagonal characters. Let's collect them in a set. If the length of the set is 1, then all are same. Otherwise, no.\n\nWait, but for the first part, the diagonals must have the same character. So, for all cells on the diagonals, their characters must be same.\n\nSo, for example, take the first diagonal cell (0,0), get its character. Then check that all other diagonal cells have the same.\n\nSimilarly for the non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut perhaps, for the diagonals, collect all their characters into a set. If the size is 1, then okay. Same for non-diagonal.\n\nBut then, also check that the two sets are different.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nCollect all diagonal characters into a set D. Collect all non-diagonal into a set N.\n\nIf len(D) == 1 and len(N) == 1 and D != N, then output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst example:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLet me see. The diagonals are positions where i == j or i + j = 4 (since n=5, 0-based). For example, first row: x o o o x. The first and last characters are on the diagonals. Second row: o x o x o. The first and last are on diagonals. Third row: s o x o o. The third cell (i=2, j=2) is on the diagonal. So the diagonals would be:\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\nFor i from 0 to 4:\n\ni=0: j=0 and j=4 (since 0+4=4). So x and x.\n\ni=1: j=1 and j=3. o and o.\n\ni=2: j=2. x.\n\ni=3: j=1 and j=3. o and o.\n\ni=4: j=0 and j=4. x and x.\n\nSo all the diagonal characters are x, o, x, o, x, o, x, o, x? Wait, maybe I need to count all the cells on the diagonals. For n=5, the number of diagonal cells is 2n - 1 = 9. So in the first example, the diagonals are:\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\n(0,0) x\n\n(0,4) x\n\n(1,1) o\n\n(1,3) o\n\n(2,2) x\n\n(3,1) o\n\n(3,3) o\n\n(4,0) x\n\n(4,4) x\n\nSo the diagonal characters are x, x, o, o, x, o, o, x, x. So the set D would be {x, o}? So len(D) is 2. Which is more than 1. Hence, the first sample input returns NO. Which matches the first output.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, for the second sample input:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are (i==j or i +j = 2).\n\nFor (0,0): w, (0,2): w.\n\n(1,1): w.\n\n(2,0): w, (2,2): w.\n\nSo all diagonals are w. So D is {w}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1): s\n\n(1,0): s\n\n(1,2): s\n\n(2,1): s\n\nSo N is {s}. So D and N are different. So output is YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\n(0,0): x, (0,2): x.\n\n(1,1): x.\n\n(2,0): x, (2,2): e.\n\nSo the diagonals have x, x, x, x, e. So D is {x, e}, len is 2. So output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate through each cell.\n\n- Separate into diagonals and non-diagonals.\n\n- Check that diagonals have all same character.\n\n- Check that non-diagonals have all same character.\n\n- Check that the two characters are different.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nIn code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. Let's store as a grid, maybe a list of lists.\n\nThen, collect diagonal_chars and non_diagonal_chars.\n\nFor each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   for each j in 0 to n-1:\n\n      if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n          add to diagonal_chars\n\n      else:\n\n          add to non_diagonal_chars\n\nThen, check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) == 1 and len(set(non_diagonal_chars)) == 1 and diagonal_chars[0] != non_diagonal_chars[0]\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non_diagonal_chars? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut for example, when n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 2*3 - 1 = 5. Total cells 9. Non-diagonal is 4.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nBut in Python, for the case when there are no non-diagonal cells (but n is 1?), but since n is >=3, this is not possible. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut need to check that the non_diagonal_chars is not empty. Wait, but for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So for any n >=3, the non-diagonal cells exist. So, in code, we can proceed.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line as a string. Let's say grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\ndiagonal = []\nnon_diagonal = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal)) == 1 and len(set(non_diagonal)) == 1 and diagonal[0] != non_diagonal[0]:\n\nthen print YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n=3, it's not. So for n >=3, the non_diagonal is not empty.\n\nBut for example, n=3, the diagonals have 5 elements, and non-diagonal has 4. So, in code, the non_diagonal list is not empty.\n\nBut what if all the non_diagonal elements are same? For example, if the grid is all same letters except for the diagonals. But the code checks that.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut in code, if n is 3, then for example, the non_diagonal list will have 4 elements. So, in code, the len(set(...)) will be checked.\n\nBut what if all the non_diagonal elements are same? For example, in the second sample input, the non_diagonal elements are all 's'.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle it.\n\nBut what about when the non_diagonal is empty? Well, no, because for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut let's think about n=3, and all cells are on diagonals. But that's impossible. Because for n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells, and the total is 9. So 9-5=4 non-diagonal.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nBut what about when the non_diagonal list is empty? Well, no. So the code can proceed.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = []\nnon_diagonal = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal)) == 1 and len(set(non_diagonal)) == 1 and diagonal[0] != non_diagonal[0]:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n=3, it's not. So the code is okay.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal is not empty, but the set has more than one element? Then the code returns NO.\n\nBut let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=5, the grid is:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe diagonal characters would be:\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: x (diagonal)\n\ni=0, j=4: x (diagonal)\n\ni=1, j=1: o (diagonal)\n\ni=1, j=3: o (diagonal)\n\ni=2, j=2: x (diagonal)\n\ni=3, j=1: o (diagonal)\n\ni=3, j=3: o (diagonal)\n\ni=4, j=0: x (diagonal)\n\ni=4, j=4: x (diagonal)\n\nSo the diagonal list is [x, x, o, o, x, o, o, x, x]. The set is {x, o} → len is 2. So the code returns NO. Which is correct.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ni=0, j=0: w; i=0,j=2: w.\n\ni=1, j=1: w.\n\ni=2, j=0: w; i=2,j=2: w.\n\nSo diagonal list is [w, w, w, w, w]. Set is {w}.\n\nnon_diagonal is:\n\ncells (0,1): s; (1,0): s; (1,2): s; (2,1): s. So set {s}.\n\nSo the code returns YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiagonal cells:\n\n(0,0): x; (0,2): x.\n\n(1,1): x.\n\n(2,0): x; (2,2): e.\n\nSo diagonal list is [x, x, x, x, e]. set is {x, e} → len 2. So code returns NO.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nBut what about cases where the diagonals are same, but non-diagonal is same as diagonals?\n\nLike, for example, n=3, all cells are 'x'. Then the diagonals are x, and non-diagonal is x. So the code would check that the two sets are same. So the condition is that the non-diagonal is different. So code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'x', non-diagonal is 'y'. Then code returns YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'x' and 'x', but non-diagonal has some 'x's and some 'y's. Then code returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut what about when the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n=3, it's not. So code is okay.\n\nNow, what about when the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n=1, which is not allowed. So code is okay.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as the first line being n, then n lines of letters.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings, like ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...], but in actual code, the input is read via standard input.\n\nBut in the code, the code reads n, then reads n lines. So the code should be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being the row.\n\nBut in Python, when reading from stdin, for example, if the input is given as:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the code would read n as 5, then read the next 5 lines.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, as per the problem statement. Each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the input lines are exactly n characters long. So using strip() may be a problem if there are leading or trailing spaces. But according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters, so perhaps it's better to read each line as is. However, in practice, when reading via input(), the trailing newline is stripped. But for example, if the input line is 'xooox', then input().strip() would be same as the original. But perhaps, in some cases, there could be leading or trailing whitespace? But the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters. So perhaps, we can read each line as input().strip()? Or perhaps just read the line as input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps, the code should read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut for example, if a line is entered with leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each line has exactly n letters. So perhaps the code can read each line as input().strip(), but maybe not. For example, if a line is 'xooox\\n' (with a newline), then input().strip() would remove the newline. But the problem says that each line has exactly n letters. So the code can read each line as input().strip().\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to read each line as input().strip().\n\nSo the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut in the sample input, for example, the first input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich would be read correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings, but in actual code, the input is read as per standard input.\n\nNow, the code is written as:\n\nRead n, then read n lines.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n\nBut what about the case where the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n=3, it's not.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = []\nnon_diagonal = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal)) == 1 and len(set(non_diagonal)) == 1 and diagonal[0] != non_diagonal[0]:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the diagonal is empty? No, because for n >=3, the diagonals have 2n-1 elements. For n=3, 5 elements.\n\nBut in code, the diagonal list is built correctly.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n=3, it's not.\n\nBut in code, when the non_diagonal is empty, then len(set(non_diagonal)) is 0. But in that case, the code would check len(set(...)) == 1, which is false. So the code returns NO. Which is correct.\n\nBut for n=3, the non_diagonal is not empty.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut let's think about another test case.\n\nTest case:\n\nn=3\n\nall cells are 'a' except for the diagonals which are 'b'.\n\nSo the diagonals are 'b's. The non-diagonal cells are 'a's. So the code returns YES.\n\nAnother test case where the diagonals are 'a's, but non-diagonal cells have two different letters. Then code returns NO.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So code is safe.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, diagonals are all same, non-diagonal has all same but same as diagonals. Then code returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are all 'a', non-diagonal has all 'a's. Then code returns NO.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n",
