Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check if all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this diagonal_char.\n2. Check if all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same and not equal to diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, let's collect all the diagonal cells. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, check if it's on either diagonal. For a cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if either of those conditions is true, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo for all cells in the grid, we can check if they are on a diagonal. Then collect all the characters in the diagonals and check if they are all the same.\n\nThen, collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal character.\n\nBut wait: what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For example, n=3: the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping at the center. So total diagonal cells are 2*3 -1 =5. The total cells are 9, so non-diagonal is 4. So yes, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- Collect all diagonal characters. Check that they are all the same. Let's say the diagonal_char is the first diagonal character. Then check all others in diagonals are same as that.\n\n- Collect all non-diagonal characters. Check they are all same and not equal to diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n. So grid is a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1, and the two sets are different.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because the non_diagonal_chars could be empty? No, because n is at least 3. For example, when n=3, there are 3*3 - 5 = 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut for the case where the non-diagonal cells are all same, but maybe the diagonal has more than one character. But the code would check that.\n\nWait, the code above would collect all the diagonal characters into diagonal_chars. If all are same, then len(diagonal_chars) is 1. Similarly for non_diagonal_chars.\n\nSo the conditions would be:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, n is odd. For n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 9 - 5 =4. So no, non_diagonal_chars can't be empty.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLet me check the diagonals. The main diagonal is (0,0) x, (1,1) o, (2,2) x, (3,3) o, (4,4) x. So the diagonal characters are x, o, x, o, x. So the set would have {x, o} → len is 2. So the code would return NO, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w.\n\n(1,1) s.\n\n(2,0) w, (2,2) w.\n\nSo the diagonals are positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). The characters are w, w, s, w, w. So the diagonal_chars set is {w, s} → len is 2. Wait, but according to the sample output, this is supposed to be YES. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait sample input 2 is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w.\n\nOther diagonal: (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w.\n\nSo all diagonals are w. So diagonal_chars is {w}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1): s\n\n(1,0): s\n\n(1,2): s\n\n(2,1): s.\n\nSo non_diagonal_chars is {s}.\n\nSo the condition is met. So the code would return YES.\n\nAh, I see. My earlier analysis was wrong. Because for the diagonals, the code checks for i == j or i +j == n-1. For n=3, i +j = 2.\n\nFor (0,0): i+j=0, which is not 2. So no. Wait, no. Wait, for n=3, the other diagonal is from (0, 2) to (2, 0). So for i + j = 2 (since n-1 is 2). So for (0,2) → 0+2=2. (1,1) → 1+1=2. (2,0) → 2+0=2. So yes. So the diagonals are (i==j) or (i +j == n-1). So in the sample input 2, the diagonals are all w. So the code would collect diagonal_chars as {w}, and non_diagonal_chars as {s}, which are different. So the code would return YES.\n\nSo why did my previous analysis get the diagonal_chars as {w, s}? Because I made a mistake in checking the cells. So the code seems correct.\n\nSo the code approach is:\n\nCheck that all diagonal cells have same character, and all non-diagonal have same character, and the two are different.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nIn code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut in code, for each cell (i,j):\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal) == 1 and len(non_diagonal) == 1 and diagonal != non_diagonal.\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal is empty? For n=1? But n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So code is okay.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nBut what about the case where the non-diagonal is empty? Well, since n is at least 3, and for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 4. So no.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, comparing sets with != is possible. But what if the diagonal has one element and non_diagonal has another. For example, diagonal is {'a'}, non_diagonal is {'b'}, then they are different. So the code would return YES.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, no, as discussed.\n\nBut let's test some cases.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: yes (i=j). Also, i +j =0, which is not 4 (n-1 is 4 for n=5). So only i=j.\n\nSo for (0,0) → x.\n\n(0,1): no. So non-diagonal.\n\n(0,2): no. non-diagonal.\n\n(0,3): no. non-diagonal.\n\n(0,4): i +j =0+4=4 → yes. So diagonal.\n\nSo for row 0, the first and last are diagonal.\n\nSimilarly for row 1:\n\ni=1, j=0: i +j =1+0=1 !=4. j=1: i=j → yes. So (1,1) is diagonal. j=2: i +j=3 !=4. etc.\n\nSo for the diagonals, the code collects all the characters.\n\nIn the first sample input, the diagonals have x, o, x, o, x (from the main diagonal and other diagonal). So the diagonal_chars would be {x, o} → len is 2. So the code returns NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe diagonals are all w. So diagonal_chars is {'w'}, non_diagonal is {'s'}, so returns YES.\n\nSample input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nLet me check:\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0 → yes. i=0, j=2 → yes (0+2=2, n-1=2).\n\ni=1, j=1 → yes.\n\ni=2, j=0 → yes (2+0=2). j=2 → 2+2=4 != 2. So for row 2, j=0 is diagonal, j=2 is not.\n\nSo the diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e?\n\nWait, (2,2) is i=2, j=2. i ==j → yes. So (2,2) is part of the diagonal. So for row 2, j=2 is part of the diagonal.\n\nSo for row 2, j=0 (i=2, j=0) → i +j = 2+0=2 (n-1=2 for n=3). So yes. So (2,0) is part of the diagonal. (2,2) is part of the main diagonal.\n\nSo the diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2. So the code returns NO, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nBut what about when the non-diagonal cells have more than one character?\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nThe diagonals are all a. The non-diagonal cells are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) b, (2,1) a. So non_diagonal_chars is {a, b} → len 2. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\nbaa\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) a, (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal_chars is {a}. Non-diagonal cells are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) a. So non_diagonal_chars is {a, b} → len 2. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same but same as diagonal. Like:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen, all cells are a. So diagonal_chars is {a}, non_diagonal is {a}. So the condition is that they are different. So code returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, how to read the input? The input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines of strings. But in the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nBut in actual input, the code needs to read from stdin. So for each test case, the code reads n, then n lines.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input is given as a list of inputs. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines.\n\nSo the code needs to read n, then read n lines.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, the first input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich would be read as n=5, then 5 lines.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut need to make sure that after reading n, the next n lines are read. However, sometimes when reading from stdin, there might be leading/trailing spaces, but the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the code can read each line, strip any whitespace (like newlines) and process.\n\nSo the code would proceed as follows.\n\nBut in some cases, when reading via input(), sometimes there are issues with trailing newlines, but using strip() would take care of that.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is stripped.\n\nThen process as before.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = set()\n\nnon_diagonal = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal) == 1 and len(non_diagonal) == 1 and diagonal != non_diagonal:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the diagonal is empty? Well, no. For n >=3, the diagonals have at least 2n-1 cells. For n=3, 5 cells. So the diagonal set can't be empty.\n\nBut for the code, the check is len(diagonal) ==1. So if all the diagonal cells are same, then yes.\n\nBut what if the diagonal has multiple characters? Then len(diagonal) >1, returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the non_diagonal is empty? Well, no. As discussed.\n\nBut let's think about n=3, and all cells are on diagonals. For example, n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells, and the non-diagonal has 4 cells. So no, non_diagonal can't be empty.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input 2:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid is:\n\n['wsw', 'sws', 'wsw']\n\nFor i=0, j=0: i==j → yes. grid[0][0] is 'w'.\n\ni=0, j=1: not on diagonals. So added to non_diagonal. grid[0][1] is 's'.\n\ni=0, j=2: i +j = 0+2=2 (n-1=2) → yes. grid[0][2] is 'w'.\n\ni=1, j=0: i +j =1+0=1 !=2. So no. j=1: i==j → yes. grid[1][1] is 'w'. j=2: i +j = 1+2=3 !=2. So no.\n\ni=2, j=0: i +j = 2+0=2 → yes. grid[2][0] is 'w'.\n\nj=1: i=2, j=1: i +j=3 !=2. So non-diagonal. grid[2][1] is 's'.\n\nj=2: i==j → yes. grid[2][2] is 'w'.\n\nSo diagonal has {w}.\n\nnon_diagonal has {s}.\n\nSo code returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nThe diagonals are all a. The non-diagonal cells are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) b, (2,1) a. So non_diagonal is {a, b} → len 2. So code returns NO.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWhat about when the non_diagonal is all same but same as diagonal?\n\nLike:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa.\n\nThen, diagonal is {a}, non_diagonal is {a}. So len is 1 and 1, but they are same. So code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbab\n\naba.\n\nDiagonals are (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) b, (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal_chars is {a, b} → len 2. So returns NO.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, when you read input with input(), sometimes there may be issues with leading/trailing whitespaces. However, the problem says that each of the next n lines contains exactly n letters, so using .strip() is safe. However, perhaps the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, but the problem says that each line contains n letters. So using .strip() would remove any leading/trailing whitespace, but perhaps it's better to read the line as is. However, for example, if the input line is 'xooox\\n', then .strip() would remove the newline, but the line is correct.\n\nBut perhaps using input().strip() is correct.\n\nBut in some cases, for example, if the line is 'xooox' (without any newline), but the input is properly formatted. So, in code, perhaps just using input().strip() is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be as written.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code will read n=5, then the 5 lines. The diagonals have x, o, x, o, x (from the main and other diagonals). So diagonal set is {x, o} → len 2. So returns NO.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw → returns YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe → returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then read n lines. Then check the diagonals and non-diagonals.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
