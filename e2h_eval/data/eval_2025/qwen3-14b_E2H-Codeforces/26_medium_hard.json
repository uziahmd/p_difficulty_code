    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triplets (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x ≤ y ≤ z, and x + y > z.\n\nWait, but the original condition says that x ≤ B, and y ≥ B. So x can be up to B, and y starts from B. Also, since B ≤ C, y is between B and C. And z is between C and D. Also, the order x ≤ y ≤ z is enforced by the ranges. Because x is up to B, y starts at B and goes up to C, and z starts at C. So for any x, y, z chosen in their ranges, x ≤ y ≤ z holds. Because x is up to B, y starts at B. So x can be less than or equal to y. For example, if x is B and y is B, then x equals y. And since z starts at C which is ≥ B, so y is ≤ C ≤ z. So the triplet x, y, z will satisfy x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to counting all possible (x, y, z) with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D], and x + y > z.\n\nSo the main challenge is to compute this efficiently given the constraints on the input (up to 5e5).\n\nLet me think about how to compute this.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z and check if x + y > z. However, with ranges up to 5e5, this would be O(B * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1)), which is way too slow for large values. For example, if B is 5e5, C is 5e5, D is 5e5, then the loops would be O( (5e5)^3 ), which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the variables. For each x and y, we can find the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. But since z must also be ≥ y (since y ≤ z), but wait, since z is in [C, D], and y is in [B, C], so z is ≥ C ≥ y. Therefore, for a given x and y, z must be between max(C, ... ) and min(D, x + y - 1). Wait, because z has to be >= C and <= D, and also z < x + y. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, D] and [C, x + y - 1]. So the lower bound is C, upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). But if x + y - 1 < C, then there are no such z's. So for each x and y, the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C else 0.\n\nBut then, the problem reduces to iterating over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and for each pair (x, y), compute the number of z's as described.\n\nBut even that approach would be O(B * (C - B + 1)) operations. Let's see: if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then C - B + 1 is 1. So for each x in 5e5 elements, and y in 1 element, total is 5e5 operations. But if B is 1 and C is 5e5, then it's 1 * 5e5 = 5e5 operations. Which is manageable. However, if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then the total is 5e5 * 1 = 5e5. So overall, the maximum possible number of iterations would be (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). Let's see: for A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, then it's 5e5 * 1 = 5e5. For A=1, B=2, C=5e5, then it's 2 * (5e5 - 2 + 1) = 2 * ~5e5 = 1e6. Which is acceptable. So this approach would be feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate over all x in [A, B]\n\n- For each x, iterate over all y in [B, C]\n\n- For each (x, y), compute the lower and upper bounds for z. Since z must be >= C and <= D, and also z < x + y.\n\n   The upper bound for z is min(D, x + y - 1). The lower bound is C. So the number of valid z's is max(0, upper_bound - C + 1) if upper_bound >= C else 0.\n\nBut then, how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nYes, but for each (x, y) pair, compute the number of z's as max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C else 0.\n\nBut wait, let me rephrase that:\n\nThe valid z's are those in [C, D] and also z < x + y.\n\nSo the valid range for z is [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nIf min(D, x + y - 1) < C, then there are no valid z's. Otherwise, the count is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nSo for each (x, y), we calculate this value and sum all of them.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut the problem is that for each x and y, the calculation is O(1), so the total time is O(B * (C - B + 1)).\n\nBut what's the maximum possible value of B * (C - B + 1)?\n\nSince B ≤ C, and A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D.\n\nLet me take an example where B is 5e5 and C is 5e5. Then (C - B + 1) is 1. So the product is 5e5 * 1 = 5e5.\n\nAnother example: when B is 1, C is 5e5. Then (C - B + 1) is 5e5. So the product is 1 * 5e5 = 5e5.\n\nAnother case: B is 2.5e5 and C is 5e5. Then (C - B + 1) is 2.5e5 + 1. So the product is 2.5e5 * 2.5e5 = 6.25e10. That's way too big. Wait, that's 62.5 billion operations. That's not feasible.\n\nOh no! This approach would not work for such cases. For example, if B is 2.5e5 and C is 5e5, then the total number of (x,y) pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). Assuming A is 1, then (B - A + 1) is 2.5e5. Multiply by (C - B + 1) which is 2.5e5 + 1. So the total is about 6e10 operations. Which is way too slow for Python. Even if each iteration is a single operation, that's impossible to process in the allowed time.\n\nTherefore, we need a more efficient approach.\n\nAlternative idea: find a way to compute for all possible x and y, the sum over z's, but using mathematical formulas instead of iterating through each x and y.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find for each possible x and y, the number of z's is as discussed, but find a way to compute the sum over x and y efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. Let me think of x and y. Since x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, so x ≤ y.\n\nSo for each x and y, the sum is the number of z's in [C, D] where z < x + y. Which is equivalent to z can be from C to min(D, x + y - 1). So the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C else 0.\n\nLet me denote S = x + y. Then the upper limit for z is min(D, S - 1). So the count is max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C else 0.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nif S - 1 < C → 0\n\nelse if D < S - 1 → D - C + 1\n\nelse → S - 1 - C + 1 = S - C.\n\nSo the count is:\n\ncount = 0 if S - 1 < C else (min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nif S <= C → 0\n\nelse:\n\n   if S - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\n   else → (S - 1 - C + 1) = S - C.\n\nSo the count is:\n\nmax(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1) where S = x + y.\n\nBut S is x + y. So for each (x, y) pair, S is x + y.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of:\n\nif x + y > C → then the number of z's is:\n\nif x + y - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → (x + y - 1) - C + 1 = x + y - C.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me split the problem into two parts:\n\nFor all x and y such that x + y > C:\n\nsum += (number of z's for that x and y)\n\nSo the first step is to find for which (x, y) pairs x + y > C. Because for those, we have some contribution.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum?\n\nLet me think of the sum as:\n\nTotal = sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C [ (if x + y > C then ...) else 0 ]\n\nLet me consider that for x and y, x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C.\n\nLet me think about for fixed x, how to compute the sum over y in [B, C] of the contribution.\n\nSo for a fixed x, let's find the range of y where x + y > C. Which is equivalent to y > C - x.\n\nBut since y is in [B, C], the condition becomes y > max( C - x, B - 1 ), but since y starts at B.\n\nWait, for a fixed x, the minimal y is B. So the condition x + y > C → y > C - x.\n\nSo for y to be in [B, C], and y > C - x.\n\nSo the valid y's are those in [y_min, C], where y_min is max(B, floor(C - x) + 1). Wait, because y must be integer. Let me think:\n\nWe have y > (C - x) → since y is integer, the minimal y is floor(C - x) + 1. But since y is an integer, the condition is y >= (C - x) + 1 ?\n\nYes. For example, if C - x is 3.2, then y must be at least 4. If C -x is 3, then y must be at least 4.\n\nBut since y is integer, the minimal y is (C - x) + 1, but only if that's <= C. Otherwise, there are no such y's.\n\nSo for each x, the valid y's are in the interval [y_low, C], where y_low is max(B, (C - x) + 1). But since y must be ≥ B and ≥ (C - x) + 1. So y_low = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nBut since y can't exceed C, the upper bound is C. So the number of valid y's for this x is:\n\nif y_low > C → 0.\n\nElse, the count is C - y_low + 1.\n\nBut for each such y, we have to compute the contribution to the total sum.\n\nBut the contribution depends on whether x + y - 1 is >= D or not.\n\nSo for each x and y in the valid range, the contribution is:\n\nif (x + y - 1) >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → (x + y - C)\n\nSo for a fixed x, the sum over y in [y_low, C] can be split into two parts:\n\nthose y where x + y - 1 >= D, and those where x + y - 1 < D.\n\nLet me think of for a fixed x, the threshold for y is when x + y - 1 >= D → y >= D - x + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the y's in [y_low, C] can be split into two intervals:\n\ny in [y_low, y_upper], where y_upper = min(C, D - x) → for these y's, x + y -1 < D → contribution is x + y - C.\n\nAnd y in [y_upper + 1, C] → contribution is D - C + 1.\n\nBut how to find y_upper?\n\nLet me define for a given x:\n\nthreshold_y = D - x + 1.\n\nBecause for y >= threshold_y, x + y - 1 >= D → x + y -1 >= D → y >= D - x + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the y's in [y_low, C] can be split into:\n\ny in [y_low, y_threshold - 1] → contribute (x + y - C)\n\nand y in [y_threshold, C] → contribute (D - C + 1)\n\nBut need to check if y_threshold is within [y_low, C].\n\nSo for each x, the steps are:\n\nCompute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\nif y_low > C → no contribution for this x.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute threshold_y = D - x + 1.\n\nThen, the y's in the valid range [y_low, C] can be divided into:\n\na) Those y where y < threshold_y → contribute (x + y - C)\n\nb) Those y where y >= threshold_y → contribute (D - C + 1)\n\nSo the total contribution for this x is:\n\nsum_a + sum_b.\n\nNow, how to compute sum_a and sum_b?\n\nLet me think about sum_a:\n\nsum_a is the sum over y in [y_low, y_upper_a] of (x + y - C), where y_upper_a is min(C, threshold_y - 1).\n\nSimilarly, sum_b is the number of y in [y_lower_b, C] multiplied by (D - C + 1), where y_lower_b is max(y_low, threshold_y).\n\nBut how to compute these ranges?\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFor a given x:\n\ny_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\nif y_low > C → skip.\n\nElse:\n\nthreshold_y = D - x + 1.\n\ny_upper_a = min(C, threshold_y - 1)\n\ny_lower_b = max(y_low, threshold_y)\n\nif y_upper_a < y_low → sum_a is zero.\n\nElse:\n\nsum_a = sum_{y = y_low}^{y_upper_a} (x + y - C) \n\nWhich can be rewritten as sum_{y} (x - C) + y → (x - C) * (number of terms) + sum_{y} y.\n\nSimilarly, sum_b is the number of terms in [y_lower_b, C] multiplied by (D - C + 1).\n\nSo for sum_a:\n\nnumber_of_terms_a = y_upper_a - y_low + 1.\n\nsum_of_y_a = (y_low + y_upper_a) * number_of_terms_a // 2.\n\nsum_a = (x - C) * number_of_terms_a + sum_of_y_a.\n\nFor sum_b:\n\nnumber_of_terms_b = max(0, C - y_lower_b + 1)\n\nsum_b = number_of_terms_b * (D - C + 1)\n\nSo adding sum_a and sum_b gives the contribution for this x.\n\nThis way, for each x, we can compute the contribution in O(1) time.\n\nSo the overall approach would be:\n\nLoop over x in [A, B], for each x:\n\ncompute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\nif y_low > C → continue\n\nelse:\n\ncompute threshold_y = D - x + 1\n\ncompute y_upper_a = min(C, threshold_y - 1)\n\nif y_upper_a < y_low → sum_a = 0\n\nelse:\n\ncompute sum_a as above\n\ncompute y_lower_b = max(y_low, threshold_y)\n\nif y_lower_b > C → sum_b = 0\n\nelse:\n\ncompute sum_b as above\n\ntotal_contribution += sum_a + sum_b\n\nThus, the total time complexity is O(B - A + 1) → which is acceptable even for B up to 5e5.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nBut first, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet's walk through this.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nFor x in [1, 2].\n\nFirst, x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 - 1 + 1) = max(2, 3) → 3.\n\nC is 3. So y_low = 3, which is <= 3. So proceed.\n\nthreshold_y = D - x + 1 = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4.\n\ny_upper_a = min(3, 4 - 1) = min(3, 3) → 3.\n\nsum_a is for y from 3 to 3.\n\nnumber_of_terms_a = 1.\n\nsum_of_y_a = 3.\n\nsum_a = (1 - 3)*1 + 3 = (-2) + 3 = 1.\n\nthreshold_y is 4. y_lower_b = max(3, 4) → 4. Since C is 3, which is less than 4, sum_b is 0. So total contribution for x=1 is 1.\n\nNow x=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 - 2 + 1) = max(2, 2) → 2.\n\nC is 3. So y ranges from 2 to 3.\n\nthreshold_y = D - x + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.\n\ny_upper_a = min(3, 3 - 1) → min(3, 2) → 2.\n\nso sum_a is for y from 2 to 2.\n\nnumber_of_terms_a = 1.\n\nsum_of_y_a = 2.\n\nsum_a = (2 - 3) * 1 + 2 → (-1) + 2 = 1.\n\ny_lower_b = max(2, 3) → 3. So y ranges from 3 to 3.\n\nnumber_of_terms_b = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1 → sum_b = 1 * (4 -3 + 1) = 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nSo total contribution for x=2 is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nTotal overall is 1 + 3 = 4 → which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nLet me check.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nSo x ranges from 1 to 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2 - 1 + 1) = max(2, 2) → 2. C is 2. So y is 2.\n\nthreshold_y = D -x +1 = 5 -1 +1 =5.\n\ny_upper_a is min(2, 5-1=4) → 2. So sum_a for y=2:\n\nsum_a = (1 - 2)*1 + 2 → (-1) + 2 = 1.\n\nthreshold_y is 5. y_lower_b = max(2,5) →5. Since C is 2, sum_b is 0. Contribution is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2 - 2 + 1) → max(2, 1) → 2. C is 2.\n\nthreshold_y = 5 - 2 +1 =4.\n\ny_upper_a = min(2, 4-1=3) → 2. So sum_a is for y=2:\n\nsum_a = (2-2)*1 + 2 = 0 +2=2.\n\ny_lower_b = max(2,4) →4. Which is larger than C=2. sum_b is 0. So contribution for x=2 is 2.\n\nTotal sum is 1+2=3. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nx can be 500000. y can be 500000. z must be between 500000 and 500000.\n\nCheck x + y > z → 500000 + 500000 > 500000 → yes. So for x=500000, y=500000:\n\nthreshold_y = D -x +1 = 500000 - 500000 +1 = 1. So for y_low:\n\ny_low = max(500000, C -x +1) = max(500000, 500000 - 500000 +1) → max(500000, 1) → 500000.\n\nthreshold_y is 1. So y_upper_a is min(500000, 1-1=0) → 0. Which is less than y_low (500000). So sum_a is 0. Then y_lower_b = max(500000, 1) → 500000. Which is <= C (500000). So number_of_terms_b = 500000 -500000 +1 =1. sum_b = 1 * (500000 - 500000 +1) = 1 * 1 =1. So total contribution is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the logic works for the samples.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement this.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor x in range A to B inclusive:\n\n    compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n    if y_low > C:\n\n        continue\n\n    else:\n\n        threshold_y = D - x + 1\n\n        y_upper_a = min(C, threshold_y - 1)\n\n        if y_upper_a < y_low:\n\n            sum_a = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            num_terms_a = y_upper_a - y_low + 1\n\n            sum_y_a = (y_low + y_upper_a) * num_terms_a // 2\n\n            sum_a = (x - C) * num_terms_a + sum_y_a\n\n        # compute sum_b\n\n        y_lower_b = max(y_low, threshold_y)\n\n        if y_lower_b > C:\n\n            sum_b = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            num_terms_b = C - y_lower_b + 1\n\n            sum_b = num_terms_b * (D - C + 1)\n\n        total += sum_a + sum_b\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for sum_a and sum_b, we need to make sure that the ranges are valid.\n\nBut how to handle cases where y_upper_a is less than y_low? For example, if y_upper_a is less than y_low, then sum_a is zero.\n\nSimilarly for sum_b.\n\nSo the code should be as follows.\n\nNow, in Python, the loop for x in range(A, B+1):\n\nBut for large values, like 5e5, this loop would run 5e5 times. Which is acceptable in Python.\n\nBut let's test for the case where A=1, B=5e5, etc. But in Python, loops can handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input lines. Wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is four integers on the first line. But the sample input shows multiple lines, like:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut the actual input is given as one line per test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first line contains four integers... So the input is one line. However, the sample input shows multiple lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the user should read input from stdin and print outputs. So perhaps the code needs to handle multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000'], but that's probably the way the sample is presented. However, according to the problem statement, the input is four integers. So perhaps the code should read one line of input, split into four integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says:\n\nInput: The first line contains four integers...\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases. But the actual problem says that the input is a single line with four integers. But perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read input lines until EOF, each line being a test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, it says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as three lines, each with four integers. The sample output is three lines with the respective outputs. So the code should read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the original problem is from a programming contest where each test case is on a separate line. However, the problem may have been presented with multiple test cases in the sample, but the actual code needs to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is four integers. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. So perhaps the code needs to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nIn Python, that can be done by reading all lines from stdin, splitting each into four integers, and processing them.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute the answer and print\n\nBut let's proceed with that.\n\nNow, implementing the code as discussed.\n\nBut let's code the function for a single test case.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_triangles(A, B, C, D):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n\n        y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n        if y_low > C:\n\n            continue\n\n        threshold_y = D - x + 1\n\n        y_upper_a = min(C, threshold_y - 1)\n\n        if y_upper_a < y_low:\n\n            sum_a = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            num_terms_a = y_upper_a - y_low + 1\n\n            sum_y_a = (y_low + y_upper_a) * num_terms_a // 2\n\n            sum_a = (x - C) * num_terms_a + sum_y_a\n\n        # compute sum_b\n\n        y_lower_b = max(y_low, threshold_y)\n\n        if y_lower_b > C:\n\n            sum_b = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            num_terms_b = C - y_lower_b + 1\n\n            sum_b = num_terms_b * (D - C + 1)\n\n        total += sum_a + sum_b\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but what about when D - C + 1 is negative? Well, since C ≤ D, D - C + 1 is ≥ 1. Because D ≥ C. So that's okay.\n\nTesting this function with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4 → returns 4.\n\nSample 2: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5 → returns 3.\n\nSample 3: A=500000, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000 → returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where C = D. For example, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3. Then for x=1, y_low is max(2, 3 -1 +1) = max(2, 3) =3. y ranges from 3 to 3. threshold_y is 3 -1 +1 = 3 -x +1? Wait, threshold_y = D -x + 1 = 3 -x +1.\n\nFor x=1, threshold_y = 3 -1 +1 = 3. So y_upper_a = min(3, 3-1=2) → 2. Which is less than y_low (3). So sum_a is 0. y_lower_b is max(3, 3) → 3. So sum_b is 3 -3 +1 =1. (D-C+1) is 3-3+1=1. So sum_b is 1*1=1. So contribution for x=1 is 1.\n\nx=2: y_low is max(2, 3-2+1)=max(2, 2) =2. C=3. threshold_y = 3-2 +1 =2. So y_upper_a is min(3, 2-1=1). Which is 1. Which is less than y_low=2. sum_a=0. y_lower_b is max(2, 2) =2. sum_b is (3-2 +1) * 1 = 2 *1 =2. So total is 1+2=3. So total triangles is 3. Let's see:\n\nPossible (x,y,z) with x in [1,2], y in [2,3], z in [3,3].\n\nFor x=1, y=3: z must be 3. Check 1+3>3 → 4>3 → yes. So count 1.\n\nFor x=2, y can be 2 or 3.\n\nFor y=2: z=3. Check 2+2>3 → 4>3 → yes. So count 1.\n\nFor y=3: z=3. Check 2+3>3 → yes. So count 1. So total is 1+2=3. Which matches.\n\nSo code works here.\n\nAnother edge case: when x + y <= C. For example, A=1, B=1, C=3, D=5. Then for x=1, y_low is max(1, 3 -1 +1) = max(1, 3) =3. But C=3. So y_low=3. So y is 3. Then threshold_y is D -x +1 =5-1+1=5. y_upper_a = min(3, 5-1=4) → 3. So sum_a is (1-3)*1 + (3) → (-2) +3=1. sum_b: y_lower_b = max(3, 5) →5. Which is > C=3. So sum_b=0. So contribution is 1. Which is for z in [3, min(5, 1+3-1)=3]. So z can be 3. So 1 triangle (1,3,3). Which is correct.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when D is very large, so that for some (x,y), x + y -1 >= D. For example, x=2, y=3, D=10. Then threshold_y = 10 - 2 + 1 =9. So for y >=9, sum_b is added. But since C is say 3, then y_lower_b is 9 which is larger than C=3. So sum_b is 0. So the contribution comes from sum_a.\n\nBut code handles that.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut for large values (like 5e5), the code should run in acceptable time.\n\nIn Python, looping 5e5 times is acceptable. Let's see: 5e5 iterations, each with simple calculations. It's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n        total = 0\n\n        for x in range(A, B + 1):\n\n            y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n            if y_low > C:\n\n                continue\n\n            threshold_y = D - x + 1\n\n            y_upper_a = min(C, threshold_y - 1)\n\n            if y_upper_a < y_low:\n\n                sum_a = 0\n\n            else:\n\n                num_terms_a = y_upper_a - y_low + 1\n\n                sum_y_a = (y_low + y_upper_a) * num_terms_a // 2\n\n                sum_a = (x - C) * num_terms_a + sum_y_a\n\n            # compute sum_b\n\n            y_lower_b = max(y_low, threshold_y)\n\n            if y_lower_b > C:\n\n                sum_b = 0\n\n            else:\n\n                num_terms_b = C - y_lower_b + 1\n\n                sum_b = num_terms_b * (D - C + 1)\n\n            total += sum_a + sum_b\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case is '1 2 3 4' which outputs 4, and the code would generate that. However, when there are multiple test cases, each line is processed and printed.\n\nBut what about the case when the input is empty? Probably, the code will handle that.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is four integers, but the sample shows multiple lines. So the code is written to read all lines from stdin, each line being a test case.\n\nNow, testing with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n1 2 2 5\n\n500000 500000 500000 500000\n\nSample Output:\n\n4\n\n3\n\n1\n\nWhich the code should generate.\n\nNow, what about when A=B=C=D=1?\n\nThen x can be 1, y can be 1, z can be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy specific constraints. The constraints are such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we focus on ensuring $x + y > z$ for the triangle to be valid.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: For each valid triplet $(x, y, z)$, we need to ensure $x + y > z$. Given the ranges for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can derive the valid ranges for $z$ based on the values of $x$ and $y$.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating through all possible triplets, we use mathematical insights to compute valid ranges for $z$ efficiently. For each $x$ in the range $[A, B]$ and each $y$ in the range $[B, C]$, we determine the valid $z$ values in $[C, D]$ such that $x + y > z$.\n3. **Range Splitting**: For each pair $(x, y)$, we split the valid range of $z$ into two parts: those where $z < x + y$ and those where $z \\geq x + y$. This allows us to compute the number of valid $z$ values using arithmetic progression formulas.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total = 0\n        for x in range(A, B + 1):\n            y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n            if y_low > C:\n                continue\n            threshold_y = D - x + 1\n            y_upper_a = min(C, threshold_y - 1)\n            if y_upper_a < y_low:\n                sum_a = 0\n            else:\n                num_terms_a = y_upper_a - y_low + 1\n                sum_y_a = (y_low + y_upper_a) * num_terms_a // 2\n                sum_a = (x - C) * num_terms_a + sum_y_a\n            # compute sum_b\n            y_lower_b = max(y_low, threshold_y)\n            if y_lower_b > C:\n                sum_b = 0\n            else:\n                num_terms_b = C - y_lower_b + 1\n                sum_b = num_terms_b * (D - C + 1)\n            total += sum_a + sum_b\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.\n2. **Iterating Over Possible Values**: For each value of $x$ in the range $[A, B]$, we determine the valid range for $y$ starting from $B$ to $C$.\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: For each $x$ and $y$, we calculate the threshold value for $z$ such that $z < x + y$. This helps in determining the valid range for $z$ efficiently.\n4. **Summing Valid Triangles**: Using arithmetic progression, we compute the number of valid $z$ values for each valid $(x, y)$ pair and accumulate the total count of valid triangles.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid triangles without explicitly iterating through all possible triplets, making the solution feasible even for large input sizes.",
