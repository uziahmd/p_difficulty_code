Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the number of queries and the length of the string can be up to 1e5. Directly applying each substitution step-by-step would be too slow because each substitution could involve replacing every occurrence of a digit in the current string, which could be O(n) per query and lead to O(n^2) time overall. That's not feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\nHmm, so I need a smarter approach. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can track how each original digit contributes to the final value. Wait, no. Because substitutions are applied in order. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', then later replace '0' with something else, that would affect the previous substitution. So the order of processing queries is important.\n\nWait, but if we think in terms of building up the replacements. For example, each digit in the original string might be replaced by some string, which itself might be replaced by other substitutions. So perhaps we can model this with a mapping from each digit to its replacement, but considering that when a substitution is made, it might overwrite previous mappings.\n\nBut how do we compute the final value? Let's think about the following: For each digit in the original string, we can track what it expands to after all substitutions. However, substitutions can be applied in sequence. For example, if there's a query that replaces 'a' with 'b', and then another query that replaces 'b' with 'c', then the original 'a' would end up as 'c'.\n\nSo the key idea is to track for each digit (from 0-9) what it currently maps to. But since substitutions can override previous ones, we need to process the queries in order, updating the mappings. However, when a substitution is done, it's possible that the replacement string contains digits that are themselves subject to substitution. So, for example, if we have a query \"2->3\", and then a query \"3->4\", then the original '2's will become '3's, which then become '4's. Therefore, when processing the queries, the order matters, and each substitution affects future substitutions.\n\nBut how can we model this efficiently? Because if we have a mapping for each digit, and when a substitution is applied, we can update the mapping for that digit. However, when a digit is replaced by a string that contains other digits, those digits may have their own mappings. So, when we process a substitution, we need to expand the replacement string according to the current mappings of the digits in it. Wait, but that might not be possible because the substitution is applied in order. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the initial mappings are such that each digit maps to itself. Then, when a query comes in, say \"d -> t\", we need to update the mapping for d to be t. However, the t may contain digits that have their own mappings. But since the substitution is applied in order, when we process the query, the replacement string t is taken as-is. Wait, no. Because the substitution is applied immediately. For example, suppose the first query is \"2->00\" and then a query \"0->7\". Then, the original '2's would be replaced with \"00\", and then the \"0\"s in that string would be replaced with \"7\". So the original '2's would become \"77\".\n\nBut if we process the queries in order, and for each substitution, we can track the current mapping of each digit. However, when we replace a digit with a string, we need to make sure that any digits in that string are already processed according to the current mappings. Wait, but no. Because the substitution is applied as per the current state. For example, when a query is processed, the replacement string ti is used as it is, but any digits in ti may be replaced in future queries. So the mapping for the original digit is updated to ti, but when ti is processed, the digits in ti are not expanded at the time of the substitution. They are only expanded when they are replaced in subsequent substitutions.\n\nSo, for example, if we have:\n\nInitial mapping: each digit maps to itself.\n\nFirst query: 2 -> 00. Now, the mapping for 2 is \"00\".\n\nSecond query: 0 -> 7. Now, the mapping for 0 is \"7\". But the existing mapping for 2 is still \"00\". So when we process the substitution for 2, it would expand to 00",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The key challenge is to avoid repeatedly expanding the string for each query, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Tracking**: Maintain a mapping for each digit (0-9) that represents what it expands to after all substitutions. Initially, each digit maps to itself.\n2. **Reverse Processing**: Process the queries in reverse order to determine how each digit should be expanded. This allows us to build a dynamic programming solution where we track the contribution of each digit to the final result.\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Modulo**: Use dynamic programming to compute the value of the string as we apply the substitutions. For each digit, compute its contribution to the final number using modular arithmetic to ensure we stay within the constraints of large numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize mappings: digit -> expansion string\n    # We will process queries in reverse to build up the mappings\n    # We need to track for each digit, what it expands to\n    # Initially, each digit maps to itself\n    mappings = {str(d): str(d) for d in range(10)}\n    \n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        # Save the current mapping of d, since it may be overwritten\n        old_d_map = mappings[d]\n        # Update the mapping for d to t\n        mappings[d] = t\n    \n    # Now, compute the value of the original string s using the final mappings\n    # We'll use dynamic programming to compute the value\n    # dp[i] = value of the first i characters of s\n    # For each character in s, we expand it according to the mappings and combine with previous results\n    # Since the expansion can be long, we need to precompute for each digit what its value is\n    # However, we can't precompute all possible expansions, so we need to compute on the fly with memoization\n    # But since the mappings are fixed, we can build a memo for each digit's expansion value\n    \n    # Precompute for each digit, what is the value of its expansion\n    # memo[d] = (value, length)\n    # where value is the value of the expansion mod MOD\n    # and length is the number of digits in the expansion\n    memo = {}\n    for d in mappings:\n        expansion = mappings[d]\n        val = 0\n        length = 0\n        for ch in expansion:\n            val = (val * 10 + int(ch)) % MOD\n            length += 1\n        memo[d] = (val, length)\n    \n    # Now process the original string s\n    # dp[i] will store the value of the first i characters\n    dp = [0] * (len(s) + 1)\n    for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):\n        current_digit = s[i - 1]\n        val, length = memo[current_digit]\n        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] * pow(10, length, MOD) + val) % MOD\n    \n    print(dp[len(s)])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Initialization**: Each digit initially maps to itself.\n2. **Reverse Query Processing**: By processing queries in reverse, we ensure that when a digit is replaced, subsequent replacements are already accounted for in the mapping.\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Modulo**: We use dynamic programming to compute the value of the string after all substitutions.
