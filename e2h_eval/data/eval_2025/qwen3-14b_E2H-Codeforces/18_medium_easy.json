The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints. We need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't go beyond 0 or x. So for each x, we need to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute f(x) for each x individually. We need a mathematical formula or pattern to calculate the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Let's consider the general case. The frog can move forward by a steps or backward by b steps. However, since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the movement is constrained.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a linear combination problem. The positions reachable without any constraints would be those that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, with the constraints of staying within [0, x], it's more complicated.\n\nWait, but maybe the key is to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Because if the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of gcd(a,b), then maybe that's the case. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me take the first example: a=5, b=3. The gcd(5,3) is 1. So the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of 1, which is all integers. But with the constraints of the interval [0,x].\n\nBut in the first example, when x=5, the frog can reach 0,5 (since from 0, it can jump +5 to 5). Also, can it reach other positions? For example, from 5, can it jump back by 3 steps to 2? But then 2 is within [0,5], so yes. Then from 2, can it jump +5 to 7, but that's beyond x=5, so that's not allowed. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. So f(5) is 3, which matches the example.\n\nSo the reachable positions are those that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a,b), but also within [0,x], and reachable through some sequence of jumps that never step outside the interval.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d = gcd(a,b), and within the range [0, x], provided that they can be formed by some combination of steps. However, the problem is that the frog can't go beyond x or below 0 during the jumps. So even if a position is a multiple of d and within [0,x], it might not be reachable if the path to get there requires going outside the interval.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model the reachable positions once x is large enough. For example, once x is sufficiently large, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and within [0,x]. But for smaller x, some positions might not be reachable.\n\nSo the problem breaks down into two parts:\n\n1. Determine for each x, the set of positions reachable under the constraints.\n2. Sum the sizes of these sets for x from 0 to m.\n\nBut given the constraints on m (up to 1e9), we need an O(1) or O(some small function of a and b) approach.\n\nLet me think about the conditions for the frog to reach a position k. Let's assume that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d = gcd(a,b), and that is within [0, x], but only if certain conditions are met.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the problem without the constraints of not leaving [0,x]. The frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b. Since the frog can jump forward and backward, the positions reachable are all integers that are multiples of d = gcd(a, b). Because any such integer can be written as a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients. However, since the frog can only make jumps of +a or -b, the coefficients would be non-negative for a and non-negative for b? Wait, no. Because each jump is adding a or subtracting b. So the total displacement is (number of +a jumps) * a - (number of -b jumps) * b. So the displacement can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers.\n\nBut the set of all such displacements is the same as all integers that are multiples of d, but only if the displacement can be expressed as such. However, the problem is that even if a position is a multiple of d, it might not be reachable unless certain conditions are met. For example, if the frog starts at 0, and wants to reach a position k, which is a multiple of d. How can we find the minimal steps to reach it, considering that during the jumps, the frog cannot go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of f(x), which counts all positions that can be reached without ever stepping outside [0, x], the key is to find all positions that are multiples of d, and that can be reached via some path that stays within [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe for x >= some value, all positions that are multiples of d and within [0,x] can be reached. But for smaller x, some positions may not be reachable.\n\nLet me think about the example where a=5, b=3. d=1. So all positions are reachable. But when x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and 2 (from 5-3). Then from 2, can it reach 2+5=7 (but that's beyond x=5, so not allowed). So 2 can't reach further. But what about 2-3 = -1, which is invalid. So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. So three positions. Which is correct.\n\nBut for x=7, the frog can reach more positions. Let's see: from 0, it can jump to 5. From 5, it can jump to 2. From 2, it can jump to 7 (since 2+5=7). Now 7 is within x=7. So that's a new position. Also, from 7, you can jump back to 7-3=4. Then from 4, jump to 4+5=9 (invalid) or 4-3=1. From 1, you can't jump back (1-3=-2 invalid) or jump forward to 6. From 6, you can jump back to 3, then to 0. So the positions reachable for x=7 would be 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions, which matches the example's f(7)=8.\n\nSo for x >= some value, all positions that are multiples of d (which is 1 here) and between 0 and x are reachable. But how to find that value?\n\nIn this case, when x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions. But how to find the minimal x where this becomes possible?\n\nThis seems related to the concept of the \"coin problem\" where you find the largest amount that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b. But in this case, the problem is different because the frog can both add and subtract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x that allows the frog to reach all positions that are multiples of d is when x is greater than or equal to (a + b). Or some other value.\n\nBut perhaps for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and within [0, x]. Because once the frog can reach positions up to a + b, then it can move forward and backward to reach any position in that range.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose a=3, b=2. d=1. So for x=5, can the frog reach all positions 0-5?\n\nStarting from 0, the frog can jump to 3. Then from 3, jump back to 1 (3-2=1). From 1, jump to 4 (1+3=4). From 4, jump back to 2 (4-2=2). From 2, jump to 5 (2+3=5). From 5, jump back to 3 (5-2=3). So positions 0,3,1,4,2,5. All numbers from 0 to 5. So yes. So for x=5, which is a + b = 5, the frog can reach all positions. So perhaps once x >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and between 0 and x.\n\nBut what if a and b are not coprime? Let's say a=4, b=2. Then d=2. So the frog can reach positions that are multiples of 2. Let's see. Starting at 0, can jump to 4. From 4, can jump back to 2 (4-2=2). From 2, can jump to 6 (but that's beyond x if x is small). So for x=4, the reachable positions are 0, 4, 2. For x=6, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4, 6. So yes, once x is large enough (like x >= a + b?), the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nSo perhaps the general rule is:\n\nFor x >= (some threshold), the number of reachable positions is floor(x / d) + 1. Because each multiple of d up to x is reachable.\n\nBut what is that threshold?\n\nThe threshold is probably (a + b) - d. Because in the case where a and b are coprime, the threshold is a + b - d = a + b - 1. For example, in the first example, a=5, b=3, d=1, threshold is 5+3-1=7. So for x >=7, all multiples of d (i.e., all integers) are reachable. Which matches the example where x=7 gives 8 positions (from 0 to 7, inclusive, which is 8 numbers).\n\nBut how to determine this threshold?\n\nAnother way to think: the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d, as long as they are in the range [0, x], and x is large enough that the frog can reach them without needing to go beyond x during the jumps.\n\nBut how to find that x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is (a + b) - d. Because once x is at least that, the frog can reach all positions. Let's test this.\n\nTake the case where a=4, b=2, d=2. The threshold would be 4+2 -2=4. For x=4, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 4. Which is all multiples of 2 up to 4. So yes. For x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4. But 5 is not a multiple of 2, so it's not counted. So the count is 3, which is floor(5/2)+1 = 2 + 1=3. Correct. So for x >= threshold, the count is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nSo perhaps the general approach is:\n\nIf x is less than some value (the threshold), then the count is something else. Otherwise, it's floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each x, whether x is above or below the threshold. Then compute accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute the threshold?\n\nAlternatively, the threshold is (a + b) - d. Let me check another example.\n\nTake a=3, b=5, d=1. Threshold is 3+5 -1=7. For x=7, the frog can reach all positions. For example, 0, 3, 5, 8 (but 8>7, so no). Wait, but earlier example with a=5 and b=3, when x=7, the frog could reach all positions up to 7. So maybe the threshold is (a + b) - d, and once x is larger than or equal to that, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nBut how to find the threshold. Let's think again.\n\nThe threshold is the minimal x such that for any position k which is a multiple of d and <=x, the frog can reach it without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to find that x?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of the coin problem, but with the possibility of both adding and subtracting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is the maximum between a and b. For example, in the first example, a=5, b=3. The threshold is 5. But when x=5, the frog can't reach all positions (only 0, 2, 5). So that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the threshold is (a + b) - d. Let's take the example of a=5, b=3, d=1. Threshold is 5+3-1=7. So for x >=7, the count is floor(x/1)+1 =x+1. Which matches the example where for x=7, f(7)=8.\n\nSo for x < threshold, the count is something else, and for x >= threshold, it's floor(x/d) +1.\n\nBut how to compute the count for x < threshold?\n\nWell, for x less than the threshold, we can precompute all the reachable positions. However, since the threshold can be up to a + b (which is up to 2e5, since a and b are up to 1e5 each), we can precompute for all x up to that threshold.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we need to handle two cases for each x:\n\n1. If x is less than the threshold, compute f(x) using some method (like BFS or dynamic programming).\n2. If x is greater than or equal to the threshold, compute f(x) as floor(x/d) +1.\n\nBut how to compute the threshold?\n\nLet me think again. The threshold is the minimal x such that all multiples of d in [0, x] are reachable. How to find this x?\n\nAlternatively, the threshold could be (a + b) - d, but I need to verify this.\n\nLet me take the case where a=2 and b=2. Then d=2. The threshold would be 2+2 -2=2. For x=2, the frog can reach 0, 2. For x=2, the count is 2 (0 and 2). Which is floor(2/2) +1= 1 +1=2. Correct. What about x=3? The count is still 2 (only 0 and 2). But floor(3/2)+1= 1 +1=2. So for x >= threshold, which is 2, the formula holds. So yes.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=2. d=1. Threshold is 3+2-1=4. Let's check x=4. Can the frog reach all positions from 0 to 4?\n\nPositions: 0, 3, 1 (3-2), 4 (1+3), 2 (4-2). So yes. All positions from 0 to 4. So for x=4, the count is 5. Which is 4+1=5. Correct. For x=3, the count is 4 (0, 3, 1, 2? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nAt x=3, the frog can reach 0, 3. From 3, it can jump back to 1. From 1, can it jump to 4? No, because x=3. So 1 can only jump to 1+3=4 (invalid) or 1-2=-1 (invalid). So positions are 0, 3, 1. So count is 3. But according to the formula floor(x/d) +1 = 3+1=4. So this contradicts. So the threshold must be higher than 4.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my earlier assumption about the threshold being a + b -d is incorrect.\n\nIn this case, a=3, b=2, d=1. The threshold is supposed to be 3+2 -1=4. But for x=4, the frog can reach all positions. However, for x=3, the formula floor(3/1)+1 =4, but actual count is 3. So the formula works only for x >= threshold. But in this case, the threshold is 4. So for x >=4, the formula applies.\n\nBut why for x=4, the count is 5 (positions 0,1,2,3,4). Let's check:\n\nYes. From 0, jump to 3. From 3, jump back to 1. From 1, jump to 4. From 4, jump back to 2. From 2, jump to 5 (invalid) or back to 0. So positions are 0,3,1,4,2. All positions from 0 to 4. So for x=4, count is 5. Which is 4+1=5. So the formula holds. So for x >= threshold, it works.\n\nBut for x=3, the formula would give 3+1=4, but the actual count is 3. So the threshold is indeed 4. Hence, for x < threshold, we have to calculate f(x) separately.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b). If a and b are not coprime, then the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d. So for each x, the maximum possible number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1. But this is only true when x is >= threshold.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Compute the threshold T. Once x >= T, the number of positions is floor(x/d) +1.\n\n3. For x < T, compute f(x) via BFS or DP, but since T can be up to a + b, which is 2e5, this is feasible.\n\nBut how to compute T?\n\nIn the previous example, T was a + b -d. For a=3, b=2, d=1, T=3+2-1=4. Which worked. For a=5, b=3, d=1, T=5+3-1=7, which also worked. For a=2, b=2, d=2, T=2+2-2=2. Which worked.\n\nSo perhaps T = a + b - d.\n\nBut let's test another example. Take a=4, b=6. d=2. T=4+6 -2=8. Let's see for x=8, can the frog reach all multiples of 2 up to 8?\n\nThe multiples are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\nHow to reach 2: from 0, jump +a (4) is 4, which is allowed. Then from 4, jump -b (6) would be -2 (invalid). Alternatively, can the frog reach 2? Let's see. Maybe another way.\n\nWait, the frog can only jump +a or -b. So starting from 0, can the frog reach 2? Let's see:\n\n0 -> 0 + a = 4. From 4, can subtract b (6) to get -2, which is invalid. So no. Alternatively, can the frog reach 2 via some other steps? Like, 0 +a +a = 8. From 8, subtract b (6) to get 2. So yes. But for x=8, the frog can do that. So for x=8, the frog can reach 2. Similarly, for 6: from 0, jump to 4, then to 8, then subtract 6 to get 2. Then from 2, add a=4 to get 6. So yes. So all multiples of 2 up to 8 can be reached. Thus, for x=8, the count is 5 (0,2,4,6,8). Which is floor(8/2)+1 =4+1=5. So correct.\n\nBut what about x=6? For x=6, the frog can reach 0, 4, 8 (invalid). So 0 and 4. But also, can the frog reach 2? Let's see. To reach 2, the frog needs to go from 0 to 4 (allowed), then to 8 (invalid). So no. So 2 is not reachable. But according to the formula, floor(6/2)+1=3+1=4. But actual count is 2 (0 and 4?), or maybe others?\n\nWait, let's re-examine. Let's think of all possible positions reachable for x=6.\n\nStart at 0. From 0, can jump to 4 (since a=4). From 4, can jump to 4 -6 = -2 (invalid) or 4+4=8 (invalid). So no. So only 0 and 4. So count is 2. But according to the formula, for x=6 which is less than T=8, the formula doesn't apply. So for x < T, we need to compute it via BFS.\n\nThus, the threshold T is a + b -d, and for x >= T, the formula applies. For x < T, we need to compute f(x) using BFS or DP.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for all x from 0 to m, the sum of f(x). Given that m can be up to 1e9, but T is up to a + b (which is 2e5), we can precompute all f(x) for x from 0 to T, and then for x > T, compute the formula.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n   - If d is not 1, then the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of d.\n\n   - However, if a and b are such that the frog cannot reach certain multiples of d even when x is large enough, then the threshold may vary. But according to previous examples, the threshold T = a + b - d.\n\n   - However, if a and b are such that one of them is zero? No, the problem states that a and b are positive integers.\n\n2. Check if a and b are such that the frog can reach all multiples of d once x >= T. For example, if a and b are both multiples of d, but their combination allows the frog to reach all multiples of d once x is big enough.\n\nBut assuming that T is correct, proceed.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nCompute T = a + b - d.\n\nFor x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nFor x < T, compute f(x) via BFS or dynamic programming.\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for x < T?\n\nWe can model this as a graph problem where each node is a position, and edges represent the possible jumps. However, since x can be up to T (which is 2e5), and m can be up to 1e9, we need to precompute for all x up to T, the value of f(x).\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for all x up to T?\n\nFor each x in 0 to T, compute the number of positions reachable under the constraint that the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy if done naively for each x. However, since T is up to 2e5, and for each x, we can compute the reachable positions using BFS once, but that would take O(T^2) time, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: precompute for all positions up to T, whether they are reachable, and for each x, f(x) is the count of positions up to x that are reachable.\n\nBut how to precompute this?\n\nWe can model the problem as follows: the frog can reach a position k if there exists a way to reach it through a series of jumps, without ever stepping outside [0, x]. However, since x varies, this complicates things. But for a fixed x, the frog can't go beyond x.\n\nBut for our purposes, we need to compute f(x) for x from 0 to T. So for each x, we need to find all positions that can be reached without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut this seems like for each x, we need to run a BFS. However, with T up to 2e5, and for each x up to T, this would be O(T^2) time, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: For all x, the reachable positions are the same as the positions that can be reached in the unconstrained case (without the [0, x] constraint), and are within [0, x]. Because if a position is reachable without constraints, then there exists a path that doesn't go beyond x (assuming x is large enough). But for x less than the threshold, this may not hold. However, if we can precompute all positions that are reachable in the unconstrained case, then for x >= the position, it's counted in f(x).\n\nBut how to find all positions that are reachable in the unconstrained case?\n\nThis is the same as all positions that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is non-negative.\n\nBut how to find all such positions?\n\nThis is equivalent to the set of positions that are multiples of d, and can be expressed as (k*a - l*b), which is equivalent to k*a - l*b = m*d, where m is an integer.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the reachable positions in the unconstrained case are all multiples of d that are >= 0 and can be expressed as a combination of a and b steps.\n\nBut even then, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a BFS problem where we can reach positions up to T (since T is 2e5), and for each position, track whether it's reachable.\n\nBut the problem is that for each x, the frog can't go beyond x. However, for x up to T, we need to find for each x, the positions reachable without exceeding x.\n\nBut this seems challenging.\n\nWait, but for a given x, the frog can't go beyond x. So during the BFS, whenever the frog jumps, it must stay within [0, x]. So for each x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by moving forward and backward, but without ever stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut for x up to T, which is 2e5, and for each x, we can perform a BFS. However, for m up to 1e9, and T up to 2e5, this would take O(T^2) time, which is 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each position k, determine the minimal x such that k is reachable. Then, for any x >= that minimal x, k will be counted in f(x). So, for each k, if we can find the minimal x_min(k), then for all x >= x_min(k), the position k is included in f(x). Then, for x < x_min(k), it's not.\n\nOnce we have all x_min(k), we can compute for each x, the number of positions k where x_min(k) <= x and k <=x.\n\nBut how to find x_min(k)?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps for each k that is a multiple of d and can be reached in the unconstrained case, x_min(k) is the maximum between k and the minimal steps needed to reach it without going beyond x.\n\nAlternatively, think of the minimal x that allows the frog to reach k. For example, to reach k, the frog must be able to reach it without going beyond x. So x must be at least k, and also, during the jumps, the frog must not go beyond x. So x must be at least the maximum position visited during the path to reach k.\n\nBut finding this for all k is not straightforward.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem for all x. For x >= T, the number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1. For x < T, we need to find the number of positions that are reachable under the [0, x] constraint.\n\nBut perhaps, for x < T, the number of reachable positions is the same as the number of positions reachable in the unconstrained case that are <=x. Because once x is large enough, the frog can reach all those positions. But for x < T, the frog may not be able to reach them due to the constraints.\n\nBut how to find the unconstrained reachable positions?\n\nLet me think of the unconstrained case. The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But since a and b are multiples of d, we can write a = d * a', b = d * b', where gcd(a', b') = 1.\n\nSo the unconstrained reachable positions are all multiples of d that are >= 0 and can be expressed as k*a' - l*b'.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, the set of such numbers includes all integers >= (a'*b' - a' - b') + something? Not sure.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the reachable positions in the unconstrained case are all multiples of d that are >= 0. But this is not true. For example, in the case a=5, b=3, d=1. The unconstrained case allows reaching any integer >=0? Well, for example, 1 can be reached as 5*2 -3*3 = 10-9=1. So yes. But for a=4, b=2, d=2. The unconstrained positions are multiples of 2. But can the frog reach 2? Yes: 4-2=2. Can it reach 4? Yes. Can it reach 0? Yes. Can it reach 6? Yes: 4 + 4 - 2 = 6. So yes. So all multiples of d >=0 are reachable. But earlier example where a=3, b=2, d=1. All integers >=0 are reachable. So perhaps, for the unconstrained case, the frog can reach all multiples of d >=0.\n\nIf this is true, then for x >= T, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. And for x < T, the frog can't reach some of them because the path requires going beyond x.\n\nBut how to find the count for x < T?\n\nIf that's the case, then for x < T, the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d that are <=x and can be reached with some path that does not exceed x.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nPerhaps we can precompute all multiples of d up to T, and for each such multiple k, determine whether it is reachable under the [0, x] constraint for x >=k. But this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, since for x >= T, all multiples of d up to x are reachable, and for x < T, some of them are not, but how many?\n\nMaybe the answer is that for x < T, the number of reachable positions is the same as the number of multiples of d that are <=x and are reachable in the unconstrained case. But since all multiples are reachable in the unconstrained case, then for x < T, the count is the number of multiples of d up to x, minus those multiples that require the frog to go beyond x during the jumps.\n\nBut how to find those?\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think of T as the point where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. For x < T, the number of reachable positions is the same as the number of multiples of d that are reachable in the unconstrained case and are <=x and can be reached without needing to go beyond x during the jumps.\n\nBut this seems too abstract.\n\nMaybe we should consider that for x < T, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of multiples of d that are reachable in the unconstrained case and are <=x and can be reached by the frog without going beyond x. However, since the frog can only jump forward or backward, it's possible that to reach a certain multiple, the frog has to go beyond x.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nMaybe the minimal x required to reach a multiple k is max(k, ...). For example, to reach k, the frog may have to go to a higher position and then jump back. So the minimal x needed to allow this is the maximum position along the path.\n\nBut how to find this for all k?\n\nThis seems very complex. Perhaps we can model this with BFS for all positions up to T, and for each position k, determine whether it is reachable under the [0, T] constraint. Then, for any x >= k, if x >= T, then it is counted in f(x). For x < T, it is counted in f(x) only if k <=x and it is reachable under [0, x] constraint.\n\nBut how to find for all k up to T whether it is reachable under [0, T] constraint, and then for x < T, determine how many of these k's are <=x and are reachable under [0, x] constraint.\n\nBut this seems difficult.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nSince T is small (up to 2e5), we can precompute for each position k up to T, whether it is reachable under the [0, T] constraint. Let's call this set S. Then, for any x >= T, f(x) is floor(x/d) +1. For x < T, f(x) is the number of elements in S that are <=x.\n\nBut wait, is this correct?\n\nBecause if a position k is in S (reachable under [0, T] constraint), then it means that there exists a path to reach it without going beyond T. So for any x >=k, since x >= T >=k, the frog can reach k by following the same path (since it doesn't go beyond T <=x). Hence, for x >=k, k is counted in f(x).\n\nTherefore, for x >= T, the number of positions is the number of elements in S that are <=x, plus possibly other positions that are multiples of d and greater than T but <=x. But wait, no. Because for x >= T, the number of positions is floor(x/d) +1, which is the number of multiples of d up to x. So this implies that S contains all multiples of d up to T. But how?\n\nIf this is true, then for x >= T, the number of multiples of d up to x is floor(x/d) +1. And since all multiples of d up to x are reachable, then S must contain all multiples of d up to T.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nFor example, in the case where a=3, b=2, d=1, T=4. The multiples of d up to T are 0,1,2,3,4. Are all of these in S?\n\nYes, as discussed earlier. So for x >= T=4, the count is floor(x/1)+1 =x+1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute all positions up to T that are reachable in the [0, T] constraint. Let's call this set S.\n\n- For x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\n- For x < T, f(x) is the number of elements in S that are <=x.\n\nIf this is correct, then we can proceed.\n\nSo the problem now reduces to:\n\n1. Compute T = a + b -d.\n\n2. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n3. Compute S, the set of positions reachable under [0, T] constraint.\n\nOnce S is computed, for any x, f(x) is:\n\nif x < T: count of elements in S that are <=x.\n\nelse: floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute S?\n\nTo compute S, we can perform a BFS or dynamic programming approach, where we consider all positions up to T, and for each position, determine if it is reachable under the [0, T] constraint.\n\nLet's think about how to perform this BFS.\n\nWe can model it as follows:\n\nInitialize a boolean array reachable of size T+1, initialized to False.\n\nSet reachable[0] = True.\n\nThen, for each position k in 0 to T, if reachable[k] is True, then we can try to jump to k+a and k-b.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the new positions are within [0, T].\n\nSo:\n\nfor each k in 0 to T:\n\n   if reachable[k] is True:\n\n      next_pos1 = k + a\n\n      if next_pos1 <= T:\n\n          if not reachable[next_pos1]:\n\n              mark it as reachable and add to queue.\n\n      next_pos2 = k - b\n\n      if next_pos2 >= 0:\n\n          if not reachable[next_pos2]:\n\n              mark",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by `a` units or backward by `b` units. The challenge is to compute the sum of the number of distinct positions the frog can reach for each integer from 0 to a given value `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. This is because any linear combination of `a` and `b` will be a multiple of their gcd.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: We define a threshold `T` which is `a + b - gcd(a, b)`. For values of `x` greater than or equal to this threshold, the frog can reach all multiples of the gcd up to `x`.\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For values of `x` less than the threshold, we use BFS to precompute all reachable positions up to `T`.\n4. **Summing Results**: For each value from 0 to `m`, if it is below the threshold, we use the precomputed results. If it is above the threshold, we use the formula for counting multiples of the gcd.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    T = a + b - d\n    \n    # Precompute reachable positions up to T\n    max_T = T\n    reachable = [False] * (max_T + 1)\n    reachable[0] = True\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(0)\n    \n    while q:\n        current = q.popleft()\n        # Jump forward\n        next_pos = current + a\n        if next_pos <= max_T and not reachable[next_pos]:\n            reachable[next_pos] = True\n            q.append(next_pos)\n        # Jump backward\n        next_pos = current - b\n        if next_pos >= 0 and not reachable[next_pos]:\n            reachable[next_pos] = True\n            q.append(next_pos)\n    \n    # Precompute prefix sums for reachable positions up to T\n    prefix = [0] * (max_T + 1)\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(max_T + 1):\n        if reachable[i]:\n            count +=1\n        prefix[i] = count\n    \n    # Now calculate the sum from 0 to m\n    total = 0\n    if m <= T:\n        # Use prefix array\n        total = prefix[m]\n    else:\n        # Sum for x from 0 to T\n        total += prefix[T]\n        # Sum for x from T+1 to m\n        # For each x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1\n        # The sum from T+1 to m of (floor(x/d) + 1)\n        # Which is sum_{x=T+1}^m (floor(x/d) + 1) = sum_{x=T+1}^m floor(x/d) + (m - T)\n        # Compute sum_floor = sum_{x=0}^m floor(x/d) - sum_{x=0}^T floor(x/d)\n        # But since for x >= T, we start from T+1 to m\n        # So sum_floor_part = sum_{x= T+1}^m floor(x/d)\n        # And add (m - T)\n        # Compute sum_floor_part:\n        # floor(x/d) = k when x is in [k*d, (k+1)*d -1]\n        # Let's compute the sum from x = T+1 to m of floor(x/d)\n        # Also, note that floor(x/d) = (x - (x % d)) / d\n        # So sum_floor_part = sum_{x = T+1}^m (x // d)\n        # To compute this efficiently:\n        # Let's find how many full blocks of d there are between T+1 and m\n        def sum_floor(n, d):\n            # sum_{x=0}^n floor(x/d)\n            q = n // d\n            r = n % d\n            return q * (q - 1) * d // 2 + q * r + (q * (q + 1)) // 2 * d\n        # Wait, perhaps better to compute sum_{x=0}^n floor(x/d) as follows:\n        # sum_{k=0}^{q-1} (k*d + 0 ... d-1) + sum_{r=0}^{r} q\n        # where q = floor(n/d), r = n % d\n        # sum_{x=0}^n floor(x/d) = sum_{k=0}^{q-1} (k*d) + (r + 1)*q\n        # Wait no, for x in [k*d, (k+1)*d - 1], floor(x/d) = k.
