    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. The instability is the max minus min of the remaining elements. So, the problem is to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nFirst, let's think about the straightforward approach. For each element in the array, if I remove it, compute the max and min of the remaining elements, then take their difference. Then find the minimum among all these differences. But wait, for n up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. Because for each element, you have to scan the array again to find max and min. That's not feasible for n=1e5. So we need a smarter way.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the original array. The instability when removing one element depends on which elements are left. The original max and min might be affected by the element removed. For example, if the original array has multiple instances of the max or min, removing one of them might not change the overall max or min.\n\nSo maybe we can precompute the prefix and suffix max and min arrays. Like, for each position i, we can know the max and min of the array up to i, and from i onwards. Then, when considering removing element at position i, the new max would be the maximum between the max of the elements before i and the max of the elements after i. Similarly for the min. Then, the instability would be (max_left_or_right) - (min_left_or_right).\n\nYes! That makes sense. Let me think about how to implement this.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose the array is [1,3,3,7]. The original max is 7 and min is 1. If we remove 7 (the last element), the new max is 3 and min is 1. So instability is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo for each element, when we remove it, the new max is the maximum of the elements before it and after it. Similarly for the min. So the idea is:\n\n- Precompute prefix max and min arrays.\n- Precompute suffix max and min arrays.\n- For each index i, the new max is max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1]) and similarly for min. Then compute the difference.\n\nBut how to handle the cases where the element is the first or last element?\n\nFor example, if i is 0 (the first element), then the prefix_max[i-1] would be undefined. So in that case, the max would be the suffix_max[i+1], which is the max of the rest of the array. Similarly for the last element.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min.\n\nLet's think about how to compute those.\n\nprefix_max[i] will be the maximum of the first i elements (from 0 to i). Similarly for prefix_min. Similarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum of elements from i to n-1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to have prefix_max where prefix_max[i] is the max of the first i elements. Wait, indexes can be a bit tricky here. Let's think of the array as 0-based.\n\nFor example, for the array [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}].\n\nprefix_max[0] = a_0.\n\nprefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i]).\n\nSimilarly for prefix_min.\n\nSimilarly, for suffix_max, suffix_max[n-1] = a[n-1], and for i from n-2 down to 0, suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i]).\n\nSame for suffix_min.\n\nOnce we have these arrays, for each index i, when we remove it, the max of the remaining elements is max( prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1] ), but only if i is not the first or last element. For example, if i is the first element (i=0), then the prefix_max[i-1] is invalid. So the max is suffix_max[1], which is the max of the elements from index 1 to end. Similarly, if i is the last element (n-1), the max is prefix_max[n-2].\n\nSo for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nif i == 0:\n\nnew_max = suffix_max[1]\n\nnew_min = suffix_min[1]\n\nif i == n-1:\n\nnew_max = prefix_max[n-2]\n\nnew_min = prefix_min[n-2]\n\nelse:\n\nnew_max = max( prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1] )\n\nnew_min = min( prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nThen, the instability is new_max - new_min.\n\nWe compute this",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. The key challenge is to achieve this efficiently for large arrays (up to 100,000 elements).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We precompute prefix and suffix arrays for both maximum and minimum values. These arrays help us quickly determine the maximum and minimum values of the array excluding any specific element.\n2. **Iterate Over Each Element**: For each element in the array, we consider removing it and calculate the instability of the resulting array using the precomputed prefix and suffix arrays.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By using the precomputed arrays, we can efficiently determine the max and min values of the array excluding the current element in constant time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    prefix_max = [0] * n\n    prefix_min = [0] * n\n    suffix_max = [0] * n\n    suffix_min = [0] * n\n    \n    prefix_max[0] = a[0]\n    prefix_min[0] = a[0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n        prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n    \n    suffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\n    suffix_min[-1] = a[-1]\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n        suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], a[i])\n    \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            current_max = suffix_max[1]\n            current_min = suffix_min[1]\n        elif i == n-1:\n            current_max = prefix_max[n-2]\n            current_min = prefix_min[n-2]\n        else:\n            current_max = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1])\n            current_min = min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1])\n        instability = current_max - current_min\n        if instability < min_instability:\n            min_instability = instability\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only two elements, the instability after removing one element is zero.\n3. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays are constructed to store the maximum and minimum values up to each index (prefix) and from each index to the end (suffix).\n4. **Instability Calculation**: For each element, we calculate the instability of the array after removing that element using the precomputed prefix and suffix arrays. This allows us to efficiently determine the new max and min values without scanning the entire array repeatedly.\n5. **Result**: The minimum instability across all possible removals is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
