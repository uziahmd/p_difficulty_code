Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. Each takes turns, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of H and M moves that achieves this maximum.\n\nHmm, the input is a number A with 2n digits. For each turn, the leftmost digit is taken by the current player. So the order of taking digits depends on the sequence of H and M choices. But both players must take exactly n digits each. So the problem is to choose which player takes which digits in order to maximize the total sum.\n\nThe challenge here is to find the optimal sequence of moves. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of possible sequences is C(2n, n), which for n=18 would be 18 choose 9 = 48620. Wait, but 2n is 36 digits. Wait, no, for n=18, the number of possible sequences is (2n)!/(n!n!) which for n=18 is 36!/(18!18!) which is a huge number. That's way too big for brute force. So we need a dynamic programming approach or some other optimization.\n\nWait, but for n=18, even if we have a DP approach with states based on the current position and the count of H and M moves taken so far, maybe that's manageable. Let's think about the state.\n\nLet me think. At any step, the number of digits taken by Homer and Marge is determined. Suppose we have a state (h, m) where h is the number of digits Homer has taken so far, and m is the number of digits Marge has taken. The total steps taken so far is h + m. Since each move takes one digit, the next digit to take is the (h + m + 1)th digit in the original A string. Wait, no. Because each time, the leftmost digit is taken. So the order of digits being taken is fixed based on the sequence of H and M moves. For example, the first move takes the first digit of A. The second move takes the next digit (since the first was removed). So the order of digits taken depends on the sequence of H and M. However, the problem is that the digits are taken from the front of A as they are chosen. So, the actual digits available depend on how many digits have been taken so far.\n\nBut for the DP approach, perhaps we can model it as follows: the state is the current position in the string (i.e., how many digits have been taken so far). Let's say that the current state is k digits taken. Then, the next digit to take is the (k+1)th digit of the original A. Wait, no. Because when you take digits from the front, the digits left are the original A's digits starting from position k. So the next digit is A[k], assuming that the initial A is stored as a list or string, and k is the number of digits taken so far. So for example, if we have taken k digits, the next digit is the (k)th index (if zero-based) of the original string.\n\nSo, the DP state could be (h, m), where h is the number of digits Homer has taken, and m is the number of digits Marge has taken. Since h + m = k, the number of digits taken so far. Also, since each player must take exactly n digits, the constraints are h <= n, m <= n, and h + m <= 2n. Also, for each state, the next move can be either H or M, provided that the count doesn't exceed n.\n\nThe key is to find the optimal choice (H or M) at each step that maximizes the total sum. However, the problem is that the total sum depends on which digits are chosen for H and M. For example, choosing H now adds the current digit to Homer's number, which contributes to the total sum as a digit in the number S1. Similarly for M. But since the numbers S1 and S2 are built by appending digits, the value of S1 is the sum of digit * 10^{n - h} for each digit taken by Homer. Wait, no. For example, if Homer takes digits in order d1, d2, ..., dn, then his number is d1 followed by d2, etc. So the value is d1 * 10^{n-1} + d2 * 10^{n-2} + ... + dn * 10^0. Similarly for Marge. But the problem says that the total prize is S1 + S2. So, the total is the sum",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that the total prize (sum of their numbers) is maximized. The challenge is to choose the sequence of moves efficiently given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach where each state is represented by the number of digits taken by Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`). The state transitions depend on whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit.\n2. **Memoization**: We memoize the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.\n3. **Greedy Choice**: At each step, we decide whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit based on which choice leads to a higher total prize in the subsequent steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    \n    digits = list(A)\n    \n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        k = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[k]\n        current_val = int(current_digit)\n        \n        # Try Homer's turn\n        if h < n:\n            val_h = 0\n            next_val, next_seq = dp(h + 1, m)\n            total_h = current_val * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + next_val\n            val_h = total_h\n            seq_h = 'H' + next_seq\n        \n        # Try Marge's turn\n        if m < n:\n            val_m = 0\n            next_val, next_seq = dp(h, m + 1)\n            total_m = current_val * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + next_val\n            val_m = total_m\n            seq_m = 'M' + next_seq\n        \n        if h < n and m < n:\n            if val_h > val_m:\n                return (val_h, seq_h)\n            else:\n                return (val_m, seq_m)\n        elif h < n:\n            return (val_h, seq_h)\n        else:\n            return (val_m, seq_m)\n    \n    total, sequence = dp(0, 0)\n    print(sequence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of digits `n` and the string `A`.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function is defined with memoization using `lru_cache`. It takes the current counts of digits taken by Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`).\n3. **State Transitions**: For each state, the function checks if Homer or Marge can take the next digit. It calculates the potential total prize if either takes the digit and recursively solves the subproblem.\n4. **Greedy Decision**: The function chooses the move (Homer or Marge) that results in the higher total prize, ensuring optimal decisions at each step.\n5. **Base Case**: When both Homer and Marge have taken exactly `n` digits, the recursion terminates, returning a total prize of 0 and an empty sequence.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently using memoization, leading to an optimal solution without explicitly generating all permutations.",
