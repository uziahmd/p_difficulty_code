They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about reconstructing the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the GCD and LCM values given for each road (edge) between two lawns (vertices). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Each edge has a GCD and LCM of the two vertices it connects. Let's denote the two vertices as u and v. Let their mushroom counts be a and b. Then, GCD(a, b) = g and LCM(a, b) = l. Also, we know that a * b = g * l. So for each edge, the product of the two numbers must equal the product of the GCD and LCM provided.\n\nBut how do we assign values to each node such that all edges satisfy their respective GCD and LCM?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the properties here. For any pair of numbers a and b, their GCD divides both a and b. Also, their LCM is a multiple of both. Moreover, since the GCD divides the LCM (since LCM is a multiple of both a and b, and GCD divides both), we must have that the given GCD and LCM for an edge must satisfy g divides l. Otherwise, there's no possible a and b. Wait, right! Because for any a and b, LCM(a,b) is divisible by GCD(a,b). So if in the input, for any edge, the given GCD does not divide the LCM, then it's impossible. So first, we should check for each edge whether g divides l. If not, immediately output NO.\n\nSo that's one check. But even if that's true, there's more to do.\n\nNow, considering that each edge gives us a relationship between two nodes. So this seems like a graph problem where each edge imposes constraints on the nodes it connects. How can we model these constraints?\n\nLet me think about the relationships. Let's take an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. Let's say that a_u and a_v are the mushroom counts. Then:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g\nlcm(a_u, a_v) = l\n\nWe can express a_u and a_v as multiples of g. Let me see: since the GCD is g, then a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime (since the GCD of a_u and a_v is g). Then, the LCM of a_u and a_v is g * x * y. Because LCM(a_u, a_v) = (a_u * a_v)/GCD(a_u, a_v) = (g^2 x y)/g = g x y. \n\nSo according to the problem, this LCM must be equal to l. Therefore, g * x * y = l → x * y = l / g. Also, since x and y are coprime, this implies that x and y must be divisors of l/g and their product is exactly l/g, and they are coprime. \n\nSo for each edge, we can compute l/g and check if it's an integer. Wait, but earlier we checked that g divides l. So that's already taken care of. \n\nSo, for each edge, the product of x and y is (l/g), and x and y are coprime. Therefore, the possible pairs (x, y) are pairs of coprime integers whose product is (l/g). However, since x and y are coprime, each of them must be a divisor of (l/g) and their product is exactly that value. \n\nBut how does this help us? Well, the key point is that for each edge, the values of a_u and a_v are multiples of g, and when divided by g, they are coprime. \n\nThis suggests that the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node's value is determined up to a multiple of some factors, but with constraints between connected nodes.\n\nBut how can we model this? It feels like a system of equations or constraints that need to be satisfied. \n\nAnother thought: since the GCD of a_u and a_v is g, then both a_u and a_v must be multiples of g. So, for each node, its mushroom count must be a multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. Wait, no. Because if a node is connected to multiple edges, each with different GCDs, then the mushroom count must be a multiple of the GCD of each of those edges. For example, if node u is connected to two edges with GCDs g1 and g2, then a_u must be a multiple of both g1 and g2. Therefore, a_u must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to u. But perhaps that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph where each edge defines a relation between two variables (the node values). For example, for each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we can say that a_u and a_v are multiples of g, and their ratio (when divided by g) is coprime. \n\nBut how to assign these values across the entire graph?\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a graph where each connected component must have consistent assignments. So, for each connected component, we can assign values to the nodes in a way that satisfies all the constraints. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's consider that each node's value is determined by a base value multiplied by some factors. For example, for each edge between u and v, we can represent that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime. Then, x * y = l/g. \n\nBut for the same node, if it's connected to multiple edges, each of those edges will impose different conditions. So, for example, if a node u is connected to two different edges, then the value of a_u must be compatible with both. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure, but with additional constraints. However, Union-Find is typically used for equivalence relations, but here the constraints are more complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each edge defines a relation between two nodes. For example, for each edge between u and v, we can say that a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime and x*y = k, where k = l/g. \n\nBut how do we find x and y? Well, since x and y are coprime and their product is k, then x must be a divisor of k, and y must be k/x. Also, since x and y are coprime, x must be a divisor of k such that gcd(x, k/x) = 1. Which implies that x must be a divisor of k, and x and k/x are coprime. \n\nBut for each edge, there are two possibilities for x and y: (x, y) or (y, x). So, for example, if the edge is between u and v, then we can choose either a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, or a_u = g * y and a_v = g * x. However, this choice affects the rest of the graph. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a graph where each node has a value that is determined relative to others. For example, we can model this as a graph where each node has a value that is a multiple of some base value, and the ratios between connected nodes are constrained. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: For each connected component, pick a root node and assign a value to it. Then, propagate the constraints through the edges to determine the values of other nodes. However, this requires that the constraints are consistent and that there are no contradictions.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think of each node's value as being a multiple of some base value. Let's take the example of an edge between u and v. Suppose we have already assigned a value to u, say a_u. Then, for the edge with GCD g and LCM l, we can compute what a_v must be. \n\nWait, but how? Let's suppose that we have a_u and want to find a_v. Since gcd(a_u, a_v) = g, and lcm(a_u, a_v) = l. \n\nWe know that a_u must be a multiple of g. Similarly for a_v. So, let me write a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y. Then, x and y are coprime, and x * y = l / g. \n\nSo, once we have a_u, then a_v is determined as follows: \n\nIf a_u is known, then x = a_u / g. Then, since x * y = k (where k = l/g), y = k / x. But since x and y must be coprime, we must have that x divides k, and that gcd(x, k/x) = 1. \n\nWait, but if a_u is already determined, then x is fixed. So, if the current a_u is such that x divides k, and that gcd(x, k/x) = 1, then a_v can be set to g * (k/x). Otherwise, it's impossible. \n\nBut how do we ensure that during the traversal of the graph?\n\nThis suggests that we can model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to another node. For example, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal, starting from a node, assigning a value to it, and then propagating the constraints to adjacent nodes. However, during this process, we must ensure that the constraints are satisfied. \n\nBut the problem is that the initial assignment of the root node's value may not be arbitrary. For example, if the root node is part of multiple edges, the value must satisfy all constraints. \n\nWait, but how do we choose the initial value? Let's think again. For the root node, say node u, we can assign a value that is a multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. Wait, but perhaps that's not necessary. Because the GCD of the edge is part of the constraints. For example, if node u is connected via an edge to node v, then the GCD of u and v is g. So, a_u must be a multiple of g. Similarly, if node u is connected to another node w with a different GCD, say h, then a_u must be a multiple of h. Therefore, the value of a_u must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. \n\nBut how to find such a value? Well, during the traversal, when we assign a value to the root node, we need to make sure that it's compatible with all edges connected to it. However, since the edges are processed in the traversal, perhaps this is handled automatically. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the root node's value can be chosen as the GCD of the edge multiplied by some factor. For example, if the root node is connected to an edge with GCD g, then a_u must be a multiple of g. So, perhaps the root node's value can be set to g * x, where x is some integer. But how to determine x?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of an example. Suppose we have a single edge between u and v with GCD 1 and LCM 3. Then, a_u and a_v must be 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1) since their GCD is 1 and LCM is 3. So, the possible assignments are [1,3] or [3,1]. \n\nIn this case, when we start with u, we can assign a_u as 1, then a_v would be 3. Or assign a_u as 3, then a_v would be 1. Either is acceptable. \n\nBut how to choose which one? Well, the problem allows any valid assignment, so during traversal, we can choose one possibility and proceed. However, during traversal, if we make a wrong choice, we might end up with contradictions later. \n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to model the relationships between nodes as a graph where each edge defines a ratio between the two nodes. But how?\n\nWait, for a given edge between u and v, with GCD g and LCM l. Let me define k = l/g. Then, as before, a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime, and x * y = k. \n\nSo, x and y are coprime divisors of k. \n\nTherefore, for each edge, the possible pairs (x, y) are coprime pairs whose product is k. So, for example, if k is 6, then possible pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). However, since x and y must be coprime, (2,3) is allowed because GCD(2,3)=1, but (2,6) is not allowed because GCD(2,6)=2. \n\nBut in our case, since x * y = k and they are coprime, then x must be a divisor of k and y = k/x, and GCD(x, y) = 1. \n\nTherefore, for each edge, there are multiple possibilities for x and y, but they are determined by the factors of k. \n\nBut how can we model this? For example, during BFS/DFS traversal, when we reach a node, we can assign a value based on the previous node's value. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each connected component, we can build a graph where each node's value is determined in terms of the root node's value. \n\nFor example, let's say we have a connected component. We choose a root node and assign it a value. Then, for each adjacent node, we determine their value based on the edge's constraints. \n\nBut how to choose the root's value? Because the root's value must satisfy all the constraints from its connected edges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the root's value is determined by the product of the GCDs and LCMs. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the relationships as a graph where each node's value is a multiple of some base value. For example, for each node u, we can represent its value as g_u * s_u, where g_u is the GCD of all edges connected to u. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that for each edge, a_u and a_v must be multiples of their GCD. So, for each node, the mushroom count must be a multiple of the GCD of every edge connected to it. Therefore, the value of each node must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. \n\nBut how can we find that? Let's say for node u, all edges connected to it have GCDs g1, g2, ..., gk. Then, the value of a_u must be a multiple of the LCM(g1, g2, ..., gk). \n\nBut how do we compute that? For each node, we can precompute the LCM of all the GCDs of its edges. Let's call this value 'base'. Then, the mushroom count for the node must be a multiple of 'base'. \n\nBut how does that help us? Well, if during the BFS/DFS traversal, when we assign a value to a node, it must be a multiple of 'base' for that node. \n\nBut perhaps this is a way to check for consistency. \n\nLet me outline a possible algorithm:\n\n1. For each edge, check if the given GCD divides the LCM. If not, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component in the graph (since the graph may be disconnected), process it separately.\n\n3. For each connected component, perform a BFS or DFS to assign values to the nodes. \n\n   a. Choose a starting node and assign it a value. However, the value must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. \n\n   b. For each adjacent edge, determine the possible value of the adjacent node based on the current node's value and the edge's constraints. \n\n   c. If during this process, a contradiction is found (e.g., the required value for a node is not compatible with previous assignments), output NO.\n\nBut how do we choose the initial value for the starting node? \n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have a connected component. Let's pick a starting node u. The value of u must be a multiple of the LCM of the GCDs of all edges connected to u. Let's call this LCM value 'base_u'. However, since the node may be connected to multiple edges, and each of those edges has their own GCD, this 'base_u' is the LCM of all those GCDs. \n\nBut how do we find this base_u? For each node, collect all the GCDs of the edges connected to it, compute their LCM, and that's the minimal value that the node's mushroom count must be a multiple of. \n\nOnce we have that, for the starting node u, we can assign it a value of base_u multiplied by some integer. However, the choice of that integer could affect the rest of the assignments. \n\nBut how can we choose it? Well, perhaps during the traversal, the initial value can be set as base_u, and then for each edge, we can compute the required value for the adjacent node. However, this may not work if the adjacent node's base is not compatible with the computed value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value can be set as the product of the GCD and some factor derived from the edge's LCM. \n\nThis seems quite vague. Let's think of an example. \n\nTake the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['1 0', ...]\n\nWhich is n=1, m=0. So there's only one lawn, and no roads. Then, the answer is YES with 1. \n\nSample Input 2:\n['2 1\\n1 2 1 3']\n\nSo two nodes connected by an edge with GCD 1 and LCM 3. The possible assignments are 1 and 3. \n\nSo for node 1, base is LCM of GCDs of edges connected to it. Since there's one edge with GCD 1, base is 1. Similarly for node 2. \n\nSo during BFS, assign node 1 as 1. Then, node 2 must be 3. Which works. \n\nAnother example: sample input 3:\n\n['3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10']\n\nSo three nodes, two edges. First edge between 3 and 2 with GCD 1, LCM 2. Second edge between 3 and 1 with GCD 1, LCM 10. \n\nThe output is YES with [5, 1, 2]. \n\nLet me check: \n\nFor node 3, connected to edges with GCD 1 and 1. So base is LCM(1, 1) = 1. \n\nSo node 3's value must be a multiple of 1. \n\nSuppose we assign node 3 as 2. Then, for the first edge (3-2, GCD 1, LCM 2). \n\na_3 = 2, a_2 must be such that GCD(2, a_2) = 1 and LCM(2, a_2) = 2. \n\nThe LCM of 2 and a_2 is 2. That implies that a_2 must be a divisor of 2. Also, the GCD(2, a_2) is 1. The divisors of 2 are 1,2. GCD(2,1)=1, GCD(2,2)=2. So a_2 must be 1. \n\nThen, for the second edge (3-1, GCD 1, LCM 10). a_3 is 2, so a_1 must be such that GCD(2, a_1) = 1 and LCM(2, a_1) = 10. \n\nThe LCM of 2 and a_1 is 10. So 2 * a_1 = GCD(2, a_1) * LCM(2, a_1) = 1 * 10 → 2a_1 = 10 → a_1 =5. \n\nCheck GCD(2,5) is 1. Correct. So the assignment is 2, 1, 5. But the sample output is [5,1,2]. Which is also valid. So the answer is correct. \n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nThe key idea is that during the traversal, when we assign a value to a node, we can compute the value of its neighbor based on the edge's GCD and LCM. \n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. We have already assigned a value to u, say a_u. Now, we need to find a_v. \n\nAs before, a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, x and y coprime, x * y = l/g. \n\nSo, given a_u, x is a_u / g. Then, y = (l/g) / x. \n\nBut since x must divide (l/g), and y must be such that x and y are coprime. \n\nBut since a_u is already known, x is fixed as a_u/g. \n\nBut wait, a_u must be a multiple of g. Because the GCD of a_u and a_v is g. So, for the edge between u and v, a_u must be a multiple of g. \n\nSo, when processing the edge, during the traversal, we can check if the current a_u is a multiple of g. If not, that's a contradiction. \n\nBut during the traversal, the initial assignment of a_u must be such that it is a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. \n\nSo, during the BFS/DFS traversal:\n\n- When visiting a node u, we have already assigned a value to it. \n\n- For each adjacent edge, we can compute what the value of the adjacent node v should be. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   Select a starting node. Assign it a value. \n\n   Then, for each edge connected to it, compute the value of the adjacent node. \n\nBut how to choose the initial value of the starting node? \n\nWell, the initial value must be a multiple of the LCM of the GCDs of all edges connected to that node. Let's call this LCM value as 'base'. \n\nBut how to compute this 'base'? For each node, collect all the GCDs of its edges, compute their LCM. \n\nOnce we have that, the initial value of the starting node can be set to 'base', and then during the traversal, the values of other nodes are computed accordingly. \n\nBut what if the base is not compatible with the edge constraints? For example, if the initial value is set to base, but when processing an edge, the computed value of the adjacent node may not be compatible with its own base. \n\nBut perhaps during the traversal, we can check for consistency. \n\nLet me try to model this with code.\n\nFirst, for each node, compute the base value (LCM of all GCDs of its edges). \n\nThen, for each connected component:\n\n   Initialize a queue with a starting node. Assign it a value of base. \n\n   For each node in the queue:\n\n      For each adjacent edge:\n\n         if the adjacent node is not yet assigned:\n\n             compute the required value of the adjacent node based on the current node's value and the edge's parameters.\n\n             check if this value is compatible with the adjacent node's base (i.e., the value must be a multiple of the adjacent node's base).\n\n             if not, return NO.\n\n             assign the value to the adjacent node, add to the queue.\n\n         else:\n\n             check if the existing value is compatible with the current node's value and the edge's parameters.\n\n             if not, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute the required value of the adjacent node?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that the current node u has value a_u. The edge between u and v has GCD g and LCM l. \n\nThen, we need to find a_v such that:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g \n\nlcm(a_u, a_v) = l \n\nWe can use the formula that a_u * a_v = g * l. \n\nSo, a_v = (g * l) / a_u. \n\nBut wait, because a_u * a_v = g * l. \n\nYes! Because for any two numbers, a * b = gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b). \n\nSo, given a_u, a_v must be (g*l) / a_u. \n\nBut we need to check that this value is valid. \n\nBut wait, since a_u and a_v are supposed to have GCD g and LCM l, but the formula gives a_v = (g*l)/a_u. However, this may not necessarily satisfy the GCD and LCM constraints. Because the formula is derived from the fact that a_u and a_v have those GCD and LCM. \n\nWait, no. Because if a_u and a_v have GCD g and LCM l, then their product is g*l. Therefore, given a_u, the a_v must be (g*l)/a_u. However, this may not be an integer. \n\nWait, but for the edge, we have already checked that g divides l. So, l/g is an integer. So, for the edge, the product of a_u and a_v is g*l. \n\nBut if a_u is not a divisor of g*l, then a_v would not be an integer, which is impossible. \n\nBut how can a_u be not a divisor of g*l? Because a_u is the value assigned to the node, which must be compatible with the edge's parameters. \n\nWait, but during the traversal, when we assign a_u, we need to ensure that it is compatible with the edge's parameters. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. For example, suppose that during traversal, we have assigned a value to u, which is a_u. For the edge between u and v, the formula says that a_v must be (g*l)/a_u. But this must be an integer. \n\nSo, during the traversal, when we compute a_v, we must check that (g*l) is divisible by a_u. \n\nBut how can that happen?\n\nBecause during the traversal, the initial value of u is chosen as the base (which is the LCM of the GCDs of its edges). But how can we ensure that a_u divides g*l?\n\nThis seems to be a problem. Because if the initial value is not compatible with the edge's parameters, then this approach would fail. \n\nSo, perhaps the initial assignment of the starting node's value is not correct. \n\nBut how to choose the initial value?\n\nLet me think. The starting node's value must be such that for each of its edges, (g * l) is divisible by the value. \n\nBut how can we find such a value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value for the starting node can be chosen as g * x, where x is a divisor of (l/g) and x is compatible with the other nodes. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value can be chosen as the GCD of the edge multiplied by some factor, and during traversal, the factor is adjusted accordingly. \n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that during the traversal, the a_u must be such that (g * l) is divisible by a_u. \n\nBut since a_u and a_v are supposed to satisfy a_u * a_v = g*l, then for any valid assignment, this must hold. So during the traversal, when we assign a value to u, we must ensure that for each of its edges, (g * l) is divisible by a_u. \n\nBut how to ensure that? \n\nLet me think of the example where the initial value is set to the base (the LCM of the GCDs of the edges connected to u). \n\nSuppose that for a particular edge connected to u, the GCD is g and LCM is l. Then, for the formula a_u * a_v = g*l, a_v must be (g*l)/a_u. \n\nBut since a_u is a multiple of g (because it's a multiple of the base, which is the LCM of the GCDs of the edges connected to u), then a_u = k * g for some integer k. \n\nThen, (g*l)/a_u = (g*l)/(k*g) = l/(k). \n\nSo, l must be divisible by k. \n\nBut how can we ensure that? \n\nThis depends on the value of k. \n\nBut during traversal, when we assign the initial value of u as base, which is a multiple of g (since base is the LCM of the GCDs of the edges connected to u, which includes g), then k = base / g. \n\nSo, l must be divisible by k. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nWell, the edge's parameters are given, and we have already checked that g divides l. But this doesn't imply that l is divisible by k. \n\nSo, this approach may not work. \n\nThis suggests that the initial assignment of the base may not be sufficient. \n\nHmm. This seems like a major hurdle. How can we choose the initial value of the starting node such that all edges connected to it are compatible?\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of variables. Each edge between u and v defines a relation between a_u and a_v. For each edge, a_u and a_v must satisfy:\n\na_u = g * x \n\na_v = g * y \n\nwith x and y coprime, and x * y = k = l/g. \n\nSo, for each edge, the ratio between a_u and a_v is x/y or y/x. \n\nBut since x and y are coprime, and their product is k, this suggests that the ratio between a_u and a_v is determined by the factors of k. \n\nBut how to model this in the graph. \n\nAnother Idea: For each connected component, the values of the nodes are determined up to a multiplicative factor. For example, if we fix the value of one node, the values of the others are determined. \n\nBut how to find that factor?\n\nLet me think of the connected component as a graph where each edge defines a relation between two nodes. For example, if we have a chain of nodes u-v-w, and each edge has certain constraints. \n\nSuppose we start with u and assign it a value. Then, v's value is determined by the first edge. Then, w's value is determined by the second edge. \n\nBut what if there's a cycle? For example, u-v-w-u. In that case, the assignments must be consistent around the cycle. \n\nThis suggests that the graph must be bipartitioned in some way, or that the product of the ratios around any cycle must be 1. \n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each edge, the ratio between a_u and a_v is x/y or y/x, depending on the direction. \n\nBut since x * y = k, and x and y are coprime, the ratio between a_u and a_v is x/y or y/x. \n\nBut since x * y = k, the product of the ratios around a cycle must be 1. \n\nHowever, this seems complex. \n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nFor each edge, we can represent it as a constraint between two nodes. Let me think of the following variables for each node: for each node u, its value is a_u. \n\nFor each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, the following must hold:\n\na_u = g * x \n\na_v = g * y \n\nx * y = l/g \n\ngcd(x, y) = 1 \n\nSo, for each edge, the product of x and y is fixed. \n\nNow, since x and y are coprime, the values of x and y are uniquely determined by the edge's parameters. \n\nWait, no. For example, if k = l/g = 6, then (x,y) can be (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). But only those pairs where x and y are coprime. \n\nSo, for each edge, there are multiple possible pairs (x, y). \n\nBut how to choose between them? \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a graph where each edge has a weight that represents the ratio between the two nodes. However, since there are multiple possible choices for the ratio, it's unclear. \n\nBut perhaps for each edge, we can choose the ratio between a_u and a_v as k / a_v = a_u / g. \n\nWait, this is getting too abstract. \n\nLet me think differently. Let's consider that for each edge, the product of a_u and a_v is fixed as g*l. So, a_u * a_v = g*l. \n\nThis is a crucial equation. \n\nSo, during the traversal, if I have a_u, I can compute a_v as (g*l)/a_u. \n\nBut this requires that a_u divides g*l. \n\nSo, during the traversal, when I assign a value to a node, I must ensure that for each adjacent edge, the value of the adjacent node computed as (g*l)/a_u is an integer. \n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nThis suggests that during the traversal, we need to choose the initial value of the starting node such that for all edges connected to it, a_u divides g*l. \n\nBut how to find such an initial value? \n\nThe initial value must be a divisor of g*l for every edge connected to the starting node. \n\nBut how can we find such a value?\n\nThis seems like a big problem. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the starting node u is connected to an edge with GCD g1 and LCM l1. Another edge with GCD g2 and LCM l2. \n\nThe initial value of u must be a divisor of g1*l1 and also a divisor of g2*l2. \n\nBut how to find such a value?\n\nBut the initial value must also be a multiple of the base value (the LCM of the GCDs of its edges). \n\nSo, the initial value must be a common multiple of the base and a common divisor of all g_i*l_i for the edges connected to u. \n\nThis seems very restrictive. \n\nPerhaps this suggests that the problem can be solved only if the base value divides all g_i*l_i for the edges connected to u. \n\nBut how to verify that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the base value is the LCM of the GCDs of the edges connected to u. Let's denote this as B. \n\nFor the initial value, it must be a multiple of B. Let's say the initial value is B * k. \n\nThen, for each edge connected to u with GCD g and LCM l, we have:\n\na_u = B * k \n\nmust divide g * l. \n\nBut B is the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to u. So, for each edge, g divides B. \n\nSo, B = LCM(g1, g2, ...) for all edges connected to u. \n\nSince g divides B, then g*l is divisible by g, so it's l multiplied by g. \n\nBut B*k divides g*l? \n\nNot sure. \n\nThis seems too vague. \n\nMaybe I should think of the following approach:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   Pick a starting node. \n\n   Assign it a value of g * x, where g is the GCD of the first edge connected to it, and x is some value that ensures compatibility with the rest of the edges. \n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think about the following. For each edge, the product of a_u and a_v is fixed as g*l. So, during the traversal, if I have a_u, I can compute a_v as (g*l)/a_u. \n\nBut for this to be valid, a_u must divide g*l. \n\nSo, during the traversal, when I assign a value to a node, I must ensure that for each adjacent edge, the computed a_v is an integer. \n\nBut how to choose the initial value of the starting node so that this is true for all edges connected to it?\n\nMaybe the initial value for the starting node can be set to g * something. \n\nWait, for example, for the first edge connected to the starting node, say with GCD g and LCM l. \n\nLet me assume that the starting node's value is g * x. Then, for this edge, the adjacent node's value would be (g*l) / (g*x) = l/x. \n\nBut since the adjacent node's value must be a multiple of its own base (the LCM of the GCDs of its edges), this may impose constraints on x. \n\nBut how to choose x?\n\nThis feels like a dead end. \n\nMaybe I should look for some references or similar problems. \n\nWait, this problem resembles the problem of checking if a graph can be assigned values such that for each edge, the product of the two nodes is equal to some fixed value. This is similar to a bipartition problem, where the product of values along edges must be fixed. \n\nIn such cases, the graph must be bipartite, and the product of the values around any cycle must be 1. \n\nBut how to apply this here?\n\nLet me think of the following. For each edge",
