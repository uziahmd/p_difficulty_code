He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign each of these input strings as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings in order. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that fits the assignments.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I think the main idea is to find the correct string s, then check which of the input strings are prefixes and suffixes of s. But since there might be multiple possible s's, how do we choose?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, it's sufficient to output any valid assignment. So maybe we can find the correct s by checking which of the possible candidates can be formed based on the input strings.\n\nWait, but how do we find s? Well, the string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. So for example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be a prefix of s. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be a suffix of s. Also, for the full string s, the prefixes and suffixes of various lengths must be present in the input.\n\nBut here's an idea: the actual string s can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap in some way. Because s is of length n, the longest prefix (n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix (n-1) is s[1..n-1]. So combining these two, the first n-1 characters and the last n-1 characters, their overlapping part must be consistent.\n\nWait, but how can we find s? Let's think: the correct s must have the longest prefix (say, p) and the longest suffix (say, s). Then, the first n-1 characters of s is p, and the last n-1 characters is s. So the entire string s would be p[0] followed by s[1...n-1], because the first n-1 characters are p, and the last n-1 are s. So the first character of p is the first character of s, and the last character of s is the last character of s. Therefore, the entire string s would be p concatenated with the last character of s. Wait, but p is of length n-1. So the last character of s is the last character of the longest suffix. So combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix, the full string would be p + (last character of the longest suffix), but only if the first n-1 characters of the longest suffix match the last n-1 characters of the prefix. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take the example given. In the first sample input, the correct s is \"ababa\". The longest prefix (length 4) is \"abab\" and the longest suffix (length 4) is \"baba\". So the full string is ababa. How does that fit? The longest prefix is \"abab\", which is the first four letters. The longest suffix is \"baba\", which is the last four letters. So the full string is the first four letters (abab) plus the fifth letter (a). But the last four letters are baba. So the fifth letter is a, and the fourth character is b. So the fourth character is the last character of the prefix (abab's last character is b), and the fifth character is a. The suffix (baba) starts with the second character of the string. So the full string is s = prefix (length n-1) + [last character of suffix].\n\nWait, perhaps the full string can be determined by taking the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1). Since the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1], so combining them, the full string s is (longest prefix)[0..n-2] + (longest suffix)[n-2], because the longest suffix starts at position 1. Wait, the longest suffix is s[1..n-1], which is of length n-1. The first character of the suffix is s[1], and the last is s[n-1]. So the full string s is s[0] + s[1..n-1] = s[0] + longest suffix. But the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], which is the first n-1 characters. So the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first n-1 characters of the longest suffix is s[1..n-2], which is the same as the last n-2 characters of the longest prefix. So the longest prefix and the longest suffix must agree on the overlapping part. Therefore, if we take the longest prefix and the longest suffix, they must have a common part. \n\nSo, for example, the longest prefix is P, the longest suffix is S. Then, the first n-2 characters of S must be equal to the last n-2 characters of P. Then, the full string s is P concatenated with the last character of S. Because the first n-1 characters are P, and the last n-1 characters are S, which is the last n-1 characters of s. So the full string is P's first n-1 characters plus the last character of S. \n\nSo, the idea is: for the given input, find the two strings of length n-1. One is a prefix, the other is a suffix. Then, check if they can be combined into a string s. Then, once s is determined, check if all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s. If so, then assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to find which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that among the input strings, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B. One of them is a prefix of s, the other is a suffix. So, the correct s must be formed by combining A and B in such a way that the overlapping part matches. For example, if A is the prefix (so s starts with A), and B is the suffix (so s ends with B), then the first n-1 characters of s is A, and the last n-1 characters is B. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of B must be equal to the last n-2 characters of A. Because the first n-2 characters of B are the characters from position 1 to n-2 of s, which is also the last n-2 characters of A (since A is the first n-1 characters of s).\n\nSo, for A and B, check if the first n-2 characters of B equals the last n-2 characters of A. If yes, then the full string is A + last character of B. Alternatively, if we swap A and B, then check if the first n-2 characters of A equals the last n-2 characters of B, then the full string is B + last character of A. \n\nOnce we find such a combination, then we can get the candidate string s. Then, we can check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. If that is true, then we can proceed to assign the labels.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all the input strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. Try both possibilities: one as prefix (A) and the other as suffix (B), and check if their overlapping parts match. If they do, then form the candidate string s = A + B[-1], and check if all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\n3. Once we find such an s, then we can assign the labels for each input string (whether it's a prefix or suffix of s).\n\nBut how do I check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s? Well, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with it) or a suffix (s ends with it). Since the problem says that the input strings are indeed prefixes and suffixes of some s, but we need to find which ones are which.\n\nBut once we have s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. However, since each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of s, but there could be cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the second sample input, the string is \"aaa\", so all the input strings (like \"a\", \"aa\", etc.) are both prefixes and suffixes. But in that case, the problem allows us to assign them as either P or S, as long as the total counts are correct (n-1 P's and n-1 S's, but total 2n-2 entries). Wait, no. The output must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's, since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. Because for each length from 1 to n-1, there are two strings (one prefix and one suffix). So the output must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\nSo, once we have s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S. However, there could be cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. But since the problem says that the input strings are all the prefixes and suffixes of some s, then for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. But when there's overlap, like a string that is both, we can choose either P or S, but we have to make sure that the total number of P and S is correct.\n\nBut how to handle that? Well, once we have s, we can generate all possible prefixes and suffixes of s. For each input string, it must be present in either the prefixes or the suffixes. So for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then it's a prefix. If not, then it's a suffix. But what if it's both? Then we can choose either. However, the problem requires that the number of P and S is equal to n-1 each. So perhaps for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix. If it's a prefix, then assign P, else assign S. But in that case, we need to ensure that exactly n-1 of them are P's and the rest are S's. However, since the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s, then the count should be correct. Because for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings (one prefix and one suffix). So for each input string, exactly one of the options (prefix or suffix) is correct. So for example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix of s, but it's supposed to be counted as a prefix and a suffix. However, since the input has exactly two strings per length, and for that length, one is a prefix and one is a suffix. So, for example, in the case where a string is both, but there's another string of same length which is also both, but that's impossible. Because for a given length l, there's exactly two strings. One is a prefix and one is a suffix. So for example, if the string is of length l, then one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. So for the same length, one is a prefix and one is a suffix. So even if both are prefixes and suffixes of s, but for the input, one is assigned as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\nSo, in practice, for each input string, if it is a prefix of s, then it must be a prefix (since the input includes all prefixes and suffixes). But how to ensure that the count is correct? Well, since the input is guaranteed to be correct, once we find s, the number of prefixes and suffixes in the input will be exactly n-1 each. So, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix of s. Then, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. And this will give exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Find the candidate s by checking the two strings of length n-1.\n\nOnce we have s, then for each input string, check if it's a prefix of s. Assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to find s? Let's think again. For the two strings of length n-1, we need to find which one is the prefix and which is the suffix. For example, in the first sample input, the two strings of length 4 are \"abab\" and \"baba\". Let's check if they can be combined. The first n-2 characters of the suffix (baba) is \"bab\", and the last n-2 characters of the prefix (abab) is \"bab\". So yes. So the full string would be abab + last character of suffix (a) → ababa. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor the two strings of length n-1, let's call them A and B. Check if A's last n-2 characters equals B's first n-2 characters. If so, then s is A + B[-1]. Else, check if B's last n-2 characters equals A's first n-2 characters. If so, then s is B + A[-1]. If neither is possible, then something's wrong. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there must be a way.\n\nSo, in code, first, collect all the input strings. Then, find the two strings of length n-1. Then try the two possibilities. Once we find the correct s, then proceed to assign P/S.\n\nOnce we have s, for each of the input strings, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S. Because the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s, so for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix. So this approach should work.\n\nNow, the problem is how to find the two strings of length n-1. Let's see. For example, in the input, the 2n-2 strings include exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1. So for each length l in 1..n-1, there are two strings. So for l = n-1, there are two strings. So in code, we can collect all the input strings, group them by their lengths, and then find the two strings of length n-1.\n\nOnce we have those two, we can proceed to check which one is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 strings. Let's store them as a list, say 'strings'.\n\nThen, group the strings by their lengths. For example, for each l in 1..n-1, there are two strings. So for l = n-1, get those two.\n\nOnce we have the two strings, A and B, we need to check which combination forms a valid s.\n\nOnce s is determined, then for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. Assign 'P' if yes, else 'S'.\n\nBut how to check if a string is a prefix of s? For example, for a string t, check if s starts with t. Similarly for suffix: check if s ends with t.\n\nSo, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut what if a string is both a prefix and a suffix? Like, in the second sample input, where the string is \"aaa\". For example, the string \"a\" is a prefix and a suffix. But in that case, the input has two strings of length 1: \"a\" and \"a\". So for each of them, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But since they are the same, when checking, both would be considered as prefixes. But how to assign P and S in that case?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for each input string, it must be a prefix or a suffix of s. However, when there are duplicates, the code may assign both as P, leading to more than n-1 P's. But that's not possible, because the input has exactly two strings per length, and for each length, one is a prefix and one is a suffix. So, for example, for the two \"a\" strings of length 1, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. But since they are the same, when checking against s, they are both prefixes. So how to distinguish between them?\n\nAh, but in that case, the code would assign both as P, leading to more than n-1 P's. Which would be invalid. So this approach would fail in that case.\n\nWait, but how can that happen? Because for the input, the two strings are the same. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for example, in the second sample input, the input is:\n\nn=3\n\ninput strings are a, aa, aa, a. So the two strings of length 1 are a and a. The two strings of length 2 are aa and aa. The correct s is \"aaa\". For the two \"a\" strings, they are both prefixes and suffixes. But the correct assignment would have one as P and the other as S. However, when checking, both would be considered as prefixes. So how to decide which to assign P and which S?\n\nIn this case, the code would generate for each input string a 'P' if it's a prefix. So for the two 'a's, they would both be marked as P. Then, the total number of P's would be 2 (for the two 'a's) plus 2 (the two 'aa's) which are also prefixes. But for n=3, the number of P's should be n-1=2. But in this case, there are 4 P's. That's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For n=3, the correct s is \"aaa\". The prefixes are of lengths 1, 2. The prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\". The suffixes are of lengths 1, 2. The suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". So the input strings are:\n\na (prefix), a (suffix), aa (prefix), aa (suffix). So the input has two of each. So when processing the input, each of the four strings must be assigned as P or S. But in the code approach above, for each string, if it is a prefix, assign P. But for the two 'a's, they are prefixes. So both would be assigned P. Similarly, the two 'aa's would be assigned P. Which would result in four P's, which is incorrect. But the required number of P's is n-1 = 2. So this approach would not work.\n\nSo, this suggests that the initial approach is flawed.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nThe problem is that the code approach assigns all prefixes as P and suffixes as S, but when a string is both a prefix and a suffix, how to decide which to assign.\n\nBut the problem says that for each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix. But in this case, the same string can be both. However, the input has exactly two strings for each length. For each length l, exactly one of them is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So, for example, in the case of two 'a's (length 1), one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But since they are the same string, when checking if it's a prefix, both would return true. So the code would assign both as P, which would lead to more than n-1 P's. Which is invalid.\n\nSo how can we resolve this?\n\nWe need to find, for each input string, whether it's a prefix or a suffix of s. But when a string is both, we need to assign it as either P or S, but ensuring that for each length, exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, the problem is that the code approach of checking whether the string is a prefix of s and assigning P otherwise S would not account for the fact that for a given length, exactly one of the two strings must be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach should be:\n\nOnce s is known, for each length l in 1 to n-1, collect the two input strings of that length. Then, for each of them, check which one is a prefix of s (there should be exactly one, since the input is valid), and assign that as P, the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for each length l, we can check which of the two input strings is a prefix of s. Assign that as P, and the other as S.\n\nThis way, for each length l, exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S. Which ensures the correct counts.\n\nSo, the revised approach is:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each length l in 1..n-1:\n\n   collect the two input strings of that length.\n\n   for each of the two strings, check if it is a prefix of s. Exactly one of them will be a prefix (since the input is valid). Assign that as P, the other as S.\n\nBut how to check which of the two strings is the prefix?\n\nFor example, in the second sample input, for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a'. Both are prefixes of s (which is 'aaa'). So how to decide which to assign as P and which as S?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But in this case, both are prefixes. So that contradicts the problem statement. Wait, no. Because the input is guaranteed to be valid. So how can that be?\n\nAh, the problem statement says that the input strings are all the prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So for example, for the string 'aaa', the prefixes of length 1 is 'a', and the suffixes of length 1 is 'a'. So the input for l=1 would have two 'a's. So for that case, the two strings are the same. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So in this case, the two strings are the same, but they are both a prefix and a suffix. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct, and for the given input, there exists at least one string s that is consistent with the assignment.\n\nIn this case, for the two strings of length 1, one must be assigned as P and the other as S. But since they are the same, it's arbitrary. So the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S, even though they are the same.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each length l, collect the two strings. For each pair, determine which one is a prefix (if any) and which is a suffix. But if both are prefixes, then one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. How?\n\nBut since the input is valid, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix of s and the other is a suffix of s. So in the case where both are prefixes, then the other must be a suffix. But how can that be? Because for the same length l, a string can't be both a prefix and a suffix unless the entire string is made of the same characters. So, for example, in the case of s = 'aaa', the string 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix. But according to the input, there are two strings of length 1. So one of them is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. But how can you tell which is which?\n\nThe answer is that the code can choose arbitrarily. For example, for the two 'a's of length 1, assign one as P and the other as S. The problem says that any valid assignment is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code can process for each length l, the two strings. For each of the two strings, check if it is a prefix of s. If exactly one is a prefix, assign that as P and the other as S. If both are prefixes (which can only happen if the two strings are the same and are a prefix and suffix), then assign one as P and the other as S. How to decide which?\n\nWell, in that case, perhaps we can check which one is a suffix. But since they are the same, they are both suffixes as well. So, for example, if both are prefixes and suffixes, then we can assign one as P and the other as S. How to choose which? It doesn't matter, as the problem allows any valid assignment.\n\nSo, in code, for each length l, collect the two strings. Then, for each of the two strings, check if it's a prefix of s. If exactly one is, assign that as P, the other as S. If both are, then assign one as P and the other as S. How to choose which? Well, perhaps just pick the first one as P and the second as S, or vice versa. But how to track which is which in the input list.\n\nBut how to map the original input order. Because the code must produce a string of 'P' and 'S' in the same order as the input strings.\n\nSo, the code needs to process each input string, and for each, determine if it's a prefix or suffix of s. However, for cases where the same string appears twice (like the 'a's in the second sample), we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that? Because when checking for a particular input string, we can't know if it's the first or second occurrence of that string. So, the approach of checking for each length l, the two strings, and for each, assign P or S based on which is a prefix, may be better.\n\nSo, here's the revised plan:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each length l in 1 to n-1:\n\n   collect the two input strings of that length.\n\n   for each of the two strings, check if it's a prefix of s. Let's say count how many are prefixes.\n\n   if exactly one is a prefix, assign that one as P, the other as S.\n\n   if both are prefixes (which implies they are the same string), assign one as P and the other as S. How? Well, perhaps check if the string is also a suffix. Since for the input, one must be a suffix. So for the two strings, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But since they are the same, both are prefixes and suffixes. So, we can assign one as P and the other as S. How to choose? For example, in the input, the first occurrence is assigned as P, the second as S.\n\nBut how to track which input strings belong to which length and which are the first or second in the group.\n\nSo, the code needs to process the input strings grouped by their lengths. For each group (each length), process the two strings and assign their labels (P/S) based on whether they are prefixes or suffixes. Then, for each input string, we need to know its label.\n\nBut how to track which input strings belong to which group. For example, during processing, the code can create a list of tuples containing (original index, string, length), then group by length. Then, for each group, process the two strings and assign their labels.\n\nOnce the labels are determined for each string, we can build the output string in the order of the original input.\n\nSo, here's the step-by-step plan for code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings, storing them along with their original indices.\n\nGroup them by length. For each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings.\n\nOnce we find the candidate s, for each length l, process the two strings of that length:\n\n   for each of the two strings, check if it is a prefix of s.\n\n   if exactly one is a prefix, assign that one as P, the other as S.\n\n   if both are prefixes (i.e., same string), then assign one as P and the other as S. How? Well, in this case, since they are the same, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. But how to determine which? Well, since the input is valid, there must be exactly one of them that is a prefix (but both are). So we can arbitrarily assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to choose which one? For example, for the two strings in the group, assign the first one as P and the second as S. But how to know which is first and second in the group.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each group (l, [str1, str2]):\n\n   check if str1 is a prefix of s → is_p1.\n\n   check if str2 is a prefix of s → is_p2.\n\n   if is_p1 and not is_p2 → assign P to str1, S to str2.\n\n   if not is_p1 and is_p2 → assign P to str2, S to str1.\n\n   else:\n\n      if is_p1 and is_p2:\n\n         assign P to str1, S to str2 (or vice versa)\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nOnce that is done, for each input string, we can assign its label.\n\nOnce all labels are determined, output the labels in the order of the original input.\n\nSo, the key is to find s correctly.\n\nNow, the problem is how to find s. Let's think again.\n\nFor the two strings of length n-1, A and B.\n\nWe need to find which is the prefix and which is the suffix. So, the correct s is formed by combining the prefix and the suffix. So, for example, if A is the prefix, then the first n-1 characters of s are A. The suffix B is the last n-1 characters of s. So, the first character of B must be the second character of A, and so on. So, the overlapping part between A and B must be the same.\n\nSo, the condition is that A[1:] == B[:-1], or B[1:] == A[:-1], depending on which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, the two strings of length 4 are \"abab\" and \"baba\".\n\nCheck if A is prefix, B is suffix: A[1:] is \"bab\", B[:-1] is \"bab\" → yes. So s is A + B[-1] → \"abab\" + \"a\" → \"ababa\".\n\nAlternatively, if we assume B is prefix and A is suffix: check if B[1:] == A[:-1]. B is \"baba\", B[1:] is \"aba\". A[:-1] is \"aba\" (since A is \"abab\"). So yes. Then s would be B + A[-1] → \"baba\" + \"b\" → \"babab\". But that string would have the longest prefix of length 4 as \"baba\" and longest suffix of length 4 as \"abab\". But then, the input strings must be prefixes and suffixes of this string. However, the problem says that the input is valid for some s. But in the first sample input, the correct s is \"ababa\". So why would this approach generate a different s?\n\nAh, but in that case, the input strings may not be compatible with \"babab\". So the code must find which of the two possibilities for s is compatible with all the input strings.\n\nSo, the code must generate both possibilities for s, and check which one is compatible with all input strings.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for the two possibilities, only one will be valid.\n\nBut how to find which one is correct.\n\nSo, the code needs to generate both possibilities for s, and check which one is valid (i.e., all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s). Once that is found, proceed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCollect the two strings of length n-1, say A and B.\n\nGenerate candidate s1 = A + B[-1], if A[1:] == B[:-1].\n\nGenerate candidate s2 = B + A[-1], if B[1:] == A[:-1].\n\nCheck which of these candidates is valid. That is, for all input strings, they are either a prefix or a suffix of the candidate s.\n\nOnce the correct s is found, proceed to assign labels.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor the two strings A and B of length n-1:\n\n   possible_candidates = []\n\n   if A[1:] == B[:-1]:\n\n       possible_candidates.append(A + B[-1])\n\n   if B[1:] == A[:-1]:\n\n       possible_candidates.append(B + A[-1])\n\n   for candidate in possible_candidates:\n\n       check if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of candidate.\n\n       if yes, then use this candidate as s.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate, proceed.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of candidate s.\n\nBut since the problem says that the input is valid, there must be exactly one candidate that satisfies this. But perhaps there are two candidates. For example, if both possibilities for s are valid. But in that case, the code can choose any.\n\nSo, the code can generate the possible candidates, check which one is valid, and proceed.\n\nOnce s is determined, proceed with the grouping by length and assigning labels.\n\nNow, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, putting all this together in Python.\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read 2n-2 lines. Let's read them into a list called 'strings'.\n\nThen, group the strings by their lengths. For example, using a dictionary, where the keys are the lengths, and the values are lists of strings for that length.\n\nThen, find the two strings of length n-1. Let's say, for example, len_n_minus_1 = n-1. Then, the list is group[len_n_minus_1], which has two elements, A and B.\n\nThen, generate possible candidates for s.\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined, check for all input strings whether they are a prefix or suffix of s. But how to do that?\n\nBut for the code to find the correct candidate s, it's necessary to check all input strings against it.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s or a suffix of s. If for all input strings, at least one of those is true, then the candidate is valid.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate, proceed.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\ndef is_valid(s, input_strings):\n\n    for t in input_strings:\n\n        if not (s.startswith(t) or s.endswith(t)):\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nOnce the candidate s is generated, call this function. If returns True, then proceed.\n\nOnce the correct s is found, proceed to assign labels.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nOnce s is found, we need to process all input strings, grouped by their lengths, and assign P or S.\n\nBut how to track which input strings belong to which group and their original positions.\n\nSo, perhaps, during the initial processing, we can create a list of tuples (original_index, string, length). Then, group them by length. Then, for each group, process the two strings, and assign their labels.\n\nBut to build the output, we need to assign for each original input string a 'P' or 'S'.\n\nSo, the code can create a list of labels, with the same order as the input strings. Initially, all are empty. Then, for each group (length l), process the two strings, and for each, assign 'P' or 'S' based on whether it's a prefix of s, and update the labels accordingly.\n\nBut how to find which input strings are in the group.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor idx, s in enumerate(strings):\n\n    groups[len(s)].append( (idx, s) )\n\nThen, for each length l in groups:\n\n   process the two (idx, s) pairs.\n\nBut in the code, the strings are stored in the original order. So, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, for each group (l, [(idx1, s1), (idx2, s2)]):\n\n   check if s1 is a prefix of s.\n\n   check if s2 is a prefix of s.\n\n   if exactly one is a prefix, assign P to that one and S to the other.\n\n   else:\n\n       if both are prefixes, then assign P to one and S to the other. How?\n\n       For example, assign P to the first in the group and S to the second.\n\nOnce that is done, the code can build the output string.\n\nSo, in code:\n\noutput = [''] * len(strings)\n\nfor l in groups:\n\n    if l == n-1:\n\n        continue  #",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but not their order. Our task is to assign each string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with this assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate String `s`**: \n   - The longest improper prefix and suffix (of length `n-1`) can be combined to form the candidate string `s`. We check two possible combinations of these longest strings to determine the correct `s`.\n\n2. **Validate Candidate String**:\n   - Once a candidate string `s` is generated, we verify if all given input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n\n3. **Assign Labels**:\n   - For each input string, determine if it is a prefix or suffix of the validated candidate string `s`. This ensures that the labels (P/S) are correctly assigned while maintaining the required counts of prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Group strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for idx, s in enumerate(strings):\n        groups[len(s)].append((idx, s))\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for key in groups:\n        if key == len_n_minus_1:\n            lst = groups[key]\n            A = lst[0][1]\n            B = lst[1][1]\n            # Check if A can be prefix and B suffix\n            if A[1:] == B[:-1]:\n                s_candidate = A + B[-1]\n                candidates.append(s_candidate)\n            # Check if B can be prefix and A suffix\n            if B[1:] == A[:-1]:\n                s_candidate = B + A[-1]\n                candidates.append(s_candidate)\n    \n    # Now find which candidate is valid\n    valid_s = None\n    for candidate in candidates:\n        valid = True\n        for s_str in strings:\n            if not (candidate.startswith(s_str) or candidate.endswith(s_str)):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            valid_s = candidate\n            break\n    \n    # Now assign P/S based on valid_s\n    output = [''] * len(strings)\n    \n    # Process each group\n    for l in groups:\n        if l == len_n_minus_1:\n            continue  # handled in candidate\n        group = groups[l]\n        # For each pair in group, determine P/S\n        for i in range(0, len(group), 2):\n            idx1, s1 = group[i]\n            idx2, s2 = group[i+1]\n            # Check which is prefix\n            p1 = valid_s.startswith(s1)\n            p2 = valid_s.startswith(s2)\n            if p1 and not p2:\n                output[idx1] = 'P'\n                output[idx2] = 'S'\n            elif not p1 and p2:\n                output[idx1] = 'S'\n                output[idx2] = 'P'\n            else:\n                # Both are prefix or both are not\n                # Check if they are prefix\n                if p1:\n                    output[idx1] = 'P'\n                    output[idx2] = 'S'\n                else:\n                    # Check if they are suffix\n                    s1_suffix = valid_s.endswith(s1)\n                    s2_suffix = valid_s.endswith(s2)\n                    if s1_suffix and not s2_suffix:\n                        output[idx1] = 'S'\n                        output[idx2] = 'P'\n                    elif not s1_suffix and s2_suffix:\n                        output[idx1] = 'P'\n                        output[idx2] = 'S'\n                    else:\n                        # both are suffix or both are neither?
