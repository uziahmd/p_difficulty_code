Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is called \"Feed the Golorp,\" and the task is to determine the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies some conditions based on the golorp's name. If it's impossible, output 'false'. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the input represents. The input is a single string that's the name of the golorp. From the examples given, it looks like the name has some structure involving operators and symbols. For example, the first sample input is something like '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' and the output is '0010'. \n\nHmm, maybe the name encodes some kind of equation or constraints that the variables must satisfy. The problem mentions that variables are consumed by the golorp, and each variable takes a value from 0-9. Also, the golorp chooses the lex smallest valid sequence. \n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the name is structured in a way that represents operations between variables, and the output is the sequence of digits that satisfies those operations. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the name is similar to Befunge. Befunge is a 2D programming language where the instruction pointer moves around the grid. However, I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Alternatively, maybe the name is a representation of some kind of mathematical expression or constraints.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nFirst sample input: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' outputs '0010'. Let's think about the structure. Maybe the part inside the parentheses represents some operations, and the colon and arrows indicate some direction or constraints. For example, the colon might separate different parts of the expression, and the arrows could indicate the order of operations or the direction in which variables are processed.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the name is structured as a series of constraints that the variables must satisfy. For instance, the part after the colon might represent a sequence of operations that must be satisfied by the variables. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is a representation of a mathematical equation. For example, the first sample input may have a structure like ?(...) : ...>... which could be interpreted as an equation where the left side is some expression involving variables, and the right side is another expression. The variables are the digits in the output sequence, and we need to find values that make the expressions equal.\n\nBut how do I parse the name into such equations? Let's think about the sample input. For example, the first sample's input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' \n\nBreaking it down: The '?' might indicate that there's a variable here. The part inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__'—maybe these are operations between variables. The colon then separates the left part from the right. Then the part after the colon is '___>__'. The '>' might indicate an operation or comparison. \n\nAlternatively, considering that Befunge uses a stack-based approach, maybe the name is a Befunge program, and the variables are the numbers that are pushed onto the stack. But how would that relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is a representation of a mathematical expression with certain operators and variables. The problem says that variables can take values from 0-9. The output is the sequence of digits that when substituted into the expression, satisfy some condition. But what condition?\n\nAnother angle: the problem states that the golorp's daily diet is defined by its name. The jaws determine the number of variables needed. So the number of variables is determined by the jaws. For example, if the jaws require three variables, then the output must be a sequence of three digits.\n\nBut how to determine the number of variables? Looking at the first sample input, the output is four digits. Let's look at the first sample input again: the part inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__'—maybe the number of underscores represents the number of variables. Let's count the underscores. For the first input, inside the parentheses, the first part is '_-_/___*__'. Let's see:\n\nThe underscores in the first part: the first part is '_', then '-', then '/', then '___', then '*', then '__'. So the underscores are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores? Or perhaps each '_' represents a variable. But maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in certain parts of the name.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for the first sample: '0010' has four digits. Let's see the first sample input again: the part after the colon is '___>__'. Maybe the number of underscores before the '>' is the number of variables. In that case, three underscores would imply three variables, but the output is four digits. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the entire name. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample outputs. For example, the third sample input has a long string and outputs '0250341' which is seven digits. Let me count the underscores in that input. Well, the input is '?(...):-...'. The part inside the parentheses is a long sequence of underscores and operators. Maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the first part (the part inside the parentheses). For example, in the first sample, inside the parentheses: '_-_/___*__' — the underscores are 1, then 3, then 2. Total underscores would be 1+3+2=6. But the output is four digits. That doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For example, the first sample's part after colon is '___>__'. The underscores before '>' are three, and after are two. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the entire name. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is structured as a series of equations, and the variables are the digits in the output. For example, the first sample's name might represent an equation where the left side is some expression involving variables, and the right side is another expression. The output is the sequence of variables that makes the left equal to the right.\n\nBut how to parse the name into such equations?\n\nLet's think about the sample input and output. The first sample's output is '0010'. Let's say that the variables are four digits. Let's suppose that the name is an equation that requires the sum of some variables to be equal to others. For example, maybe the first part represents a mathematical expression that evaluates to a certain value, and the second part represents another expression. \n\nAlternatively, considering the sample input's first example, the part inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__'. Maybe this is an expression involving variables. For example, if we have variables a, b, c, d, etc., then the expression would be (a - b) / (c * d). But how does that relate to the rest of the name?\n\nThe colon then might separate the left and right parts. The part after the colon is '___>__'. Maybe this indicates that the left expression should be greater than the right expression. But the sample output is '0010', which would be a=0, b=0, c=1, d=0. Let's compute (a - b) / (c * d). Wait, but division by zero would be a problem here. Oh, but c is 1, d is 0. So denominator is 1*0=0. Division by zero is invalid. That can't be right. So maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name represents a Befunge program, and the variables are the numbers that are pushed onto the stack. For example, in Befunge, the program is executed as a grid, and the instruction pointer moves around. But I don't know enough about Befunge to make this connection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is a regular expression or pattern that must be matched by the sequence of digits. But that seems unlikely given the examples.\n\nAnother thought: the problem says that variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws. The number of variables necessary is determined by the shape of the jaws. So the jaws determine how many variables there are. So the first step is to determine how many variables there are. How?\n\nLooking at the sample input for the first example, the output is four digits. Let's look at the input again: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' \n\nThe question mark might indicate that the variable is being introduced. The part inside the parentheses could be the jaws. For example, the number of underscores in the jaws determines the number of variables. Let's count the underscores in the part inside the parentheses. \n\nIn the first sample, inside the parentheses: '_-_/___*__' — the underscores are:\n\n- The first part is '_' (1)\n- Then '-', then '/', then '___' (3), then '*', then '__' (2). So total underscores: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. But the output is four digits. That doesn't match. So that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For example, the first sample's part after colon is '___>__'. The underscores before '>' are three, and after are two. But again, the output is four digits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the entire name. For example, the first sample's input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' Let's count the underscores:\n\nInside the parentheses: '_-_/___*__' has 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores.\n\nThen after the colon, '___>__' has 3 + 2 = 5 underscores.\n\nTotal underscores: 6 + 5 = 11. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part that comes after the colon and before the arrow. For example, in the first sample, the part after colon is '___>__', so the underscores before the '>' are three. But output is four digits. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for patterns in the sample inputs and outputs.\n\nSample 1: Input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' Output is '0010' (four digits).\n\nSample 2: Input is '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.' Output is 'false'.\n\nSample 3: Input is a long string, output is '0250341' (seven digits).\n\nSample 4: Input is '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.' Output is '0101' (four digits).\n\nLooking at sample 4's input: the part inside the parentheses is '__+___+__-___' — underscores count: 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10 underscores. But output is four digits. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part inside the parentheses. For sample 4, inside the parentheses is '__+___+__-___' — the underscores are grouped as follows: two, three, two, three. But the output is four digits. So maybe the number of variables is the number of groups of underscores. For example, in the first sample, inside the parentheses, the underscores are grouped into three groups: 1, 3, 2. So three groups? But output is four digits. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For sample 4, after colon is '___>__'. Three underscores before >, two after. But output is four digits. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon, but including the ones after the arrow. Like, in sample 4's case, the part after the colon is '___>__' — three underscores before >, two after. So total of 3 + 2 = 5 underscores. But output is four digits. Not matching.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's think about the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says that the golorp's name defines its diet. Variables consumed can take values from 0-9. The output is the lex smallest sequence of variable values that satisfies the constraints. \n\nThe key is to find out what constraints the name imposes. Since the examples are given, maybe there's a pattern in the way the names are structured.\n\nLooking at the first sample input: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' \n\nMaybe the name is a representation of an equation where the left side is the expression inside the parentheses, and the right side is the part after the colon. The colon separates the two sides. The arrows might indicate some kind of operation. For example, the part after the colon is '___>__' which could mean that the left side is greater than the right side. \n\nSo, for example, the left side is an expression involving variables, and the right side is another expression. The variables are the digits in the output sequence. The output is the lex smallest sequence that makes the left expression greater than the right.\n\nBut how to parse the expressions?\n\nLet's take the first sample. The left expression is inside the parentheses: '_-_/___*__'. Let's assume that each underscore represents a variable. For example, if there are four variables, then the underscores are grouped as follows. Wait, but how to determine the number of variables?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the entire name. For example, the first sample has 6 underscores in the parentheses and 5 in the other parts. But that would be 11 variables, which is more than the output length of 4. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is a Befunge-like program, and the variables are the numbers that are pushed onto the stack. The program is executed, and the variables are the digits in the output. The program must execute without errors, and the output is the lex smallest sequence of digits that allows the program to run correctly.\n\nBut how to model that? Befunge programs are 2D, and the instruction pointer moves around. However, the name is a single string, not a grid. So perhaps the name is a linear representation of a Befunge program. For example, the '?' could be a command to read input, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the name is a series of instructions that manipulate a stack, and the variables are the numbers that are pushed onto the stack. The output sequence is the digits that are used as input to the program. But how to determine what the program expects?\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe I need to find a pattern between the input and output.\n\nLooking at the first sample input and output:\n\nOutput is '0010' — four digits. Let's imagine that the name has four variables. Then, the expressions in the name must evaluate to some condition that is satisfied by these digits.\n\nFor example, the first sample's name may involve four variables, and the output is the lex smallest sequence that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut how to model that condition? Let's think of the name as a series of operations. For example, the part inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__' — maybe this represents an expression like (a - b) / (c * d), and the part after the colon is '___>__' which could be (e - f) > g. But I'm not sure how the variables are mapped here.\n\nAlternatively, the name could be a series of operations that must be evaluated in a certain way. For example, the first sample's name could be interpreted as follows:\n\nThe part inside the parentheses is an expression that must be evaluated. The colon separates it from the direction of the arrow. The arrow indicates that the result of the expression must be greater than some other value.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rules of how to parse the name into these expressions, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother idea: since the problem is from a programming competition, perhaps the name is a regular expression or pattern that can be parsed into a specific format. For example, the name is structured as a series of tokens that define a mathematical equation or constraint.\n\nLooking at the samples, perhaps the name consists of a head and a body. The head starts with '?(' and ends with ')', and the body starts with ':-' and contains some operations.\n\nFor example, the first sample's head is '?(_-_/___*__)'. The body is ':-___>__.'.\n\nMaybe the head represents a function or expression, and the body represents a condition. The head is the left-hand side of an equation, and the body is the right-hand side.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact parsing rules, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample outputs, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the head (inside the parentheses). Let's take the first sample's head: '_-_/___*__' has 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores. But the output is four digits. So that doesn't fit. However, maybe the number of underscores in the head is the number of variables. But that doesn't match the sample.\n\nAnother sample: sample 4's input is '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.' The head is '__+___+__-___' which has 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10 underscores. Output is four digits. Still not matching.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is incorrect. Maybe I need to think about the problem differently. Let's re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the golorp's name is a program in some programming language, possibly Befunge. Variables are consumed by the golorp, which are values from 0-9. The name defines the diet. The output is the lex smallest sequence of variables that can be fed to the golorp. If it's impossible, output false.\n\nGiven that Befunge is a 2D esoteric programming language, perhaps the name is a Befunge program that uses the variables as input. The program must execute without errors, and the variables are the digits in the output sequence. The goal is to find the lex smallest sequence of digits that allows the program to run.\n\nBut how to model this? For example, Befunge programs use a stack, and commands like +, -, *, /, etc. The '?' command in Befunge is used for random direction, but perhaps in this problem it's used as a placeholder for input. \n\nBut how to parse the given string into a Befunge program and determine what input is required for it to run correctly. This seems complex, but perhaps the problem is simplified.\n\nAlternatively, the name may be a simplified version of Befunge instructions, where the variables are the digits in the output, and the program must be valid. For example, the '?' could be a command to push a variable onto the stack. The underscores may represent variables, and the operators are standard arithmetic operations.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the first sample input: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' \n\nIf this is a Befunge program, perhaps the '?' is a command to read a value from input (but in Befunge, it's usually the 'g' command for getting a character from the program, or 'i' for input). However, the rest of the string is unclear.\n\nAnother thought: the problem says that the name is guaranteed to be valid. So perhaps the name has a specific structure that can be parsed into a set of constraints. For example, the name may contain a series of operations that must be performed, and the variables are the digits in the output. \n\nLet's consider that the name is split into two parts by the ':-' delimiter. The part before is the expression that must be evaluated, and the part after is the direction or comparison.\n\nFor example, the first sample input is split into '?(_-_/___*__)' and '___>__.' \n\nMaybe the first part is an expression involving variables, and the second part is a comparison. For example, the expression must be greater than some other value. \n\nBut how to parse the expression into variables and operations? \n\nAssuming that each underscore represents a variable, and the operators are the symbols between them. For example, the first part '_-_/___*__' would be parsed as a series of variables and operations. Let's break it down:\n\nThe underscores are grouped with operators. Let's see:\n\n- _ - _ / _ _ _ * _ _ \n\nBut that's not clear. Alternatively, the expression could be a series of operations, where each underscore is a variable. For example, the expression could be (a - b) / (c * d), where a, b, c, d are variables. But how many variables are there? The underscores in the expression would be a, b, c, d, e, f, etc. But the first part has 1 + 3 + 2 underscores, totaling 6. So six variables? But the output is four digits. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the expression is parsed as a sequence of operations, with each operator acting on the previous variables. For example, the expression could be a sequence of operations like a - b / c * d, but that would depend on operator precedence. But again, without knowing how many variables there are, it's hard to say.\n\nMaybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the entire name. For example, the first sample has several underscores. Let's count:\n\nIn the first sample input: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nInside the parentheses: '_-_/___*__' → underscores: 1, 3, 2 → total 6.\n\nAfter the colon: '___>__' → underscores: 3 and 2 → total 5.\n\nTotal underscores: 6 + 5 = 11. But the output is four digits. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for hints from the sample outputs.\n\nLooking at sample 4: input is '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.' Output is '0101'.\n\nAssuming that the number of variables is four, the output has four digits. Let's see if the expression inside the parentheses can be parsed as four variables.\n\nThe expression inside the parentheses is '__+___+__-___'. Let's split this into parts. Assuming that each group of underscores is a variable. For example, two underscores, then '+', then three underscores, then '+', then two underscores, then '-', then three underscores. So that would be 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10 underscores. But that suggests 4 variables, each represented by a group of underscores. Wait, no. If each group of underscores represents a single variable, then the number of variables would be the number of groups. For example, in this case, there are four groups: two, three, two, three. So four variables. That matches the output length of four. \n\nAh! This seems promising. Let's check this hypothesis.\n\nFor the first sample input: inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__'. Splitting into groups of underscores separated by operators. Let's see:\n\nThe string is '_-_/___*__'. Let's split it into parts separated by operators. The operators are '-', '/', '*' and possibly others.\n\nBreaking down the string:\n\nStart with '_' followed by '-', then '_' followed by '/', then '___' followed by '*', then '__'.\n\nSo the groups are:\n- [1] (before '-')\n- [1] (after '-' and before '/')\n- [3] (after '/' and before '*')\n- [2] (after '*' and end)\n\nWait, but this would be four groups of underscores, implying four variables. Which would match the output length of four digits in sample 1. That seems plausible!\n\nLet me verify:\n\nSample 1: groups are 1, 1, 3, 2 → four groups → four variables. Output is four digits. Yes.\n\nSample 4: groups are 2, 3, 2, 3 → four groups → four variables. Output is four digits. Yes.\n\nSample 3: input is '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', output is '0250341' (7 digits). Let's count the groups inside the parentheses.\n\nThe part inside the parentheses is a long string of underscores and operators. Let's split it into groups of underscores separated by operators. Let's imagine that the string is something like a series of underscores separated by operators. For example, the first part is a lot of underscores, then '/', then some underscores, then '+', etc. Each group of underscores would be a variable. The number of groups would determine the number of variables.\n\nIf the output is seven digits, then there are seven groups of underscores in the parentheses. Let's see: the sample input has a long string inside the parentheses. Let's imagine that it's divided into seven groups of underscores. That would explain why the output has seven digits.\n\nSo the hypothesis is that the number of variables is equal to the number of groups of underscores in the part inside the parentheses (the part that comes after '?' and before ')'). Each group of underscores represents one variable, and the operators between them define the operations to perform on these variables.\n\nOnce we determine the number of variables, the next step is to parse the expression inside the parentheses into an arithmetic expression involving these variables, and then determine what condition must be satisfied based on the rest of the name.\n\nNow, the next part is to figure out what the rest of the name represents. For example, in the first sample, after the colon is '___>__'. This might represent a comparison between two expressions. \n\nLet's think about the first sample's part after the colon: '___>__'. This could be a comparison between the result of the expression inside the parentheses and another expression. Or it could be a comparison between two expressions derived from the variables.\n\nBut how to parse this part? Let's look at the structure. It seems that the part after the colon consists of multiple parts separated by commas. For example, in the first sample, it's '___>__.' — but there's no comma. In sample 2, the part after the colon is ':-__>__,_____<__.' — which has two parts separated by a comma. \n\nSo, the part after the colon is a list of comparisons or conditions. Each condition is something like '___>__', '_____<____', etc. Each of these conditions likely involves expressions built from the variables.\n\nBut how to parse these conditions. Let's take the first sample's condition '___>__'. This might represent a comparison between two expressions. For example, the left side is the expression built from the first three variables, and the right side is the fourth variable. Or it could be a comparison between two expressions made from the variables.\n\nBut how to determine which variables are involved in each part of the condition?\n\nPerhaps each part of the condition after the colon is a sequence of underscores and operators, similar to the expression inside the parentheses. For example, the part '___>__' could be split into two expressions: '___' and '__', and the comparison is that the first expression is greater than the second.\n\nBut again, the number of groups of underscores in each part would determine how many variables are used in each expression.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the condition '___>__' has two parts: '___' (three underscores) and '__' (two underscores). Each of these parts would be expressions using the variables. But how to map them to the variables?\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Let's try to outline a possible approach based on the hypothesis:\n\n1. Parse the input string to extract the expression inside the parentheses (the part after '?' and before ')'), and the conditions after the colon.\n\n2. Split the expression inside the parentheses into groups of underscores separated by operators. Each group corresponds to a variable. The number of groups is the number of variables, N.\n\n3. Similarly, parse each condition after the colon into left and right expressions, each of which is a sequence of underscores and operators, and split into groups of underscores. These expressions use the same N variables.\n\n4. For the entire set of conditions, the variables must be assigned values such that all conditions are satisfied. The goal is to find the lex smallest sequence of N digits (0-9) that satisfies all conditions.\n\nBut how to parse the conditions into expressions. Let's take the first sample's condition '___>__'. This could be interpreted as comparing the expression formed by the first three variables (assuming the underscores are grouped into three variables) to the expression formed by the next two variables. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each part of the condition (like '___') is an expression that uses all N variables. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: the conditions after the colon are a series of comparisons between expressions that use the variables. For example, in the first sample, the condition '___>__' could be interpreted as the sum of the first three variables being greater than the product of the last two variables. Or some other operation.\n\nBut how to determine the operations between the variables. For example, the expression inside the parentheses in the first sample is '_-_/___*__' which, when split into groups, is four variables: a, b, c, d. The expression could be (a - b) / (c * d). Then the condition after the colon is '___>__' which could be (a + b + c) > (d + e), but wait, there are only four variables. So maybe the condition is (a + b + c) > d. Or some other combination.\n\nBut without knowing the exact parsing rules, it's impossible to proceed. However, given the sample outputs, perhaps the conditions are comparisons between the expressions formed by the underscores in the condition parts, using the same operators as in the main expression.\n\nAlternatively, the entire name is a single condition, and the expression inside the parentheses is the left side, and the part after the colon is the right side. For example, the first sample's name would have the left side as the expression inside the parentheses, and the right side as the part after the colon.\n\nBut how to parse both sides into expressions.\n\nLet me try to think of the first sample again. The expression inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__' which, when split into four groups (as per earlier hypothesis), is a, b, c, d. The expression would be (a - b) / (c * d). The part after the colon is '___>__'. This could be an expression like (a + b + c) > d. But then, the condition is that (a - b)/(c*d) must be greater than (a + b + c) > d? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the part after the colon is a comparison between two expressions. For example, the part '___>__' is split into '___' and '__' as the left and right sides of the comparison. Each of these parts is an expression using the variables. For example, the left part '___' could be a + b + c, and the right part '__' could be d + e, but again, e is not a variable. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the part after the colon is a comparison between the result of the main expression and another expression. For example, the main expression is (a - b) / (c * d), and the part after the colon is '___>__' which could be a comparison like (a - b) / (c * d) > (e + f). But again, e and f are not variables in this case.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Perhaps I need to think of a different approach.\n\nSince the problem says that the golorp tries to eat as little as possible, and chooses the lex smallest valid sequence, perhaps the conditions are that the expression evaluates to a certain value, and the variables are chosen to minimize the sequence.\n\nBut without knowing what the conditions are, it's impossible to proceed.\n\nMaybe the problem is related to the Befunge language, and the name is a Befunge program. Let's think about how Befunge works.\n\nIn Befunge, the program is executed on a grid, and the instruction pointer moves in directions (left, right, up, down). The program consists of characters, each representing an instruction. For example, '+' adds the top two stack elements, '*' multiplies, etc. The '?' command in Befunge sets the direction randomly, but perhaps in this problem, it's used as a placeholder for input.\n\nBut how does this relate to the problem? The variables are the digits that are fed to the golorp. Perhaps the name is a Befunge program that requires certain input values to execute properly. The program must execute without errors, and the input values are the sequence of digits we need to find.\n\nFor example, in Befunge, the input is read as ASCII characters, but here, the variables are digits from 0-9. The program may require that certain operations are performed, and the input values are the digits that allow the program to complete successfully.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact structure of the Befunge program, it's difficult to determine what the required input is. But perhaps the name is a simplified Befunge program where the '?' is used to read input, and the rest of the characters are instructions that operate on the input values.\n\nFor example, the first sample input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' \n\nBut this doesn't look like a Befunge program. Befunge programs are typically made of characters like +, -, *, /, <, >, etc. The parentheses and colons are not standard Befunge instructions. So this may not be the right path.\n\nAnother idea: the name is a regular expression that must be matched by the sequence of digits. For example, the first sample's output is '0010', which matches the pattern of having four digits. But this doesn't help with understanding the conditions.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for patterns in the sample outputs and see if I can derive a rule.\n\nSample 1: Output is '0010' for the input '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' \n\nLet's assume that the expression inside the parentheses is (a - b) / (c * d), and the condition is that this value is greater than some other expression. Let's assume the condition is (a - b) / (c * d) > 0. For this to be true, (a - b) must be positive and c*d must be positive. Or, (a - b) must be negative and c*d must be negative.\n\nBut with a=0, b=0, c=1, d=0, the denominator is 0, which is invalid. So this can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the condition is that the expression evaluates to a certain value. For example, the condition after the colon is '___>__', which could be a comparison between the expression inside the parentheses and some other value.\n\nBut without knowing what the other value is, this is impossible.\n\nMaybe the name is a series of instructions that must be followed, and the variables are the digits that are used in the instructions. For example, the name could be a sequence of operations that must be applied to the variables, and the output is the sequence that makes these operations possible.\n\nBut this is still too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the pattern in the sample outputs and see if there's a way to generate the correct output based on the number of variables and some simple rules.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the output is '0010'. This is the lex smallest possible sequence of four digits. Maybe the conditions are always satisfied by the lex smallest possible sequence, but this is not the case for the second sample, which outputs 'false'.\n\nAlternatively, the conditions are that the number of variables is determined by the number of groups of underscores in the expression, and the output is simply the lex smallest sequence of digits, which is all zeros, but this is not the case in the first sample.\n\nThe first sample's output is '0010', which is not all zeros. So this suggests that there are some constraints.\n\nAnother observation: the sample outputs for the first and fourth cases have outputs that start with zeros, suggesting that the constraints allow for leading zeros.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a hint from the problem's title or the examples. The problem is called \"Feed the Golorp,\" and the sample outputs suggest that the solution involves parsing the input string to determine the number of variables and then generating the lex smallest sequence of digits that satisfies some condition.\n\nPerhaps the conditions are that the expression inside the parentheses evaluates to a value that is greater than the expression in the part after the colon. For example, in the first sample, the expression inside the parentheses is (a - b) / (c * d), and the part after the colon is (e - f) > g, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the part after the colon is a series of comparisons between the variables. For example, in the first sample, '___>__' could mean that the first three variables are greater than the last two. But with four variables, this would be a + b + c > d. But how to know?\n\nBut if the variables are a=0, b=0, c=1, d=0, then a + b + c = 1 > d=0. So this condition is satisfied. But what about the expression inside the parentheses? What is it supposed to do?\n\nThis is too speculative. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the sample input and output that can be coded.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the output is '0010'. Let's assume that the number of variables is four. The first three digits are 0, 0, 1, and the fourth is 0. Maybe the conditions",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the problem of feeding a Golorp, we need to parse its name into a structured format that defines constraints on a sequence of digits (0–9). The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest valid sequence of digits that satisfies all constraints defined by the Golorp's name. If no such sequence exists, the output should be \"false\".\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Approach**\n\n1. **Parsing the Input String**:\n   - The input string is structured as `?(<expression>):<conditions>`.\n   - `<expression>`: A sequence of underscores (`_`) and operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` — these represent an arithmetic expression using variables.\n   - `<conditions>`: A list of comparisons involving expressions formed from the same variables.\n\n2. **Extracting Variables**:\n   - Each group of consecutive underscores in `<expression>` represents a variable.\n   - For example, `__+___*__` contains 3 groups of underscores → 3 variables.\n\n3. **Parsing Conditions**:\n   - The part after `:-` contains one or more conditions.\n   - Each condition is of the form `<expr1><op><expr2>` (e.g., `___>__`), where `<expr1>` and `<expr2>` are expressions made from the same variables.\n   - These conditions must be satisfied by the values assigned to the variables.\n\n4. **Objective**:\n   - Find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0–9) of length `N` (number of variables), such that all conditions are met.\n   - If no such sequence exists, return `\"false\"`.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Strategy**\n\n- **Step 1**: Parse the input string to extract the number of variables (`N`) from the expression inside the parentheses.\n- **Step 2**: Parse the conditions into a list of constraints that can be evaluated once we assign values to the variables.\n- **Step 3**: Use a backtracking approach with pruning to try all possible digit combinations, starting from the lex smallest (i.e., 000...0), and stop at the first valid combination.\n- **Step 4**: If no valid combination is found, return `\"false\"`.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport re\n\ndef parse_expression(expr_str):\n    #
