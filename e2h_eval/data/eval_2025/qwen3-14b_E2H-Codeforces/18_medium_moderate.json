The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a frog that starts at position 0 on the number line. The frog can jump either +a or -b from its current position. But the frog can't jump outside the interval [0, x] for a given x. The function f(x) counts the number of distinct integers the frog can reach under these constraints. Then, given m, I have to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m.\n\nConstraints are m up to 1e9, and a and b up to 1e5. So, any O(m) solution is impossible. We need an efficient approach, probably mathematical.\n\nFirst, let's think about what positions the frog can reach without any restrictions. Since the frog can move forward by a or backward by b. But since the frog can do multiple jumps, maybe the positions reachable are those that can be expressed as some linear combination of a and b? But with the constraints that the frog can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nWait, but the frog can't go beyond x. So for each x, f(x) is the number of positions reachable within [0, x], considering that the frog can't step outside during the jumps.\n\nBut how do we model the reachable positions?\n\nLet me think about the general case. Let's consider that the frog can make any number of jumps, but during the process, it can't go outside [0, x]. However, the frog can reach a position if there exists a path that starts at 0 and ends at that position, without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nThis seems complicated. But maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nLet me first think about the case when the frog can move freely (without the x constraint). What positions can it reach?\n\nSince the frog can add a or subtract b. The positions reachable would be all numbers of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, such that the result is non-negative. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because the frog can do any sequence of jumps. For example, starting at 0, adding a once gives a. Then subtracting b once gives a - b. Then adding a again gives 2a -b, etc. So the set of reachable positions is all integers that can be written as (some combination of a and -b steps) but the frog can't have negative positions during the process.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Let me denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, any reachable position must be a multiple of d. Because a and b are multiples of d, so any linear combination will also be a multiple of d. So the positions reachable are multiples of d. Also, the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0, provided that there's a way to get there without stepping out of [0, x].\n\nWait, but maybe not. For example, if a=5 and b=3. Then d=1. So in theory, the frog can reach any integer, but only if there's a way to reach it without going negative. For example, to reach 1, the frog would need to do something like 5-3-3+... but that would require steps that may go negative. But the problem states that the frog can't jump outside [0, x], so during the jumps, the frog can't step into negative positions or beyond x.\n\nSo, the problem becomes more complex because the frog's path must stay within [0, x]. However, for the purpose of counting reachable positions, perhaps there's a way to model the reachable positions for each x.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we need a formula that allows us to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the case where a and b are coprime. Let's say a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any sufficiently large integer. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into a problem of finding all positions that are congruent to 0 modulo d, and then considering certain constraints based on a and b.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Let's assume that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that is greater than or equal to some value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: The frog can perform any number of +a and -b steps, but the path must never go below 0 or above x. However, since the frog can choose any path, perhaps the positions reachable are those that can be written as a linear combination of a and b (with coefficients non-negative?), but adjusted to stay within [0, x].\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's think of it as a graph problem. Each position is a node, and edges are jumps. Then, f(x) is the number of nodes reachable from 0, with the constraint that all nodes in the path are between 0 and x.\n\nBut for x up to 1e9, we can't simulate this for each x. So we need a mathematical approach.\n\nAnother angle: For a given x, what positions can the frog reach?\n\nLet me consider that the frog can reach a position k if and only if:\n\n- k is a multiple of d (d = gcd(a, b)), and\n- There exists some integer t such that k = t*a - s*b, where t and s are non-negative integers, and during the sequence of steps, the frog never goes below 0 or above x.\n\nBut even this seems hard to model.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and which is at least (some value), and also can be reached via some steps that don't go below 0.\n\nWait, but for the frog to reach a position k, it's necessary that there exists a way to reach it by adding a's and subtracting b's, but ensuring that during the process, the frog never steps out of [0, x]. However, since x varies per f(x), perhaps for a given x, the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as some combination of a and b steps, and that are within [0, x], and that can be reached via a path that doesn't go beyond x.\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nPerhaps, for a given x, the reachable positions are all positions that are multiples of d and are in [0, x], and for which there exists a way to reach them by adding a's and subtracting b's, possibly with some constraints.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the frog's movement. Since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b, but can't go below 0 or above x. Let's assume that the frog can reach any position that is reachable in the absence of the x constraint (i.e., the frog can jump anywhere), but that is within [0, x].\n\nBut how to determine which positions are reachable in that scenario.\n\nLet me consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (since a and b are multiples of d), and that is >=0. But how to ensure that there's a way to reach it without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nWait, but for a given x, if the frog can reach a position k (which is a multiple of d) via some path, then even if during the path the frog went beyond x, but that's not allowed. So the problem is that the path must stay within [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x >= some value, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. For example, if a and b are coprime, then after a certain point, all numbers can be expressed as combinations. But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For the frog to reach a position k, it must be possible to reach it by adding a's and subtracting b's, but the path must not go out of [0, x]. However, the frog can reach k if there's a path that starts at 0 and ends at k, and never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut since x is varying, perhaps for each x, the reachable positions are all positions that are reachable in the unbounded case and lie within [0, x].\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nLet me think of the unbounded case. The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and which is >= (something). For example, if a and b are coprime, then the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b (with non-negative coefficients) is ab - a - b. But that's for the case where you can use any number of a's and b's. However, in our problem, the frog can add a's and subtract b's, which is different. So perhaps the conditions are different.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a Diophantine equation. The frog can reach position k if there exist non-negative integers t and s such that k = t*a - s*b. But also, during the sequence of steps, the frog must not go below 0 or above x. However, since x is variable, perhaps for the purpose of f(x), we can ignore the path constraints and just check whether k is reachable in the unbounded case, and then see if it's within [0, x].\n\nBut this seems incorrect. For example, suppose a=5 and b=3. Then, the position 1 can be written as 5*1 - 3*1 = 2. Wait no, that's 5-3=2. Hmm. To get 1, maybe 5*2 - 3*3 = 10-9=1. So yes, it's possible. But the path to get there would be: 0 →5→10→7→4→1. But during that path, the frog is at positions 0,5,10,7,4,1. All are ≥0. So for x ≥10, the frog can reach 1. But for x less than 10, like x=5, the frog can't reach 1 because during the path it would have to go to 10, which is outside [0,5]. So the position 1 is not reachable for x=5, but is reachable for x≥10.\n\nSo the problem is that even though k is reachable in the unbounded case, it might not be reachable for a given x if the path requires going beyond x.\n\nThus, the reachable positions for x depend on both the ability to reach k in the unbounded case and the existence of a path that stays within [0,x].\n\nThis seems really complicated. How can we model this for large x?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the minimal x for which a position k can be reached. For example, for k to be reachable, there must be some way to reach it without going beyond x. So x must be at least the maximum position encountered along the path.\n\nBut how to find that maximum for each k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given k, the minimal x required to reach it is the maximum of the positions along some path that reaches k. Then, for any x ≥ that maximum, the position k is counted in f(x).\n\nBut how to find that maximum for each k?\n\nThis seems challenging. But perhaps there's a way to find for each k, the minimal x needed to reach it, and then for the sum over i from 0 to m of f(i), we can compute how many times each k is counted (i.e., for how many i ≥ the minimal x of k, and i ≥k, since k must be ≤x).\n\nBut again, for large m, we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x for which k can be reached is equal to the maximum between k and the maximum position in the path. But how to find that maximum for the path.\n\nAnother thought: The frog can reach k if and only if k is a multiple of d and there exists some t and s such that k = t*a - s*b, and also that there exists a path from 0 to k where all intermediate positions are between 0 and x. But since x is variable, perhaps for a given k, the minimal x required to reach it is the maximum of the positions along some path to k. However, finding that minimal x for each k is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach k if and only if k is a multiple of d and k ≥0, and there exists some way to reach k with a path that doesn't go below 0. Because once x is large enough to include all positions in the path, then k is reachable. So for x ≥ the maximum position in the path, k is included in f(x). Therefore, for each k that can be reached in the unbounded case (i.e., k is a multiple of d and there exists t and s such that k = t*a - s*b), the minimal x required to reach it is the maximum position in some path to k. Once x is ≥ that maximum, then k is included in f(x).\n\nBut how to compute that maximum for each k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x needed to reach k is the maximum between k and (some other value). For example, if the frog can reach k by adding a's and subtracting b's, but during the process, the frog might have to go higher than k. For example, to reach k=1 with a=5 and b=3, the path could be 0→5→10→7→4→1. Here, the maximum position is 10. So x needs to be at least 10 to allow this path. However, maybe there's another path that requires a lower maximum. For example, is there a shorter path?\n\nWell, maybe another path would involve fewer steps. Let's see: 0 →5 →2 → ... but 5-3=2, then 2-3 is negative, which is not allowed. So that's not possible. Another path: 0 →5 → (5-3) = 2, then 2 +5 =7 → 7-3=4 → 4-3=1. But that path has max 7. So x needs to be at least 7. But wait, in that path, the positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1. So the maximum is 7. So for x ≥7, the frog can reach 1. So the minimal x is 7.\n\nSo for k=1, the minimal x is 7.\n\nBut how to find this minimal x for each k?\n\nThis seems tricky. However, perhaps there's a way to model this with some mathematical properties.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the frog's movement. Suppose the frog wants to reach k. The frog can only move forward by a or backward by b. But the frog can't go below 0. So, to reach k, the frog must have a way to reach it by adding a's and subtracting b's, but ensuring that during the process, the frog never goes below zero.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of making change, but with some constraints.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a BFS. For a given k, the minimal x needed is the maximum position encountered along the path. But since m can be up to 1e9, and a and b up to 1e5, we need a way to compute for each k, the minimal x required, and then aggregate this information.\n\nBut with m up to 1e9, enumerating all k's is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's find for each x, what is the set of positions reachable. Then, compute f(x) as the size of that set, and sum over x from 0 to m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the case when the frog can't make any jumps. That is when a=0 or b=0. But according to the input constraints, a and b are positive integers. So that case is not possible.\n\nWait, the input says that a and b are positive integers. So the third example in the sample input is \"100 100000 1\", which means a=100000, b=1. The note says that the frog can't make any jumps. Wait, why? Because for example, from 0, the frog can jump to 0+a=100000, or 0-b = -1, which is invalid. So the frog can only jump to 100000 if x is at least 100000. Otherwise, it can't make any jumps. So for x < 100000, the frog can't jump anywhere, so f(x) is 1. For x >=100000, the frog can jump to 100000, and then from there, can jump to 100000 +a= 200000 (if x is big enough), or to 100000 -b = 99999. But if x is 100000, then from 100000, the frog can't jump to 200000 (since x is 100000), but can jump to 99999. So for x=100000, the frog can reach 0, 100000, 99999. So f(100000) is 3. So the third example's output is 101, which is sum from i=0 to 100 of f(i). For all i < 100000, f(i) is 1. For i >=100000, it depends. But since m is 100, which is less than 100000, all f(i) are 1, so sum is 101.\n\nSo in this case, the frog can only make jumps when x is large enough to allow the jumps.\n\nBut how to model this for general cases.\n\nLet me think about the case when the frog can reach positions in a certain way. Let's consider the problem when the frog can make jumps in both directions. Let's suppose that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that is >=0, but with some constraints based on the minimal steps.\n\nBut again, how to find this.\n\nAlternative idea: For the frog to reach a position k, it must be that k is a multiple of d, and that there exists some t and s such that k = t*a - s*b, and that during the process of adding a's and subtracting b's, the frog never goes below 0. However, the problem of finding such t and s is equivalent to solving for k = t*a - s*b, which is the same as k + s*b = t*a. Since d divides a and b, let's write a = d * a', b = d * b', and k = d * k'. Then, the equation becomes k' + s*b' = t*a'.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding non-negative integers t and s such that k' + s*b' = t*a'. This is equivalent to solving for s and t in non-negative integers.\n\nLet me think about this equation. For fixed k', we want to find s and t such that t*a' - s*b' = k'.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime (since d is the gcd), we can think of this as a linear Diophantine equation. The solutions exist if and only if k' is a multiple of gcd(a', b') = 1, which it is. So solutions exist.\n\nBut we need non-negative s and t. So for each k', we need to find whether there exists s and t ≥0 such that t*a' - s*b' = k'.\n\nThis seems like a classic problem. Let's think of it as t*a' = k' + s*b'. So t must be such that k' + s*b' is divisible by a'. Or equivalently, s must be such that s ≡ -k'/(b') mod a', but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed k', we can find the minimal t and s that satisfy the equation.\n\nBut even if such s and t exist, the path to reach k' would involve adding a's and subtracting b's. But how to ensure that during the process, the frog never goes below 0.\n\nBut perhaps this is equivalent to the existence of some t and s that satisfy the equation, and that during the process of adding t a's and subtracting s b's, the frog never goes below 0.\n\nBut this seems very abstract. Let me think of an example. Take a=5, b=3. So d=1, a'=5, b'=3. Let's take k'=1. Then, we need t*5 - s*3 = 1. One solution is t=2, s=3. Then, the path would be adding two a's (to 10), then subtracting three b's (to 1). But during this path, the frog is at 0, 5, 10, 7, 4, 1. All are >=0. So this path is valid.\n\nBut how to ensure that such a path exists for any k' that satisfies the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any k' that can be expressed as t*a' - s*b', there exists a path that reaches it without going below 0. If that's the case, then the problem reduces to counting all multiples of d that are >=0 and can be expressed as t*a' - s*b' for non-negative integers t and s.\n\nBut how to find this set.\n\nLet me think about the equation t*a' - s*b' = k'. Rearranged, this is t*a' = k' + s*b'. Since a' and b' are coprime, for any k', there are infinitely many solutions (s, t) to this equation. However, we need to find solutions where both s and t are non-negative.\n\nFor example, for k'=1, as before, there are solutions like (s=3, t=2), (s=3 + a', t=2 + b'), etc. Because adding a' to s and b' to t maintains the equality.\n\nSo the general solution can be found as follows: Find one particular solution (s0, t0), then the general solution is s = s0 + a'*m, t = t0 + b'*m, where m is an integer.\n\nWe need s and t to be non-negative. So for some m, s and t are non-negative.\n\nBut how to find if there exists such m.\n\nAlternatively, for any k', the equation t*a' - s*b' = k' can be rewritten as t*a' = k' + s*b'. Let's fix s and find t. For example, s can be chosen such that k' + s*b' is divisible by a'. Let's say that k' + s*b' = a'*t. Then, for some s ≥0, t must be ≥0.\n\nBut this seems like the same problem as solving for s and t.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as finding s such that s ≡ -k' * (b')^{-1} mod a'. Then, s can be written as s = s0 + a'*m for some integer m ≥0. Then, t = (k' + s*b') / a'.\n\nWe need t ≥0.\n\nSo for example, once we find s0, the minimal s that makes the equation hold, then increasing m increases s by a' each time, and increases t by b' each time. So, for m ≥ m_min, where m_min is such that s ≥0 and t ≥0.\n\nBut this seems like it's getting somewhere. Let's formalize.\n\nLet me find for a given k' the minimal s and t that satisfy the equation. Once we have that, we can determine whether there exists such s and t with s ≥0 and t ≥0.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the equation again: t*a' - s*b' = k'. Let's rearrange it as t*a' = s*b' + k'.\n\nWe can think of this as finding s and t such that s*b' + k' is divisible by a'.\n\nLet me define r = k' mod a'. Then, since a' and b' are coprime, there exists some s such that s*b' ≡ -k' mod a'. Let me find the minimal s ≥0 that satisfies this congruence.\n\nOnce I find that s, then I can compute t = (s*b' + k') / a'.\n\nBut for this to work, s must be such that s*b' +k' is non-negative and divisible by a'.\n\nOnce we find such s and t, then we can check if t is ≥0. Since s ≥0 and k' ≥0, s*b' +k' is ≥0, so t is ≥0.\n\nBut what about the other direction? For example, if I have t ≥0, then s = (t*a' -k')/b'. But this requires that t*a' -k' is divisible by b' and that the resulting s is ≥0.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is that for any k' that is reachable (i.e., there exists s and t ≥0), there exists some minimal s and t.\n\nBut how does this help us determine whether k' is reachable?\n\nWell, for example, if we can find s and t such that s ≥0 and t ≥0, then k' is reachable.\n\nSo, the question now becomes: For a given k', can we find s and t ≥0 such that t*a' - s*b' = k'?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding whether there's a solution to this equation with s and t non-negative.\n\nBut how to find this quickly?\n\nLet me think about the following. For the equation t*a' - s*b' = k', we can rearrange it to t*a' = s*b' +k'.\n\nWe can think of this as t*a' - k' = s*b'. So, the left side must be divisible by b', and the result must be ≥0.\n\nSo, t*a' -k' must be ≥0, and divisible by b'.\n\nWhich implies that t ≥ ceil(k' /a') ?\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, for some t ≥0, the value t*a' -k' must be divisible by b', and the quotient s = (t*a' -k')/b' must be ≥0.\n\nSo, for some t ≥0, (t*a' -k') must be divisible by b', and (t*a' -k')/b' ≥0.\n\nWhich implies that t*a' ≥k'.\n\nSo, t ≥ ceil(k'/a').\n\nBut how to find such t.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of this as solving for t in the congruence t*a' ≡ k' mod b'. Because t*a' ≡ k' mod b' implies that t*a' -k' is divisible by b'.\n\nSince a' and b' are coprime, we can find the modular inverse of a' modulo b'. Let's call it inv_a. Then, the solution for t is t ≡ k' * inv_a mod b'.\n\nSo, the minimal positive solution for t is t0 = (k' * inv_a) mod b'.\n\nBut this gives us a solution for t, and we can then find the minimal t ≥0 that satisfies the congruence.\n\nOnce we have that t0, we can compute s = (t0*a' -k')/b'.\n\nIf this s is ≥0, then we have a solution. Otherwise, we can try adding multiples of b' to t0 to get larger t's, which would increase s accordingly.\n\nBut how to find if there exists such a t that makes s ≥0.\n\nLet me think. Let's find the minimal t ≥0 such that t*a' ≡k' mod b'.\n\nOnce we have that, then for t = t0 + m*b', where m ≥0, we can compute s = (t*a' -k')/b' = (t0*a' -k')/b' + m*a'.\n\nSo, s increases by m*a' as m increases.\n\nSo, the minimal s is s_min = (t0*a' -k')/b'.\n\nIf s_min ≥0, then we have a solution. Otherwise, we can increase m until s becomes ≥0.\n\nLet me see. For example, suppose s_min is negative. Then, adding m*a' to s_min would eventually make it non-negative. Because m can be increased.\n\nBut what's the minimal m required?\n\nLet me solve for m such that s_min + m*a' ≥0 → m ≥ (-s_min)/a'.\n\nSince m is an integer ≥0, we can find the minimal m.\n\nOnce we find such m, then t = t0 + m*b', and s = s_min + m*a'.\n\nSo, in this case, there exists a solution.\n\nThus, for any k', there exists a solution (s, t) with s ≥0 and t ≥0. Therefore, every k' that is non-negative can be expressed as t*a' - s*b' for some non-negative integers s and t.\n\nWait, but that can't be true. For example, take k' = 1, a'=5, b'=3. Then, the congruence t*5 ≡1 mod 3. Since 5 mod3 is 2, so 2t ≡1 mod3 → t ≡2 mod3. So t0=2. Then, s = (2*5 -1)/3 = (10-1)/3 = 3. Which is ≥0. So yes, solution exists.\n\nWhat about k'=1, a'=2, b'=3. Then, the equation is t*2 - s*3 =1. Let's find solutions. For example, t=2, s=1: 4-3=1. Yes. So s=1 ≥0, t=2 ≥0. So yes.\n\nAnother example: k'=1, a'=3, b'=2. Equation t*3 - s*2 =1. Let's find t and s. For example, t=1, s=1: 3-2=1. So yes.\n\nBut what if k'=1, a'=1, b'=1. Then, t*1 - s*1 =1 → t-s=1 → t = s +1. For s ≥0, t ≥1. So yes.\n\nSo in all these examples, there is a solution. So perhaps for any k' ≥0, there is a solution. Which would imply that the frog can reach any multiple of d (since k' is any non-negative integer) as long as the path doesn't require going below 0. But earlier example showed that for k=1, the path requires going up to 10 (for a=5 and b=3), but with x ≥7, it can be done.\n\nBut according to this, the frog can reach any k that is a multiple of d and is ≥0. Because the equation has solutions. So for any k that is a multiple of d and ≥0, there exists a path to reach it, but the minimal x required to allow that path is the maximum position along the path.\n\nBut how to find this maximum position for each k.\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps the maximum position along the path is t*a, where t is the number of a-jumps in the path. Since the path starts at 0 and adds a's and subtracts b's, the maximum position along the path is the maximum of all positions during the journey.\n\nBut how to find this maximum.\n\nLet me think about the path that uses the minimal t and s. For example, in the case of k=1, a=5, b=3, the minimal t is 2 and s is 3. The path would be adding two a's (to 10), then subtracting three b's (to 1). The maximum position is 10. However, there may be other paths with smaller maximum positions.\n\nBut for our purposes, we need to know for a given k, the minimal x such that there exists a path to k that stays within [0, x]. Once x is ≥ this minimal x, the frog can reach k.\n\nBut how to find this minimal x for each k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x is the maximum between k and the maximum position in the path. For example, in the case of k=1 and x=7, the maximum position is 7, which is larger than k=1.\n\nBut how to find this maximum.\n\nLet me think of the path that reaches k by first adding as many a's as needed and then subtracting b's. For example, for k = t*a - s*b, the path could be:\n\nStart at 0, add a t times to reach t*a. Then subtract b s times to reach k. This path's maximum position is t*a.\n\nBut during the subtraction steps, the frog may go below zero. For example, if during the subtraction steps, the frog subtracts b more than possible. So this path is only valid if during the subtraction steps, the frog never goes below zero.\n\nBut if we choose t and s such that t*a - s*b =k and s*b ≤ t*a, then during the subtraction steps, the frog will go from t*a down to k, which is ≥0. So the maximum position is t*a.\n\nIn this case, the minimal x required to allow this path is t*a. So for k, the minimal x is t*a.\n\nBut what is t in this case? It's the t from the solution to the equation t*a' -s*b' =k', where k' =k/d, a'=a/d, b'=b/d.\n\nBut how to find t in this case.\n\nLet me think. For the equation t*a' - s*b' =k', we can find the minimal t such that t*a' ≥k' and s = (t*a' -k')/b' is an integer and ≥0.\n\nBut how to find this t.\n\nAlternatively, since we have that for any k', there exists a solution (t, s), and we can find the minimal t such that t*a' ≥k'.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again about the equation t*a' - s*b' =k'. We can think of this as t*a' = s*b' +k'. So for the path that adds t a's and then subtracts s b's, the maximum position is t*a'.\n\nWe want this to be as small as possible. So, for the minimal t*a'.\n\nBut how to find this minimal t.\n\nAlternatively, since the equation t*a' - s*b' =k' implies that t*a' = s*b' +k', and since we want t*a' to be as small as possible, we can find the minimal t such that t*a' ≥k' and (t*a' -k') is divisible by b'.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the minimal t ≥ ceil(k' /a') such that (t*a' -k') mod b' ==0.\n\nBut how to compute this t.\n\nLet me think about this. Let me define rem = k' mod a'. Then, t*a' -k' = s*b' → t*a' -k' must be divisible by b'. So, t*a' ≡k' mod b'.\n\nAs before, since a' and b' are coprime, this congruence has a unique solution modulo b'. Let me call this solution t0 mod b'.\n\nSo the minimal positive solution for t is t0. However, t0 may be less than ceil(k'/a'), which would make t*a' <k', which would imply that s would be negative. So we need to find the smallest t ≥ t0 such that t*a' ≥k'.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of t0 as the solution to t*a' ≡k' mod b', and then find the minimal t ≥ t0 where t*a' ≥k'.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nLet me proceed with an example. Let's take k'=1, a'=5, b'=3. We have t*5 ≡1 mod3 → 5 mod3 is 2. So 2t ≡1 mod3 → t ≡2 mod3. So t0=2. Now, t0*a' =2*5=10 ≥k'=1. So this is acceptable. So the minimal t is 2, leading to maximum x=10.\n\nBut earlier, I thought there was a path that reaches 1 with maximum x=7. How is that possible?\n\nAh, because there are other paths that may not follow the \"add all a's first\" approach. For example, the path 0→5→2→7→4→1. This path involves adding a's and subtracting b's in a different order. The maximum position here is 7, which is less than 10. So the minimal x for k=1 is 7, not 10.\n\nThus, the approach of taking the path that adds all a's first and then subtracts all b's may not yield the minimal x. Hence, finding the minimal x for a given k is not straightforward.\n\nThis complicates things. How can I find the minimal x for each k?\n\nAn alternative idea: The minimal x required for a position k is the maximum between k and the minimal number of a's added minus the b's subtracted in a way that ensures that during the path, the frog never goes below zero. However, finding this seems challenging.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of calculating the sum over f(x), we can find that for x ≥ some value, all positions that are multiples of d and are in [0,x] are reachable. This would mean that for x ≥ some threshold, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1 (since all multiples of d up to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints and sum these values for all integers from 0 to m. The frog can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`, but it cannot go outside the interval [0, x] for any given x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. This is because any linear combination of `a` and `b` will be a multiple of their gcd.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each position `k` that is a multiple of `d = gcd(a, b)`, there exists a way to reach it if `k` is non-negative and within the bounds of the interval [0, x]. However, the frog must not step outside the interval during its journey.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints, we need an efficient way to compute the sum of reachable positions for all x from 0 to m.
