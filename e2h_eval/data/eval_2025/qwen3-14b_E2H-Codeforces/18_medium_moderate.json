The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints. We need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't go beyond 0 or x. So for each x, we need to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute f(x) for each x individually. We need a mathematical formula or pattern to calculate the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Let's consider the general case where the frog can move forward by a and backward by b. The key here is to find all positions reachable by some combination of these jumps, but constrained within [0, x].\n\nBut since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the movement is limited. However, for large x, perhaps there's a pattern once x is large enough.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when a and b are such that the frog can reach any position beyond a certain point. For example, if a and b are coprime, then by the coin problem, the maximum unattainable number is ab - a - b. But this is for the case where you can add any number of a and b. However, in our problem, the frog can only add a steps forward or subtract b steps. So perhaps the problem is different.\n\nWait, but the frog can make any number of jumps. So for example, the frog can reach positions that are linear combinations of a and b. However, since the frog can only add a or subtract b, the positions must be of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But the frog can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut considering that the frog starts at 0, which is a valid position. Then, each time, it can jump forward by a (so adding a) or backward by b (subtracting b). However, the frog can't jump to a position outside [0, x], so even if a jump would take it beyond x, it can't do that.\n\nSo the problem is to find all positions reachable via such jumps, but staying within [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Let's first ignore the x constraint. What's the set of positions reachable?\n\nThe positions are all integers of the form a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers. But since the frog can perform any sequence of jumps, perhaps the positions are those that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b). Because any linear combination of a and b is a multiple of their gcd. So the reachable positions must be multiples of d = gcd(a, b).\n\nBut wait, the frog can only add a or subtract b. So the positions are of the form a*k - b*l. Which is equivalent to a*k + (-b)*l. So the set of positions is the same as the set of integers that can be expressed as linear combinations of a and b with coefficients in integers. But since the coefficients are non-negative for a and non-negative for -b, perhaps the positions are not all multiples of d. But maybe the reachable positions are all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d, and also satisfy certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the problem in terms of the greatest common divisor. Let d = gcd(a, b). Let's denote a = d * a', b = d * b', where gcd(a', b') = 1. Then, any reachable position must be a multiple of d. Because a and b are multiples of d, so any combination of them will be a multiple of d. Therefore, the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of d.\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be simplified by dividing everything by d. Let's assume that d = gcd(a, b), and then we can work with a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since a' and b' are coprime, perhaps the problem becomes easier.\n\nSo, the positions reachable are multiples of d. Let's focus on the problem where a and b are coprime. Then, the positions are integers that are reachable via steps of +a and -b. Let's think about this.\n\nIf a and b are coprime, then any integer can be expressed as a combination of a and b. However, the frog can only make forward steps of a or backward steps of b. So the positions are all integers that can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers. But since the frog can't go below 0, perhaps some positions are not reachable.\n\nBut for the problem of f(x), which counts the number of positions reachable within [0, x], perhaps for large enough x, the number of reachable positions is x//d + 1 (if all multiples of d up to x are reachable). However, this depends on whether the frog can reach every multiple of d in [0, x].\n\nBut when a and b are coprime, then the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of d (which is 1 in this case) beyond a certain point. Wait, but for example, when a=5 and b=3, which are coprime. Let's see the first example given: in the first input, m=7, a=5, b=3. The output for f(5) is 3. The positions reachable are 0, 5, and 5-3=2. Then, from 2, can you jump to 2+5=7 (but if x is 5, then 7 is outside, so not allowed). So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. Hence f(5)=3. Similarly, for x=7, the frog can reach positions like 0, 2, 5, 7 (from 2+5), 7-3=4, 4+5=9 (exceeds x=7?), no. So from 4, can jump to 4+5=9 (no), or 4-3=1. So 1 is added. Then from 1, can jump to 1+5=6, which is allowed. From 6, can jump to 6-3=3, etc. So for x=7, the reachable positions include 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions, which matches the example's f(7)=8.\n\nSo for x >= some value, all positions that are multiples of d (which is 1 in this case) can be reached. But how to find that threshold?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions are all integers that are congruent to 0 mod d and are greater than or equal to some value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps once the frog can reach a certain range, it can reach all positions beyond that. For example, if the frog can reach a position x, then by adding a steps, it can reach x+a, x+2a, etc., provided they don't exceed the current x limit. However, since the problem allows x to be up to m, which is very large, perhaps we need to find for each x the number of positions reachable, which depends on whether x is large enough to allow all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think again. Let's assume that a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is >= (some value) and congruent to 0 mod 1 (so all integers). But how to find the minimal value beyond which all integers are reachable?\n\nWait, the problem is similar to the classic \"coin problem\", but here the frog can only add a or subtract b. Let's think of it as a variation. For example, the classic problem says that the largest amount that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b (assuming coprime) is ab - a - b. But that's when you can use any combination of adding a and b. However, in our case, the frog can only add a or subtract b. So the reachable positions are different.\n\nBut perhaps for the case where a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any integer >= (some value). Let's think about the example where a=5, b=3. The reachable positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, etc. For example, 1 can be reached by 5-3*1 (from 0, jump forward to 5, then back to 2, then back to -1? No, wait that's invalid. Wait, the frog can't go below zero. So how does the frog reach 1?\n\nIn the example, when x=7, the frog can reach 1. How?\n\nLet me retrace:\n\nStarting at 0, jump to 5 (k=5). From 5, jump back by 3 to 2. From 2, jump back by 3 would be -1, which is invalid. So can't do that. But from 2, jump forward by 5 to 7. Then, from 7, jump back by 3 to 4. From 4, jump back by 3 to 1. So that's allowed. So yes, the frog can reach 1.\n\nSo in this case, the frog can reach 1. So for x=7, which is larger than 1, the frog can reach 1. So the minimal value for which all positions are reachable may be lower than the classic problem's value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any integer that is >= (a - b) or something. Not sure.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight here is that once x is large enough, the number of reachable positions is x + 1 (if d=1) or (x//d) + 1 (if d is the gcd). But how to find when x is large enough?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d, provided that x is large enough. For example, if the frog can reach a certain position, then by adding a steps (since a is a multiple of d), it can reach higher positions. But how to ensure that all positions up to x are reachable?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of the problem in terms of the reachable positions. Let's suppose that after a certain point, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Then, for x larger than that point, f(x) would be equal to the number of multiples of d in [0, x], which is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find that point?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable is (a + b) * something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the frog can move forward by a steps and backward by b steps. Let's think of the positions as being in the form of k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. Since a and b are coprime, any integer can be written as a linear combination of a and b. However, the coefficients here are constrained to be non-negative for a and non-negative for -b. So the problem is to find all integers that can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers.\n\nBut this is equivalent to the set of integers that can be written as a*k + (-b)*l, with k and l non-negative. Which is similar to the problem of the Frobenius number, but with different constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the case when a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any integer >= (some value). Let's think of the example where a=5 and b=3. The positions reachable are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 8, etc. So once the frog can reach 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, then for x >= 7, any higher number can be reached by adding a steps. For example, 8 can be reached by 3 + 5. 9 can be 4 +5. 10 can be 5 +5, etc. So once x is >= 7, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 up to x. Wait, but for x=8, the frog can reach 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So for x >= 7, f(x) = x + 1. But in the first example, when x=7, f(x) is 8. Which is indeed 7+1. But for x=5, f(x) is 3, which is less than 5+1. So the threshold here is x >= (a + b - 1) ?\n\nWait, in the example, a=5, b=3. The threshold seems to be 7. Which is 5 + 3 - 1 = 7. So perhaps the threshold is (a + b - 1). Once x >= (a + b - 1), then all positions from 0 to x are reachable. But why?\n\nThis seems similar to the Frobenius problem. However, the classic Frobenius number for two coprime numbers a and b is ab - a - b. But here, the frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a and subtracting b. So perhaps the threshold is different.\n\nBut in the example, the threshold is a + b - 1. Let's check another example. Suppose a=3, b=2. They are coprime. Then, according to this hypothesis, the threshold is 3+2-1=4. Let's see:\n\nFor x=4, the frog can reach 0, 3, 1 (3-2), 3+3=6 (but x=4, so not allowed). Also, from 1, can jump to 1+3=4 (allowed). So positions are 0, 1, 3, 4. Also, from 4, subtract 2 to get 2. So for x=4, the frog can reach 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So f(4)=5. Which is 4+1. So yes, it works. For x=3, the positions are 0, 3, 1 (from 3-2). So f(3)=3. Which is less than 3+1=4. So the threshold seems to be correct.\n\nSo perhaps for a and b coprime, once x is >= a + b - 1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Therefore, for x >= (a + b - 1), f(x) = x + 1. But wait, in the case of a=5, b=3, the threshold is 5+3-1=7. And for x=7, f(x)=8=7+1. So that seems to hold.\n\nIf that's the case, then for general a and b, after some threshold, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (the gcd of a and b). Because once the frog can reach a certain range, adding multiples of a allows reaching higher positions.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b). Let's divide a and b by d to get a' and b', which are coprime.\n\n2. The reachable positions are multiples of d. So, for a given x, the maximum number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1. But this is only true if x is large enough. Otherwise, it's less.\n\n3. The threshold for x is such that for x >= T, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Then, for x < T, we have to compute the actual count.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding T, which is the threshold beyond which all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nNow, how to compute T?\n\nAssuming that a' and b' are coprime, then the threshold for the original problem (with a and b) would be T' = a' + b' - 1. Then, the threshold for the original problem (before dividing by d) would be T = T' * d = (a' + b' - 1) * d. Because the original a is d*a', and original b is d*b'.\n\nWait, but let me think. Let's say that in the reduced problem (a' and b' coprime), the threshold is T' = a' + b' - 1. Then, for the original problem, the threshold is T = T' * d. Because the positions are multiples of d. So for example, in the first example, a=5, b=3, d=1. So T'=5+3-1=7. Which matches the example. Another example: a=3, b=2, d=1, T'=3+2-1=4, which worked.\n\nAnother example: suppose a=6 and b=4. Their gcd is 2. So a'=3, b'=2. Then T'=3+2-1=4. So the original threshold is T = 4 * 2 = 8. Let's see. The original a=6, b=4. So the reachable positions are multiples of 2. Let's check for x=8.\n\nCan the frog reach all even numbers up to 8?\n\n0 is reachable. 2: can you get there? From 0, can you jump forward by 6 (to 6) then subtract 4 (to 2). So yes. 4: 0 +6 -4*1 = 2, then 2+6=8 (but if x is 8, allowed. Then from 8 subtract 4 to get 4. So yes. 6: directly from 0 +6. 8: 0+6+6=12 (but x=8, so no. Or from 6 +6=12 (invalid). Alternatively, 0 +6 (to 6) then +6 (to 12, invalid). Hmm. Or from 0, jump to 6, then subtract 4 to 2, then add 6 to 8. So yes. So for x=8, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. All even numbers up to 8. So yes, for x=8, which is T=8, the count is 5 (since x/d is 4, 4+1=5). So that works.\n\nBut what about x=6? For x=6, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 6, 4 (from 6-2*4?), but wait:\n\nOriginal a=6, b=4. So the frog can jump +6 or -4.\n\nAt x=6:\n\nStart at 0. Jump +6 to 6. Can't jump further. From 6, can subtract 4 to 2. From 2, can add 6 to 8 (exceeds x=6, not allowed). So positions are 0, 2, 6. So f(6) is 3. Which is (6/d) +1 = 3 +1 =4? No, 6/2 is 3, plus 1 is 4, but actual count is 3. So the threshold T is 8. So for x < T (like 6), the count is less than x/d +1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each x, if x >= T, then f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1. Else, we need to compute the number of reachable positions.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for all x from 0 to m?\n\nThe sum would be divided into two parts:\n\n1. For x < T: compute f(x) individually.\n\n2. For x >= T: f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, and T could be up to (a' + b' -1)*d, which for a and b up to 1e5, T could be up to (1e5 + 1e5 -1)*1e5 = around 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10. Which is way larger than m (up to 1e9). So if T is larger than m, then all x in 0..m are below T, and we have to compute f(x) for each x. Which is impossible for m up to 1e9.\n\nSo this approach may not work. Therefore, we need to find a way to compute the sum efficiently, even when T is larger than m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the general case. Let's assume that the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x if x is large enough. Let's call this condition satisfied when x >= T. Then, the sum can be split into two parts: for x < T, and x >= T.\n\nBut if T is larger than m, then all x in 0..m are in the first part. Thus, we need to compute the sum for x from 0 to m, where for each x, f(x) is the number of reachable positions.\n\nBut how to compute this sum when T is larger than m?\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for x < T?\n\nBut for x < T, the number of reachable positions can be determined by the number of multiples of d that can be reached, which depends on the possible steps.\n\nBut how to compute this for all x up to T?\n\nBut T could be up to (a' + b' -1)*d. For a and b up to 1e5, a' and b' are up to 1e5, so T could be up to (2e5)*d. But d is up to 1e5, so T could be up to 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10, which is way too big to compute for each x up to m=1e9. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Find for the general case, when the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x, and for x < T, find the number of reachable positions. But how?\n\nBut perhaps, for the cases where x is small, the reachable positions are the same as the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem (a', b') multiplied by d. So perhaps we can model the problem for the reduced case where a and b are coprime.\n\nLet me think again. Let's assume that d = gcd(a, b). Let a = d*a', b = d*b', where gcd(a', b') = 1. Then, the positions reachable by the frog are multiples of d. So for any x, the reachable positions are the multiples of d in [0, x] that are reachable by the frog's movement.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving for the reduced case with a' and b', and then multiplying the results by d. For example, the number of reachable positions for x is equal to the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem (for x' = x/d) multiplied by 1 (since each position is a multiple of d). But how?\n\nActually, the number of reachable positions in the original problem is equal to the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem (where a' and b' are coprime) multiplied by 1, because each reachable position in the reduced problem corresponds to a position in the original problem multiplied by d. So for example, in the reduced problem, if the frog can reach k positions, then in the original problem, those positions are multiplied by d. So the count is the same as the count in the reduced problem.\n\nTherefore, we can focus on solving the problem for the case when a and b are coprime. Then, multiply the result by d, but wait, no. Because the count is the same. For example, in the original problem, if the reduced problem has a count of c, then the original problem has the same count. Because each position in the reduced problem is multiplied by d, but the count remains the same.\n\nSo, the problem can be transformed into solving the case when a and b are coprime, and then applying the same logic for the general case.\n\nTherefore, let's assume that a and b are coprime. Then, the problem is to find for each x, the number of positions reachable (which are integers between 0 and x) that can be reached by the frog's jumps. Then, for the general case, we can compute this count and use it.\n\nSo, the key is to find for coprime a and b, and given x, the number of positions reachable.\n\nAs discussed earlier, for x >= T = a + b - 1, the number of positions is x + 1. Because all integers from 0 to x are reachable. For x < T, the number of positions is less.\n\nSo, the sum over x from 0 to m is:\n\nsum_{x=0}^m f(x) = sum_{x=0}^{min(m, T-1)} f(x) + sum_{x=max(T, 0)}^m (x + 1)\n\nBut how to compute the first part, which is for x up to T-1?\n\nBut T can be up to a + b - 1, which is up to 2e5 (since a and b are up to 1e5). So for m up to 1e9, the first sum is up to T-1, which is 2e5. Which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor the general case:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b). Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Then, compute T' = a' + b' - 1. The threshold for the reduced problem is T' = a' + b' - 1. Then, the threshold for the original problem is T = T' * d.\n\nThen, for the original problem, the sum is:\n\nsum_{x=0}^m f(x) = sum_{x=0}^{min(m, T - 1)} f(x) + sum_{x = max(T, 0)}^m (floor(x/d) + 1) if T <= m.\n\nBut wait, in the reduced problem, when a and b are coprime, the number of reachable positions for x is (number of reachable positions in reduced problem). For the original problem, the number of reachable positions is the same as the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem, because each position is multiplied by d. For example, in the reduced problem, the positions are integers between 0 and x' = x/d. So, in the original problem, the positions are multiples of d, up to x. So the count is equal to the count of reachable positions in the reduced problem for x' = x/d.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the reduced problem, the positions are integers between 0 and x'. But in the original problem, the positions are multiples of d between 0 and x. So for the original problem, the count is equal to the count in the reduced problem for x' = floor(x / d). Because if in the reduced problem, the frog can reach k positions, then in the original problem, those positions are multiplied by d, and thus are within [0, x] only if k*d <= x.\n\nSo for the original problem, the count f(x) is equal to the count of reachable positions in the reduced problem for x' = floor(x / d).\n\nBut how to compute the count in the reduced problem for x'?\n\nSo, for the original problem, the steps are:\n\nFor each x, compute x' = floor(x / d). Then compute the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem (with a' and b' coprime) for x'.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nFor the reduced problem (coprime a' and b'), we can precompute for all x' up to T' (which is a' + b' - 1) the number of reachable positions, and then for x' >= T', it's x' + 1.\n\nThus, the total sum for the original problem is:\n\nsum_{x=0}^m f(x) = sum_{x=0}^m [f_reduced(floor(x/d))]\n\nWhere f_reduced(x') is the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem for x'.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b), a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n\n2. Compute T' = a' + b' - 1.\n\n3. For the reduced problem, precompute an array reach_counts where reach_counts[x'] is the number of reachable positions for x' in the reduced problem.\n\n   For x' from 0 to T', compute reach_counts[x'].\n\n   For x' >= T', reach_counts[x'] = x' + 1.\n\n4. For the original problem, for each x in 0 to m, compute x' = floor(x / d), then get reach_counts[x'] if x' <= T', else x' + 1.\n\nBut how to compute reach_counts for the reduced problem?\n\nWe need to compute for x' from 0 to T' the number of reachable positions.\n\nHow to compute reach_counts[x']?\n\nWe can model this as a dynamic programming problem. For the reduced problem (coprime a' and b'), the reachable positions are those that can be reached by starting at 0 and adding a' or subtracting b', but never going below 0 or above x'.\n\nBut since x' can be up to T' = a' + b' - 1 (which is up to 2e5), we can precompute for each x' the number of reachable positions using BFS or DP.\n\nLet me think about how to compute reach_counts[x'] for all x' up to T'.\n\nLet me think of the reduced problem. For each x', the frog can reach certain positions. For example, for x' = 0, the frog can only be at 0. For x' = 1, if a' is 1, then it can reach 0 and 1. But if a' is larger than 1, then maybe not.\n\nBut how to compute for each x' the number of reachable positions?\n\nWe can model this as a graph problem. Each position is a node. There's an edge from k to k + a' if k + a' <= x', and an edge from k to k - b' if k - b' >= 0. The reachable positions from 0 are all nodes reachable via these edges.\n\nBut for x' up to 2e5, this is feasible with BFS.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor the reduced problem (a' and b' coprime), precompute for each x' from 0 to T' the number of reachable positions. This can be done with BFS for each x'? No, that would be O(T'^2), which is 4e10 operations for T'=2e5, which is impossible.\n\nAlternative idea: For all x' up to T', the reachable positions are the same as those reachable in the infinite case (without the x' limit), but capped at x'.\n\nBut how to find the reachable positions for all x' up to T'?\n\nAnother approach: For each x', the reachable positions are the union of all positions that can be reached by any sequence of jumps (adding a' or subtracting b') starting from 0, and not exceeding x'.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, once x' is large enough (T'), all positions are reachable. So for x' < T', the number of reachable positions can be computed with BFS for each x'?\n\nBut that would be too slow. For example, if T' is 2e5, and for each x' up to 2e5, we run BFS, that's O( (2e5)^2 ) operations, which is 4e10, which is way too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: Precompute all reachable positions for the infinite case (without x' limit), and then for each x', the number of reachable positions is the number of positions in this set that are <= x'.\n\nBut how to find the set of positions reachable in the infinite case?\n\nFor the reduced problem, the frog can reach any integer >= (some value). As discussed earlier, once x' is >= T' = a' + b' - 1, all positions are reachable. So for the infinite case, the set of reachable positions is {0, 1, ..., T'-1} ∪ {T', T'+1, ...} ?\n\nNo, because for x' >= T', all positions are reachable. So the reachable positions are all integers >= 0. Wait, no. Because in the infinite case, the frog can reach any integer >= 0? For example, in the case a'=5, b'=3 (coprime), the frog can reach any integer >= 0. Because once you can reach 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (as in the first example), then for any larger number, you can add a' steps.\n\nBut how to confirm this? For example, for any integer n >= 0, can you reach it?\n\nYes. Because once you can reach all numbers from 0 up to T', then any number larger than T' can be reached by adding a' steps. For example, n = T' + k*a'.\n\nBut how to compute the set of reachable positions for x' < T'?\n\nThis seems challenging. But perhaps we can precompute all reachable positions up to T' using BFS once, and then for any x', the count is the number of positions in the precomputed set that are <= x'.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor the reduced problem (a' and b' coprime):\n\n- Perform a BFS starting from 0, and mark all positions that can be reached, without exceeding T'.\n\nBut how to do this? Because during the BFS, when moving forward by a', you can go beyond T', but we need to cap it at T'.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of determining which positions are reachable in the infinite case, we can consider that once a position is reached, adding a' steps can reach higher positions. However, during BFS, we can process positions up to T', and for positions beyond T', we can note that they are reachable.\n\nBut this seems complex. Alternatively, since T' is a' + b' -1, and for x' >= T', all positions are reachable, then during BFS, we can process all positions up to T', and then for any x' >= T', the count is x' + 1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor the reduced problem:\n\n- Run BFS from 0, and for each position k, we can reach k + a' and k - b', as long as they are >=0 and <= T'.\n\nBut during the BFS, we can mark all positions that are reachable. Then, for x' < T', the count is the number of positions in the reachable set that are <= x'. For x' >= T', the count is x' + 1.\n\nBut how to perform this BFS?\n\nWe can create a boolean array reachable of size T'+1. Initially, reachable[0] = True. Then, for each position k in 0..T', if reachable[k] is True, then we can add k + a' (if <= T') and k - b' (if >=0). We can use BFS or DFS to explore all reachable positions.\n\nOnce this is done, for any x' in 0..T', the count is the number of positions in reachable that are <=x'.\n\nBut for x' >= T', the count is x' + 1.\n\nSo this approach would work.\n\nOnce we have this reachable array, we can precompute a prefix sum array for the counts up to each x'.\n\nFor example, prefix_sum[x'] = number of positions in reachable that are <=x'.\n\nOnce we have this prefix_sum array, for any x' in the original problem, we can compute the count as follows:\n\nif x' < T': prefix_sum[x']\n\nelse: x' + 1\n\nSo, putting it all together, the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b), a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n\n2. If a' == 0 or b' == 0 (but since a and b are positive integers, this can't happen).\n\n3. Compute T' = a' + b' - 1.\n\n4. For the reduced problem (a', b'), perform BFS to find all positions reachable up to T'.\n\n   a. Initialize a boolean array reachable of size T'+1, with reachable[0] = True.\n\n   b. Use a queue to perform BFS. For each position k in the queue, add k+a' if <= T' and not yet marked. Also add k - b' if >=0 and not yet marked.\n\n   c. After BFS, compute prefix_sum array where prefix_sum[x'] is the number of positions reachable up to x'.\n\n5. For the original problem, for each x in 0 to m:\n\n   a. Compute x' = floor(x / d).\n\n   b. If x' <= T', then count is prefix_sum[x'].\n\n   c. Else, count is x' + 1.\n\n6. Sum all these counts for x from 0 to m.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints and then compute the sum of these values for all positions from 0 to a given integer m. The solution involves leveraging mathematical insights and efficient algorithms to handle large input sizes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mathematical Insight**: The frog's movements are constrained by two positive integers `a` and `b`. The key insight is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. This allows us to reduce the problem size by dividing `a` and `b` by their gcd.\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For the reduced problem where `a` and `b` are coprime, we use BFS to determine all reachable positions up to a certain threshold. This threshold is derived from the sum of `a` and `b`.\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: After determining all reachable positions using BFS, we construct a prefix sum array to quickly compute the number of reachable positions for any given range.\n4. **Efficient Summation**: Using the prefix sum array and the threshold value, we efficiently compute the required sum over the range from 0 to m.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a_prime = a // d\n    b_prime = b // d\n    \n    if a_prime == 0 or b_prime == 0:\n        # This case shouldn't happen since a and b are positive\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    T_prime = a_prime + b_prime - 1\n    max_x_prime = T_prime\n    \n    # Precompute reachable positions for the reduced problem\n    reachable = [False] * (max_x_prime + 1)\n    reachable[0] = True\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(0)\n    \n    while q:\n        k = q.popleft()\n        # Jump forward by a_prime\n        next_pos = k + a_prime\n        if next_pos <= max_x_prime and not reachable[next_pos]:\n            reachable[next_pos] = True\n            q.append(next_pos)\n        # Jump backward by b_prime\n        next_pos = k - b_prime\n        if next_pos >= 0 and not reachable[next_pos]:\n            reachable[next_pos] = True\n            q.append(next_pos)\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix_sum = [0] * (max_x_prime + 1)\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(max_x_prime + 1):\n        if reachable[i]:\n            count += 1\n        prefix_sum[i] = count\n    \n    total = 0\n    for x in range(m + 1):\n        x_prime = x // d\n        if x_prime <= max_x_prime:\n            cnt = prefix_sum[x_prime]\n        else:\n            cnt = x_prime + 1\n        total += cnt\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into the variables `m`, `a`, and `b`.\n2. **Reduction Using GCD**: The problem is simplified by dividing `a` and `b` by their gcd, reducing them to coprime integers `a_prime` and `b_prime`.\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold `T_prime` is calculated based on the sum of the reduced values `a_prime` and `b_prime`.\n4. **BFS for Reachable Positions**: Using BFS, we determine all positions reachable within the threshold `T_prime` for the reduced problem.\n5. **Prefix Sum Array**: This array helps quickly determine the number of reachable positions for any given range up to `T_prime`.\n6. **Summation Over Range**: For each position from 0 to `m`, we compute the number of reachable positions using the prefix sum array or the formula for values beyond the threshold, summing these values efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle large input sizes efficiently by leveraging mathematical insights and preprocessing steps.",
