The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then check who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats after some steps, so that we can compute the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, then add the remainder.\n\nLet me think about how the moves are determined. For Nikephoros, his moves are cyclic through his sequence A. So for round i (assuming zero-based?), his move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, his move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for each round i (from 0 to n-1) what the moves are, then determine who wins.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't check each round. So we need to find the number of rounds where Nikephoros loses, and the same for Polycarpus.\n\nThe challenge is to find the number of rounds where A's move beats B's move, and vice versa, over all n rounds.\n\nSo the idea is to find the number of times in the combined cycle of A and B sequences where each possible pair occurs, then multiply by the number of full cycles, and add the partial cycle.\n\nBut what's the combined cycle? Since A repeats every m rounds and B repeats every k rounds, the combined cycle length is the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's denote LCM(m, k) as lcm. So the pattern of moves between A and B will repeat every lcm rounds.\n\nSo, for example, if m=3 and k=2, the LCM is 6. So every 6 rounds, the same sequence of move pairs repeats.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to period-1, determine the outcome (whether A wins, B wins, or draw). Record the number of times A loses (so B wins) and B loses (A wins) in this period.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period.\n\n4. The remaining rounds after full periods is remainder = n % period.\n\n5. So, the total A losses would be total_periods * (number of B wins in one period) + number of B wins in the first 'remainder' rounds of the period.\n\nSimilarly for B losses.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of B wins and A wins in the period and in the remainder?\n\nSo first, for each of the period rounds, we can precompute the moves of A and B, check who wins, and count the number of times each loses.\n\nBut since the period can be up to m*k (since LCM(m,k) <= m*k), and m and k are up to 1000, the maximum period is 1000*1000 = 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute the period as LCM(m, k).\n\nThen for each i in 0 to period-1:\n\n- Get A's move: A[i % m]\n\n- Get B's move: B[i % k]\n\n- Determine the outcome.\n\nCount for each of these:\n\ncount_a_loses: number of times B wins (so Nikephoros loses)\n\ncount_b_loses: number of times A wins (so Polycarpus loses)\n\nOnce we have these counts for one period, then:\n\ntotal_a_loses = total_periods * count_a_loses + count_in_remainder_a_loses\n\nSame for total_b_loses.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the count_in_remainder_a_loses, which is the number of B wins in the first 'remainder' rounds of the period.\n\nSo for the remainder rounds, we need to check each of the first 'remainder' rounds in the period, and count how many times B wins, and same for A.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B)\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute for each i in 0 to period-1:\n\n   a_move = A[i % m]\n\n   b_move = B",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a large number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Strategy**: Each player's moves are determined by a sequence that they cycle through repeatedly. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is \"RPS\", his moves will be R, P, S, R, P, S, and so on.\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Since both players use cyclic strategies, the combined sequence of moves will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This LCM value gives us the period after which the move pairs repeat.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the potentially very large number of rounds (up to 2 billion), we need an efficient approach. We calculate the number of losses in one full period and then use this to compute the total losses over all periods, plus any remaining rounds after the full periods.\n\n4. **Outcome Determination**: For each round within one period, determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors. Count the number of losses for each player within one period and use this to extrapolate the total losses over all rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)  # Draw\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)  # A wins, B loses\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)  # B wins, A loses\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    count_a_loses = 0\n    count_b_loses = 0\n    \n    # Precompute for one period\n    for i in range(period):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        a_loss, b_loss = get_outcome(a_move, b_move)\n        count_a_loses += a_loss\n        count_b_loses += b_loss\n    \n    total_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    # Now calculate the remainder part\n    remainder_a = 0\n    remainder_b = 0\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        a_loss, b_loss = get_outcome(a_move, b_move)\n        remainder_a += a_loss\n        remainder_b += b_loss\n    \n    total_a = total_periods * count_a_loses + remainder_a\n    total_b = total_periods * count_b_loses + remainder_b\n    \n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is calculated to determine the period after which the move pairs repeat.\n\n3. **Outcome Calculation**: For each round within one period, we determine the outcome and count the losses for each player.\n\n4. **Total Losses Calculation**: Using the counts from one period, we compute the total losses over all full periods and add the losses from the remaining rounds after the last full period.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating nature of the sequences, ensuring the solution is computed in linear time relative to the LCM of the sequence lengths, which is feasible given the constraints.",
