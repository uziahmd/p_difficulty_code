The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nThe input is n, then the sequences A and B. The output is two numbers: Nikephoros's red spots (his losses) and Polycarpus's (his losses).\n\nFirst, let's think about how to model their moves. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find what move each player makes. Since their sequences are cyclic, for round i, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round one by one. So simulating each round is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find out for each possible pair of moves (a, b) in the sequences, how many times they occur in the rounds, and then compute the number of wins for each player.\n\nBut since the sequences repeat, perhaps we can find the total number of times each pair (a, b) occurs over all n rounds, and then calculate the number of wins based on that.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's first find for each round, the move of A and B. The problem is that the sequences repeat, so the pattern of moves repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles.\n\nSo the idea is to find the number of full cycles of the combined pattern (of length LCM(m, k)) and then the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nLet's compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it T. Then, each T rounds, the pattern of moves for A and B repeats. So for example, if m=3 and k=2, then LCM(3,2)=6. So in each 6 rounds, the pairs of moves repeat.\n\nSo, for n rounds, we can compute how many full T-length cycles there are (let's call it full_cycles = n // T), and the remaining rounds (remainder = n % T). Then, for each full cycle, we can compute the number of wins for each player, multiply by full_cycles, and then add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the number of wins per T rounds?\n\nFor each of the T rounds, we can compute the moves of A and B, then determine who wins. Then sum up the number of wins for each player in that T rounds. Then multiply by full_cycles. Then process the remainder rounds similarly.\n\nBut T can be up to m*k. Since m and k are up to 1000, T could be up to 1e6. Which is manageable, because even for 1e6 rounds, processing them once is feasible.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute m = len(A), k = len(B). Compute T = LCM(m, k).\n\n2. Precompute for each of the T rounds, the moves of A and B. Then compute for each of these rounds, whether A wins, B wins, or draw.\n\n3. Sum the number of A wins (which contribute to Nikephoros's loss, since Nikephoros is A, and if he loses, he gets a spot) and B wins (contribute to Polycarpus's loss). Wait, no. Wait, when A's move is a, B's move is b. Who wins?\n\nWe need to check for each pair (a, b) which one wins. For example:\n\nIf a is R and b is S: A wins (rock beats scissors). So Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (since he lost). So Nikephoros's loss count increases when he loses, which is when B's move beats A's.\n\nSo for each round, if A's move beats B's, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is not increased, but Polycarpus's is increased by 1). Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So in each round, if A wins, then B is the loser, so B gets a spot. So Nikephoros's red spots are the number of times he lost. So when B wins, Nikephoros gets a spot. Similarly, when A loses, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round:\n\nif a beats b: B loses, so",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over `n` rounds, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to handle very large values of `n` (up to 2 billion) without simulating each round individually.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Cyclic Nature of Moves**:\n   - Each player's move sequence repeats cyclically.\n   - For round `i`, Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]` and Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\n\n2. **Pattern Repeats Every LCM(m, k) Rounds**:\n   - Since both sequences repeat, the combined pattern of moves will repeat every `T = LCM(m, k)` rounds.\n   - This allows us to precompute the number of wins for each player in one full cycle and then multiply by the number of such cycles in `n` rounds.\n\n3. **Efficient Computation**:\n   - We compute how many full cycles of length `T` fit into `n` rounds, and handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n---\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Compute the LCM of the lengths of A and B**.\n2. **Simulate One Full Cycle (T rounds)**:\n   - For each round in this cycle, determine who wins based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors.\n   - Count how many times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose in this cycle.\n3. **Multiply the counts by the number of full cycles** in `n` rounds.\n4. **Simulate the Remaining Rounds** after the full cycles.\n5. **Sum up the total losses** for each player.\n\n---\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef determine_winner(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)  # Draw\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)  # A wins, B loses\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)  # B wins, A loses\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    lcm = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    # Precompute results for one full cycle of length lcm\n    a_wins = 0\n    b_wins = 0\n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        win_a, win_b = determine_winner(a_move, b_move)\n        a_wins += win_a\n        b_wins += win_b\n\n    # Number of full cycles and remainder\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n\n    total_a = a_wins * full_cycles\n    total_b = b_wins * full_cycles\n\n    # Process the remaining rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        win_a, win_b = determine_winner(a_move, b_move)\n        total_a += win_a\n        total_b += win_b\n\n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **determine_winner**: Determines which player (if any) wins a round based on the rules.\n- **LCM Calculation**: Used to identify the repeating cycle of moves.\n- **Cycle Simulation**: Efficiently computes the number of wins per full cycle and scales it up using the number of full cycles.\n- **Remaining Rounds**: Simulated directly for the leftover rounds after full cycles are processed.\n\nThis approach ensures that even with `n` as large as 2 billion, the solution runs in O(LCM(m, k)) time, which is efficient since `m` and `k` are at most 1000.",
