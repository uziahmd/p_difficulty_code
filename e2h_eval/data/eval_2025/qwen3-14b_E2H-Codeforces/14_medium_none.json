    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those n's in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros in n!. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. For example, when n increases by 1, f(n) either stays the same or increases by 1 (if the new n is a multiple of 5, maybe more).\n\nWait, but when n crosses a multiple of 5, like 25, then adding 25 would add two zeros. So, for example, f(24) is 4 (since 24//5=4, 24//25=0). Then f(25) is 6 (25//5=5, 25//25=1, total 6). So between 25 and 25, the count jumps by 2. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros? Wait, because between 24 (which has 4 zeros) and 25 (which has 6), there's a jump. So for m=5, there are no n's. So the answer would be 0.\n\nBut in the sample input, when m=1, the output is 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Let's check:\n\nFor 5! = 120 → 1 zero. 6! is 720 → 1 zero. Similarly up to 9! which is 362880 → 1 zero. Then 10! adds another 5, so 2 zeros. So for m=1, the numbers are from 5 to 9, inclusive. So five numbers.\n\nSo the key is to find all n where f(n) = m. But how?\n\nThe approach I need is to find the possible n's that would produce exactly m trailing zeros. But since f(n) is non-decreasing, the values of n that give exactly m zeros would form a contiguous range. However, sometimes there may be no such n. For example, when m is between f(n) and f(n+1) but there's a jump.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are multiple n's. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower and upper bounds of n that would give exactly m zeros. But how to find that?\n\nLet me think about binary search. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, we can find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and the largest n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) would be the possible n's. But how to find these?\n\nBut first, we need to check if there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If there isn't, then output 0. Otherwise, the count is (upper - lower + 1).\n\nBut how to find the lower and upper bounds?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimum n such that f(n) >= m. Let's call this low_n.\n\n2. Then check if f(low_n) == m. If not, then there's no solution. So return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the maximum n where f(n) = m. Let's call it high_n.\n\nThen the numbers from low_n to high_n would be the valid ones. But how to find high_n?\n\nAlternatively, find the first n where f(n) = m, and then find the first n where f(n) = m+1. Then the numbers between the first and the second minus one would be the valid ones.\n\nYes. Because for example, if the first occurrence of m is at n_start, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at n_end, then all numbers from n_start to n_end-1 will have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Let's call this start.\n\n- Find the smallest n where f(n) = m+1. Let's call this end.\n\n- Then, the numbers from start to end-1 are the valid n's. So the count is end - start.\n\nBut how to find the start and end?\n\nBut how to find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Well, perhaps using binary search. Because for the function f(n), it's non-decreasing. So for example, to find the first occurrence of m, we can use binary search.\n\nWait, but how to find if m exists. For example, if there's no n such that f(n) = m, then the answer is 0.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Let's call this lower.\n\nThen check if f(lower) == m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nIf yes, then find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this upper.\n\nThen, the numbers from lower to upper-1 are the valid ones. The count is upper - lower.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause for example, let's say m is 5. Suppose that the first occurrence of m is at n= some value, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at some higher value. All numbers between the first occurrence and the first occurrence of m+1 minus one will have exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo, the steps for the problem:\n\nGiven m, we need to:\n\n- Check if there exists any n such that f(n) = m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, collect all n's between the first occurrence and the last occurrence (which is upper -1).\n\nSo the first thing is to implement a function that counts the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nLet me write that function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Well, perhaps using binary search.\n\nBut first, we need to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this low_n.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nThe binary search can be done between 0 and 5*m. Because for example, m is the number of zeros. Since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, so the minimal n for m zeros is at least 5*m. Wait, no. For example, m=1, the minimal n is 5. 5*1=5. But for m=5, the minimal n is 25? Let's see: count_zeros(25) is 6. Oh, so that's not correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, the maximum number of zeros for n is count_zeros(n). So for m, the minimal n that gives at least m zeros can be found via binary search. But what's the upper bound for binary search?\n\nWell, since for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because for each 5 in 5*m, you get at least one zero. For example, 5*m divided by 5 is m. So count_zeros(5*m) is m + (5m//25) + ... which is at least m. So 5*m is an upper bound. But maybe even lower. However, for binary search, it's safe to use 5*m as upper bound.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we find that, we can check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, we then find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the numbers between the first n and the second n minus one are the valid numbers.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input where m=1:\n\nlow_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 1. That is 5. Then check if count_zeros(5) is 1. Yes. Then find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2. Which is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (10-1) are valid. That's 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's see. Let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25? No. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. So for m=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is greater than 5. So then, there is no n with exactly 5 zeros. Hence output is 0.\n\nSo the code would proceed as follows:\n\nImplement a function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nLet me write that function.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nWait, but for example, for target=1, the function returns 5, which is correct.\n\nSo once we have this function, then for the given m, we can find the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this n_low. Then check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, then return 0. Else, find n_high which is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high -1 are the valid ones.\n\nSo the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to handle cases where m is very large? Like m=1e5. Well, the binary search would take O(log (5*m)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, n must be positive. Wait, the problem says \"positive integers n\". So for m=0, the possible n's are 1-4. But according to the input constraints, m is between 1 and 1e5. So the input m is at least 1. So the code doesn't have to handle m=0.\n\nSo for the given m:\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: then output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from n_low to n_high -1, inclusive.\n\nso the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut wait, for example, when m=1, n_low is 5, n_high is 10. So 10-5=5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6. Let's see. For n=25, count_zeros is 6. Then find_min_n(6) is 25. Then find_min_n(7) is 25? Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So for target=7, find_min_n(7) would be 25? No. Let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6. So the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7 is 25+ something. Let's compute for 25: 6. 26: 6. 27:6. 28:6. 29:6. 30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1. Total 7. So find_min_n(7) is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29 (30-1) are valid. So 5 numbers. So for m=6, the answer is 5 numbers (25-29).\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\nSo the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to generate the list of numbers? Well, if the count is k, then the numbers are [n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1].\n\nSo for example, for m=1, the list is 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the code would generate that list.\n\nBut what if the count is zero? Well, that's handled by checking if count_zeros(n_low) is m.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the case where m is such that no n exists. For example, m=5.\n\nIn that case, n_low is find_min_n(5). Let's see:\n\nfor target=5, find_min_n(5) would be 25?\n\nWait, let's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 (as earlier). count_zeros(25) is 6. So during binary search for target=5, the code would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Which is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So the code would output 0.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the find_min_n function.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nThen:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but for example, when m=1, the range is from 5 to 10-1=9. So range(n_low, n_high) is 5 to 10, but in Python range is exclusive on the upper end. So range(5, 10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct. So yes, the code would generate that.\n\nBut wait, the code for the else part is:\n\nprint(k) followed by the list.\n\nBut in the sample input, for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut in the code, when m=1, the code would generate range(n_low, n_high) which is 5 to 10 (exclusive), which is 5,6,7,8,9. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about when m=6, n_high is 30. So the range is 25 to 30 → 25,26,27,28,29. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says that m is between 1 and 1e5, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5? Let's see.\n\nBut the code should handle that. The find_min_n function uses 5*target as upper bound. For target=1e5, 5*target is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the binary search for find_min_n. For example, for m=1e5, the code would perform binary search between 0 and 5*1e5.\n\nBut the count_zeros function for n=5*1e5 would be:\n\ncount_zeros(5e5) = 5e5//5 + 5e5//25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + ... which is more than 1e5. So the upper bound is safe.\n\nBut what if the actual n is larger than 5*m? Well, for example, m=1, the upper bound is 5*1=5, but the minimal n is 5. So the code works. For m=6, the upper bound is 5*6=30, which is the correct n_high for m=6 (since find_min_n(6) is 25, which is less than 30). So the code works.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(1) → returns 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nn_high = find_min_n(2). Let's compute find_min_n(2):\n\nbinary search for target=2.\n\nInitially low=0, high=10.\n\nmid=5 → count_zeros(5)=1 < 2 → low=6.\n\nmid= (6+10)/2=8 → count_zeros(8) is 1 < 2 → low=9.\n\nmid= (9+10)/2=9.5 → 9.5 is floored to 9. count_zeros(9) is 1 < 2 → low=10. Now low=high=10. Return 10.\n\nSo n_high is 10. So the numbers are 5 to 10-1=9. Which is correct.\n\nSample Output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. Then, n_low is find_min_n(5) → let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(5) would search for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4, count_zeros(25) is 6. So the code would return 25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → output 0. Which matches the sample input's second case.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m is 6? For example, the code would return 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The output is 5 numbers (25-29).\n\nNow, the code needs to output the numbers in increasing order. The code uses range(n_low, n_high), which is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the problem:\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So the code reads m from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for input ['1', '5'], the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nWait, the sample input is given as a list, but in reality, the input is a single line. Wait, the original problem's sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the way the sample is presented. Probably, the first input is m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code needs to read a single integer m from input. So the code should be:\n\nRead m from input, process, and output the required answer.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead m as input().strip()\n\nBut the code must read from stdin, and output to stdout.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list, but that's probably a formatting error. So the code should read m as an integer from standard input.\n\nNow, coding:\n\nBut in Python, for the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but when k is zero? Well, that can't happen because if count_zeros(n_low) is m, then n_high is the first n where count_zeros is m+1. So n_high must be larger than n_low. Because for example, if n_low is the first occurrence of m, then n_high is the first occurrence of m+1, which is after n_low. So the difference is at least 1.\n\nBut let's see. Suppose m is such that there is only one n (like m=6, but for some reason, the next is m+1 at n_low+1). Then k would be 1, and the list is [n_low].\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, testing the code with m=5, which should return 0.\n\nBut what about m=6?\n\nLet me compute n_low for m=6: find_min_n(6) returns 25, since count_zeros(25) is 6. Then n_high is find_min_n(7) which is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So the code outputs 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother case: m=2. Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. So n_low=10. find_min_n(3) is 15 (count_zeros(15) is 3). So the numbers are 10-14. Which is 5 numbers. Let's check:\n\n10! → 2 zeros. 11! → same. 12! → same. 13! → same. 14! → same. 15! → 3 zeros. So yes, 5 numbers.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nNow, what about m=3?\n\nn_low is 15 (count_zeros(15) is 3). n_high is find_min_n(4). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3. count_zeros(20) is 4 (20/5=4, 20/25=0. So 4). So find_min_n(4) returns 20. So numbers from 15 to 19. Which is 5 numbers. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, what about when m is 24?\n\nLet me think. For example, 24 is the count_zeros(100) ?\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 100//5 + 100//25 + 100//125 = 20 +4 +0 = 24. So for m=24, n_low is 100. Then find_min_n(25) would be 100?\n\nNo. Because count_zeros(100) is 24. So for target=25, the find_min_n would look for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=25.\n\nLet me compute count_zeros(100) = 24. count_zeros(101) is same as 100. count_zeros(104) is same. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Sum is 25. So find_min_n(25) returns 105. So the numbers are from 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. So code outputs 5, and the numbers 100-104.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when m is 100000? Well, the code would have to compute find_min_n(100000). But for that, the binary search would take O(log(5*1e5)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut what about the upper bound for find_min_n? For example, when target is 1e5, the upper bound is 5*1e5=500000. But the actual n could be higher? Let's see.\n\nSuppose for target=1e5, the required n is such that count_zeros(n) = 1e5.\n\nBut for n=5*1e5, count_zeros(n) is 5*1e5 /5 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + ... which is larger than 1e5. So the upper bound is sufficient.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. Also, note that in the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0. So the code correctly outputs 0 in that case.\n\nNow, the code is ready. Let me code it accordingly.\n\nBut also, note that when the code prints the numbers, for example, when k is 5, the code prints '5' followed by the numbers. But in Python, when you do print(' '.join(...)), it will print the numbers separated by space. But for the first sample, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code does:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nWhich would output two lines.

The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the valid values of $ n $ using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s dictates the number of trailing zeros.\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: A helper function `count_zeros(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing up the integer divisions of $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc.\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Using binary search, we find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros is at least $ m $ (denoted as `n_low`). Similarly, we find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros is at least $ m+1 $ (denoted as `n_high`).\n4. **Validation**: If `count_zeros(n_low)` is not equal to $ m $, it means there are no valid $ n $ values for the given $ m $, and we output 0. Otherwise, the valid $ n $ values lie between `n_low` and `n_high - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least `target`. The upper bound for the binary search is set to $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, which is a safe estimate based on the distribution of factors of 5.\n3. **Main Logic**: After determining `n_low` and `n_high`, we check if `n_low` indeed results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, we print 0. Otherwise, we compute the range of valid $ n $ values and print them.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $.",
