    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those n's in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m zeros. But how to find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Let's think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. So for example, when n increases, f(n) can stay the same or increase, but never decrease.\n\nSo for a given m, there might be a range of n's where f(n) equals m. But how to find that range?\n\nWait, but for some m, there might be no n's. For example, if m is 5, let's see. Let's compute f(24) = 24/5=4, 24/25=0 → total 4. f(25) is 25/5 + 25/25 = 5+1=6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where f(n) is 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be 0.\n\nSo the first step is to find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and then check if there are consecutive numbers that also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, looking at the sample input. For m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. Let's compute f(5) = 1. Then f(6) is also 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly up to 9. Then at 10, it's 2. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers. So the possible numbers can be a range of 5 consecutive numbers. But why?\n\nSo the idea is that for some m, there's a range of numbers where f(n) equals m. However, when there's a jump in the count, like when adding a multiple of 5, the count increases by more than 1. For example, when n is 25, adding 25 adds two 5s (since 25 is 5^2), so the count increases by 2. So between 24 (count 4) and 25 (count 6), there's a jump. Therefore, for m=5, there's no n.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then check if there exists such n. If not, return 0.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n for a given m?\n\nThis seems like a binary search problem. Because the function f(n) is monotonically increasing. So for a given m, we can find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) equals m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the range of numbers where f(n) equals m.\n\nWait, but how to find the numbers where f(n) equals m. Let's think.\n\nOnce we find the minimal n where f(n) = m, then the next numbers (n+1, etc.) will have f(n) either same or higher. So the maximum n where f(n) = m is the number where f(n) is m, but f(n+1) is m+1. So the range is from the minimal n to the maximal n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find that range?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible numbers n that satisfy f(n) = m can be found by checking the numbers around the value where f(n) = m. But how?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Let's call it low. Then find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Let's call it high. Then the numbers from low to high inclusive are the solutions. The count is high - low + 1. But how to find low and high?\n\nBut how to find if there exists any n where f(n) = m. For example, if m is 5, then there is no such n.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Use binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this n_min. Then check if f(n_min) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and then find the maximal n where f(n) = m.\n\nWait, but how to find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Because once you find the first n where f(n) = m, the next numbers may also have the same count. So the maximal n is the first number where f(n) = m and f(n+1) > m. So perhaps, for the maximal n, it's the first n where f(n) = m and f(n+1) is m+1.\n\nAlternatively, since f(n) is non-decreasing, once we find the first occurrence of m, the last occurrence is the first occurrence of m+1 minus 1. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the first occurrence of m is at n_low. Then, the first occurrence of m+1 is at n_high. Then all numbers from n_low to n_high -1 will have f(n) = m. So the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to find n_high?\n\nSo for example, in the sample input m=1. The first occurrence of m=1 is at n=5. The first occurrence of m=2 is at n=10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFind the first n where f(n) = m. Let's call it lower. Then find the first n where f(n) = m+1. Let's call it upper. Then the numbers from lower to upper -1 are all the solutions. So the count is upper - lower.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of m and m+1?\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of m. Because binary search can find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if that value is exactly m. If not, then there is no solution. Otherwise, that is the lower bound.\n\nSimilarly for m+1.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nFor a given m, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Let's call this n_low. How? Well, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m, then check if it's equal to m. If not, return 0.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. That's a standard binary search problem.\n\nThen, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this n_high. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high - 1 are all the numbers with exactly m trailing zeros. So the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut wait, what if there's no n where f(n) = m+1? Like, if m is very large. But since m can be up to 1e5, but for any m, there exists some n where f(n) = m+1. Or maybe not? Well, for example, if m is 1e5, then there's definitely some n where f(n) is m+1. Because as n increases, the count increases. So the binary search for m+1 will find a value.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- Compute the lower bound (n_low) for m.\n\n- Compute the lower bound (n_high) for m+1.\n\n- The numbers between n_low and n_high -1 are the solutions.\n\nSo the count is (n_high - n_low).\n\nBut how to compute the lower bound for a given target (like m or m+1)?\n\nLet me think about the binary search function. Let's write a helper function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for a given target, find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= target. How?\n\nThe binary search can be done between low=0 and high=5*target (since for n=5*target, the count_zeros(n) is at least target, because each 5 contributes at least one, so 5*target /5 = target. But maybe higher. But for binary search, we need an upper bound. So perhaps 5*m is sufficient. But for m=1e5, 5*1e5 is 5e5. Which is manageable.\n\nBut maybe even higher. For example, for m=1e5, the actual n could be higher. Let me think. For example, for m=1e5, the number of zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + ... which is roughly n/5 + n/25 + ... = n/4. So solving n/4 = m gives n=4m. So 4*m is a better upper bound. So for binary search, the upper bound can be 5*m, but perhaps 4*m is sufficient. But to be safe, perhaps using 5*m.\n\nBut for binary search, even if the upper bound is larger than needed, it's okay. So let's proceed.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nOnce we find that n, then check if count_zeros(n) == target. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nSo for the original problem:\n\nOnce we find n_low (the minimal n for target m), and n_high (the minimal n for target m+1), then the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the solutions. The count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut wait, what if the count_zeros(n_high -1) is m? Because n_high is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So for n_high-1, count_zeros(n_high-1) is <= m. But since n_high is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1, then count_zeros(n_high-1) is < m+1. So it could be m or less. But since n_low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, and count_zeros(n_low) is m, then for n_high-1, the count_zeros is >= m. So it must be exactly m.\n\nSo the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are all the numbers with exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut then, the count is (n_high -1) - n_low + 1 = n_high - n_low.\n\nYes. So the number of solutions is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo the algorithm steps for a given m:\n\n1. Compute the minimal n_low such that count_zeros(n_low) >= m. Check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n2. Compute the minimal n_high such that count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1. Then the number of solutions is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut then, the list of numbers is [n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1].\n\nSo for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nn_low is 5, since count_zeros(5) is 1. n_high is 10 (since count_zeros(10) is 2). So the numbers are 5-9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example, m=5. Let's compute n_low for m=5. Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 = 4. count_zeros(25) = 5 + 1 = 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So there are no solutions. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo that's how it works.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, implement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nThen, implement a function to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= target. Let's call this function find_min_n(target).\n\nImplementing find_min_n(target):\n\nWe can use binary search. The lower bound is 0, upper bound can be 5*target (or higher, but 5*target is safe). For example, for target=1, upper is 5.\n\nBut for large targets, 5*target may be big. But for m up to 1e5, 5*1e5 is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the binary search:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = 5 * target\n\nwhile low < high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n    if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n        high = mid\n\n    else:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nBut what if the target is 0? Well, in the problem, m is at least 1, so maybe not needed here.\n\nOnce we have find_min_n, then:\n\nFor the given m, compute n_low = find_min_n(m). Check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\nElse compute n_high = find_min_n(m+1). Then the answer is n_high - n_low numbers, which are n_low, n_low+1,...,n_high-1.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef solve(m):\n\n    def count_zeros(n):\n\n        count =0\n\n        while n>0:\n\n            n = n//5\n\n            count +=n\n\n        return count\n\n    def find_min_n(target):\n\n        low =0\n\n        high =5*target\n\n        while low < high:\n\n            mid = (low + high)//2\n\n            if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n                high = mid\n\n            else:\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n        return low\n\n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n        return\n\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = n_high - n_low\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5 6 7 8 9. The code would generate range(n_low, n_high) which is range(5, 10) → 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct. So yes.\n\nBut what about when m is 5? For m=5, n_low = find_min_n(5) → let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(5) would search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute for n=24: count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 = 4. For 25: 6. So the binary search would find 25 as the minimal n where count_zeros >=5. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So the code returns 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(6) is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) is 25? No. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(26) is 6. count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → 7. So find_min_n(7) is 25? No, wait. Let's think.\n\nWait, find_min_n(7) is looking for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7. Let's see:\n\nAt n=25, count is 6. So the binary search would proceed to find the first n where count is >=7. Which would be 25+1=26? No. Let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6. For 26, same. For 29, same. For 30, it's 7. So the minimal n is 25? No. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7 is 25? No. Because 25's count is 6. So the minimal n is 30?\n\nWait, no. Let's compute for n=25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30:\n\ncount_zeros(25) = 6.\n\ncount_zeros(26) = same as 25, since 26//5 is 5, 26//25 is 1. 5+1=6.\n\nSame for 29. For 30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1, 6+1=7. So the minimal n is 25? No. The first n where count_zeros(n) >=7 is 30. So find_min_n(7) would return 30. Thus, for m=6, n_low is 25, n_high is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nThus, the code would generate that.\n\nBut how does the code find that? Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(7) is called. The binary search starts with low=0, high=5*7=35.\n\nLet me simulate the binary search for target=7.\n\nInitially low=0, high=35.\n\nmid = 17. count_zeros(17) is 3. <7 → low becomes 18.\n\nmid = (18+35)/2 = 26.5 → 26. count_zeros(26) is 5+1=6 <7 → low becomes 27.\n\nmid is (27+35)/2 = 31. count_zeros(31) is 6 + 1 = 7. So >=7. So high becomes 31.\n\nNow low=27, high=31. mid is 29. count_zeros(29) is 5 + 1=6 <7 → low becomes 30.\n\nmid is (30+31)/2 = 30.5 → 30. count_zeros(30) is 6+1=7. So high becomes 30. Now low=30 and high=30. loop ends. returns 30. So yes. So n_high is 30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So the code works.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that case.\n\nNow, what about when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So we don't need to handle m=0. But the code would handle it if needed.\n\nNow, the code needs to read m from input, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for m=1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers. For m=5, the output is 0.\n\nBut the code for the sample input would be:\n\nFor example, the first sample input is m=1. The code computes n_low = find_min_n(1) → which is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed. Then find_min_n(2) is 10. So the numbers are 5 to 9. The count is 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. The code would find n_low = find_min_n(5) → 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nWhat if m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m starts from 1. So the code doesn't have to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: m=100000. Let's think about the binary search. For m=1e5, the code would compute find_min_n(1e5) and find_min_n(1e5+1). But how efficient is this?\n\nWell, the binary search for each find_min_n is O(log (5*target)), which for target=1e5 is O(log 5e5) steps, which is acceptable. And for each step, count_zeros is O(log n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. But looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows ['1', '5'], which probably represents two test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: the only line of input contains an integer m. But the sample input shows two lines. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is for two different test cases. Like, the first input is 1, the second is 5. So the code needs to process multiple test cases? Wait, but the problem says:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of inputs. But in the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So the code should read from stdin a single integer m.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the user is supposed to process multiple test cases? But the problem says:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one m per run.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes.\n\nSo the code should read one m from input, and output the answer for that m.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'] which perhaps represents two test cases. But the sample output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is for two separate runs. For example, the first input is 1, the output is the first line, and the second input is 5, output is 0. But the problem says that the code should process a single input. So perhaps the sample is written as a list of input examples. So the code is supposed to process a single m.\n\nTherefore, the code should read a single integer m from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is '1', and the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. The second input is '5' and the output is '0'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nSo the code in Python would read m from input, then process it.\n\nBut in the code, the code needs to read from stdin. So for example:\n\nRead m = int(input().strip())\n\nThen process as above.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code needs to handle cases where the answer is zero. For example, when m=5.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, when the code is to print the numbers, when k is zero, print 0. Else, print k, then the numbers.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nCheck if count_zeros(n_low) != m → output 0.\n\nElse compute n_high = find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1. The count is k = n_high - n_low.\n\nPrint k, then the numbers.\n\nBut in code, for the case when k is zero? Well, no. Because when n_low is found, count_zeros(n_low) is m. So n_high is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So n_high is at least n_low +1. So k is n_high -n_low. Which is at least 1? Not necessarily. For example, if m=6, and n_high is 30, and n_low is 25. Then k is 5. So it's possible.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's exactly one n. For example, m=2. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. count_zeros(11) is 2. count_zeros(14) is 2. count_zeros(15) is 3. So for m=2, n_low is 10, n_high is 15. So k is 5 numbers (10-14). So 5 numbers. So the code would output 5 numbers. But what if m is such that there's only one number? Let's think. For example, m=3. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15/5=3, 15/25=0. So total 3). count_zeros(16) is same. Up to 19. Then 20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0 → 4. So for m=3, the first occurrence is 15, and the first occurrence for m+1=4 is 20. So the numbers from 15 to 19. Which is 5 numbers again. Hmm. So why is that?\n\nBecause when you have a number that is a multiple of 5, but not of higher powers. So for example, 15 is 5*3, so adding 15 adds one 5. So the count increases by 1. So for m=3, there are 5 numbers. But what if there's a case where the count increases by more than one?\n\nLike m=5. But for that case, there's no solution.\n\nAnother example: m=6. As discussed earlier, there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo in general, the count is 5 numbers? Or sometimes zero?\n\nNo, for example, if m=24, let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5=19 + 99//25=3 + 99//125=0 → 22. Not enough. 100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0 → total 24. So for m=24, n_low is 100. Then for m+1=25, find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=25. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(101) same. ... count_zeros(104) same. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0 → 25. So n_high is 105. So the numbers are from 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. So again 5 numbers.\n\nSo it seems that the number of solutions is 0 or 5. But why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros function increases by 1 for each multiple of 5, but when there's a multiple of 25, it increases by 2, etc. So for example, when there's a number that adds two 5s (like 25), then the count_zeros jumps by 2. So between numbers before 25 and after, there's a gap.\n\nBut for the cases where there's a solution, the number of solutions is 5. But why?\n\nBecause when you have a number n where count_zeros(n) = m, and the next number where count_zeros increases is when you hit a multiple of 5. So the numbers from n to n+4 (if they are not multiples of higher powers) will all have the same count_zeros. But why?\n\nBecause for example, n=5, 6,7,8,9. All of these are not multiples of 5. So their count_zeros is same as 5. When you reach 10, which is multiple of 5, count_zeros increases by 1.\n\nSo the number of solutions is 5. But why?\n\nBecause when the count_zeros increases by exactly 1, the next occurrence is after 5 numbers. But when the count_zeros increases by more than 1, there is no solution.\n\nBut in the code, the code returns n_high -n_low. So for the case where the count increases by 1, the difference is 5. For example, in the sample input, n_high is 10, n_low is 5. 10-5=5. Which is correct. For the case of m=24, n_high is 105, n_low is 100. 105-100=5. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the count increases by more than 1? For example, for m=4. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 4 (20/5=4, 20/25=0. So 4). count_zeros(21) is 4. ... up to 24. count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=4, the n_low is 20. n_high is find_min_n(5) which is 25. So the numbers are from 20 to 24. Which is 5 numbers. So even though the count increases by 2, the code returns 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what's the count_zeros for 20 to 24? For 20, it's 4. For 24, it's 4. So yes, 5 numbers. So the code returns 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nSo in all cases where there is at least one solution, the code returns 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause the code finds the first occurrence of m, and the first occurrence of m+1. The difference between them is 5. But why?\n\nBecause for the first occurrence of m, the first occurrence of m+1 is 5 numbers after. But why?\n\nNot necessarily. For example, if m is 24, the first occurrence of m+1=25 is 105. Which is 5 numbers after 100. So yes.\n\nBut what if there's a case where the first occurrence of m+1 is more than 5 numbers after n_low?\n\nLet me think of a case. Let's imagine m is 24, and n_low is 100. Then the first occurrence of m+1 is 105. So difference is 5. What if there is a case where the first occurrence of m+1 is 6 numbers after?\n\nLet me think. Suppose m= some value where the next occurrence is after 5 numbers.\n\nFor example, take m= 6. The first occurrence is 25. The first occurrence of m+1=7 is 30. So 30-25=5. So again 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m= 29. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(115) = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n115//5 = 23, 115//25=4, 115//125=0. Total 27. Not enough. 120: 120//5=24, 120//25=4, 120//125=0. 24+4=28. Still not 29. 125: 125//5=25, 125//25=5, 125//125=1. Total 25+5+1=31. So for m=29, the first occurrence would be somewhere between 120 and 125. Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(124) = 124//5=24, 124//25=4, 124//125=0 → 28. Still not 29. So when does count_zeros reach 29?\n\nLet me try 125: count_zeros(125)=31. So perhaps there's no solution for m=29? Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe there's a number between 120 and 125 where count_zeros is 29. Let's check 120+5=125. So between 120 and 125, the count_zeros increases from 28 (for 120) to 31 (for 125). So for m=29, there's no solution. So the code would find n_low as find_min_n(29) which is 125 (since count_zeros(125) is 31 >=29). But since count_zeros(125) is not 29, the code returns 0.\n\nSo for m=29, the answer is 0. But for m=28, let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(28) is 120. count_zeros(120) is 24 +4 = 28. So yes. Then find_min_n(29) is 125. So the numbers are 120 to 124. Which is 5 numbers. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo even in this case, the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo it seems that whenever there is a solution, the number of solutions is 5. But why?\n\nBecause the code finds the first occurrence of m, and the first occurrence of m+1. The difference between them is 5. But why?\n\nBecause the first occurrence of m+1 is the first n where the count_zeros increases by 1. So for example, if the first occurrence of m is at n_low, then the next occurrence of m+1 is at n_low +5. Because the next multiple of 5 is n_low +5. But this depends on whether n_low is a multiple of 5.\n\nWait, for example, in the case where m=1, n_low is 5. The next occurrence of m+1=2 is 10. Which is 5 more than 5.\n\nIn the case of m=28, n_low is 120. The next occurrence of m+1=29 is 125. Which is 5 more than 120.\n\nIn the case of m=6, n_low is 25. The next occurrence is 30. Again 5 more.\n\nBut what if n_low is not a multiple of 5?\n\nWait, n_low is the first occurrence of m. Let's say m=2. For example, n_low is 10 (which is a multiple of 5). So the next occurrence is 15. Which is 5 more. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nBut suppose that n_low is not a multiple of 5. Is that possible?\n\nLet me think. For example, m=2. The first occurrence is 10. But what about m=3? The first occurrence is 15. Which is a multiple of 5. So it seems that the first occurrence of m is always a multiple of 5?\n\nIs that true?\n\nLet me think. For example, m=1. The first occurrence is 5. Which is a multiple of 5. For m=2, first occurrence is 10. For m=3, 15. For m=4, 20. For m=5, first occurrence is 25 (but count_zeros(25) is 6). So for m=5, there's no solution. But for m=6, first occurrence is 25. Which is a multiple of 5.\n\nSo it seems that the first occurrence of m is always a multiple of 5. Because the count_zeros increases by 1 when you reach a multiple of 5. Unless there's a higher power of 5.\n\nBut how to prove that?\n\nWell, the count_zeros(n) increases when n is a multiple of 5. So for example, when n increases from 4 to 5, count_zeros increases by 1. From ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the valid values of $ n $ using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of factors of 5.\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: Given the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zero count function, we can use binary search to efficiently find the smallest $ n $ such that $ n! $ has at least $ m $ trailing zeros. This helps in determining the range of valid $ n $ values.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**: Once we find the smallest $ n $ for $ m $ trailing zeros, we then find the smallest $ n $ for $ m+1 $ trailing zeros. The valid $ n $ values lie between these two points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    \n    def count_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        while n > 0:\n            n = n // 5\n            count += n\n        return count\n    \n    def find_min_n(target):\n        low = 0\n        high = 5 * target  # Upper bound for binary search\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n                high = mid\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        return low\n    \n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing the integer divisions of $ n $ by increasing powers of 5 until the quotient is zero.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that $ n! $ has at least a given number of trailing zeros. This is done by adjusting the search range based on the count of trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: \n   - Read the input value $ m $.\n   - Use `find_min_n` to determine the smallest $ n $ (n_low) where the trailing zeros count is at least $ m $.\n   - Check if this $ n $ actually results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, print 0.\n   - Determine the smallest $ n $ (n_high) where the trailing zeros count is at least $ m+1 $.\n   - The valid range of $ n $ values is from `n_low` to `n_high - 1`, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the valid range using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $.",
