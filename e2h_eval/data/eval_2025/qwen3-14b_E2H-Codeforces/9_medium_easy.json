Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So, the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time. So I need a smarter way.\n\nFirst, since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. Let me think about grouping all items by their weight. For each weight group, I can sort them in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight group, I can precompute the prefix sums so that for any number of items taken from that group, I can quickly get the total cost.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, if I take k items, the total cost would be the sum of the top k items. Similarly for weight 2 and 3. Then, the problem becomes how to choose how many items to take from each group such that the total weight is <= m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nBut how do I combine these choices efficiently?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. Since the weights are small (1, 2, 3), maybe I can iterate over the number of weight 3 items taken, then for each possible count, compute the remaining capacity and determine the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nAlternatively, since the weights are small, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming but optimized for the small weights. Wait, but m can be up to 3e5. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: For each weight group, precompute the prefix sums. Let's say:\n\n- For weight 1, we have a list sorted in descending order of cost. Let's say the prefix sum array is s1, where s1[k] is the sum of the first k items. Similarly for s2 (weight 2) and s3 (weight 3).\n\nThen, the total weight for taking a items of weight 1, b of weight 2, c of weight 3 is a*1 + b*2 + c*3 <= m. We need to maximize s1[a] + s2[b] + s3[c].\n\nBut how to find the best a, b, c?\n\nThe problem is that with three variables, it's not straightforward. But perhaps we can fix one variable and compute the others.\n\nLet me think: For each possible number of weight 3 items (c), we can compute the maximum possible a and b given the remaining weight.\n\nBut even that might be too slow if c can be up to m/3. However, since m is up to 3e5, and for each c, the remaining weight is m - 3*c. Let's say for each c, we can compute the best a and b for the remaining weight.\n\nBut how to compute the best a and b for a given remaining weight (let's call it rem = m - 3*c). The rem could be up to m, which is 3e5. So for each possible c, we need to find the optimal a and b where a*1 + b*2 <= rem.\n\nBut how to find that efficiently. Let's think about for each possible rem, how to find the best a and b.\n\nLet me think about the weight 1 and 2 items. For a given rem, the maximum total cost can be found by considering all possible numbers of weight 2 items (b), and then taking as many weight 1 items as possible (since they are sorted by cost, taking the top ones).\n\nBut since rem can be up to 3e5, and for each c, we might have to process O(rem) steps, this could be O(m^2) in worst case. Which would be too slow.\n\nAlternative approach: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for each possible total weight, the maximum value. But how?\n\nWait, for weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum total value for a given capacity can be computed using a dynamic programming approach. However, since the number of items is up to 1e5, but the capacity is up to 3e5, that might be feasible. Let me think.\n\nBut if I do that, then for the weight 1 and 2 items, I can compute a DP array where dp[w] is the maximum value achievable with total weight w. Then, for each possible c (number of weight 3 items), the remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*c. Then, the maximum value would be dp[rem] + s3[c]. But how to compute this dp array?\n\nBut the problem is that the weight 1 and 2 items are up to 1e5 each. However, the DP approach for unbounded knapsack isn't applicable here since each item can be taken once. So it's 0-1 knapsack. But with m up to 3e5, and n up to 1e5, that would be O(nm) which is 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible. So need another idea.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps for any given capacity, we can compute the optimal number of weight 2 items and then the rest filled with weight 1 items.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a capacity of W. Let's say we take x items of weight 2. Then, the total weight used by them is 2x. The remaining weight is W - 2x, which can be filled with weight 1 items. However, x can't exceed the number of weight 2 items available (say, cnt2), and also 2x <= W.\n\nBut how to find the best x?\n\nWe can iterate x from 0 to min(cnt2, W//2), and for each x, take min(x, cnt2) items of weight 2, and then take min(W - 2x, cnt1) items of weight 1. Then compute the sum. However, for each possible W, this would take O(W) time. Which is not feasible if W is large.\n\nBut in our problem, for each c (number of weight 3 items), the rem is up to m. So if we can compute for each possible rem, the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, for a given rem, the optimal choice is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. However, since the weight 2 items are more expensive per unit weight (or not?), it's possible that taking some combination of weight 2 and 1 items gives better results.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x (number of weight 2 items) for a given rem?\n\nLet me think of this as follows: For a given rem, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible x (number of weight 2 items taken) such that 2x ≤ rem. For each x, the maximum possible is s2[x] + s1[rem - 2x], where s1 is the prefix sum of weight 1 items, and s2 is the prefix sum of weight 2 items. But rem - 2x can't be negative. Also, rem - 2x can't exceed the number of weight 1 items available (cnt1). Similarly, x can't exceed the number of weight 2 items (cnt2).\n\nBut how to find the best x quickly?\n\nIf we can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2 items, then for each rem, we can iterate x in a certain range and compute the best value.\n\nBut even that, for each rem, could take O(k) time where k is the number of weight 2 items. Which might be up to 1e5. If we have to do this for each c (up to m/3), that would be O(1e5 * 1e5) which is 1e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible rem, find the optimal x in O(1) or O(1) per rem. How?\n\nLet me think: For a given rem, the maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is min( (rem)//2 , cnt2 ). Let's call this max_x. Then, we can try taking x in the range [max(0, max_x - k), max_x], where k is small (like 1000) and check those possibilities. Because the optimal x is either near the max possible, or near the point where the weight 1 items are better than weight 2 items.\n\nThis is a common trick in problems where you have to choose between two options, and the optimal is within a small range. For example, in the problem where you have to choose between taking some items of two different types, and the optimal solution is near the maximum possible.\n\nSo for each rem, instead of checking all possible x, we can check x from max(0, max_x - 1000) to max_x. Because the optimal x is likely to be in that vicinity. Since the number of items is large, and the weight is small, checking 1000 possibilities for each rem would be manageable.\n\nBut how to choose the value of k? Well, since the weight of the items is small, and the cost is high, the optimal x is likely to be in the vicinity of max_x. For example, if there are a lot of weight 1 items with high cost, then perhaps taking fewer weight 2 items and more weight 1 items is better. However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, and weight 2 items are sorted, the best x is probably somewhere around max_x.\n\nSo, for each rem, we can try all x in the range [max(0, max_x - K), max_x], where K is a small number like 1000. Then, for each x, compute the corresponding value. Then take the maximum among those.\n\nWhat's the value of K needed here? Well, since the weight of each item is up to 3, and the cost can be up to 1e9, but in practice, if we take K as 1000, then even for m up to 3e5, the total number of operations would be O( (m/3) * 1000 ), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n1. Preprocess the items by their weight. Sort each group in descending order of cost, compute prefix sums.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For weight 1: sort all items in descending order of cost, then compute s1 where s1[k] is the sum of the first k items. Similarly for s2 and s3.\n\n2. For each possible c (number of weight 3 items taken), which can be from 0 to min( cnt3, m//3 ), compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*c. Then, for this rem, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items as described above.\n\n3. Take the maximum over all possible c and their corresponding best combinations.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut how to compute the possible c values? Well, the maximum number of weight 3 items is min( cnt3, m//3 ), which can be up to 1e5 (if m is 3e5 and all items are weight 3). So for each c in 0 to that maximum, we can compute the rem and then compute the best a and b.\n\nBut for each c, the rem is m - 3*c. Now, for that rem, we need to compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nNow, for the weight 1 and 2 items, the approach is:\n\nCompute the maximum x (number of weight 2 items) that can be taken, which is min( (rem) // 2, len(s2) ). Then, check x from max(0, x_max - K) to x_max, and for each x, take the min(x, len(s2)) items of weight 2, and then take the min( rem - 2*x, len(s1) ) items of weight 1.\n\nBut what is K? Let's choose K as 1000. Then, for each rem, we check 1000 possibilities. That should be manageable.\n\nBut why would this approach work? Because the optimal x is either near the maximum possible (when taking as many weight 2 items as possible) or when there's a trade-off between taking a few less weight 2 items to allow more weight 1 items. However, if the weight 1 items are very valuable, then maybe the optimal x is lower. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking as many as possible of the highest value items is better. So, for example, if the weight 2 items have a higher per-unit cost than weight 1 items, then taking as many as possible weight 2 items is better. Otherwise, perhaps taking fewer weight 2 items to allow more weight 1 items.\n\nBut with the K approach, we can cover all possibilities where the optimal x is within K steps from the maximum possible x. For example, if K is 1000, then even if the optimal x is 1000 steps less than the maximum, we can find it.\n\nBut what if the optimal x is not in that range? Well, that's a risk. However, given that the weight of items is small, and that the cost is high, perhaps this approach is sufficient. For example, in the worst case, the optimal x is such that the difference between taking x and x+1 is negligible. However, given that the code is expected to pass all test cases, perhaps this approach is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps K can be set to 3000, which is manageable.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, group the items by their weight. Then sort each group in descending order of cost, and compute prefix sums.\n\nFor example, for weight 1:\n\nSort all items with w=1 in descending order of c. Then, create a prefix sum array s1 where s1[i] is the sum of the first i items. Similarly for s2 and s3.\n\nThen, for each possible c (number of weight 3 items taken), we can take up to min( (m - 3*c) // 3, len(s3) ) ?\n\nWait no, c is the number of weight 3 items taken, so the maximum possible c is min( len(s3), m // 3 ). So for each c in 0 to that maximum:\n\n- The weight used by the 3 items is 3*c. The remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*c.\n\nThen, for rem, we need to find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nNow, for the weight 1 and 2 items:\n\nmax_x = min( (rem) // 2, len(s2) )\n\nThen, for x in range max(0, max_x - K) to max_x:\n\n   take x items of weight 2 (sum s2[x])\n\n   then, the remaining weight is rem - 2*x. Take as many as possible weight 1 items, which is min( rem - 2*x, len(s1) )\n\n   sum is s2[x] + s1[ min( rem - 2*x, len(s1) ) ]\n\nTake the maximum of all these possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps we also need to consider the possibility of taking fewer than max_x items, but in the K steps.\n\nBut what if the optimal x is less than max_x - K? For example, suppose that taking x = 0 is better than taking x = max_x. Then, the code would miss it. However, in practice, for the given constraints, this approach may work. But perhaps K needs to be chosen as the maximum between the number of weight 2 items and something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is either the maximum possible, or the maximum possible minus some value. For example, for each possible rem, we can also check x = 0, but that would take O(1) steps.\n\nBut how to ensure that all possibilities are covered?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, for a given rem, the optimal x is such that:\n\nthe marginal gain of taking one more weight 2 item is better than taking two weight 1 items (since 2 weight 1 items take 2 units of weight, same as one weight 2 item). So, if the next weight 2 item (x+1-th) is more valuable than the next two weight 1 items, then we should take it. Otherwise, not.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, this can be checked. However, this seems complicated.\n\nBut given that the code must be written, and the time constraints, perhaps the approach of trying x in the vicinity of max_x is the way to go.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, for the input, read n and m. Then read n lines of wi and ci. Then group them into three lists: w1, w2, w3. Then sort each in descending order of ci. Then compute prefix sums for each.\n\nFor example, for w1, after sorting, the prefix sum s1 is computed as follows:\n\ns1[0] = 0\n\ns1[1] = w1[0].c\n\ns1[2] = s1[1] + w1[1].c, etc.\n\nSame for s2 and s3.\n\nOnce that's done, for each possible c (number of weight 3 items taken), compute the rem = m - 3*c. If rem <0, skip. Then compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nNow, the code for that part.\n\nBut how to loop through possible c?\n\nThe maximum number of weight 3 items is min( len(w3), m//3 )\n\nSo, for c in 0 to that max_c:\n\n   current_weight = 3*c\n\n   if current_weight > m: continue\n\n   rem = m - current_weight\n\n   then compute best value for rem.\n\nNow, the code for the best value for rem.\n\nImplementing the approach of checking x in the range [max_x - K, max_x], where K is 1000 or so.\n\nBut what if max_x is less than K? Then, we just check from 0 to max_x.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_possible_x = min( len(s2), rem // 2 )\n\nstart_x = max(0, max_possible_x - K)\n\nfor x in range(start_x, max_possible_x + 1):\n\n   if x > len(s2): continue\n\n   current_weight_2 = 2 * x\n\n   rem_after_2 = rem - current_weight_2\n\n   if rem_after_2 <0: continue\n\n   take_1 = min( len(s1), rem_after_2 )\n\n   total = s2[x] + s1[take_1]\n\n   keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut what about x being up to len(s2)? For example, if the len(s2) is less than max_possible_x, then the actual x is len(s2). So, the code would take x up to len(s2).\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nIn code, the max_possible_x is min( len(s2), rem//2 )\n\nSo, the x can be up to that value.\n\nSo, the code for that part.\n\nNow, what's K? Let's pick K=1000. But why 1000? Because for the worst case, if the optimal x is 1000 steps away from the max_possible_x, then checking that would cover it. But how to decide K?\n\nWell, considering that the weight of the items is small, and the cost can be high, but since the items are sorted, the optimal x is probably not too far from max_possible_x. So, K=1000 is a safe bet. Let's try that.\n\nNow, for each rem, we check up to 1000 possibilities. So for each c, the time is O(1000). The total number of c is up to m//3, which for m=3e5 is 1e5. So 1e5 * 1000 is 1e8 operations. Which is acceptable in Python? Well, 1e8 operations might be tight for Python, but perhaps with optimizations. Wait, 1e8 operations would take about 10 seconds, but Python is slower. So maybe 1e8 is too slow. Hmm.\n\nWait, but what is the maximum possible for m? m is 3e5. So m//3 is 1e5. For each c, we check K=1000 steps. So 1e5 * 1000 = 1e8 steps. That's a lot for Python, which can handle about 1e6 operations per second. So 1e8 is 100 seconds. Which is way beyond the time limit.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm. Need to find a better way.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for each possible total weight up to m, the maximum value. But how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think again about the weight 1 and 2 items. Since they are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible weight, the maximum value by combining the best possible number of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For a given capacity W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking all possible weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\n- Or, taking one less weight 2 item and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find that without checking all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible number of weight 2 items, the maximum number is up to len(s2). Let's say that for each possible number of weight 2 items, we can compute the maximum weight 1 items that can be added. But again, how to do this quickly.\n\nBut if we can find for a given W, the optimal x is the minimum between (W//2) and len(s2), and also possibly x-1, x-2, etc., but perhaps only a few steps.\n\nBut again, this brings us back to the same problem.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible W, the optimal x is such that 2x is as large as possible, but the sum of s2[x] + s1[W - 2x] is maximized. Since the s1 and s2 arrays are non-decreasing (because we added items in descending order of cost), then for a given W, the function f(x) = s2[x] + s1[W - 2x] is not necessarily unimodal. However, it's possible that the maximum occurs near the maximum x possible.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x quickly.\n\nAnother approach: Since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, for a given W, the optimal x is the one that balances the value of the next weight 2 item and the next two weight 1 items.\n\nFor example, if the next weight 2 item (x+1) has a higher value than the next two weight 1 items, then it's better to take it. Otherwise, not.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, this can be checked greedily.\n\nSo, here's an idea: take as many weight 2 items as possible, but whenever adding another weight 2 item is worse than taking two weight 1 items, stop.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have x weight 2 items taken. Then, the next weight 2 item has value s2[x+1] - s2[x]. The next two weight 1 items have value s1[min(len(s1), W - 2x - 2 + 1)] - s1[ ... ] ?\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, the value of taking one more weight 2 item is the cost of that item, and the value of taking two more weight 1 items is the sum of the next two weight 1 items (if available).\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can greedily take the higher value items first.\n\nBut since the weight 2 items and weight 1 items are sorted, perhaps the optimal strategy is to take as many as possible of the higher-value items.\n\nBut since weight 2 items are worth more per unit weight? No, that depends on their individual values.\n\nFor example, a weight 2 item with cost 5 is better than two weight 1 items with cost 3 and 2. But worse than two weight 1 items with cost 3 and 3.\n\nSo, this is not straightforward.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps the optimal way is to take the highest value items first, regardless of their weight.\n\nBut how to model this. It seems like a classic 0-1 knapsack problem, but with items of two types.\n\nBut again, for large n and m, this is not feasible with standard DP.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, for any given capacity W, the optimal selection is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items. And the optimal number of weight 2 items is either the maximum possible, or the maximum possible minus 1, or some small number around that.\n\nThis is similar to the previous approach, but with K=1, which would reduce the number of checks per W to O(1). Let's try this.\n\nLet's say that for a given W, we check x = max_possible_x, and x = max_possible_x -1. Which would take O(1) time per W.\n\nBut will that cover all possibilities? Probably not. However, in practice, this might work for some cases.\n\nBut how to know?\n\nFor example, suppose the optimal x is max_possible_x - 2. Then, this approach would miss it. However, if the code is allowed to have some errors, but passes the test cases, then it might be acceptable. But since the problem requires correct answers, this approach may not be sufficient.\n\nAnother thought: For weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for a given capacity W is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible, and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible minus 1, and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible minus 2, and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\n... and so on, up to a certain number.\n\nBut how many steps to check? Perhaps checking up to 100 steps would be sufficient.\n\nBut again, for the earlier problem of O(1e5 * 100) steps, which is 1e7, that's manageable in Python.\n\nLet me calculate. For m=3e5, the number of c is up to 1e5. For each c, the rem can be up to 3e5. For each rem, checking 100 steps: 1e5 * 100 = 1e7 operations. That's manageable.\n\nSo, let's try with K=100.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfor each c in 0 to max_c:\n\n    rem = m - 3*c\n\n    if rem < 0: continue\n\n    max_x = min( len(s2), rem // 2 )\n\n    for x in range( max(0, max_x - 100), max_x + 1 ):\n\n        # compute the value for x\n\n        ...\n\n    take the maximum value for this rem.\n\nNow, with this, the code would be faster.\n\nBut how to determine the value of K. For example, if the optimal x is 100 steps away from max_x, then this approach would fail. But in practice, given that the items are sorted, the optimal x is likely to be near the max_x.\n\nLet's think about an example.\n\nSuppose we have a weight 2 item with cost 100, and two weight 1 items with cost 100 each. For a capacity of 2, taking one weight 2 item gives 100. Taking two weight 1 items gives 200. So the optimal x is 0. In this case, the max_x is 1 (since rem is 2, 2//2=1). So the code would check x=1-100=0 (assuming K=100), and x=0 would be included. Thus, it would find the correct value.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are many weight 2 items with low value, and many weight 1 items with high value. Then, the optimal x is 0. But if K is 100, then the code would check x from max(0, max_x - 100) to max_x. If max_x is large, then x=0 would be included only if max_x - 100 <= 0. Otherwise, it would not. So, if max_x is 1000, and K is 100, then the code would check from 900 to 1000. But x=0 is not checked. Hence, the code would miss the optimal x=0.\n\nBut how to handle this scenario?\n\nAh, this is a problem. So, this approach would fail in such cases.\n\nThus, we need to find a way to cover both scenarios: when it's better to take as many weight 2 items as possible, and when it's better to take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea: For each rem, we can also check the case where we take zero weight 2 items, and take as many weight 1 items as possible. But this would add one more check per rem.\n\nBut in the example above, if we check x=0 and x=max_x, then it would find the optimal.\n\nBut how to balance between checking a few possibilities and covering all cases.\n\nMaybe, for each rem, check x in the range [max(0, max_x - 100), max_x], and also check x=0. But that adds one more check. But in the worst case, it's manageable.\n\nBut this still doesn't solve the problem where the optimal x is somewhere in the middle, but not near max_x or zero.\n\nAnother approach: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for a given W is the maximum between:\n\n- taking x weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items, where x is in the range [max(0, max_x - K), max_x], and also x is in the range [0, min(max_x, K)].\n\nThis way, we check both ends of the x range. For example, if K is 100, then we check the last 100 x values and the first 100 x values. This increases the number of checks per rem to 200, but covers more possibilities.\n\nBut again, this is a heuristic and may not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, we can compute the optimal x by considering that the best x is either the maximum possible, or the maximum possible minus some small number, or the minimum between the maximum possible and some small number.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Let's assume that for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can compute for each possible number of weight 2 items x, the maximum possible number of weight 1 items is y = min( (W - 2x), len(s1) ). The total cost is s2[x] + s1[y]. Since s2 is non-decreasing and s1 is non-decreasing, for fixed W, the function f(x) = s2[x] + s1[ min(W - 2x, len(s1)) ] is not necessarily unimodal. However, it's possible that the function has its maximum at x_max or near x_max.\n\nBut how to find the maximum quickly.\n\nAnother observation: For a given W, the optimal x is such that the next weight 2 item (if any) has a cost greater than the next two weight 1 items (if any). Otherwise, it's better to take the weight 1 items instead.\n\nSo, the optimal x is the largest x such that the next weight 2 item (x+1-th) is more valuable than the next two weight 1 items.\n\nThis suggests a greedy approach: start with x = 0, and keep increasing x as long as the next weight 2 item is more valuable than the next two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think: we can have pointers for the weight 2 items and weight 1 items. Initially, x is 0, and y is W. Then, while we can take more weight 2 items and it's beneficial, we do so.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nFor example:\n\ncurrent x is the number of weight 2 items taken. The next weight 2 item is s2[x] - s2[x-1] = cost of x-th item (assuming 1-based indexing). The next two weight 1 items would be s1[y] - s1[y-2], where y is the current number of weight 1 items taken (which is min(W - 2x, len(s1))).\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the current x, the number of weight 1 items is y = W - 2x. If this is positive, then the next two weight 1 items would be the ones at positions y and y-1, assuming y is large enough. But this is not precise.\n\nBut perhaps, for each step, compare the value of the next weight 2 item with the sum of the next two weight 1 items. If the weight 2 item is better, increment x by 1, otherwise stop.\n\nThis would give the optimal x.\n\nLet me try this with the earlier example:\n\nW = 2.\n\ns2 is [0, 100], and s1 is [0, 100, 200].\n\nInitially, x=0, y=2. Next weight 2 item is 100. Next two weight 1 items are 100 + 100 = 200. Since 100 < 200, we don't take the weight 2 item. So x remains 0. The total is s2[0] + s1[2] = 0 + 200 = 200.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: W=2, s2 has [0, 150], s1 has [0, 100]. So next weight 2 item is 150, next two weight 1 items is 100. 150 > 100, so take the weight 2 item. x becomes 1, y = 2 - 2*1 = 0. Total is 150 + 0 = 150. But the optimal is to take the weight 2 item, which is better.\n\nSo this greedy approach works here.\n\nAnother example: W=3, s2 has [0, 100], s1 has [0, 100, 100, 100]. Initially, x=0, y=3. Next weight 2 item is 100, next two weight 1 items are 100 + 100 = 200. Since 100 < 200, we don't take the weight 2 item. Total is 0 + 300 = 300. But if we take one weight 2 item and one weight 1 item (total weight 2 + 1 = 3), the total is 100 + 100 = 200, which is worse. So the greedy approach is correct.\n\nAnother example: W=4, s2 has [0, 150, 150], s1 has [0, 100, 100, 100, 100]. Initial x=0, y=4. Next weight 2 item is 150. Next two weight 1 items: 100 + 100 = 200. 150 < 200 → don't take. So total is 0 + 400 = 400. But if we take one weight 2 item and 2 weight 1 items (weight 2 + 2 = 4), total is 150 + 200 = 350. Worse. So the greedy approach is correct.\n\nAnother example: W=2, s2 has [0, 150], s1 has [0, 100]. Greedy says not to take the weight 2 item, but taking it gives 150, which is better than 100. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait in this case, the next weight 2 item is 150, and the next two weight 1 items are 100 (since y=2, but we can only take 2 items, which is 100 + ... but wait, y is W - 2x = 2 - 0 = 2. So the number of weight 1 items is min(2, len(s1)). Assuming len(s1) is >= 2, the sum is s1[2] = 100 + 100 = 200? No, in this example, s1 is [0, 10",
