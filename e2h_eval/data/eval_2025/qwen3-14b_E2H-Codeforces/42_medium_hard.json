    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the progress bars work. Let's break it down. For each byte copied, there's a current file's progress and the overall progress. Both are calculated as floor(100 * x / a_i) for the current file, and floor(100 * total_bytes_copied / total_size) for the overall. And these values update after each byte is copied. Also, initially, both are zero before any bytes are copied.\n\nSo, the approach would be to simulate each byte being copied and check for each moment if both progress bars show the same value. But wait, with n up to 100 and a_i up to 1000, the total number of bytes is up to 100*1000=10^5. So for each byte, we can check the two percentages. But considering that for each of those bytes, we have to compute both values and see if they match. Then collect all such values and output them sorted.\n\nBut wait, even 1e5 steps is manageable, right? Because 1e5 iterations are acceptable for Python in terms of time constraints. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, calculate the total size of all files. Then, for each file i, for each byte x in 1..a_i (since after each byte, the progress updates), compute the current progress (for the file) and the overall progress (sum of all previous files plus x). Then check if both percentages are equal. Also, note that the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0 for both, so 0 is always included.\n\nWait, but the initial state is before any bytes are copied. The problem says that after copying each byte, the progress bars update. So the initial 0% is before any bytes are copied. But according to the problem statement, the first byte is copied, then the progress bars are updated. So the initial 0% is considered as a valid moment. So we need to include 0% in the answer if it's possible. But when is that possible? Well, at the very beginning, both are 0. So 0 is always present.\n\nBut for the other values, we need to check during the copying of bytes. So the plan is:\n\n- Precompute total_size = sum(a)\n- Initialize a set to store the valid percentages.\n- Add 0 to the set since it's always present.\n- For each file i from 0 to n-1:\n   - For each byte x in 1 to a[i]:\n      - Compute current_file_percent = (x * 100) // a[i]\n      - Compute total_copied = sum_prev_files + x\n      - overall_percent = (total_copied * 100) // total_size\n      - if current_file_percent == overall_percent, add this value to the set.\n- After processing all bytes, collect all the values in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nWait, but sum_prev_files is the sum of the sizes of all previous files. So for the i-th file (assuming 0-based index), sum_prev_files is sum(a[0..i-1]). So for each file, we can precompute the sum_prev_files. Let's think about that.\n\nYes. So for example, for the first file, sum_prev_files is 0. For the second file, it's a[0], etc.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCompute the total_size = sum(a)\n\nCompute prefix_sums where prefix_sums[i] is the sum of the first i files. So for example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. Then, for the i-th file (0-based), the sum_prev_files is prefix_sums[i].\n\nThen, for each file i (0-based), for each x in 1..a[i], the total_copied is prefix_sums[i] + x. \n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_size = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        # current file percent\n        curr_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n        # total copied is sum_prev + x\n        total_copied = sum_prev + x\n        overall_percent = (total_copied * 100) // total_size\n        if curr_percent == overall_percent:\n            result.add(curr_percent)\n\nThen, collect all elements in result, sort them, and print them each on separate lines.\n\nWait, but what about the case when the total_copied is equal to the total_size? For example, when the last byte is copied. At that moment, the overall_percent would be 100. But according to the problem statement, after copying the byte, the progress is updated. So that's included.\n\nBut let's test the first example:\n\nSample Input 1: 1\\n6\n\nSo n=1, a=[6]. total_size=6.\n\nprefix_sums is [0,6].\n\nFor i=0, sum_prev is 0. x runs from 1 to 6.\n\nFor each x:\n\ncurr_percent is (x*100)//6.\n\noverall_percent is (x * 100) // 6.\n\nSo they are equal. So all percentages during the copy are same. So the set includes 0 and all the percentages generated during the process. But according to the sample output, the output is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nWait, but for x from 1 to 6:\n\nx=1: 100*1/6 = 16.666..., floor is 16.\n\nx=2: 33.333... → 33\n\nx=3: 50 → 50\n\nx=4: 66.666 → 66\n\nx=5: 83.333 → 83\n\nx=6: 100 → 100.\n\nSo the set includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample output. So the code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code above, the initial 0 is added. Then, for each x in 1..a[i], we check the curr_percent and overall_percent. So in this case, the code would add all those values. So the code works for the first sample.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is 2\\n100 500. So total_size is 600.\n\nThe output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. Let's think about that.\n\nBut according to the code, during the copying of the first file (size 100):\n\nsum_prev is 0. For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent = (x * 100)/100 = x. So for x from 1 to 100, current_percent is 1 to 100.\n\noverall_percent is (x * 100)/600 → floor(x/6).\n\nSo for x=1, overall is 0. So current is 1, which is not equal to 0. So no match here.\n\nBut when x=6, the overall is 1 (6*100/600 = 1). current is 6. Not equal. So no match.\n\nBut for x= 599? Wait, no. Wait the first file is 100 bytes. So during the first file, x ranges from 1 to 100. The total_copied is x, which is up to 100. So overall_percent is (x * 100)/600 → for x=100, it is 100 * 100 / 600 = 16.666... → 16. So the current_percent is 100, which is not equal to 16. So no match during the first file.\n\nThen, during the second file (size 500), sum_prev is 100. So for x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100) // 500 → which is floor( (x * 100)/500 ) = floor(x/5).\n\noverall_percent is (100 + x) * 100 / 600 → floor( (100 +x) * 100 / 600 )\n\nSo for example, when x= 500, total_copied is 600. So overall is 100. current_percent is 500*100//500 = 100. So that's 100, which is added.\n\nBut when does current_percent equal overall_percent?\n\nLet me think about the sample output. The output includes 95,96,97,98,99,100. How do those happen?\n\nLet me think for the second file. Let's take x such that current_percent is 95. current_percent is floor( x * 100 / 500 ) = floor( x / 5 ). So 95 = floor(x/5) → x is between 95*5=475 and 95*5+4=479. So x in 475-479. \n\nAt that time, total_copied is 100 + x. Let's take x=475. total_copied is 575. overall_percent is (575 * 100) / 600 = 57500 / 600 = 95.833..., floor is 95. So current_percent is 95, overall is 95. So this is a match. Similarly for x=475, 476, 477, 478, 479. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly for 96: floor(x/5) =96 → x between 96*5=480 to 484. total_copied is 100 + x. Let's take x=480 → total_copied is 580. 580 *100 /600 = 58000/600 = 96.666... → floor is 96. So yes, 96 is added. Similarly for 96, 97, etc.\n\nBut when x= 500, the overall is 100, current is 100. So that's added.\n\nBut also, when x is 599? No, because the second file is 500 bytes. So x ranges from 1 to 500.\n\nSo during the second file, the code would capture these values. Also, the initial 0 is included. But when does 95, 96, etc. get added? They are added during the second file's processing. Also, when x= 599, but that's not possible here. \n\nSo the code would generate all these values. Then the output includes 0, 95-99, 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case when the same percentage is achieved at multiple points? For example, 0 is added once. The code uses a set, so duplicates are handled automatically.\n\nNow, what about the case when the total_size is zero? No, since each a_i is at least 1. So total_size is at least 1. So division by zero is not possible.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a=[1]. Then total_size=1. For x=1, the current_percent is 100, overall_percent is 100. So the set includes 0 and 100. So output is 0, 100.\n\nAnother edge case: when during the copying of a byte, both percentages are same. For example, when the current file is 2 bytes, and the total is 2. Then for x=1, current is 50, overall is 50. So 50 is added. So the output would be 0, 50, 100.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. The input is given as a single line for n, then a line with n numbers.\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the input is given as, for example, ['1\\n6', ...], but in actual code, the input is read from stdin. So for the code, the input is read as:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read correctly.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing the steps as discussed.\n\nBut let's think about the third sample input:\n\nSample Input 3: 4\\n1000 2 2 998 → Output is 0,50,99,100.\n\nLet's think about the total size: 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nFor the first file (1000 bytes), sum_prev is 0. For each x from 1 to 1000:\n\ncurrent_percent is (x*100)/1000 = x/10.\n\noverall_percent is (x * 100)/2002 → which is floor( (x*100)/2002 ). \n\nWe need to find x where x/10 equals floor( (x*100)/2002 ). \n\nBut perhaps during the first file, there's a point where the two percentages are same. For example, when x= 1000, current is 100, overall is (1000 * 100)/2002 = 49.95... → floor is 49. So not same. So during the first file, maybe only 0 is added.\n\nThen, during the second file (size 2), sum_prev is 1000. For x=1 and 2:\n\ncurrent_percent is (1*100)/2 = 50, (2*100)/2=100.\n\noverall for x=1: total_copied = 1000 + 1 = 1001. 1001 * 100 / 2002 = 50.0 (exactly 50.0). So 50. So current is 50, overall is 50. So 50 is added. So that's why 50 is in the output.\n\nThen for x=2: total_copied is 1002. 1002 * 100 / 2002 = 100200 / 2002 ≈ 50.0499... → floor is 50. current_percent is 100. So not same. So 50 is added once.\n\nThen during the third file (size 2), sum_prev is 1000 + 2 = 1002. For x=1 and 2:\n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100)/2 → 50 and 100.\n\noverall for x=1: total_copied is 1002 + 1 = 1003. 1003*100 / 2002 = 100300 / 2002 ≈ 50.1... → floor 50. So current is 50, overall is 50. So 50 is added again. But since it's a set, it's already there.\n\nFor x=2: total_copied is 1004. 1004 * 100 / 2002 = 100400 / 2002 ≈ 50.149... → 50. So current is 100. Not same.\n\nThen during the fourth file (size 998), sum_prev is 1002 + 2 = 1004. For x from 1 to 998:\n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100) // 998. \n\noverall is (1004 + x) * 100 // 2002.\n\nWhen x=998, total_copied is 1004 + 998 = 2002. So overall is 100. current is (998 * 100)/998 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nAdditionally, during the fourth file, maybe there's a moment when the overall is 99 and current is 99. Let's think. For example, when total_copied is 1999. So 1999 * 100 / 2002 is 99.85... → 99. So current_percent is (x) where x is 1999 - 1004 = 995. So x=995. current_percent is (995 * 100)/998 → let's compute that. 995 / 998 is approximately 0.9969... *100 → 99.69 → floor is 99. So yes, current is 99 and overall is 99. So that's added.\n\nSo the output includes 0,50,99,100. Which matches the sample.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the code needs to process all these possibilities. So the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then a list. Compute total_size. Compute prefix_sums. Then loop through each file, each byte, check if current and overall percentages are equal, add to the set.\n\nNow, implement that in Python.\n\nBut for the prefix_sums, perhaps it's easier to compute as a cumulative sum. Like:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n\nThen, for the i-th file (0-based), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n, then a.\n\ntotal_size = sum(a)\n\nprefix_sums = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        curr_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n        total_copied = sum_prev + x\n        overall_percent = (total_copied * 100) // total_size\n        if curr_percent == overall_percent:\n            result.add(curr_percent)\n\nThen, collect the sorted list.\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nprint('\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n\nWait, but the sample outputs have the numbers separated by newlines. For example, the first sample output is:\n\n0\n16\n33\n50\n66\n83\n100\n\nWhich is each number on a separate line. So the code needs to print each element of the sorted list on its own line.\n\nSo in Python, after generating the sorted list, we can loop through each element and print it.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for the first case is given as '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100' — which is the same as printing each element on its own line.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nAfter collecting the sorted list, print each element in order, each on a new line.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_size = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        curr_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n        total_copied = sum_prev + x\n        overall_percent = (total_copied * 100) // total_size\n        if curr_percent == overall_percent:\n            result.add(curr_percent)\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the total_size is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, each a_i is at least 1. So total_size is at least 1. So division by zero is not possible.\n\nTesting the code with the first sample input:\n\nInput:\n1\n6\n\nThe code adds 0, and for each x from 1 to 6, curr_percent and overall_percent are same. So the set has 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input is:\n\n2\n100 500\n\nWhich gives the output 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nThe code should generate that.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a=[1]. The output would be 0 and 100. Let's see:\n\ntotal_size = 1.\n\nprefix_sums is [0,1].\n\nLoop for i=0, current_file_size=1. x runs 1:\n\ncurr_percent = 100*1//1 = 100.\n\ntotal_copied is 0 + 1 = 1. overall_percent is 100*1//1 = 100. So added. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nSo output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a=[1, 1]. total_size is 2.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 1, 2].\n\nFor first file (size 1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurr_percent is 100*1//1 = 100.\n\noverall_percent is (0+1)*100//2 = 50. So not equal. So no addition.\n\nFor second file (size 1), sum_prev is 1. x=1:\n\ncurr_percent is 100*1//1=100.\n\ntotal_copied is 2. overall_percent is 200//2 = 100. So added. So the result set is {0, 100}.\n\nSo output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: when during the copy of a file, the same percentage is achieved multiple times, but the set ensures it's added once.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the time complexity. For n=100, each a_i is 1000. So total bytes is 100*1000 = 1e5. For each byte, we do O(1) operations. So total steps are 1e5, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nTherefore, this approach should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the file copying process. The progress bars update after each byte is copied, showing the percentage of the current file copied and the overall percentage of all files copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Progress Bars**: The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer.\n2. **Simulate the Copy Process**: For each byte copied, compute both progress percentages and check if they match.\n3. **Track Valid Percentages**: Use a set to collect all valid percentages that match on both progress bars at any point during the copy process.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Precompute prefix sums to efficiently calculate the total bytes copied up to each file, which helps in determining the overall progress percentage quickly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_size = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        curr_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n        total_copied = sum_prev + x\n        overall_percent = (total_copied * 100) // total_size\n        if curr_percent == overall_percent:\n            result.add(curr_percent)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The number of files `n` and their respective sizes are read from the input.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: This helps in quickly determining the total bytes copied up to each file, which is essential for calculating the overall progress percentage efficiently.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, compute both the current file's progress and the overall progress. If these values match, add the percentage to the set of valid results.\n4. **Result Collection and Output**: The set of valid percentages is sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently simulate the copying process and check for matching progress percentages, leveraging prefix sums for quick calculations and a set to avoid duplicates. The complexity is linear with respect to the total number of bytes, making it efficient even for the upper constraint limits.",
