Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving through a common border between blocks. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite roads (lines). Each road is a line equation. The key here is that moving from one block to another requires that they share a nonzero length border. So, two blocks are adjacent if their common boundary is a segment (not just a point). \n\nBut how do I model this? Well, the problem seems similar to a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent. Then, the task is to find the shortest path from the home block to the university block. However, directly modeling all blocks is impossible because there are infinitely many blocks. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the problem using the roads and the positions of home and university. Let's think: each time you cross a road, you move to an adjacent block. But how can we represent the blocks in terms of their position relative to the roads?\n\nAnother approach: For each road, the blocks are on either side of the line. So, for each line, the home and university are in some region relative to that line. The idea is that two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road. Wait, no. Because crossing a single road would take you to an adjacent block. But the problem is that the adjacency depends on the arrangement of multiple roads. \n\nBut maybe the key insight is that the minimum number of steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university. Wait, not sure. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider the example given. In the first example input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: y=0 and x=0. The home is in the first quadrant, and the university is in the third. The roads divide the plane into four quadrants. To get from home to university, you need to cross both roads. So the minimum steps are 2. Which matches the output.\n\nIn the second example, there are three roads: x=0, y=0, and x + y = 3. The home is (1,1), which is on the same side of x=0 and y=0 as the first quadrant, but the line x+y=3 is such that (1,1) gives 1+1-3 = -2 <0. The university is (-1,-1), which for x+y-3 is -1-1-3 = -5 <0. So both points are on the same side of the third road. So the home and university are separated by the first two roads. So again, two steps.\n\nSo the answer is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step. But how do we compute that?\n\nAh! Because each road divides the plane into two parts. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then that road is part of the path. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me think. Suppose there are two roads that separate them. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. Because each step crosses one road. But how can you cross two roads in two steps?\n\nYes. Because each step moves across one road. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many roads have the home and university on opposite sides. Because each such road must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is exactly that count.\n\nBut why is that correct? Because if two regions are separated by k roads, then you need to cross each of those roads once. And since each crossing is a step, the minimal steps is k.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's think of some examples.\n\nSuppose there are two roads, and the home and university are separated by both. Then the minimal steps is 2. Which is correct.\n\nIf there are three roads, but the home and university are separated by two of them. Then the minimal steps is 2. Because you can cross those two roads in two steps.\n\nBut what if the roads are arranged such that crossing one road allows you to cross another? For example, imagine two roads that intersect. If the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads, then you need to cross both roads. But the minimal steps would be two. Because you can cross one road, then cross the other. So the count is correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for each road whether the home and university are",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite roads. Each step involves moving across a road, and the minimum steps are determined by the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite roads. Each road is defined by a linear equation. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves crossing a road.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimum number of steps required is determined by the number of roads that separate the home and university. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed once. Thus, the solution reduces to counting how many roads have the home and university on opposite sides.\n\n3. **Mathematical Check**: For each road defined by the equation $a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0$, we check if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. This can be determined by evaluating the sign of the expressions $a_i x_1 + b_i y_1 + c_i$ and $a_i x_2 + b_i y_2 + c_i$. If the signs are different, the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into lines for processing.\n- **Home and University Coordinates**: The coordinates of the home and university are read and stored.\n- **Roads Processing**: For each road, we compute the values of the linear equation at the home and university points. If these values have opposite signs, it indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, hence the road must be crossed.\n- **Counting Separating Roads**: The count of such roads is printed as the result, which represents the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road in linear time relative to the number of roads, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limit of input constraints.",
