Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads. Each road is a line equation. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home's block to university's block. A step is moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. So, adjacent blocks through a line segment (not just a point) are considered adjacent.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? Well, each block can be considered as a node in a graph, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent. Then the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between the home's block and the university's block.\n\nBut the problem is that there are infinitely many blocks. So we can't model all of them. There must be another way.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is that each block is determined by the position relative to each line. For each line, a point is either on one side or the other. Since the lines divide the plane, the regions can be represented by the sign of each line's equation evaluated at the point.\n\nFor example, if we have n lines, then each region is determined by a tuple of signs (s1, s2, ..., sn), where each si is +1 or -1, indicating which side of the line the point is on. However, since the lines can be arranged in various ways, not all combinations are possible. But for the purposes of adjacency, two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one sign. Because that would mean they are separated by exactly one line. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think.\n\nIf two regions are separated by exactly one line, then they are adjacent. Because moving across that line would take you from one region to another. However, if two regions differ in more than one sign, then they might not be adjacent. Because their boundaries would require crossing multiple lines, which may not form a common border.\n\nSo, the adjacency here is that two regions (blocks) are adjacent if their sign tuples differ in exactly one position. Because that would mean that they are separated by exactly one line. So, moving from one to the other is allowed in one step.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Suppose two regions are separated by two lines. Then, perhaps they are not adjacent. But if two regions differ in exactly one sign, then they are adjacent via that line.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to modeling each block as a node with a state of signs for each line. Then, the adjacency is when two nodes differ in exactly one sign. So, the problem becomes a BFS problem where each state is the sign vector, and transitions are flipping one bit (sign) at a time.\n\nBut how do we represent the sign vector for the home and university positions?\n\nYes. The home's position has a certain sign for each line. Similarly for the university. We need to find the minimum number of steps (flips) to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step flips exactly one sign (i.e., moves across a single line into an adjacent region).\n\nWait, but that seems like a very simple problem. Because the minimal steps would be the number of positions where the home and university's sign vectors differ. Because each differing position can be fixed by flipping that bit once. But that's only if the differences are independent. However, maybe there's some dependency. Wait, no. Because each flip can be done in sequence. So, for example, if the home's sign vector is (s1, s2, s3) and the university's is (t1, t2, t3), then the minimal steps is the number of positions where s_i != t_i. Because each differing position can be flipped one by one. But wait, that's only if each flip is allowed. But in reality, flipping a bit (changing the sign for a line) would correspond to moving across that line. So, the minimal steps would be the number of differing signs between the home and university's sign vectors.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Let me think of an example. Suppose the home is in a region that differs from the university's region in two signs. Then, according to this idea, the minimal steps would be 2. But is that possible?\n\nLet me imagine two lines, say x=0 and y=0. Suppose home is in (1,1) which is (+, +) for the lines x=0 and y=0. University is in (-1, -1) which is (-, -). So the sign vectors differ in both positions. The minimal steps would be 2. Because you can cross x=0 first to get to (-, +), then cross y=0 to get to (-, -). So two steps. Which matches",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the Crazy Town problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a non-zero boundary segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that each block (region) can be represented by a sign vector relative to each line equation. For each line, a point lies either on one side or the other, which can be determined by evaluating the line equation at that point.\n2. **Sign Vector Representation**: For both the home and university positions, compute their respective sign vectors based on the given lines. Each element in the vector indicates whether the point lies on the positive or negative side of the corresponding line.\n3. **Minimum Steps Calculation**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of differing signs in their respective sign vectors. Each differing sign represents a necessary crossing of a line, hence one step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    def get_signs(x, y):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            if val > 0:\n                signs.append(1)\n            else:\n                signs.append(-1)\n        return tuple(signs)\n\n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1)\n    univ_signs = get_signs(x2, y2)\n\n    diff = sum(1 for i in range(n) if home_signs[i] != univ_signs[i])\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of the home and university positions, followed by the list of line equations defining the roads.\n2. **Sign Vector Calculation**: For each point (home and university), we compute a sign vector where each element corresponds to the sign of the result when the point is substituted into the respective line equation.\n3. **Difference Calculation**: The minimum number of steps is determined by counting the number of differing elements in the sign vectors of the home and university positions. Each difference indicates a necessary crossing of a line, thus requiring one step.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum steps using simple arithmetic and comparison operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
