Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The main challenge is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If I try to process each substitution naively by replacing every occurrence in the string, that could be O(n * m) where m is the length of the string, which might be too slow for large cases. Because for each query, replacing all instances of a digit in the string would take O(len(s)) time, and with n queries, that could be O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo, I need a smarter approach. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if substitutions are done in sequence, then each substitution affects the current state of the string. However, if I process the queries in reverse order, maybe I can model the transformations more efficiently.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of thinking about building the string step by step, perhaps we can track for each digit what it represents after all substitutions. But since substitutions can be overwriting previous ones, we need to process them in the order they are given. For example, if a query replaces '2' with '00', and then another query replaces '0' with '1', then the '2's would first become '00', and then those '0's would become '1's. So the order of processing is important.\n\nBut how to represent the substitutions. Let me think about using a mapping from each digit to its replacement string. However, if a substitution is applied multiple times, like if a query replaces '2' with something, and then later replaces '2' again, then the latest substitution would override the previous one. So, for each digit, we need to track what it's currently mapped to.\n\nBut the problem is that when we perform a substitution, all occurrences of di in the current string are replaced with ti. So, if we have a string that contains some digits, and we replace a digit d with a string t, then each occurrence of d in the string becomes t. However, if later substitutions affect digits in t, then those would also be replaced.\n\nSo, the key is that each substitution affects the current state of the string. But directly simulating this for large strings is not feasible. So, perhaps we can model the transformations in terms of their contribution to the final number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nLet me think about the mathematical approach. Let's consider that each digit in the original string can be transformed through a series of substitutions. However, since substitutions are applied in order, each substitution may change the representation of digits. So, for example, if we have a substitution sequence where '2' is first replaced with 'a', then 'a' is replaced with 'b', but since substitutions are done on digits, maybe not. Wait, no, substitutions are always on digits. So the ti can be any string of digits, but the replacements are done on digits. So, for example, if a query is '2->00', then all '2's in the current string are replaced with '00'. Then, if there's a query '0->11', all '0's (including those generated from the previous substitution) are replaced with '11'.\n\nSo, the substitutions can be thought of as a series of transformations on the digits. Therefore, if we can track for each digit what it will eventually be replaced with, considering all substitutions that happen after it, then we can compute the final string.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think about processing the queries in reverse order. For example, suppose we have a mapping for each digit that tells us what it will be replaced with. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each query in reverse order, if we process them in reverse, we can update the mappings. Wait, no. Because substitutions are applied in order. Let's think: if a query is processed first, then any subsequent substitution that affects the replacement of that digit would overwrite it. So, if we want to find for each digit, the final expansion after all substitutions, perhaps we can process the queries in reverse order and build up the mappings.\n\nFor example, suppose we have two queries: first, '2->00', then '0->11'. Then, when processing in reverse, we first process '0->11'. So, for the initial mapping, each digit maps to itself. Then, processing the second query (which is the first in reverse), we see that 0 is being replaced by 11. So, the mapping for 0 is now '11'. Then, processing the first query (which was '2->00'), but in reverse order. Now, when we process this query, the current mapping for 2 is '2' (original). But when we replace 2 with '00', which is now mapped to 11*2? Or wait, perhaps the idea is that for each substitution, when we process it, we need to replace the digit di with ti, but ti may contain digits that have their own mappings. So, when processing in reverse, if we have a substitution di → ti, then the current mapping for di is ti, but ti's digits would have their own mappings. So, perhaps we can precompute for each digit, the final expansion, taking into account all substitutions that are applied after it.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this with a dictionary, where for each digit, we store the expansion. Initially, each digit's expansion is itself. Then, when processing a substitution query (di → ti), we need to update the expansion of di to be ti, but with each character in ti replaced by their current expansions. Wait, no. Because when you perform the substitution, any occurrence of di in the current string is replaced with ti. However, when ti is processed, any subsequent substitutions on the digits in ti would affect them. So, if we process substitutions in reverse order, then for each substitution, we can compute what the expansion of di would be after all substitutions. Let me think:\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the substitutions are:\n\nFirst, 2 → 00\n\nThen, 0 → 11\n\nSo, the order is first 2 is replaced with 00, then 0 is replaced with 11. So, the final expansion of 2 would be 00 → 1111. But how can we compute this?\n\nIf we process substitutions in reverse order. Let's start with the last substitution, which is 0 → 11. So, the mapping for 0 is 11. Then, the first substitution is 2 → 00. But when we process this substitution, the 00 in ti would be replaced by the current mapping of 0. So, the expansion of 2 would be 00 → 11 + 11 = 1111. So, the idea is that when processing a substitution di → ti, we need to replace each character in ti with their current expansion. Then, the new expansion of di is this result.\n\nSo, if we process the substitutions in reverse order, and for each substitution, we compute the expansion of di as ti's expansion, where each character in ti is replaced by their current expansion. Then, this way, when we process substitutions in reverse, each substitution's ti is already expanded with any substitutions that come after it (since we're processing in reverse).\n\nWait, but if we process substitutions in reverse order, then the first substitution we process is the last one in the original list. For example, the original order is [A, B], then processing in reverse would be [B, A]. When processing B, we set the expansion of B's digit to ti. Then, when processing A, which may involve digits that were modified by B. So, this seems correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a dictionary, say, expand, where expand[d] is the string that digit d will be expanded to. Initially, expand[d] = d for all digits 0-9.\n\n- Then, process the substitution queries in reverse order. For each query, which is di → ti:\n\n   - We need to compute the expansion of di as ti, but with each character in ti replaced by their current expansion. Because, when this substitution is applied, any digits in ti would have already been processed (since we are processing in reverse order, and any substitutions that happened after this one in the original order have already been processed). Wait, no. Because if we are processing in reverse, then the current substitution is the earliest in the original order. For example, if original order is substitution A (earlier) then substitution B (later). When processing in reverse, we first process B, then A. When processing B, we set expand[B's digit] to its ti. Then, when processing A, the ti of A's substitution may contain digits that have been modified by substitution B. So, when we process substitution A, we need to expand ti's digits according to the current expand mappings. Because substitution A is applied before substitution B, but since we are processing in reverse, substitution B is processed first. So, the substitution A's ti is replaced with the current expand values (which include substitution B's effects). This way, when we finally apply all substitutions, the expansion of each digit will be the result of all substitutions applied in order.\n\nYes! That makes sense. Because, when you process substitution in reverse, for each substitution, you are setting the expansion of di to ti, but with ti's digits already expanded according to any substitutions that were applied after di's substitution. Because in the original order, substitutions are applied in sequence. So, when you process a substitution in reverse, you need to make sure that the ti is expanded with the current mappings, which represent the substitutions that happened later (in original order). Thus, the expand map will correctly represent the final expansion of each digit.\n\nOnce we have this expand map, we can take the original string s, and for each character in s, replace it with the corresponding expand value. Then, the resulting string is the final string. Then, compute its value mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the original string can be up to 1e5 characters, and each expansion can be up to some length. However, if we naively expand all characters, the total length could be O(1e5 * len(ti)), which could be up to 1e10, which is impossible to handle directly.\n\nSo, we can't generate the actual string. We need to compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7 without generating the entire string.\n\nAh, right! So the problem requires us to compute the number represented by the final string mod 1e9+7. So, even if the string is very long, we can compute the mod incrementally.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Process all substitution queries in reverse order to build the expand map, where expand[d] is the string that digit d will be replaced with.\n\n2. Then, for each character in the original string s, we take its expand value, and compute the contribution of that expand string to the final number mod MOD.\n\nBut how to compute the contribution of a string to the number mod MOD?\n\nFor example, suppose the current number is X, and we append a string T. Then, the new number is X * (10^len(T)) + value_of_T. But since we are working mod MOD, we can compute this using modular exponentiation and modular arithmetic.\n\nSo, the idea is to process each character in the original string, and for each character c in s, we compute the expansion string expand[c], and then compute the contribution of that expansion string to the overall value.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nWe can precompute for each possible expand string (for each digit), the value of the string mod MOD, and the power of 10 that would be needed when appending it. However, since expand strings can be different for each digit, we need to compute for each expand string, its value mod MOD, and the length of the string (to compute the multiplier for the next parts).\n\nBut since the expand strings can be long, we need to compute their value mod MOD and their length as part of the expand map.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. Let's think of the problem as building a number step by step. For each character in the original string, we have to process its expansion, which is a string. The overall number is built by concatenating all these expansion strings. So, for example, if the original string is 'abc', and the expansion of a is 'x', expansion of b is 'y', expansion of c is 'z', then the final number is x followed by y followed by z.\n\nSo, the way to compute the mod is to process each expansion string in order, and for each, compute the contribution. Let's say we have a current value 'res' which is the value of the number built so far. When we append a new expansion string T, which has value v and length l, then res = (res * 10^l + v) mod MOD.\n\nBut how to compute 10^l mod MOD for each expansion string?\n\nSo, for each expansion string, we need to precompute two things: its value mod MOD, and its length. Then, during processing of the original string, we can compute the cumulative result.\n\nBut how to compute these for the expand strings?\n\nWell, during the processing of the substitution queries, when building the expand map, we can compute for each digit d, the value of expand[d] mod MOD and the length of expand[d]. However, since the expand[d] is built by combining other expand strings, we can compute these values recursively.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- For each digit d, we maintain two values: val[d] (the value of the expansion string mod MOD), and len[d] (the length of the expansion string).\n\n- Initially, for each digit d, val[d] = d mod MOD, and len[d] = 1.\n\n- Then, when processing substitution queries in reverse order, for each query di -> ti, we need to compute the new val and len for di. How?\n\nThe ti is a string. For each character in ti, we replace it with the current val and len of that character. Then, the new expansion string for di is the concatenation of the expansions of each character in ti. So, the value of this new expansion is equal to the value of ti's expansion, which can be computed as follows:\n\nSuppose ti is composed of characters t_1, t_2, ..., t_k. Then, the value of the expansion of ti is:\n\nvalue = ( ( ( ( (val[t_1] * 10^{len[t_2]} + val[t_2]) ) * 10^{len[t_3]} + val[t_3] ) ... ) * 10^{len[t_k]} + val[t_k] )\n\nBut calculating this for each ti can be done by processing each character in ti, and for each step, keeping track of the current value and the total length.\n\nSo, for example, when building the expansion for di, we can process each character in ti, and for each character c in ti, we compute the new value and length as follows:\n\nnew_val = (current_val * pow(10, len_c, MOD) + val_c) % MOD\n\nnew_len = current_len + len_c\n\nWhere len_c is the length of the expansion of c, and val_c is the value of the expansion of c.\n\nSo, for ti, we can compute the value and length of the expansion of ti, which would be the value and length of the new expansion for di.\n\nTherefore, during the processing of substitution queries in reverse order, for each query di -> ti:\n\n- We compute the value and length of ti's expansion (using the current val and len of each character in ti).\n\n- Then, we set val[di] to this new value, and len[di] to this new length.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, we can process the original string s. For each character c in s, we take its val[c] and len[c], and compute the cumulative result as follows:\n\nInitially, res = 0.\n\nFor each character c in s:\n\n    res = (res * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n\nThis would give the final value mod MOD.\n\nThis approach avoids generating the actual string and handles the substitutions efficiently.\n\nNow, the key steps are:\n\n1. Preprocessing the substitutions in reverse order to compute val and len for each digit.\n\n2. Processing the original string s to compute the final value using the val and len arrays.\n\nNow, the question is: how to compute the pow(10, len_c, MOD) efficiently during the substitution processing?\n\nBut during the substitution processing, when building ti's expansion, for each character in ti, we need to calculate the pow(10, len_c, MOD), where len_c is the len of that character's expansion. However, for each character in ti, we can get len_c from the len array.\n\nBut calculating pow(10, len_c) for each step is computationally expensive if done naively. However, since len_c can be up to some large value (but for each ti, we can compute the pow(10, len_c) on the fly, but perhaps we can precompute powers of 10 mod MOD?\n\nBut for the substitution processing, during the calculation of ti's expansion, we need to compute pow(10, len_c) mod MOD for each step. However, for each step, len_c is known, and pow(10, len_c) can be computed using modular exponentiation. But since len_c can be up to, say, 1e5 (if ti is a long string), but for each substitution, the number of steps is the length of ti, which is up to 1e5 total across all queries. So, for each character in ti, we can compute pow(10, len_c, MOD) once.\n\nBut calculating pow(10, len_c, MOD) for each character in ti during substitution processing may be acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute all possible powers of 10 mod MOD up to the maximum possible len. However, the maximum len can be very large. For example, if each substitution replaces a digit with a string of length 1e5, and there are 1e5 substitutions, then the len can be exponential. However, in practice, since we are dealing with mod 1e9+7, and the exponents can be up to 1e5 (but even higher?), but for each substitution, we need to compute pow(10, len_c, MOD) for len_c up to some value.\n\nBut calculating pow(10, len_c, MOD) can be done quickly with the built-in pow function in Python, which is efficient.\n\nAlternatively, during the substitution processing, when building the value and length of ti's expansion, we can compute the pow(10, len_c, MOD) as needed.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps again:\n\nInitialize val and len arrays for digits 0-9:\n\nval = [d % MOD for d in 0..9]\n\nlen = [1 for _ in 0..9]\n\nProcess each substitution query in reverse order:\n\nfor query in reversed(queries):\n\n    di, ti = parse the query\n\n    compute the value and length of ti's expansion:\n\n        current_val = 0\n\n        current_len = 0\n\n        for c in ti:\n\n            # c is a character, e.g., '0'\n\n            digit = int(c)\n\n            # the value of this digit's expansion is val[digit], and its length is len[digit]\n\n            # compute the new_val and new_len when appending this expansion to the current_val\n\n            # new_val = current_val * (10^len_c) + val_c\n\n            # new_len = current_len + len_c\n\n            len_c = len[digit]\n\n            pow_10 = pow(10, len_c, MOD)\n\n            new_val = (current_val * pow_10 + val[digit]) % MOD\n\n            new_len = current_len + len_c\n\n            current_val = new_val\n\n            current_len = new_len\n\n        # Now, set val[di] and len[di] to current_val and current_len\n\n        val[di] = current_val\n\n        len[di] = current_len\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, process the original string s:\n\nres = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    digit = int(c)\n\n    # res = res * 10^len[digit] + val[digit]\n\n    pow_10 = pow(10, len[digit], MOD)\n\n    res = (res * pow_10 + val[digit]) % MOD\n\nreturn res\n\nBut wait, in the code above, during substitution processing, when we process ti, we need to compute the value of the expansion of ti, which is the concatenation of the expansions of each character in ti. So, for example, if ti is \"ab\", then the expansion is expand(a) followed by expand(b). The value of this expansion is (expand(a) * 10^len(b) + expand(b)) mod MOD. Which is exactly what the code above does.\n\nYes. So this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nOriginal string is '123123', n=1, query is '2->00'\n\nProcessing substitution in reverse (only one query):\n\nFor di=2, ti='00'.\n\nProcessing ti:\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0, current_len at 0.\n\nFirst character is '0' (digit 0):\n\nlen_c = len[0] = 1\n\npow_10 = 10^1 mod MOD = 10.\n\nnew_val = 0 * 10 + val[0] = 0 + 0 = 0.\n\ncurrent_val = 0, current_len = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSecond character is '0':\n\nlen_c = 1, pow_10 = 10.\n\nnew_val = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0.\n\ncurrent_val = 0, current_len = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, val[2] becomes 0, len[2] becomes 2.\n\nThen, processing the original string s = '123123':\n\nEach character:\n\ndigit 1: val[1] = 1, len[1] = 1.\n\ndigit 2: val[2] = 0, len[2] = 2.\n\ndigit 3: val[3] = 3, len[3] = 1.\n\ndigit 1: same as first.\n\ndigit 2: same as before.\n\ndigit 3: same as before.\n\nSo processing the original string:\n\nres starts at 0.\n\nProcessing first '1' (digit 1):\n\nres = 0 * 10^1 + 1 = 1.\n\nThen '2': res = 1 * 10^2 + 0 = 100 + 0 = 100.\n\nThen '3': res = 100 * 10^1 + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003.\n\nThen '1': res = 1003 * 10^1 + 1 = 10030 + 1 = 10031.\n\nThen '2': res = 10031 * 10^2 + 0 = 1003100 + 0 = 1003100.\n\nThen '3': res = 1003100 * 10^1 + 3 = 10031000 +3 = 10031003.\n\nWhich matches the first sample output of 10031003. Then mod 1e9+7 is 10031003, which is less than MOD, so that's the answer.\n\nAnother sample input is the third example:\n\nInput: '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'\n\nSo original string is '222', n=2 queries: first '2->0', then '0->7'.\n\nProcessing in reverse order, first process '0->7', then '2->0'.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial val and len for digits:\n\nval[0] = 0, len[0] = 1.\n\nProcessing the first query in reverse (which is '0->7'):\n\nti is '7', which is a single character. So for ti:\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0, current_len 0.\n\nProcessing '7' (digit 7):\n\nlen_c is len[7] = 1.\n\npow_10 = 10^1 mod MOD = 10.\n\nnew_val = 0 * 10 + val[7] = 0 +7 =7.\n\ncurrent_val is 7, current_len is 1.\n\nSo val[0] is updated to 7, len[0] is 1.\n\nThen, process the next query in reverse (original query '2->0'):\n\nti is '0', which is a single character. So for ti:\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0, current_len 0.\n\nProcessing '0' (digit 0):\n\nlen_c is len[0] = 1, val is 7.\n\npow_10 = 10^1 mod MOD =10.\n\nnew_val = 0 * 10 + 7 =7.\n\ncurrent_val =7, current_len=1.\n\nSo, val[2] becomes 7, len[2] becomes 1.\n\nNow, the original string is '222', each '2' is replaced with expansion value 7, length 1.\n\nProcessing each '2' in s:\n\nres starts at 0.\n\nFirst '2': res = 0 * 10^1 +7 =7.\n\nSecond '2': res =7 *10^1 +7 =70+7=77.\n\nThird '2': res =77 *10^1 +7 =770+7=777. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: input '1000000008\\n0' (original string is '1000000008', no queries). So the output is the number mod MOD. The number is 1000000008. MOD is 1e9+7 = 1000000007. So 1000000008 mod MOD is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nThe input is given as a series of test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe first line contains string s. The second line contains integer n. Then n lines of queries. However, in the sample input given in the problem, the input is presented as a list of examples. However, the user's note says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.\n\nThe second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.\n\nThe next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries.\n\nSo, the code needs to read from stdin, for each test case. Wait, but the sample input shows that the user provided multiple test cases, but the actual problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nBut that's probably the way the user presented the examples, but in reality, the actual input for the problem is a single test case. So the code should read from standard input, not multiple test cases. So the code should read:\n\nRead s from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of queries.\n\nSo, the code is for a single test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user shows four examples, but the code must process one input at a time.\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin normally.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplement the following steps:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of queries.\n\nProcess the queries in reverse order.\n\nFor each query, parse di and ti.\n\nThen, compute val and len arrays.\n\nThen, process the original s string to compute the result.\n\nNow, in Python, the MOD is 10**9 +7.\n\nImplementing the val and len arrays:\n\nInitially, val = [i for i in 0..9], but mod MOD. Since digits are 0-9, their values are 0-9, which are already mod MOD.\n\nlen is [1]*10.\n\nNow, for each query in reversed(queries):\n\nparse the query into di and ti. For example, the query string is like \"2->00\".\n\nsplit on '->', so di is the first part, ti is the second part.\n\nOnce parsed, process ti as per the steps.\n\nNow, for each character in ti, we get the digit, and compute the value and len as described.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, process queries in reverse.\n\nInitialize val and len:\n\nval = [i for i in range(10)]\n\nlen_ = [1]*10\n\nWait, but for val, the initial value is the digit itself mod MOD. Since digits are 0-9, and MOD is larger than that, val is correct.\n\nThen, for each query in reversed(queries):\n\nparse di and ti.\n\ndi is the first part, which is a single character (a digit). ti is the second part (could be empty).\n\nThen, compute the value and length of ti's expansion.\n\ncurrent_val = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 0\n\nfor c in ti:\n\n    digit = int(c)\n\n    # compute the pow(10, len_[digit], MOD)\n\n    pow_10 = pow(10, len_[digit], MOD)\n\n    current_val = (current_val * pow_10 + val[digit]) % MOD\n\n    current_len += len_[digit]\n\nOnce this loop is done, set val[di_digit] = current_val, len_[di_digit] = current_len.\n\nWait, but di is a string (like '2'), so di_digit = int(di).\n\nSo, code:\n\nfor query in reversed(queries):\n\n    parts = query.split('->')\n\n    di = parts[0]\n\n    ti = parts[1]\n\n    di_digit = int(di)\n\n    # compute ti's expansion value and length\n\n    current_val = 0\n\n    current_len = 0\n\n    for c in ti:\n\n        digit = int(c)\n\n        pow_10 = pow(10, len_[digit], MOD)\n\n        current_val = (current_val * pow_10 + val[digit]) % MOD\n\n        current_len += len_[digit]\n\n    # update val and len for di_digit\n\n    val[di_digit] = current_val\n\n    len_[di_digit] = current_len\n\nOnce all queries are processed, process the original s:\n\nres = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    digit = int(c)\n\n    pow_10 = pow(10, len_[digit], MOD)\n\n    res = (res * pow_10 + val[digit]) % MOD\n\nprint(res)\n\nWait, but what if the final string is empty? According to the problem statement, if the string is empty, the number is considered zero. However, in the code, if s is empty, the loop doesn't run, and res remains 0, which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the original string s is non-empty (since the input constraints say 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1e5). Wait, no, the problem says that the initial string s can be empty? No, the first line says s is a string of digits with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1e5. So no, the original s is non-empty. But in the case where substitutions result in empty string, the code would process it. For example, if the original s is '3', and there's a substitution '3->', then the final string is empty, and the code would return 0.\n\nBut in the code, when processing the original s, for each character in s, which is processed. For example, if the original s is '3', and after substitution, the expansion of 3 is empty string (ti is empty). Then, len_[3] is 0, and val[3] is 0 (since the value of empty string is 0).\n\nBut in the code, when processing the character '3' in s, the code would do:\n\npow_10 = pow(10, 0, MOD) = 1.\n\nres = res * 1 + 0 → res is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut how is the val and len computed for ti being empty?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose a query is di -> ti, where ti is empty string. For example, '3->'.\n\nThen, during processing of this query (in reverse), the code loops over ti, which is empty. So, current_val starts at 0, current_len starts at 0. Then, the loop doesn't run. So, val[di_digit] is set to 0, and len_[di_digit] is 0.\n\nWhich is correct. Because the expansion of di is empty string, which has value 0 and length 0.\n\nYes. So the code handles that.\n\nNow, testing the second sample input:\n\nSample input: '123123', n=1, query is '3->'.\n\nProcessing reversed queries: the query is '3->'.\n\nti is empty string. So current_val is 0, current_len is 0. So val[3] becomes 0, len[3] becomes 0.\n\nProcessing the original string s = '123123':\n\nfor each character:\n\ndigit 1: len is 1, val is 1.\n\ndigit 2: len is 1, val is 2.\n\ndigit 3: len is 0, val is 0.\n\ndigit 1: same as before.\n\ndigit 2: same as before.\n\ndigit 3: same as before.\n\nSo processing:\n\nres starts at 0.\n\nFirst '1' → res = 0 * 10^1 +1 =1.\n\nThen '2' → res = 1*10^1 +2 = 12.\n\nThen '3' → res = 12 * 10^0 + 0 → 12 +0 =12.\n\nThen '1' → 12 * 10^1 +1 = 120 +1 = 121.\n\nThen '2' → 121 *10^1 +2 = 1210 +2 = 1212.\n\nThen '3' → 1212 *10^0 +0 = 1212 +0 = 1212. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where substitution leads to empty string. For example, original s is '0', and substitution is '0->'.\n\nThen, val[0] is 0, len[0] is 0. Processing the original string:\n\nres starts at 0. For the '0' in s, res is 0 * 10^0 + 0 = 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: original s is '0', no substitutions. Then, the number is 0, mod is 0.\n\nAnother case: substitution replaces a digit with a longer string, which is then replaced again. For example, original s is '2', queries are '2->3', then '3->4'. Processing in reverse order, first process '3->4', then '2->3'.\n\nProcessing '3->4' first (reverse order):\n\nti is '4', which is a single character. For each character in ti (digit 4), len is 1, val is 4. So current_val is 4, current_len is 1. So val[3] =4, len[3]=1.\n\nThen, process '2->3' (ti is '3'). For each character in ti (digit 3), len is 1, val is 4. So current_val is 4, current_len is 1. So val[2] =4, len[2] =1.\n\nProcessing original s '2' → res = 0 * 10^1 +4 →4. Which is correct, since the substitutions are 2→3→4.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut note that in Python, the pow function can take three arguments (base, exp, mod), which is efficient.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead s, n, and queries.\n\nHandle the case when n is 0.\n\nBut in code, the reversed(queries) will be handled properly even if n is 0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nval = [i for i in range(10)]\n\nlen_ = [1]*10\n\nfor query in reversed(queries):\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The challenge lies in handling potentially large strings and multiple substitutions efficiently without explicitly constructing the entire resulting string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of applying substitutions sequentially, we process them in reverse order. This allows us to build mappings for each digit to its final expanded form considering all subsequent substitutions.\n2. **Dynamic Value and Length Tracking**: For each digit, we maintain two values:\n   - `val[d]`: The numeric value of the expanded string for digit `d` modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n   - `len[d]`: The length of the expanded string for digit `d`.\n3. **Efficient Modular Arithmetic**: When expanding strings, we use modular exponentiation to compute powers of 10 efficiently, ensuring that we handle large numbers without overflow.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    s = input[0].strip()\n    n = int(input[1].strip())\n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        if input[i].strip() != '':\n            queries.append(input[i].strip())\n    \n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1] * 10\n    \n    for query in reversed(queries):\n        parts = query.split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1]\n        di_digit = int(di)\n        current_val = 0\n        current_len = 0\n        for c in ti:\n            digit = int(c)\n            pow_10 = pow(10, length[digit], MOD)\n            current_val = (current_val * pow_10 + val[digit]) % MOD\n            current_len += length[digit]\n        val[di_digit] = current_val\n        length[di_digit] = current_len\n    \n    res = 0\n    for c in s:\n        digit = int(c)\n        pow_10 = pow(10, length[digit], MOD)\n        res = (res * pow_10 + val[digit]) % MOD\n    \n    print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the initial string and the list of substitution queries.\n2. **Initialization**: Arrays `val` and `length` are initialized to store the numeric value and length of each digit's expansion.\n3. **Reverse Query Processing**: Each query is processed in reverse order to build the correct mappings. For each query, we compute the expanded value and length of the target string by iterating through each character and using modular arithmetic.\n4. **Final Calculation**: After processing all queries, the original string is processed character by character, using the precomputed values and lengths to efficiently compute the final result modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle large strings and multiple substitutions efficiently, avoiding the need to construct potentially enormous intermediate strings.",
