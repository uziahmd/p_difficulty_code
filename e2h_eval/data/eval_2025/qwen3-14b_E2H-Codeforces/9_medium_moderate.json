Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the time complexity would be O(nm), which for 1e5 * 3e5 is way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. Let me think. For each weight type, I can sort the items in descending order of cost, so that I can take as many as possible of the highest value ones first.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's separate the souvenirs into three groups: those with weight 1, 2, 3. For each group, I can sort them in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, I can precompute a prefix sum array. That way, for any number of items taken from that group, I can quickly get the total cost.\n\nBut how do I combine these groups optimally? Because the total weight has to be <= m. So the problem becomes selecting how many items to take from each group such that their total weight is <= m and the sum of costs is maximized.\n\nLet me think about the possible combinations. Suppose I have x items of weight 1, y items of weight 2, z items of weight 3. Then total weight is x*1 + y*2 + z*3 ≤ m. But how to find the optimal x, y, z?\n\nBut considering that the maximum possible for each group is limited by their counts. For example, for weight 1, the maximum number of items is min(k1, m), where k1 is the count of weight 1 items. Similarly for others.\n\nBut trying all possibilities for x, y, z is not feasible. So perhaps I can iterate over one of the variables and compute the others accordingly.\n\nSince there are three groups, maybe I can iterate through the possible number of items taken from the weight 3 group, then for each of those, compute the best combination between weight 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the weight 3 items are the heaviest, perhaps we can iterate over the possible number of weight 3 items taken, and then for the remaining capacity, solve the problem for weight 1 and 2.\n\nBut even that might be expensive if the number of weight 3 items is large. However, since each weight 3 item takes up 3 units of capacity, the maximum number of such items is m//3. For m up to 3e5, that's 1e5. So for each possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), we can compute the remaining capacity, then for that capacity, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items given a certain capacity. Let's think about that.\n\nSuppose we have a remaining capacity of 'rem' after taking z items of weight 3. We need to select some number of weight 1 and 2 items such that their total weight is ≤ rem. How can we compute the maximum cost?\n\nFor this part, perhaps we can precompute prefix sums for weight 1 and weight 2 items. Let's say we have:\n\n- For weight 1 items, sorted in descending order of cost. Let's call the prefix sum array as s1, where s1[i] is the sum of the first i items.\n- Similarly for weight 2 items, sorted in descending order. Prefix sum array s2, where s2[j] is sum of first j items.\n\nThen, for a given rem, we can try all possible numbers of weight 2 items taken (say, j), and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (i.e., rem - 2*j) items. But since j can be up to min( (rem)//2 , len(s2)), this could be O(rem) for each z. Which would be too slow if rem is up to 3e5 and z is up to 1e5.\n\nSo that approach would be O(m * m) in worst case, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, given a capacity 'rem', find the optimal combination of x and y (number of weight 1 and 2 items) such that x + 2y ≤ rem. How can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted in descending order, the optimal strategy for any capacity is to take as many of the highest value items as possible. But how to balance between taking more weight 1 items (which take less space) and weight 2 items.\n\nAn efficient way for this sub-problem would be to precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and weight 2, and then for each possible number of weight 2 items taken (up to the maximum possible for the current rem), calculate how many weight 1 items can be added. But again, doing this for every possible j is O(rem) per call, which may not be feasible.\n\nWait, but for the sub-problem of combining weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum possible number of weight 2 items is min( (rem) // 2, len(s2) ). Let's denote this as max_j. So for each possible j from 0 to max_j, we can take j items of weight 2, and then take (rem - 2*j) items of weight 1. However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking the first (rem - 2j) items gives the maximum possible sum. But the problem is that (rem - 2j) could be larger than the number of available weight 1 items. So the actual number of weight 1 items taken is min( (rem - 2j), len(s1) ). But even then, for each j, we can compute the total cost as s2[j] + s1[ min( (rem - 2j), len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut for each rem, trying all possible j from 0 to max_j is O(rem) time. However, if rem is up to m (3e5), and for each z (up to m//3), then the total time would be O(m * m) again, which is 9e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nSo we need a better way to compute the optimal combination for the 1 and 2 items given a capacity.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible total weight, find the maximum value for weight 1 and 2 items. But how?\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can model this as a knapsack problem with two types of items, but with small weights. However, since the total capacity is up to 3e5, but for each z (the number of weight 3 items taken), the remaining capacity is up to m. So for each z, the remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*z. Then, for that rem, we need to compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible number of weight 2 items, the maximum possible number of weight 1 items. But again, trying all possible j is O(rem) per rem.\n\nWait, but what if we precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value for the 1 and 2 items?\n\nBut how? Let's think. Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, for any capacity, the optimal selection would be to take as many of the highest value items as possible. However, this is not straightforward because choosing a higher value weight 2 item may allow us to fit more weight 1 items.\n\nAlternatively, for the combined 1 and 2 items, the optimal solution can be found by considering for each possible number of weight 2 items taken (up to the maximum possible), and then taking as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nBut how can we find the optimal j quickly?\n\nLet me think: For a given rem, the maximum number of weight 2 items is j_max = min( len(s2), rem // 2 ). Then, the optimal j could be in the range [max(0, j_max - k), j_max], where k is some small number. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps the optimal j is around (rem // 2). But again, not sure.\n\nAnother thought: For each possible j (number of weight 2 items taken), the corresponding number of weight 1 items is (rem - 2*j). However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, we can take up to min( (rem - 2*j), len(s1) ) items. So for each j, the total cost is s2[j] + s1[min( (rem - 2*j), len(s1) )]. The maximum over all possible j in 0..j_max.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum efficiently. If j_max is up to (rem // 2), which can be up to 1.5e5 when rem is 3e5. For each z, this is O(rem) time. But with z up to m//3 (about 1e5), the total time is O( (m/3) * (m/2) ) = O(m² / 6) which is 1.5e11 operations. That's way too slow for Python.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible. Need another idea.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nWe can precompute for each weight group:\n\n- For weight 1, sorted in descending order of cost. Compute prefix sums s1 where s1[i] is the sum of the first i items.\n- Similarly for weight 2, prefix sums s2.\n- For weight 3, prefix sums s3.\n\nThen, for the total problem, we can iterate over the number of weight 3 items taken (z), and for each z, we can compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*z. Then, we need to find the optimal way to fill rem with weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute this optimal way quickly.\n\nAnother observation: For the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection can be found by considering the following:\n\nLet’s say we have a total capacity of rem. Let’s take as many weight 2 items as possible, but also consider replacing some weight 2 items with weight 1 items if that gives a better total cost.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since weight 1 items are cheaper per unit weight (since they take 1 unit of weight each), but their individual cost may be higher than some weight 2 items. For example, if a weight 1 item has cost 100, and a weight 2 item has cost 150. Taking the weight 2 item gives more cost per weight (75 per unit) than the weight 1 (100 per unit). Wait, no. Wait, the cost per unit weight for the weight 1 is 100 per 1 unit, and for the weight 2 is 150 per 2 units, which is 75 per unit. So the weight 1 item is better per unit. So perhaps, for the same weight, taking as many weight 1 items as possible is better.\n\nBut this depends on the specific items. So maybe the optimal way is to take as many of the highest value items as possible, regardless of their weight.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can merge them into a list of items with weight 1 and 2, sorted by cost per unit weight. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for a given capacity rem, the optimal choice is to take as many weight 1 items as possible, but then replace some of them with weight 2 items if that gives a better total.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nWait, perhaps for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection can be found by considering the following: For each possible number of weight 2 items (j), we can take j items of weight 2 and (rem - 2j) items of weight 1. However, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, the maximum j can be up to min(len(s2), rem//2). But even if I can find the best j quickly, how?\n\nLet me think about the possible values of j. For the best j, it's possible that j is either floor( (rem) / 2 ), or floor( (rem)/2 ) -1, etc. So maybe for each rem, the optimal j is in the vicinity of (rem // 2), and we can check a few possibilities around that.\n\nBut how many possibilities do I need to check? For example, for each rem, check j from max(0, j_max - 100) to j_max, where j_max is min(len(s2), rem//2). Then, for each j in that range, compute the total cost. This would take O(100) per rem, which is manageable.\n\nBut why would this work? Well, since the items are sorted, the optimal j is likely to be near the maximum possible j, or perhaps near some other point. However, this is a heuristic and may not work for all cases. But given that the items are sorted, perhaps the optimal j is in a small window around the maximum possible j.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the items are sorted, for each j, the cost of taking j weight 2 items is s2[j], and the cost of taking (rem - 2j) weight 1 items is s1[k], where k is min( (rem - 2j), len(s1) ). So the total cost is s2[j] + s1[ min( (rem - 2j), len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut if I can find the j that maximizes this expression, then I can compute it quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For each possible rem, the optimal j is the one that balances the number of weight 2 and 1 items. Let's imagine that we can take up to j_max weight 2 items. Then, for each possible j in 0 to j_max, the corresponding number of weight 1 items is (rem - 2j). However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking as many as possible is optimal. So for a given j, the maximum number of weight 1 items is min( (rem - 2j), len(s1) ).\n\nBut how to find the best j?\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(j) = s2[j] + s1[ min( (rem - 2j), len(s1) ) ].\n\nThis function is not necessarily monotonic. For example, increasing j by 1 may decrease the number of weight 1 items by 2, which could lead to a decrease in the total cost. However, if the weight 2 item added has higher value than the two weight 1 items that are replaced, then the total cost increases.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, the weight 2 items are taken in order of highest cost, and same for weight 1. So perhaps the function f(j) is unimodal, meaning it first increases and then decreases, allowing binary search for the maximum. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for the given rem, the optimal j is such that the number of weight 1 items is as high as possible, but also the weight 2 items are as high as possible. However, without knowing the exact relationship, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother approach: Precompute for the weight 1 and 2 items, for each possible capacity, the maximum value. But since the capacity can be up to 3e5, and for each possible capacity, we need to compute this, it's feasible?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have a dynamic programming array dp for the weight 1 and 2 items. But how?\n\nThe standard knapsack approach for 0-1 knapsack would be O(nm), but here n is up to 1e5 and m is 3e5. That's 3e10 operations, which is impossible.\n\nBut since the items are grouped by weight (either 1 or 2), maybe we can find a way to compute the maximum for each capacity.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, since they are sorted, for any capacity, the maximum value is the sum of the first k items, where k is the minimum between the number of items and the capacity.\n\nFor weight 2 items, similarly, the maximum value for a capacity of t is the sum of the first j items, where j is the minimum between the number of items and t//2.\n\nBut combining them is the challenge.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, given a capacity rem, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many weight 1 items as possible (rem items), and none of weight 2.\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible (rem//2 items), and none of weight 1.\n\n- Some combination in between.\n\nBut how to find this combination?\n\nHere's an idea: For the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal solution can be found by considering all possible numbers of weight 2 items up to min( (rem//2), len(s2) ), but instead of checking all of them, we can check for the j that is in the vicinity of (rem - x) / 2, where x is the number of weight 1 items. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, we can find the optimal j by considering the following:\n\nFor each possible j (number of weight 2 items taken), the maximum number of weight 1 items is (rem - 2*j). However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking the first (rem - 2*j) of them is optimal.\n\nSo for a given rem, the maximum possible value is the maximum over all possible j (from 0 to min(rem//2, len(s2))) of s2[j] + s1[ min( (rem - 2*j), len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut how to compute this maximum quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following. For a given rem, the possible j ranges from 0 to j_max = min( len(s2), rem // 2 ). Let's say that j_max is up to 1.5e5. But for each z (number of weight 3 items), this would be O(1.5e5) operations. And since z can be up to 1e5, this would be O(1.5e10) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nBut maybe, for the problem constraints, there's a way to optimize this. Let's think about the maximum possible j_max. For example, if the number of weight 2 items is small (like 1e5), then j_max can be up to 1e5. But even then, for each z, it's O(1e5) operations, which is 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible rem, find the optimal j in O(1) or O(1) time using preprocessed data.\n\nLet me think about the following. For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible numbers of weight 2 items j, the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be added given a certain capacity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, for a given rem, the optimal j is the one where the next weight 2 item is not worth adding compared to the weight 1 items.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection is to take as many as possible of the highest value items, regardless of their weight. For example, if a weight 2 item has higher value than two weight 1 items, then it's better to take it. Otherwise, take the two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of merging the weight 1 and 2 items into a single list, sorted by their value per unit weight. Wait, but that's not straightforward. For example, comparing a weight 1 item with value 10 and a weight 2 item with value 15. The per unit weight is 10 vs 7.5, so the weight 1 is better. But if you have a weight 2 item with value 19 and a weight 1 with 10, then the per unit is 9.5 vs 10. So the weight 1 is better. However, if you have a weight 2 item with value 20, then per unit is 10, same as the weight 1. So in this case, you can choose either.\n\nBut how to combine them optimally. It seems like this is similar to the classic greedy algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem, but since we can't take fractions, but only whole items, it's not directly applicable.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps we can use a two-pointer approach. For example, we can have pointers i and j for the weight 1 and 2 items. We compare the next weight 1 item (s1[i]) with the next weight 2 item (s2[j]). If the weight 1 item is more valuable than the weight 2 item, take it. Else, take the weight 2 item. Repeat until the capacity is filled.\n\nWait, but this would require that we can compare individual items, but the problem is that taking a weight 2 item uses up 2 units of capacity. However, this approach might not be optimal. For example, suppose we have two weight 1 items with values 3 and 3, and one weight 2 item with value 5. The capacity is 3. The optimal choice is to take the two weight 1 items (total 6) instead of the weight 2 item (5). However, comparing the first weight 1 (value 3) with the weight 2 (value 5), the weight 2 is better. So taking it would leave 1 unit capacity, which can't be used for anything. Total is 5. But taking two weight 1 items gives 6. So the greedy approach of choosing the higher value per unit would fail here.\n\nThus, the greedy approach of comparing individual items isn't sufficient.\n\nSo back to square one.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, the optimal number of weight 2 items is either floor(rem / 2) or floor(rem / 2) - 1, or something like that. Let's think: for a given rem, the maximum number of weight 2 items is j_max = min( len(s2), rem // 2 ). Then, the optimal j could be either j_max, j_max - 1, ..., down to some small number. But how many possibilities do we need to check?\n\nIf we check all possible j in the range [max(0, j_max - 100), j_max], then for each rem, we can find the best j in O(100) time. Since 100 is a small constant, this would make the overall time acceptable.\n\nWhy would this work? Well, considering that for each rem, the optimal j is likely to be close to j_max. For example, in the worst case, taking j_max weight 2 items and then filling the remaining capacity with weight 1 items. Or, perhaps, taking j_max -1 weight 2 items and then filling with weight 1 items. The difference between these two options may be small, but since the items are sorted, the optimal j is within a small range of j_max.\n\nBut how to determine how many possibilities to check. Let's assume that checking up to 200 possibilities is enough. For example, for each rem, check j from max(0, j_max - 200) to j_max. Since 200 is small, this would add 200 * (number of z iterations) operations.\n\nBut why would this work? Well, in practice, for most cases, the optimal j is near j_max, especially since the items are sorted. However, there could be cases where the optimal j is much smaller, but given that the items are sorted, it's unlikely. For example, if there are many high-value weight 1 items that can fill up the capacity better than taking fewer weight 2 items.\n\nBut how to verify this? Well, let's take an example. Suppose rem is 100, and we have 50 weight 2 items with value 1 each (total 50) and 100 weight 1 items with value 1 each. Then, taking j=50 gives total 50, but taking j=0 and 100 weight 1 items gives 100. So the optimal j is 0. In this case, checking j_max (50) and j_max - 1 (49) would not find the optimal j. Thus, this approach would fail.\n\nSo this suggests that the idea of checking only a few possibilities around j_max is not sufficient.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible rem, the optimal number of weight 2 items is such that the number of weight 1 items taken is as much as possible. So for a given j, the number of weight 1 items is rem - 2j. But rem - 2j can be negative. So we need to ensure that 2j ≤ rem.\n\nLet me think about the following: for each possible j, the value is s2[j] + s1[ min( (rem - 2j), len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut since s1 is the prefix sum of sorted weight 1 items, and s2 is the prefix sum of sorted weight 2 items, the function is non-decreasing up to a certain point and then starts decreasing. Or maybe not. It's possible that adding more weight 2 items could sometimes increase the total value, sometimes decrease it.\n\nBut if we can find the maximum of this function over all possible j, then we can find the optimal value.\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following: for a given rem, we can compute the maximum between taking as many weight 2 items as possible, and taking as many weight 1 items as possible. Also, check some intermediate points.\n\nBut how to find those intermediate points.\n\nAlternatively, for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal number of weight 2 items is the largest j such that the (j+1)-th weight 2 item is more valuable than two weight 1 items that would be replaced by taking it.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think: For each j, the next weight 2 item (if we take j+1 items) would give us an additional value of s2[j+1] - s2[j], but would require us to reduce the number of weight 1 items by 2 (since 2j + 2 = 2(j+1), so rem - 2(j+1) = (rem - 2j) - 2). Thus, the loss in weight 1 items is the difference between the sum of the first (rem - 2j) items and the sum of the first (rem - 2j - 2) items, which is the sum of the last two items in the weight 1 selection. \n\nSo for the decision to take j+1 weight 2 items instead of j, the gain is (s2[j+1] - s2[j]) - (s1_k - s1_{k-2}), where k = min(rem - 2j, len(s1)).\n\nIf this gain is positive, it's better to take j+1 items.\n\nBut this seems complicated to compute for all possible j.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as follows: start with j=0, and increment j until the gain is no longer positive. This would give us the optimal j.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose I have weight 1 items sorted as [c1, c2, c3, ...], and weight 2 items sorted as [d1, d2, d3, ...].\n\nInitially, j=0, and the number of weight 1 items is rem. The total is s1[rem] + s2[0].\n\nNow, compare taking one more weight 2 item (d1) and reducing the weight 1 items by 2. The gain is d1 - (c_{rem} + c_{rem-1}).\n\nIf this is positive, take it. Then j increases by 1, and the new number of weight 1 items is rem - 2*1. Repeat this process until adding another weight 2 item would not give a positive gain.\n\nBut this approach would require for each j to check the next weight 2 item and compare it to the next two weight 1 items. This sounds like a greedy approach that might work.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nLet me outline the steps for this approach:\n\nFor a given rem:\n\n1. Initialize j = 0, and k = min(rem, len(s1)).\n\n2. The current total is s2[j] + s1[k].\n\n3. While j < len(s2) and (rem - 2*j) >= 0 and (j+1 <= len(s2)):\n\n   a. Compute the next possible j+1. The number of weight 1 items would be k_new = min(rem - 2*(j+1), len(s1)).\n\n   b. The gain from taking one more weight 2 item (d_{j+1}) and losing the two weight 1 items (c_{k} and c_{k-1} if k >= 2).\n\n   c. If k >= 2 and d_{j+1} > (c_{k} + c_{k-1}), then take it. Increment j by 1, and update k_new.\n\n   d. Else, break.\n\nBut wait, this assumes that the two weight 1 items being removed are the last two in the current selection. But if the current k is less than 2, then we can't remove two items. Also, if the current k is exactly the number of weight 1 items taken, then adding a weight 2 item would reduce the number of weight 1 items by 2, but only if there are at least two to remove.\n\nThis seems plausible. However, this approach may not always find the global maximum, but perhaps it's a good approximation.\n\nLet's test this with the earlier example where rem is 100, and we have 50 weight 2 items with value 1 each, and 100 weight 1 items with value 1 each.\n\nInitially, j=0, k=100. The total is 0 + 100 = 100. Now, check if adding j+1=1 weight 2 item is better. The gain is 1 (d_1) minus the sum of the last two weight 1 items (1 + 1 = 2). Since 1 < 2, we don't take it. So the loop breaks. Thus, the optimal j is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: rem=3, weight 2 items with value 5 (d_1=5), and weight 1 items with values 3, 3, 3. So s2[0] = 0, s2[1] =5. For j=0, k=3, total is 0 + 9 =9. Now, check adding j=1. The new k is min(3 - 2*1, 3) = 1. The gain is 5 - (3 + 3) = -1. So no improvement. So the optimal j is 0. But what if there's a weight 2 item with value 6? Then, the gain would be 6 - 6 = 0. Still, no improvement. But if the weight 2 item is 7, then the gain is 7-6=1, so take it. The new total is 7 + 3 =10, which is better than 9.\n\nSo this approach works in this case.\n\nAnother example: rem=3, weight 2 items with value 5, weight 1 items with values 3 and 3 (so len(s1) is 2). Initial j=0, k= min(3, 2) = 2. Total is 0 + 3+3 =6. Adding j=1 would require k = 3-2*1 = 1. So the new total is 5 + 3 =8, which is better. The gain is 5 - (3) = 2 (since k was 2, but after removing 2 items, we have k_new=1. Wait, the previous k was 2, and now we are removing 2 items (but there are only two items). So the gain is 5 - (3 +3) = -1. So according to the algorithm, we would not take it. But the actual gain is 5 + 3 (for j=1 and k=1) = 8, which is better than 6. Why is the algorithm not detecting this?\n\nAh, because the algorithm checks the sum of the last two items in the current selection (which is 3+3=6), and compares it with the new weight 2 item (5). Since 5 < 6, it doesn't take it. But in reality, taking the weight 2 item and one weight 1 item gives a better result. So this approach fails in this case.\n\nSo the algorithm's logic is flawed. What's the problem here?\n\nThe problem is that when you add a weight 2 item, you reduce the number of weight 1 items by 2. But in this case, the current number of weight 1 items is 2. After adding the weight 2 item, the number of weight 1 items is 1. So we lose 2 items, but only 1 is left. So the gain is (d_j+1) - (sum of the two items removed). In this case, the two items are 3 and 3, sum 6. The gain is 5 - 6 = -1. So the algorithm would not take it. But in reality, the total is 5 + 3 = 8, which is better than 6.\n\nWait, what's the original total? When j=0, the total is 0 + 3 +3 = 6. When j=1, it's 5 + 3 = 8. So the gain is 8-6 = +2. But according to the algorithm, the gain is 5 - (3+3) = -1. Why the discrepancy?\n\nBecause the algorithm assumes that when you add a weight 2 item, you lose two weight 1 items, but in this case, adding the weight 2 item reduces the weight 1 count from 2 to 1, which means you lose one item, not two. Wait, no. The initial weight for j=0 is 0*2 = 0. rem is 3. So the number of weight 1 items is 3, but since there are only 2 items available, it's 2. When j increases to 1, the weight used is 2*1 = 2. Remaining capacity is 3-2 = 1. So the number of weight 1 items is min(1, 2) = 1. So the total weight is 2*1 + 1*1 = 3. So the weight 1 items taken are 1, not 2-2=0. So the algorithm's calculation of the gain was incorrect.\n\nAh, here's the mistake: when you increase j by 1, you're using 2 more units of capacity. So the weight 1 items can be taken as (rem - 2*(j+1)). But in the previous step, the weight 1 items were taken as (rem - 2*j). So the difference between the two is (rem - 2*(j+1)) - (rem - 2j) = -2. So the number of weight 1 items is decreased by 2. But in this example, when j increases from 0 to 1, the number of weight 1 items goes from 2 to 1, which is a decrease of 1, not 2. This suggests that the assumption that the number of weight 1 items decreases by 2 is incorrect when the available weight 1 items are less than the required.\n\nSo the algorithm's logic is wrong. Hence, this approach may not work.\n\nThis seems to complicate things further. Perhaps this indicates that there's no efficient way to compute the optimal j for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, and we need to return to the initial idea of iterating through all possible j for each rem, but with some optimizations.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. The total number of weight 3 items is up to m//3 = 1e5. For each of these, the rem is up to m = 3e5. For each rem, the maximum possible j_max is min( len(s2), rem//2 ). Let's assume that len(s2) is up to 1e5. Then, for each rem, j_max is up to 1.5e5. If we iterate through",
