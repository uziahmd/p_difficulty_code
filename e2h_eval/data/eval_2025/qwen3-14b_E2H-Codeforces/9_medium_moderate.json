Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So, a standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time. So I need a smarter way.\n\nFirst, let's think about the weights. Since each item's weight is only 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can group items by their weight and then find an optimal way to select them.\n\nLet me break it down. For each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Because for each weight, we want to take as many as possible of the highest value items first.\n\nSo for weight 1: sort all items with w=1 in descending order of c. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nThen, for each weight group, we can precompute prefix sums. That way, for any number of items taken from that group, we can quickly get the total cost.\n\nBut how do we combine these groups optimally? Let's think.\n\nThe problem becomes selecting how many items to take from each weight group such that the total weight is <= m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nBut since the weight can be 1, 2, 3, maybe we can model this with some dynamic programming, but given the size of m, perhaps not. Wait, but maybe there's a way to handle it with some greedy approach combined with some DP steps.\n\nAlternatively, since the weights are small, perhaps we can process the items for each weight group, and for each possible number of items taken from those groups, compute the maximum cost.\n\nBut even that might be tricky. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nLet's suppose that we have sorted all the items for each weight group. For example, for weight 1, we have a list sorted in descending order. Then, for each possible number of items taken from weight 1, we can compute the total cost and weight. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nBut since combining these three groups would be complex, perhaps we can consider the problem in parts. For example, first handle the weight 1 and 2 items, then combine with the weight 3 items. Or find a way to iterate through possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is small, perhaps we can use a DP approach where for each possible weight, we track the maximum value. However, given that m can be up to 3e5, and n up to 1e5, a standard O(m) DP might be feasible if we can process the items efficiently.\n\nWait, but for items with weight 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can use a modified knapsack approach. Let me think. Let's say we have a DP array where dp[w] represents the maximum value achievable with total weight exactly w. But since m can be up to 3e5, and n is up to 1e5, this might be feasible. However, for each item, processing it would take O(m) time. For n=1e5 and m=3e5, that's 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo that's not going to work. Need another idea.\n\nAnother thought: since the weight of each item is small (only 1,2,3), maybe for each weight group, we can precompute the best possible selection for any number of items. Then, combine them in a way that considers how many items from each group are chosen, but without considering all possibilities.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, we can take up to k items, where k is min(number of items, m). Similarly for weight 2 and 3. But how to combine them?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. Let's say we have for each weight group, a list of prefix sums. For example, for weight 1, we have prefix1[i] = sum of the first i items (sorted in descending order). Similarly for weight 2 (prefix2) and weight 3 (prefix3).\n\nNow, the total weight is w1*1 + w2*2 + w3*3 <= m, where w1 is the number of items taken from weight 1, w2 from weight 2, w3 from weight 3.\n\nWe need to maximize prefix1[w1] + prefix2[w2] + prefix3[w3], under the constraint that w1 + 2w2 + 3w3 <= m.\n\nBut how to find the optimal combination of w1, w2, w3?\n\nThis seems like a three-dimensional problem, but perhaps we can reduce it by iterating over one of the variables.\n\nFor example, since the weight 3 items are the heaviest, perhaps we can iterate over how many of them we take, then for each possible number of weight 3 items, we can solve the remaining problem with weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut even that, for m up to 3e5, and weight3 items up to (m//3), which could be up to 1e5, that might be manageable.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have precomputed the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2. For each possible number of weight 3 items (say, k), we can calculate the remaining capacity as rem = m - 3*k. Then, we need to find the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items that can fit into rem weight. How to compute that quickly?\n\nThe problem now becomes, given a certain capacity, what is the maximum value obtainable using weight 1 and 2 items. How to compute this quickly?\n\nBut for each possible rem, how to compute this? Well, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute their prefix sums, and then for a given rem, we can try all possible numbers of weight 2 items (say, x), and then the number of weight 1 items would be rem - 2x. But since rem can be up to m, which is 3e5, and for each k (number of weight 3 items) we do this, it might be too slow.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible total weight, the maximum value. Let me think. Let's say we have a DP array for weight 1 and 2. But how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted in descending order of cost, perhaps we can find for a given capacity, the optimal way to take them.\n\nLet me think. For weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection would be to take as many as possible of the highest value items. However, since they have different weights, it's not straightforward. For example, taking a weight 2 item with high value may be better than two weight 1 items with lower values.\n\nBut perhaps for the combined weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, and then compute the maximum possible weight 1 items that can be added. Then, for a given capacity, we can iterate over all possible numbers of weight 2 items (up to min(possible, capacity//2)), and compute the corresponding weight 1 items.\n\nBut again, this might be O(m) per iteration, which could be expensive.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute the best possible for each possible capacity. Let's think of this as a separate problem: given a capacity W, what is the maximum value we can get by choosing items with weight 1 or 2. How can we compute this quickly?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that we have sorted the weight 1 items in descending order and the weight 2 items in descending order. Then, for each possible number of weight 2 items taken (say, x), the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken is (W - 2*x). But since the weight 1 items are sorted, we can take the first (W - 2x) items. However, x can't exceed the number of weight 2 items available, and also 2x can't exceed W.\n\nSo for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum over all x (from 0 to min(num_2, W//2)) of (sum of first x weight 2 items) + (sum of first (W - 2x) weight 1 items). But this would require for each W, trying all x up to W//2, which is O(W) time. Which is not feasible if W is up to 3e5 and we have to do this multiple times.\n\nBut maybe, for the combined weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute the best possible for all possible capacities. However, how?\n\nAlternatively, let's precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2. Let's say:\n\nprefix1[i] = sum of first i weight 1 items.\n\nprefix2[i] = sum of first i weight 2 items.\n\nThen, for a given capacity W, the optimal selection is to choose x (number of weight 2 items) and y (number of weight 1 items) such that 2x + y ≤ W. We need to maximize prefix2[x] + prefix1[y].\n\nBut how to find x and y for a given W?\n\nBut since y can be up to W - 2x, and since the prefix1 is sorted, for each x, the maximum y is min( (W - 2x), len(prefix1) ). So for each x, we can compute the maximum possible contribution.\n\nBut the problem is, for a given W, how to find the x that maximizes prefix2[x] + prefix1[ min( (W - 2x), len1 ) ].\n\nBut how can we find this x quickly?\n\nLet me think. For each possible x, the value is prefix2[x] + prefix1[ min( W - 2x, len1 ) ].\n\nWe can iterate x from 0 to min( num_2, W//2 ), and find the maximum. However, if W is up to 3e5, and we have to do this for each possible W, that's O(3e5 * 3e5) which is way too slow.\n\nBut in our problem, for the case when we are considering weight 3 items, we can compute for each possible k (number of weight 3 items), the remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*k. Then, for each such rem, we need to compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items. If we can compute this quickly, then the overall algorithm would be feasible.\n\nSo, how to compute for a given rem, the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nLet me think again. Let's denote that the maximum number of weight 2 items is x_max = min( len2, rem // 2 ). For each x in 0 to x_max, the number of weight 1 items is y = min( rem - 2x, len1 ). Then the total value is prefix2[x] + prefix1[y]. The maximum over all x is the answer.\n\nBut if we can find the optimal x for each rem quickly, then we can proceed.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of x as varying between 0 and x_max. For each x, the value is prefix2[x] + prefix1[ min(rem - 2x, len1) ].\n\nBut since the prefix arrays are non-decreasing (since we sorted the items in descending order), perhaps there's a way to find the optimal x.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given rem, the optimal x is somewhere in the range [max(0, (rem - len1)/2 ), ... ] ?\n\nNot sure. Maybe we can find that for a given rem, the optimal x is either floor((rem)/2) or something similar. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that the function f(x) = prefix2[x] + prefix1[ min(rem - 2x, len1) ] may have a single peak. So perhaps we can binary search for the optimal x. However, I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of weight 2 items is limited (let's say, up to 1e5), for each possible rem, we can compute x_max and check all x in the range from max(0, x_max - K) to x_max, where K is a small number, like 100. Because perhaps the optimal x is near the x_max.\n\nBut this is just a heuristic. How can we be sure?\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, since the weight is small, perhaps the optimal x is up to the number of weight 2 items, but given that for each rem, the maximum x is O(rem/2). However, if rem is up to 3e5, then for each k (number of weight 3 items), which can be up to m//3 (about 1e5), then the total time would be O(1e5 * 3e5) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThis approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for all possible total weight up to m, the maximum value. How?\n\nLet me think. Since the items are of weight 1 and 2, and sorted in descending order, perhaps we can use a greedy approach. For example, for a given capacity, take as many as possible of the highest value items, but considering the weight.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct. For example, if you have a weight 2 item worth 3, and two weight 1 items worth 2 each. If the capacity is 2, taking the weight 2 item gives 3, which is better than two weight 1 items (total 4). Wait no, 2+2=4 is higher. Oh right! So in that case, the greedy approach of taking the highest value per unit weight may not work. So the problem is that the choice between weight 1 and 2 items isn't straightforward.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we need to find a way to combine the two groups optimally.\n\nBut here's another idea: for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items (x) the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken (y) given that 2x + y <= W. Then, for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum over all x of (prefix2[x] + prefix1[y]).\n\nBut how to find this x quickly?\n\nSuppose we have precomputed the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2. Let's say the maximum number of weight 2 items possible is up to say, len2. Then, for each possible W, we can loop x from 0 to min(len2, W//2), and compute the corresponding y. But again, for large W, this would be O(W) time per query, which is not feasible.\n\nBut in our problem, when we are considering the weight 3 items, we can iterate over k (number of weight 3 items) and for each k, compute rem = m - 3k. Then, for that rem, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2. Let's assume that for each rem, we can compute this maximum in O(1) or O(log n) time. How?\n\nAlternative approach: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for each possible total weight up to m, the maximum value. How?\n\nLet me think. For the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for capacity W can be computed using a dynamic programming approach. Let's say dp[W] is the maximum value for capacity W. Then, for each item, we can update the dp array. But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can optimize this.\n\nBut the problem is that for n up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, this would take O(nm) time, which is again not feasible.\n\nWait, but for the weight 1 and 2 items, maybe we can process them in a way that allows us to compute the dp array quickly. For example, for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted, we can take as many as possible. For weight 2 items, same.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items. So for a given capacity W, we can take up to x = min( len2, W // 2 ) weight 2 items. For each x, the remaining capacity is W - 2x, which can be filled with weight 1 items. So the maximum over all x is the answer. But how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think. Suppose that for a given W, the optimal x is in the range [max(0, x_opt - K), x_opt + K], where K is a small number. Then, we can check all possible x in that range. But how to find x_opt?\n\nAlternatively, since the prefix2 and prefix1 are non-decreasing, the function f(x) = prefix2[x] + prefix1[ min( W - 2x, len1 ) ] is unimodal. That is, it increases to a certain point and then decreases. If that's the case, we can perform ternary search on x to find the maximum.\n\nBut is the function unimodal? Let's think. Suppose that as x increases, adding a weight 2 item may increase the value (if it's better than the weight 1 items that could be replaced). However, after some point, adding more weight 2 items may decrease the value, because the remaining capacity for weight 1 items is reduced.\n\nBut I'm not sure if it's strictly unimodal. However, assuming that it is, we can perform ternary search on x in the range [0, x_max], where x_max = min( len2, W//2 ). This would allow us to find the maximum in O(log x_max) time per query.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each rem (when processing weight 3 items), we can compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 in O(log x_max) time, which would be acceptable.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Separate the items into groups by their weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Precompute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. For each possible number of weight 3 items taken (k), compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*k. If rem < 0, skip. Otherwise, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items with capacity rem. Add that to the prefix3[k], and keep track of the maximum total.\n\nThe question is, how to compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items quickly for a given rem.\n\nSo, implementing the ternary search approach for that part.\n\nBut how to implement the ternary search? Let's think about it.\n\nFor a given W (rem), x can vary from 0 to x_max = min( len2, W//2 ). For each x, the value is prefix2[x] + prefix1[ min( W - 2x, len1 ) ].\n\nLet me define this as f(x). We need to find the x in [0, x_max] that maximizes f(x).\n\nAssuming that f(x) is unimodal, ternary search can be applied. However, I'm not sure if it's strictly unimodal. But perhaps for practical purposes, it's sufficient to try a few candidates around the optimal point.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of weight 2 items is limited (say, up to 1e5), but for each query, if the x_max is up to 1e5, then even checking all possible x would be O(1e5) per query, which for k up to 1e5 would be O(1e10) operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose that for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken. Then, for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum of prefix2[x] + prefix1[y], where y = min( W - 2x, len1 ), and x ranges from 0 to x_max.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x?\n\nLet me think of the following: since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, and the weight 1 items are also sorted, perhaps the optimal x is either the maximum possible x (so that 2x is as large as possible), or the x that allows the maximum combination of weight 2 and 1 items.\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, the optimal x can be found by considering that the best x is the one where the marginal gain of adding another weight 2 item is better than the loss of removing two weight 1 items.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to translate that into code.\n\nAnother idea: For a given W, the optimal x is the minimum between the number of weight 2 items available and floor( (W - y)/2 ), where y is the number of weight 1 items. But this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a trade-off between taking more weight 2 items and fewer weight 1 items. For example, taking one more weight 2 item would cost 2 units of weight, but gain the value of that item, and lose the value of two weight 1 items (if they exist). But since the weight 1 items are sorted, the first ones are the most valuable. So, for the optimal x, the next weight 2 item's value should be higher than the sum of the two weight 1 items that would be replaced.\n\nBut this seems complicated to model.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, perhaps the optimal x is the maximum between:\n\n- taking as many weight 2 items as possible (x_max) and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nOR\n\n- taking x_max - 1 weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut this is just a heuristic. However, considering that the number of weight 2 items is up to 1e5, but for each query, checking a few possibilities (like x_max, x_max-1, etc.) might be feasible.\n\nFor example, for a given W, we can compute x_max = min( len2, W//2 ). Then, we can check x in the range [max(0, x_max - 100), x_max], and compute the corresponding value. Since the optimal x is likely to be near x_max, this might work.\n\nBut why 100? Well, given that the items are sorted, the top few items are the most valuable. So, perhaps checking up to 100 possibilities around x_max would cover the optimal x.\n\nThis is a heuristic approach, but perhaps it works for the problem constraints.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose that W is large enough to take all weight 2 items, but there are some weight 1 items that are very valuable. For example, suppose there are 100 weight 2 items with value 100 each, and 1000 weight 1 items with value 100 each. Then, for W = 2*100 + 1000*1 = 1200, the optimal x is 100, and the rest filled with weight 1 items. But if W is slightly less, like 1200 - 1, then the optimal x is 99, allowing 1200 -1 - 2*99 = 1200 - 1 - 198 = 1001, which is more than the number of weight 1 items. So in this case, the optimal x is 99.\n\nBut if I check x_max (which is 100) and x_max-1 (99), then I can find the maximum.\n\nBut what if there's a case where the optimal x is much smaller than x_max?\n\nFor example, imagine that the weight 2 items are very low value, and the weight 1 items are very high. Like, weight 2 items have value 1 each, and weight 1 items have value 100 each. Then, for W = 100, the optimal x is 0, and y is 100. But x_max would be 50 (since 2*50 = 100). So, checking x_max and x_max-1 would miss the optimal x.\n\nIn this case, the heuristic approach would fail.\n\nSo, this suggests that the heuristic approach is not reliable. Hence, we need a better way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think again about the problem. For the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each weight group, we have sorted lists. For weight 1, we have a sorted list, and for weight 2, also sorted. Now, for a given capacity W, the optimal selection is to take as many as possible of the higher value items, regardless of their weight. But since the weight varies, how to compare?\n\nThis seems like the classic unbounded knapsack problem, but with items of limited quantity (each item can be taken once). But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nTake all the weight 1 and weight 2 items, and merge them into a single list, sorted by value per unit weight. But since the value per unit weight may not be directly comparable, this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a two-pointer approach. For example, compare the next weight 1 item with the next weight 2 item. Take whichever has higher value per unit weight. But again, since the weight differs, this might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, for each weight 1 item, its value per unit weight is c_i / 1 = c_i. For a weight 2 item, it's c_i / 2. So, if the current highest value per unit weight is from a weight 1 item, we take it. Else, take a weight 2 item. But this is a greedy approach that may not work in all cases.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose we have two weight 2 items with value 3 each, and two weight 1 items with value 2 each. The capacity is 2. According to the greedy approach, the value per unit weight for weight 2 is 3/2=1.5, and for weight 1 it's 2. So take the weight 1 item. Total value 2. But the optimal is to take one weight 2 item (value 3). So the greedy approach fails here.\n\nThus, this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think back to the original problem.\n\nWhat if we precompute for the weight 1 and 2 items, a combined prefix sum for all possible combinations of weight 1 and 2 items, but with the total weight being up to m?\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (x), we can precompute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken for any W. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute two arrays:\n\n- For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (x), the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken for a given capacity.\n\nBut this seems unclear.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the weight of the items is small, perhaps we can use a dynamic programming approach that is optimized for the small weights.\n\nFor example, let's create a dp array where dp[i] represents the maximum value achievable with total weight i. For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can initialize dp[0] = 0. Then, for each item in the combined list of weight 1 and 2 items, we can update the dp array. But since the items are processed in a specific order (sorted), perhaps this can be done efficiently.\n\nBut with m up to 3e5, and n up to 1e5, this would be O(m * n), which is too slow.\n\nBut wait, the number of items for weight 1 and 2 is up to 1e5 each, so total of 2e5 items. For each item, updating the dp array from m down to the item's weight would be O(m) per item, leading to O(2e5 * 3e5) = 6e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the items are sorted, for the weight 1 items, we can take as many as possible, and for weight 2 items, similarly. But how to balance between them?\n\nLet me think of this as follows: for a given capacity W, the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is y = min(W, len1). The maximum number of weight 2 items is x = min(W//2, len2). But we need to choose x and y such that 2x + y ≤ W, and maximize prefix2[x] + prefix1[y].\n\nBut how to find this x and y?\n\nLet me think of it as follows: for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible (x = min(W//2, len2)), then taking as many weight 1 items as possible with the remaining weight.\n\n- Taking as many weight 1 items as possible (y = min(W, len1)), then taking as many weight 2 items as possible with the remaining weight.\n\nBut this might not give the optimal solution, but it could be a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, we can compute the optimal x by finding the point where the value of the weight 2 item is higher than the value of two weight 1 items.\n\nLet me think. For example, if the next weight 2 item has value greater than the sum of the next two weight 1 items, then it's better to take the weight 2 item. Otherwise, take the two weight 1 items.\n\nThis is similar to the greedy approach used in the classic problem of merging two sorted arrays.\n\nSo, let's imagine that we have pointers for weight 1 and weight 2 items. Initially, both pointers are at the beginning. We compare the next weight 2 item (if any) with the next two weight 1 items (if any). If the weight 2 item is better, we take it; else, take the two weight 1 items. Repeat until the capacity is filled.\n\nBut this approach would require knowing the current state of how many items have been taken from each group. However, since the items are sorted, this might be possible.\n\nBut how to translate this into a way to compute for a given W?\n\nLet me think of it as a simulation. For example, for a given W, we can simulate the process of choosing between weight 2 items and pairs of weight 1 items.\n\nLet's say we have x weight 2 items taken and y weight 1 items taken. The total weight is 2x + y. We want this to be ≤ W. And we want to maximize prefix2[x] + prefix1[y].\n\nLet me think of this as a process:\n\nInitialize x = 0, y = 0.\n\nWhile there are items left to consider:\n\n   if there are weight 2 items left and weight 1 items left:\n\n      compare the next weight 2 item (c2) with the next two weight 1 items (c1a + c1b).\n\n      if c2 > c1a + c1b: take the weight 2 item (x += 1, add to total)\n\n      else: take the two weight 1 items (y += 2, add to total)\n\n   elif there are weight 2 items left:\n\n      take as many as possible.\n\n   elif there are weight 1 items left:\n\n      take as many as possible.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach that may not always work. However, it might work for this problem, given that the items are sorted in descending order.\n\nLet me test this with the earlier example:\n\nExample 1: weight 2 items have value 3 each, weight 1 items have value 2 each. Capacity W = 2.\n\nThe simulation would compare the next weight 2 item (3) with the next two weight 1 items (2 + 2 = 4). Since 3 < 4, the algorithm would take the two weight 1 items, giving total value 4, but the optimal is to take one weight 2 item (value 3). So this approach would give a suboptimal result.\n\nThus, the greedy approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me think of another way.\n\nLet's return to the original idea of iterating over the number of weight 3 items, and for each, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items. To compute that quickly, perhaps we can precompute for all possible x (number of weight 2 items) the best y for any W.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum possible number of weight 2 items is len2, and for each x (number of weight 2 items), the corresponding maximum number of weight 1 items is min( W - 2x, len1 ). So, for a given W, the maximum value is max_{x} (prefix2[x] + prefix1[ min( W - 2x, len1 ) ]).\n\nNow, the function of x is such that as x increases, the prefix2[x] increases, but the term min(W - 2x, len1) decreases, so prefix1[...] decreases. The overall function may have a single peak, so it's unimodal. If this is true, then we can use ternary search to find the maximum.\n\nLet me try to see if this is the case.\n\nConsider that for x increasing, prefix2[x] increases, but the available weight for weight 1 items decreases. So, the function may first increase and then decrease, making it unimodal.\n\nLet's take an example:\n\nprefix2 = [0, 3, 6, 9, ...] (each item adds 3)\nprefix1 = [0, 2, 4, 6, ...] (each item adds 2)\n\nFor W = 4:\n\nFor x=0: y=4 → value 0 + 4 = 4.\nx=1: 2*1=2 → y=2 → value 3 + 4 = 7.\nx=2: 2*2=4 → y=0 → value 6 + 0 = 6.\nSo the maximum is at x=1.\n\nFor W=5:\n\nx=0 → y=5 → 0 + 5*2 = 10 (assuming len1 >=5).\nx=1 → 2*1=2 → y=3 → 3 + 3*2 = 9.\nx=2 → 4 → y=1 → 6 + 2 = 8.\nx=2 is better than x=1, but worse than x=0. So the function increases up to x=0 and then decreases. But this is not a unimodal function. Wait, but in this case, the maximum is at x=0.\n\nAnother example: W=3.\n\nx=0: y=3 → 0 + 6 = 6.\nx=1: 2*1=2 → y=1 → 3 + 2 = 5.\nx=0 is better.\n\nSo, the function is not necessarily unimodal. It depends on the values of the items.\n\nBut in this case, the function is decreasing as x increases.\n\nAnother example: W=2.\n\nx=0: y=2 → 0 + 4 = 4.\nx=1: 2*1=2 → y=0 → 3 + 0 = 3.\nSo the function is decreasing.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum is at x=0.\n\nBut what if there are items where taking some x gives a higher value?\n\nLet me think of another example: weight 2 items have values [5, 4], and weight 1 items have values [3, 3, 3, 3]. W=4.\n\nFor x=0: y=4 → 0 + 3*4 = 12.\nx=1: 2*1=2 → y=2 → 5 + 3*2 = 11.\nx=2: 4 → y=0 → 5+4=9.\nSo maximum at x=0.\n\nAnother example: weight 2 items [4, 4], weight 1 items [3, 3, 3]. W=4.\n\nx=0: y=4 → 3*3 = 9 (since len1 is 3, so min(4, 3) = 3 → value 9.\nx=1: 2 → y=2 → 4 + 6 = 10.\nx=2: 4 → y=0 → 8 + 0 = 8.\nSo maximum at x=1.\n\nSo here, the function increases from x=0 to x=1, then decreases.\n\nAnother example: W=5.\n\nweight 2 items [5, 4], weight 1 items [3,3,3,3].\n\nx=0: y=5 → min(5,4) =4",
