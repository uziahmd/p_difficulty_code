The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task to the next, considering the order of tasks and the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3,2,3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down.\n\nThe first task is at 3. Starting from 1, moving clockwise to 3 takes 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Then the third task is at 3 again. From 2, moving to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time it takes to get from the current position to the next task's position, considering the circular nature.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose Xenia is currently at position current_pos, and the next task is at next_pos. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the distance between current_pos and next_pos is (next_pos - current_pos) mod n. Wait, no. Because if current_pos is 3 and next_pos is 2 in a 4-house setup, then moving clockwise would require 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. The formula (next_pos - current_pos) mod n would be (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n. But since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct way to compute the steps.\n\nWait, but when you're moving clockwise, the number of steps between current and next is (next - current) if next is >= current. Otherwise, (next - current + n). Which is equivalent to (next - current) mod n, but since mod can be negative, perhaps we need to compute it as (next - current + n) % n. But in Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers in a way that might not be directly applicable. For example, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. So yes, using (next - current) % n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nSo for each consecutive task, we calculate the steps needed from the previous position to the current task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are in order. So the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So Xenia must do them in order. So the initial position is 1. Then, for each task in the list, we compute the distance from the previous position to the current task's position, add that to the total time, and update the previous position.\n\nBut what if there are multiple tasks in the same house? Like, if the tasks are [3,3,3], then the first time she moves to 3, then for the next tasks, she's already there, so no movement needed.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n    compute distance from current_pos to a_i, add to total_time\n\n    set current_pos to a_i\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating for each consecutive a_i, the distance between current and next, and summing them all.\n\nYes. So the main thing is to process the list of a_i in order, and compute the steps between consecutive positions.\n\nBut how to handle the modulo correctly?\n\nLet me think. For example, if current is 1, next is 3, n=4. Then steps are 2. Which is (3-1) = 2. If current is 3, next is 2, n=4: (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo in code, for each step, the distance is (a_i",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and moves clockwise. Each task must be completed in the order they are given, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time.\n2. **Circular Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses in a clockwise direction can be calculated using modular arithmetic. For two positions `current_pos` and `next_pos`, the distance is `(next_pos - current_pos) % n` if `next_pos` is greater than `current_pos`, otherwise it wraps around using modulo operation to account for the circular arrangement.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in the sequence, compute the distance from the current position to the task's position and accumulate the total time. Update the current position after each task.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor next_pos in a:\n    diff = (next_pos - current_pos) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current_pos = next_pos\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `current_pos` set to 1 and `total_time` initialized to 0.\n2. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task position in the list:\n   - Calculate the distance from the current position to the next task position using `(next_pos - current_pos) % n`. This ensures that the distance is correctly computed even when moving around the circular road.\n   - Add this distance to `total_time`.\n   - Update `current_pos` to the next task position.\n3. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated `total_time`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
