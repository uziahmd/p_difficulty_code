The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks have to be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. First example input is 4 3, and the a_i's are 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The explanation is that she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1.\n- First task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3. How many steps? Well, clockwise. From 1 to 2 is 1 step, 2 to 3 is another. So total 2 steps. Then she does task 1.\n- Next task is 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2 clockwise, she has to go 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. So total time now is 2+3=5.\n- Then task 3 is at 3 again. She's currently at 2. Moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total time 5+1=6. So overall 6 steps.\n\nSo the approach is to track her current position and accumulate the time needed to move from her current position to the next task's position, for each task in order.\n\nBut how do we compute the steps between two positions?\n\nSince the ringroad is a circle, moving clockwise between two points. Let's say current position is curr, next target is next. How many steps?\n\nIf curr is less than next, then the steps are next - curr. But if curr is greater than next, then it's (n - curr) + next. For example, if curr is 3 and next is 2, with n=4: 3→4 (1 step) and 4→1 (another) and 1→2 (third). So total 3 steps. Which is (4-3) + 2 = 1 +2 =3. Wait, no. Wait, n is 4. So (n - curr) + next? Let me see:\n\ncurr =3, next=2. The steps are (n - curr + next) ? 4-3 +2 = 3 steps. Which matches. So yes, the formula would be (next - curr) if next >= curr, else (next + n - curr). Alternatively, (next - curr) if positive, else (next - curr + n). Wait, because if next is less than curr, then the difference is negative. So adding n to that.\n\nSo the steps between curr and next is (next - curr) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is 3 and curr is 2, then (3-2) is 1. Which is correct. If next is 2 and curr is 3, (2-3) is -1, mod n (4) would be 3. Which is correct. So yes, the steps between curr and next is (next - curr) if positive, else (next - curr + n). Which can be written as (next - curr + n) % n. But since in Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers, maybe that's a way to compute it.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nFor curr =3, next=2, n=4. (2 -3 +4) =3 → mod 4 is 3. Correct.\n\nFor curr=2, next=3: (3-2) =1 → mod 4 is 1. Correct.\n\nSo the formula is (next - curr) % n. But wait, what if next equals curr? Then it's zero steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each task, we calculate the steps from current position to the next a_i, add that to the total, and update current position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the tasks are given as a list a_1 to a_m. And Xenia must complete all tasks in order. So for each task i (from 1 to m), she must be at a_i, and she can only do task i after completing all previous tasks.\n\nSo the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1. Each task must be completed in order, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time. The movement is strictly clockwise.\n2. **Circular Calculation**: To compute the time between two consecutive houses, we use modular arithmetic. If moving from house `curr` to house `next`, the time required is `(next - curr) % n` if `next >= curr`, otherwise `(next - curr + n) % n`. This ensures we correctly handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We iterate through each task, accumulating the total time required to move from the current position to the next task's house, updating the current position after each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    diff = (target - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with total time initialized to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time needed to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement.\n- **Update Position**: After each move, update the current position to the target house.\n- **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the time taken for each move to get the total time required to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity O(m).",
