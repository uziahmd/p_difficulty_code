    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. The instability is the max minus min of the array. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that the new max and min of the remaining array give the smallest possible difference.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to check for each element, what happens if we remove it, then compute the instability. But with n up to 1e5, that approach would be O(n^2) in the worst case, which is probably not feasible. Because for each element, finding the max and min of the rest would take O(n) time, leading to O(n^2) total time. That's going to be too slow for n=1e5.\n\nSo we need a more efficient approach. Let's think about the original array. The instability is max - min. When we remove an element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nWell, the original max and min are part of the array. If we remove an element that is not the max or min, then the max and min of the new array remain the same as the original. But if we remove the max, then the new max is the second maximum. Similarly for removing the min.\n\nWait, but maybe there are multiple elements with the same value as the original max or min. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], the original max is 7, min is 1. If we remove 7, the new max is 3. If we remove one of the 3s, then the max is still 7 and min is 1. So the instability would be 7-1=6, which is worse than removing 7. So the optimal choice here is to remove the max (7), leading to instability 3-1=2.\n\nSo the key idea here is that when we remove an element, the new max and min depend on whether the element being removed was part of the original max or min. So perhaps the optimal way is to consider two cases: when we remove the original max, or when we remove the original min. But wait, there might be multiple maxes or mins. For example, if the array has multiple max elements, removing one of them would leave others, so the max remains the same. Similarly for min.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Sort the array first. Then, for each position i, the array without the i-th element would have a max and min that can be determined based on the sorted array.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think. Suppose the array is sorted. For example, sorted array is [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]. If we remove an element at position i, then the new array's min is the min of the original array excluding a_i. But since the array is sorted, if we remove a_i, then the new min is a_0 if i is not 0. Otherwise, it's a_1. Similarly, the new max is a_{n-1} if i is not n-1, else a_{n-2}.\n\nWait, that's only if the array is sorted. So if we sort the array first, then for each element, when we remove it, the new min and max can be determined by looking at the elements before and after it.\n\nBut how does that help us? Well, the instability after removing the i-th element (in the sorted array) would be:\n\nIf we remove the first element (a_0), then the new min is a_1, and the new max is a_{n-1}. So instability is a_{n-1} - a_1.\n\nIf we remove the last element (a_{n-1}), then the new instability is a_{n-2} - a_0.\n\nIf we remove any other element (say, a_i where 0 < i < n-1), then the min is a_0 and max is a_{n-1}, so the instability is a_{n-1} - a_0. Which is the same as the original instability. Wait, but that's only if the original array's min and max are not affected by removing that element. But if the original array has multiple elements equal to the min or max, then removing one of them would not change the min or max. So in that case, the instability would be the same as original.\n\nBut in that case, the best option is to remove either the max or the min, which would reduce the instability. So the minimal instability would be the minimum between the instability when removing the first element (original min) or the last element (original max). Or maybe other possibilities?\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose the array is sorted. Then, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If we remove any element except the first or last, the instability remains the same. So the only way to get a better instability is to remove either the first element (so the new min is a[1], and the max remains a[-1], so instability is a[-1] - a[1]), or remove the last element (so instability is a[-2] - a[0]). So the minimal possible instability would be the minimum between these two options.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple elements equal to the min or max. For example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 3]. Original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the first element, the array becomes [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the last element, the array becomes [1,1,3], instability is 3-1=2. But if we remove one of the middle elements, like the third element (3), then the array is [1,1,3], instability is 3-1=2. So in this case, all options give the same instability. But in this case, the minimal is 2, which is same as original. But maybe there are cases where removing a non-first or non-last element can lead to better results?\n\nWait, no. Because if you remove an element that is not the first or last in the sorted array, then the min and max remain the same. So the instability is same as original. So the only way to reduce instability is to remove either the first or the last element. Therefore, the minimal possible instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut wait, that's assuming that the array is sorted. So the approach would be:\n\nSort the array. Then, the minimal instability is min( (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) )\n\nBut why? Because when you remove the first element (the original min), the new array's min is a[1], and max is a[-1], so instability is a[-1] - a[1]. When you remove the last element (original max), the new array's max is a[-2], and min is a[0], so instability is a[-2] - a[0]. The other options (removing elements in the middle) don't change the min or max, so the instability is same as original, which is a[-1] - a[0]. So the minimal possible instability is the minimum between the two options above.\n\nSo the answer is the minimum between those two values.\n\nWait, but what if the array has duplicates? Like the example given in the problem. Let's take the first example: input is [1,3,3,7]. Sorted array is [1,3,3,7]. So a[-1] - a[1] = 7-3=4. a[-2] - a[0] is 3-1=2. So the minimal is 2, which matches the example. And the correct answer is indeed 2. So that works.\n\nAnother example: input is [1, 100000]. Sorted array is [1, 100000]. Then, if we remove first element, the instability is 100000 - 1 (but wait, the array has only one element, so instability is 0. Oh right. Because when you remove one element, the array has n-1 elements. So in this case, n=2, removing one element leaves one element. So the instability is zero. So for this case, the two options are:\n\na[-1] - a[1] is 100000 - a[1], but when n=2, a[1] is the second element. Wait, for the sorted array [1, 100000], a[-1] is 100000, a[1] is 100000. So a[-1] - a[1] is 0. Similarly, a[-2] is 1, a[0] is 1. So a[-2] - a[0] is 0. So the min is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if n is 2? Then, when you remove one element, the array has one element, so instability is 0. Which is covered by the formula. For example, a[-1] - a[1] would be a[1] - a[1] = 0, since for n=2, a[1] is the second element. So yes.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nSort the array. Then compute min between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but for n=3?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3]. Original instability is 2. If we remove 1, the array is [2,3], instability 1. If we remove 3, array is [1,2], instability 1. If we remove 2, the array is [1,3], instability 2. So the minimal is 1. According to the formula, a[-1] - a[1] is 3 - 2 =1. a[-2] -a[0] is 2 -1 =1. So min is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 3, 5, 7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove 1, the instability is 7-3=4. If we remove 7, instability is 5-1=4. So the formula gives min(4,4)=4. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. So the code is:\n\nSort the array, then compute min between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array has multiple elements, but removing some element in the middle gives a better result? Let's think of a scenario. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. Original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 2, the array becomes [1,4,5], instability 4. If we remove 4, the array becomes [1,2,5], instability 4. But if we remove 5, the instability is 4-1=3. Which is better. So according to the formula, a[-1] - a[1] is 5 - 2 =3, and a[-2] -a[0] is 4-1=3. So the minimum is 3. Which is correct. So the formula works.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between the instability when removing the first element (original min) and when removing the last element (original max). Because for all other elements, removing them doesn't change the min or max, so the instability remains the same as original.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to sort the array and compute the minimum of those two options.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it.\n\nCompute the two possibilities:\n\noption1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\noption2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nresult is min(option1, option2)\n\nBut wait, what if n is 2? Then, a[-2] is a[0], so option2 is a[0] - a[0] =0. Similarly option1 is a[-1] - a[1] which is a[1] - a[1] =0. So min is 0, correct.\n\nYes. So the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the array after removing one element has only one element, so instability is zero. Which is handled by the code.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=3, the code would compute option1 and option2. For example, for [1,3,3,7], n=4. So the code would compute a[-1] - a[1] =7 -3=4, a[-2] -a[0] =3-1=2. So min is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the array has more than two elements, but the best option is to remove an element in the middle?\n\nWait, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If we remove 5, the instability is 4-1=3. If we remove 1, instability is 5-2=3. But what if we remove 3? Then the array is [1,2,4,5], instability 5-1=4. Which is worse. So the best is to remove 1 or 5. So the code gives min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 5, 5, 5]. Original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, instability is 5-2=3. If we remove 5 (last element), instability is 5-1=4. So the code computes option1 = a[-1] - a[1] =5-2=3, option2 = a[-2] - a[0] =5-1=4. So min is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to sort the array, and then compute those two options.\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then, after removing any element, the instability is 0. The code would compute option1 = 1 - 1 =0, option2 = 1 -1=0. So correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 1, 2, 3]. Original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove 3, the instability is 2-1=1. If we remove 1, the instability is 3-1=2. So the code would compute option1 is 3 - 1 = 2 (a[-1] - a[1] is 3-1=2?), wait the array is sorted as [1,1,2,3]. a[-1] is 3, a[1] is 1. So option1 is 3-1=2. option2 is a[-2] (which is 2) - a[0] (1) → 1. So min(2,1) is 1. Which is correct. So the code returns 1, which is the correct answer.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nThus, the Python code should be:\n\nRead n, then the array. Sort the array. Compute the two options and take the minimum.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the code can be handled by the same formula. For example, when n=2, a[-1] is the second element, a[1] is the same. So a[-1] - a[1] is 0. Same with a[-2] - a[0] is 0. So the code can handle it without checking for n=2.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but when n is 2, the code could just compute the same as the else part. Because for n=2, a[-1] is a[1], and a[1] is the same as a[1], so option1 is 0. Similarly for option2. So the code can be written without the if condition. Let me test:\n\nFor n=2, sorted array is [a, b]. Then, option1 = a[-1] - a[1] → b - a[1] → since a[1] is b, so 0. option2 is a[-2] - a[0] → a[0] - a[0] → 0. So min(0,0) is 0. So the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n\nBut wait, for n=2, a[-2] is a[0], yes. So the code would work. So even for n=2, the code works. So the code can be written without the if condition. Let me check.\n\nYes. For n=2, the code would compute min between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]). For example, for input 2 1 100000, sorted array is [1, 100000]. a[-1] - a[1] is 100000 - 100000 = 0. a[-2] - a[0] is 1 - 1 = 0. So min(0,0) is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can be simplified to:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint( min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] ) )\n\nBut wait, for n=3, the code would compute a[-1] - a[1], which is the max of the array minus the second element. For example, sorted array [1,2,3]. a[-1] - a[1] is 3-2=1. a[-2] - a[0] is 2-1=1. min is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code works for all cases. So the code can be written as such.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3 and the array is [1, 3, 5]. Then the code returns min(5-3=2, 3-1=2) → 2. Which is correct. Because removing 1 gives instability 5-3=2, removing 5 gives 3-1=2, and removing 3 gives 5-1=4. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code is simple. So the Python code would be:\n\nRead n, read list, sort, compute min between the two options.\n\nSo that's the solution. Now, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\na[-1] - a[1] is 7 - 3 =4.\n\na[-2] - a[0] is 3 - 1 = 2. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]. a[-1] -a[1] is 100000 - 100000=0. a[-2] -a[0] is 1-1=0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 2, 3]. Output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 1]. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The code returns min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum values. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values. When we remove an element from the array, the instability of the remaining elements can be minimized by considering the effect of removing either the minimum or the maximum value.\n2. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the minimum and maximum values after removing an element. Once sorted, the minimum value is at the start and the maximum value is at the end.\n3. **Key Insight**: After sorting, the optimal strategy is to consider two scenarios:\n   - Removing the first element (minimum value) and calculating the instability of the remaining elements.\n   - Removing the last element (maximum value) and calculating the instability of the remaining elements.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By sorting the array, we can compute the instability for both scenarios in constant time, leading to an overall efficient solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (number of elements) followed by the array elements.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum values.\n3. **Instability Calculation**: \n   - The first scenario considers removing the smallest element (first element in the sorted array), resulting in the instability being the difference between the new maximum (last element) and the second smallest element (second element in the sorted array).\n   - The second scenario considers removing the largest element (last element in the sorted array), resulting in the instability being the difference between the new minimum (first element) and the second largest element (second last element in the sorted array).\n4. **Result**: The minimum of these two calculated instabilities is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is $O(n \\log n)$, making it suitable for large input sizes up to $10^5$.",
