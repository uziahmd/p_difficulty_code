The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$.

The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints. We need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't go beyond 0 or x. So for each x, we need to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute f(x) for each x individually. We need a mathematical formula or pattern to calculate the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Let's consider the general case. The frog can move forward by a steps or backward by b steps. However, since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the movement is constrained.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a linear combination problem. The positions reachable without any constraints would be those that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, with the constraints of staying within [0, x], it's more complicated.\n\nWait, but maybe the key is to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Because if the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of gcd(a,b), then maybe that's the case. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me take the first example: a=5, b=3. The gcd(5,3) is 1. So the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of 1, which is all integers. But with the constraints of the interval [0,x].\n\nBut in the first example, when x=5, the frog can reach 0,5 (since from 0, it can jump +5 to 5). Also, can it reach other positions? For example, from 5, can it jump back by 3 steps to 2? But then 2 is within [0,5], so yes. Then from 2, can it jump +5 to 7, but that's beyond x=5, so that's not allowed. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the frog starts at 0. It can jump to 5. From there, it can jump back to 5-3=2. From 2, can it jump forward to 2+5=7, which is outside x=5, so no. Or jump back to 2-3 = -1, which is invalid. So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. Hence f(5)=3, which matches the example.\n\nSo the positions reachable depend on the ability to make combinations of a and b steps, but constrained by the boundaries.\n\nBut how can we model this for general cases?\n\nAnother observation: the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo d, where d is gcd(a, b). Because each jump adds or subtracts multiples of a and b. So the positions must be multiples of d.\n\nSo first, we need to check if a and b are coprime. If they are not, then the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of their gcd. However, even with that, the constraints of the interval may limit the positions further.\n\nBut how to model the reachable positions for each x?\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the possible positions. Let's assume that d = gcd(a, b). Then, the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d. Let me denote a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since gcd(a',b') = 1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to the case where a and b are coprime. Because if they aren't, we can divide them by their gcd and proceed.\n\nSo, the key is to find for a given x, how many multiples of d are reachable within [0, x], considering that the frog can move forward by a steps or backward by b steps, but can't go beyond 0 or x.\n\nBut even then, how do we find the count?\n\nLet me think of the case when a and b are coprime. Let's say d=1. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is reachable through some combination of steps, but constrained by the interval.\n\nBut how to model this? For example, in the first example, a=5 and b=3. Since they are coprime, the frog can reach any integer that is reachable via some combination of adding 5 and subtracting 3. But given that the frog starts at 0, the reachable positions are all integers that can be written as 5k - 3l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the resulting position is between 0 and x.\n\nBut how to find the count of such positions for a given x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions >= some value, but that depends on the values of a and b.\n\nWait, this feels similar to the classic coin problem. For two coprime numbers a and b, the largest number that cannot be expressed as ax + by (for x,y non-negative integers) is ab - a - b. But here, the situation is different because the frog can move both forward and backward, but the constraints of the interval are in place.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model the reachable positions once x is large enough.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and for which there exists some combination of steps that allows it to be reached, and also lies within [0, x].\n\nBut how to find the number of such positions?\n\nLet me think again about the case when a and b are coprime. Let's say a=5 and b=3. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of 1 (so any integer), but only those that can be reached through some sequence of steps. However, since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps once the frog can reach a certain range, it can reach all positions beyond that.\n\nFor example, in the first example, when x is large enough (like x >= 5 + 3 = 8?), then the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. But I'm not sure. Let's see:\n\nIf the frog can reach position k, then from k, it can jump +a to k+a (if within x) or -b to k -b (if >=0). But how does this affect the reachable positions?\n\nAlternatively, since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the reachable positions are all integers that are congruent to 0 mod d (d=gcd(a,b)), and that are >= some minimal value. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the problem in terms of BFS. For small x, we can simulate the reachable positions. However, for large x (up to 1e9), we can't do this for each x. So we need a mathematical formula.\n\nBut given that a and b are up to 1e5, perhaps we can precompute some patterns.\n\nBut first, let's think about the case when the frog can't make any jumps. That's when a=0 or b=0, but the problem states that a and b are positive integers. So that's not possible. Wait, the input constraints say that a and b are positive integers. So the third example in the sample input has a=100000, b=1. So the frog can jump +100000 or -1. But for x=100, since the frog can't jump to positions beyond 100. For example, if the frog is at 0, it can't jump +100000 because that's beyond x=100. So the frog can't make any jumps. Hence, f(x) is 1 for all x < 100000. But in the third example, the output is 101, which is sum from i=0 to 100 of f(i). Since for all i < 100000, f(i) is 1. So the sum is 101*1 = 101, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the key seems to be whether the frog can make any forward jumps. If a is larger than x, then the frog can't make any forward jumps. Similarly for backward jumps. So for the frog to be able to move, the x must be at least a, or the frog can't make forward jumps, and maybe can make backward jumps if possible.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the minimal steps required to reach positions. For example, if the frog can make forward jumps (i.e., x >= a), then it can reach a. From a, it can jump back to a - b. But if a - b is >=0, then that's allowed. Then from there, maybe more steps.\n\nBut again, this seems too vague.\n\nAlternative idea: For a given x, the maximum position the frog can reach is min(x, ...). However, the frog can reach positions up to x, but only if there's a way to get there.\n\nBut perhaps the reachable positions are all integers in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d, and also satisfy some other condition.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following steps:\n\nFirst, compute d = gcd(a, b). Then, the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of d. So for any x, the maximum possible number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1 (since 0, d, 2d, ..., kd where kd <=x). However, this is only if all those positions are reachable.\n\nBut in reality, some positions may not be reachable. For example, in the first sample, when x=5, the reachable positions are 0,2,5. Which are multiples of 1 (since d=1). So the total number of multiples is 6 (since 5//1 +1=6). But the actual count is 3. Hence, the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nSo the problem is not just about the multiples of d. It's about which of those multiples can be reached through the allowed steps.\n\nSo how to model this?\n\nLet me consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients that allow it to be reached through the allowed steps.\n\nBut since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are >= some value. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the problem when the frog can make any number of forward and backward jumps, but can't go beyond 0 or x. The frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d, and that are in the range [0, x], provided that x is sufficiently large. But for smaller x, some positions may not be reachable.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where all positions are reachable.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. Once the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a (if within x) and k -b (if >=0). So the reachable positions form a graph where each node is connected to others via these steps.\n\nBut again, for large x, we can't simulate this.\n\nAnother approach is to find the set of positions that are reachable for any x, and then find how many of them are <=x. But how?\n\nLet me think of the problem when a and b are coprime. Suppose a=5 and b=3. The frog can reach positions that are multiples of 1, i.e., any integer. But how to find which integers are reachable.\n\nIn the example, when x is 5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. When x increases, say to 8, then from 5, the frog can jump to 5-3=2 (already there), or 5+5=10 (which is beyond x=8). From 2, it can jump to 2+5=7 (allowed), or 2-3=-1 (invalid). So now, 7 is added. From 7, can jump to 7+5=12 (no), or 7-3=4. So 4 is added. From 4, jump to 4+5=9 (no), or 4-3=1. So 1 is added. From 1, jump to 1+5=6 (allowed). From 6, jump to 6-3=3. From 3, jump to 3+5=8 (allowed). So when x is 8, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 8. All positions from 0 to 8. So for x >= 8, the frog can reach all positions. Hence, for x >= 8, f(x) = x+1 (since all positions are reachable).\n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nThis seems similar to the coin problem. For two coprime numbers a and b, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of ax + by (with x and y non-negative) is ab -a -b. However, in our case, the frog can move both ways. So perhaps once the x is larger than some value, all positions are reachable.\n\nWait, but in the case of a=5, b=3, the largest number that can't be expressed as 5x + 3y (x,y non-negative) is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. So numbers greater than 7 can be expressed as such combinations. However, in our case, the frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a and subtracting b. So perhaps the positions that can be reached are those that are >= (some value) and congruent to 0 mod d.\n\nBut since the frog can move backwards, perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are >= (something), and for x >= that something, all multiples are reachable.\n\nSo, for the case when a and b are coprime, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d (which is 1) in [0, x], hence f(x) = x + 1.\n\nBut in the first example, when x=7, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. Which is all positions from 0 to 7. So for x >= 7, f(x) is x+1. But according to the sample, when x=7, f(7)=8, which is 7+1. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the threshold for x is ab -a -b + something? Or perhaps the threshold is when x >= a + b.\n\nBut for a=5, b=3, the threshold is 7. Which is ab -a -b = 7. So for x >= 7, all positions are reachable.\n\nSo perhaps the general approach is:\n\nFor the case when a and b are coprime (d=1), once x >= (a*b - a - b), then all positions from 0 to x are reachable. Hence, for x >= this value, f(x) = x+1.\n\nBut for x less than this value, we need to calculate how many positions are reachable.\n\nBut how to compute this for arbitrary x?\n\nAlternatively, for x >= (a*b -a -b), the frog can reach all positions in [0, x], so f(x) = x + 1.\n\nBut for x < (a*b -a -b), we need to compute the number of reachable positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, given that a and b are up to 1e5, perhaps we can precompute for all possible x up to a*b, and then for larger x, use the formula.\n\nBut for m up to 1e9, and a and b up to 1e5, this could be feasible. Because a*b can be up to 1e10, which is way too big for precomputing for each test case.\n\nSo this suggests that we need another approach.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider that once the frog can reach some position, it can reach positions by adding a steps (if possible) and subtracting b steps (if possible). So the reachable positions form a set that can be built incrementally.\n\nBut perhaps for x >= (a + b), the frog can reach all positions. But in the first example, a + b = 8, and x=7 is less than that. However, in that case, all positions were reachable. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is when x is large enough that the frog can reach all positions >= some value. For example, once the frog can reach a certain position, then by adding a steps, it can reach higher positions. But how to find this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the minimum number of steps needed to reach a certain position. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Since the frog can move forward and backward, once it can reach a certain position, it can reach all positions that are congruent to it modulo d, and are within the interval [0, x], provided that x is large enough.\n\nBut again, how to find this.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following. Let's say that the frog can reach position k. Then, if k + a <= x, then it can reach k +a. Also, if k -b >=0, then it can reach k -b. So the reachable positions form a connected component.\n\nBut how to find all such positions for a given x.\n\nThis seems like a BFS problem, but again, for x up to 1e9, this isn't feasible unless we find a pattern.\n\nLet me think of the following scenario. Suppose that the frog can reach a certain range of positions. For example, once the frog can reach positions from 0 up to some value, then it can reach all positions beyond that by adding a steps. But this depends on the values of a and b.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that once the frog can reach a position k, and k >= b, then it can reach k -b, and so on. But this seems like it's going back.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the minimal number of positions that need to be checked. For example, if the frog can reach all positions from some value s upwards, then for x >= s, f(x) = s + (x - s) + 1 = x + 1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding s, the minimal value such that all positions >= s can be reached. Once we know s, then for x >= s, f(x) = x + 1. For x < s, we need to compute the number of positions reachable up to x.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nIn the case of a and b being coprime, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination (with non-negative coefficients) is ab -a -b. However, in our case, since the frog can move both forward and backward, perhaps the minimal s is zero? No, that doesn't make sense. But in the example, when x=7, which is ab -a -b (5*3 -5 -3 = 7), all positions are reachable.\n\nSo perhaps for the case when a and b are coprime, once x >= ab -a -b, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Hence, for x >= ab -a -b, f(x) = x + 1. For x < ab -a -b, we have to compute the number of reachable positions.\n\nBut how to compute this for x < ab -a -b?\n\nWell, for small x, we can simulate the reachable positions using BFS. However, for multiple test cases, and given that a and b can be up to 1e5, this might not be efficient. But given that m can be up to 1e9, and a and b are up to 1e5, perhaps for each test case, we can precompute the reachable positions up to ab -a -b, and then compute the sum accordingly.\n\nBut let's think about the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b). Let's divide a and b by d, so that a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since a' and b' are coprime.\n\n   The reachable positions are all multiples of d. So for any x, the maximum possible number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1. However, not all of these may be reachable.\n\n   Let's denote the new problem as solving for a' and b', which are coprime. Then, multiply the result by d to get the original positions.\n\n   Wait, no. The reachable positions are multiples of d. So the count of reachable positions is the same as the number of reachable positions for the problem with a' and b', multiplied by 1 (since each position is scaled by d). But how?\n\n   For example, if in the a'=5, b'=3 case, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5, etc. Then scaling by d=1 gives the same. But if d was 2, then the positions would be 0, 2, 4, etc. So the count is determined by the same logic for a' and b'.\n\n   Therefore, the problem reduces to solving for a' and b', which are coprime, and then the answer for the original problem is the same as for the reduced problem, but the positions are multiples of d.\n\n   So, the overall plan is:\n\n   - Compute d = gcd(a, b)\n   - Compute a' = a / d, b' = b / d\n   - Solve the problem for a' and b', which are coprime\n   - The answer for the original problem is the same as the answer for the a' and b' case, but with each position multiplied by d.\n\n   However, the sum we need to compute is the sum over i from 0 to m of f(i), where f(i) is the number of reachable positions for the original problem. Since the reachable positions are multiples of d, for each i, the count is equal to the number of positions in the a' and b' problem that are <= i/d. Because each such position multiplied by d is <= i.\n\n   Wait, this seems promising. Let me clarify:\n\n   For the original problem, the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d. Let's say that in the a' and b' problem, the frog can reach positions x_1, x_2, ..., x_k. Then, the original positions are x_1*d, x_2*d, etc. So, for a given i, the number of positions <= i is equal to the number of positions in the a' and b' problem that are <= floor(i / d).\n\n   So, the sum for the original problem is equal to the sum over i from 0 to m of g( floor(i /d) ), where g(x) is the number of reachable positions in the a' and b' problem for x.\n\n   Therefore, the problem reduces to solving the problem for the case where a and b are coprime, and then using that to compute the sum for the original problem.\n\n   So, the steps are:\n\n   For the original problem:\n\n   1. Compute d = gcd(a, b)\n   2. Compute a' = a/d, b' = b/d\n   3. Compute the sum over i from 0 to m of g( floor(i/d) ), where g(x) is the number of reachable positions for the a' and b' problem up to x.\n\n   Now, the problem becomes solving for the case when a and b are coprime.\n\n   So let's focus on this case: a and b are coprime.\n\n   Now, the problem is to compute, for each x, the number of reachable positions (which are integers between 0 and x) using jumps of +a and -b.\n\n   As discussed earlier, for x >= (a*b -a -b), the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Hence, g(x) = x + 1.\n\n   For x < (a*b -a -b), we need to find the number of reachable positions.\n\n   Let's denote this threshold as T = a*b -a -b.\n\n   So, the plan is:\n\n   For the coprime case:\n\n   - For x >= T, g(x) = x + 1.\n\n   - For x < T, compute g(x) via BFS or some other method.\n\n   However, for large T (up to 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10), this is impossible to precompute for each x. But given that a and b are up to 1e5, T could be up to 1e10, which is way too big for any per-test-case BFS.\n\n   Therefore, we need a way to compute the sum for x < T efficiently.\n\n   Let's think of the following approach:\n\n   For each test case, we compute T = a*b -a -b. If m is less than T, then we need to compute for all x up to m, the value of g(x), and sum them. Otherwise, we split the sum into two parts:\n\n   sum_{x=0}^{T-1} g(x) + sum_{x=T}^m (x+1)\n\n   However, even computing the first part (sum_{x=0}^{T-1} g(x)) is challenging if T is large.\n\n   But wait, in the problem statement, the constraints for a and b are up to 1e5. So, a*b could be up to 1e10, which is way too big to compute for each test case. Hence, this approach is not feasible.\n\n   So, we need a better way.\n\n   Alternative Idea:\n\n   Let's consider that when a and b are coprime, the frog can reach all positions >= T + 1 (since T is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination). But how does this relate to our problem?\n\n   Wait, in the coin problem, the largest amount that cannot be formed is T. But here, the frog can move forward and backward, so perhaps any position >= T+1 can be reached. But how?\n\n   For example, in the first case where a=5, b=3, T=7. So for x >= 8, the frog can reach all positions. Hence, for x >= T+1, g(x) = x+1.\n\n   So, the threshold is T+1. Thus, for x >= T+1, g(x) = x+1.\n\n   Therefore, for the sum, we can split it into two parts:\n\n   sum_{x=0}^{min(m, T)} g(x) + sum_{x = max(T+1, 0)}^m (x+1) if m >= T+1.\n\n   But how to compute the first sum?\n\n   For small T (like T up to 1e5), we can precompute all g(x) for x up to T using BFS. But when T is large (like 1e10), this is impossible.\n\n   So, the problem is: How to compute the first sum when T is large?\n\n   However, looking at the sample input, in the second example:\n\n   Input is 1000000000 1 2019. So a=1, b=2019, which are coprime. T = 1*2019 -1 -2019 = -1. Which is negative. Hence, T is negative. So for any x >=0, since T is negative, all positions are reachable. Hence, g(x) = x+1. Therefore, the sum is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2.\n\n   Which is what the sample shows. So when T is negative, the sum is straightforward.\n\n   So, the first thing to check is whether T is negative. If T is negative, then all positions are reachable for any x >=0. Hence, the sum is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2.\n\n   So, when T is negative, the solution is easy.\n\n   Now, what if T is non-negative?\n\n   For example, when a=5, b=3, T=7. So for x >= 8, all positions are reachable. Hence, for x >= 8, g(x) = x+1.\n\n   So, in this case, the sum can be split into:\n\n   sum_{x=0}^7 g(x) + sum_{x=8}^m (x+1)\n\n   Now, the problem is to compute the first sum (for x up to T). However, if T is large (say, 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10), then we can't compute this sum directly.\n\n   So, what's the maximum possible value of T for a and b up to 1e5? It's (1e5)^2 - 1e5 - 1e5 = 1e10 - 2e5, which is about 1e10. For m up to 1e9, this is manageable if T is larger than m. Because then the sum is sum_{x=0}^m (x+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2.\n\n   Wait, but if T is larger than m, then the entire sum is sum_{x=0}^m (x+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2.\n\n   So, in that case, we don't need to compute anything else.\n\n   So the key is to check whether T is less than or equal to m. If T is negative, or T is less than or equal to m, then the entire sum is (m+1)(m+2)/2. Otherwise, we need to compute the sum up to T and then add the sum from T+1 to m.\n\n   Wait, no. Because T is the threshold where for x >= T+1, all positions are reachable. So if m >= T+1, then the sum is sum_{x=0}^T g(x) + sum_{x=T+1}^m (x+1). But if T is larger than m, then we have to compute sum_{x=0}^m g(x).\n\n   So, the steps are:\n\n   For the coprime case:\n\n   Compute T = a*b - a - b.\n\n   If T < 0:\n\n      sum is (m+1)*(m+2)//2\n\n   Else:\n\n      if m < T:\n\n          compute sum_{x=0}^m g(x)\n\n      else:\n\n          compute sum_{x=0}^T g(x) + sum_{x=T+1}^m (x+1)\n\n   Now, the challenge is to compute sum_{x=0}^k g(x) for k up to min(m, T). However, when T is large (like 1e10), and m is up to 1e9, then k is up to 1e9, which is manageable if we can compute g(x) for x up to 1e9. But how?\n\n   But for a and b up to 1e5, even for x up to 1e9, we can't do BFS for each x. So we need a way to compute the sum of g(x) for x up to k.\n\n   Another Idea:\n\n   The reachable positions for the coprime case are all positions >= some value. But for x up to T, we need to find how many positions are reachable.\n\n   However, for the coprime case, the number of reachable positions up to x is equal to the number of integers in [0, x] that are reachable by the frog.\n\n   But how to find this number for all x up to k?\n\n   Let me think of the problem as a BFS where we track all positions reachable up to x. However, since x varies, this is not straightforward.\n\n   Alternative Idea:\n\n   Let's think of the reachable positions as all positions that are reachable through some combination of steps. Since the frog can move forward and backward, but the position must be between 0 and x.\n\n   However, the key insight is that the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as (a * k - b * l), where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is between 0 and x.\n\n   But this is equivalent to the set of positions that can be written as a*k - b*l, with k and l non-negative, and the position is between 0 and x.\n\n   However, for a and b coprime, this is equivalent to all integers that are congruent to 0 mod 1 (which is all integers), and that can be expressed as such a combination. But how to find which ones are expressible.\n\n   This brings us back to the classic problem. However, in the coin problem, we have coins of denominations a and b, and want to find the number of amounts that can be formed with non-negative numbers of coins. But in our case, the frog can use any combination of adding a and subtracting b steps. So it's similar to the problem of finding numbers that can be expressed as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers.\n\n   However, this is equivalent to numbers that can be expressed as a*k + b*m, where m is any integer (positive or negative), but with the constraint that k and m are non-negative. Not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, since the frog can move forward and backward, the problem is equivalent to the set of numbers that can be expressed as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers. This is equivalent to the set of numbers that are congruent to 0 mod gcd(a, b) (which is 1) and are in the range [0, x].\n\n   But how to find the count of such numbers up to x.\n\n   Another Idea: For the coprime case, the number of reachable positions up to x is equal to the number of integers in [0, x] that are >= (some value) and can be reached via the steps. However, without knowing this value, it's hard to proceed.\n\n   Perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem. For example, for each position up to T, track whether it is reachable. Then, for each x, the count is the number of reachable positions up to x.\n\n   However, for T up to 1e10, this is not feasible. But given that in practice, when T is larger than m, which is up to 1e9, then for the problem, we can compute the reachable positions up to m using BFS.\n\n   Wait, but for a and b up to 1e5, and m up to 1e9, this might be possible if the BFS is done efficiently. However, even for m=1e9, storing a visited array of size 1e9 is impossible.\n\n   So, this approach is not feasible.\n\n   Alternative Idea:\n\n   Let's think of the problem as follows. The frog can reach any position that is reachable via the following rules:\n\n   - Starting from 0, you can add a or subtract b, but never go below 0 or above x.\n\n   However, for the purpose of finding all reachable positions up to T, which could be up to 1e10, this seems unmanageable.\n\n   But perhaps there's another way. Let's think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (but d=1 here), and can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers. But how to count the number of such positions up to x.\n\n   This is equivalent to the number of integers in [0, x] that can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers.\n\n   But this is equivalent to the number of integers in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod 1 (all integers) and can be expressed as such a combination.\n\n   But again, this brings us back to the same problem.\n\n   Another Idea: Since a and b are coprime, for any integer n, there exist integers k and l such that n = a*k - b*l. However, the problem is that k and l must be non-negative. So for each n, we need to find if there are non-negative integers k and l such that a*k - b*l = n.\n\n   But this seems like a Diophantine equation. For example, rearranged: a*k = n + b*l. Since a and b are coprime, for each n, there are solutions in integers k and l. However, the question is whether there exist non-negative integers k and l.\n\n   For example, for n = 1, a=5, b=3: 5k - 3l = 1. Possible solutions: k=2, l=3 (5*2 -3*3=10-9=1). So yes. Hence, n=1 is reachable.\n\n   But how to find the count of such n up to x.\n\n   This seems like a problem that requires generating all such n up to x. But how?\n\n   Perhaps we can model this as a BFS where we track all positions that can be reached by adding a or subtracting b, but ensuring that we don't go below 0 or above x.\n\n   However, for large x, this is not feasible unless",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given constraints on its jumps and then compute the sum of these values for all positions from 0 to a given integer `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`. The key insight is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.\n\n2. **Reduction to Coprime Case**: By dividing both `a` and `b` by their gcd, we reduce the problem to the case where `a` and `b` are coprime. This simplifies the problem significantly as it allows us to use known results from number theory.\n\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: For coprime `a` and `b`, there exists a threshold value `T = a*b - a - b` beyond which all positions can be reached. This threshold helps in splitting the problem into two parts: positions below `T` and those above or equal to `T`.\n\n4. **Efficient Summation**: Using the threshold value, we compute the sum of reachable positions up to `T` using BFS if necessary, and handle the larger range separately using arithmetic progression formulas.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    # Compute d = gcd(a, b)\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a_prime = a // d\n    b_prime = b // d\n\n    # Now solve for a_prime and b_prime which are coprime\n    def solve_coprime(m, a, b):\n        T = a * b - a - b\n        if T < 0:\n            # All positions are reachable\n            return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\n        else:\n            # Compute the sum up to min(m, T)\n            k = min(m, T)\n            # Compute sum from x=0 to x=k of g(x)\n            # We need to find all reachable positions up to k\n            # Use BFS to find all reachable positions up to k\n            visited = set()\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(0)\n            visited.add(0)\n            while queue:\n                current = queue.popleft()\n                # Try adding a\n                next_pos = current + a\n                if next_pos <= k and next_pos not in visited:\n                    visited.add(next_pos)\n                    queue.append(next_pos)\n                # Try subtracting b\n                next_pos = current - b\n                if next_pos >= 0 and next_pos not in visited:\n                    visited.add(next_pos)\n                    queue.append(next_pos)\n            # Count how many positions are reachable up to x\n            # For each x from 0 to k, count the number of elements in visited <= x\n            # But since we need sum_{x=0}^k g(x), where g(x) is the count of positions <=x\n            # We can precompute the sorted list of reachable positions and use prefix sums\n            reachable = sorted(visited)\n            n_reachable = len(reachable)\n            # Precompute prefix sums for the number of elements <= x\n            # For each x, the count is the number of elements in reachable <= x\n            # So we can build a list of prefix counts\n            # Now compute sum_{x=0}^k (number of elements in reachable <=x)\n            # To do this efficiently, sort reachable and for each x, find the upper bound\n            # We can use binary search for each x\n            total_sum = 0\n            for x in range(k + 1):\n                # find how many elements in reachable are <=x\n                cnt = 0\n                left, right = 0, n_reachable\n                while left < right:\n                    mid = (left + right) // 2\n                    if reachable[mid] <= x:\n                        left = mid + 1\n                    else:\n                        right = mid\n                cnt = left\n                total_sum += cnt\n            # Now handle the part from T+1 to m\n            if m > T:\n                # sum from x = T+1 to m of (x + 1)\n                start = T + 1\n                end = m\n                n_terms = end - start + 1\n                sum_part = (start + end) * n_terms // 2\n                total_sum += sum_part\n            return total_sum\n\n    result = solve_coprime(m, a_prime, b_prime)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reduction to Coprime Case**: The problem is simplified by dividing `a` and `b` by their gcd, reducing them to coprime values.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold `T` is calculated using the formula `a*b - a - b`.
