From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints, and we need to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. The frog starts at 0. It can jump forward by a or backward by b. But it can't go beyond 0 or x. So for each x, we need to find all positions reachable under these constraints.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, we can't simulate this for each x. We need a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Without any restrictions (i.e., if x is very large), the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo the GCD of a and b. Wait, but since the frog can only move forward by a or backward by b, maybe the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as some combination of a and -b steps. \n\nWait, the frog can make any number of jumps. Let's think of the problem in terms of linear combinations. The positions reachable are those that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But also, the frog can't go below 0 or above x. However, when considering the entire set of positions reachable (without considering x), the positions must be such that they are in the form of (some multiple of a minus some multiple of b). But since the frog starts at 0, the positions reachable are those that are multiples of d, where d is the GCD of a and b. Because the GCD of a and b divides any linear combination of them. So, the positions reachable without considering the boundaries would be all numbers of the form t*d, where t is an integer. But the frog can only reach those positions that are achievable through some sequence of jumps.\n\nWait, but the frog can only jump forward by a or backward by b. So, for example, if the frog jumps forward once, it's at a. Then, if it jumps backward once, it's at a - b. But this depends on whether that position is allowed. However, the problem says that the frog can't step outside [0, x] during any of its jumps. So, when calculating f(x), the frog can't make any jumps that take it outside [0, x], even if the final position is within [0, x].\n\nThis complicates things because the path taken to reach a position must not have any steps outside [0, x]. However, the problem says that the frog can reach a position if there exists some way to get there without stepping outside [0, x]. So, for example, even if the frog could reach a position via a path that goes outside [0, x], but there's another path that stays within, then it counts.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this with some mathematical conditions. Let's think about the reachable positions when x is large enough. For example, when x is larger than some value, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (d = gcd(a, b)) and are >= 0. But maybe not. Because even though the frog can reach some positions, the way to reach them may require going beyond x. But if x is big enough, then those positions are allowed.\n\nSo first, let's consider the case when x is large enough that the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are non-negative. But how?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the frog's movement. The frog can move forward by a, or backward by b. But since the frog can't go below 0, the backward jumps are only allowed if the current position is at least b. Also, the forward jumps can be made as long as the new position doesn't exceed x.\n\nBut for the purposes of f(x), which is the count of reachable positions, perhaps we can find the set of positions that are reachable under the constraint that all intermediate steps are within [0, x]. However, for large x, this becomes equivalent to the positions that can be reached by the frog without any restrictions (except that they are non-negative and reachable through some sequence of jumps).\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the problem in terms of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Let d = gcd(a, b). Then, any reachable position must be a multiple of d. Because each jump adds a (which is a multiple of d) or subtracts b (also a multiple of d). So the positions are multiples of d.\n\nSo, for each x, the maximum number of positions the frog can reach is floor(x / d) + 1 (if all multiples of d from 0 up to x are reachable). However, this might not be the case. For example, in the first sample input, a=5, b=3. Then d = gcd(5,3)=1. So all positions are reachable. But according to the sample, f(5) is 3. Wait, why? Let me check the sample explanation again.\n\nIn the first example, when x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and 5-3=2. Wait, how? Let's see:\n\nThe frog starts at 0. It can jump +a (5) to 5. From 5, it can jump -b (3) to 2. From 2, can it jump +a (to 7, which is beyond x=5, so not allowed). Or jump -b (to -1, which is invalid). So the positions reachable are 0, 5, 2. That's three positions, hence f(5)=3. But according to the earlier idea, since d=1, all positions from 0 to 5 should be reachable. But clearly, that's not the case. So my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nHmm, that suggests that even though the positions are multiples of d, the frog can't reach all of them. So there must be more constraints.\n\nSo the problem is not just about being a multiple of d. There's another condition here. Let's think again.\n\nThe frog can make jumps forward by a and backward by b. Let's think of the problem as a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent the possible jumps. The frog can reach any node that is reachable from 0 via these edges, but during the traversal, all nodes must be between 0 and x.\n\nBut for large x, the frog can reach positions that are in the form of (some linear combination of a and b) as long as they are non-negative. However, the problem is that the frog can't reach certain positions unless it can reach them through a sequence of jumps that don't go negative.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find for each position k, whether there exists a way to reach it by adding a's and subtracting b's such that the intermediate steps are always non-negative.\n\nThis seems similar to the classic coin problem, but with the twist that you can only add a or subtract b. Let me think: for example, if the frog can reach position k, then there exists some integers s and t such that k = s*a - t*b, and during the process of building this, the frog never steps into negative numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions reachable are those that are multiples of d, and can be expressed as k = a * s - b * t, where s and t are non-negative integers, and such that during the process of adding a's and subtracting b's, the frog never goes negative. But how do we model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding for each position k, whether there exists some non-negative integers s and t such that k = s*a - t*b, and also that during the process of moving from 0 to k, the frog never went below zero. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (since d is the GCD of a and b) and is greater than or equal to some minimum value. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the sample input again: a=5, b=3. d=1. So all positions are possible. However, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. How about 5-3*2= -1? No, that's invalid. So how can the frog reach positions like 2?\n\nAnother way: starting from 0, the frog can jump +a to 5. From 5, it can jump -b (3) to 2. From 2, it can't jump further (since jumping +a would take it to 7, which is beyond x=5. Jumping -b would take it to -1, which is invalid. So 2 is reachable. What about 2 + a = 7, but that's beyond x=5. So no. How about other positions?\n\nWhat about 5 - 3*2 = -1 (invalid). So no. What about 5 - 3 = 2, then 2 + 5 = 7 (invalid). So no. How about 0 + 5*2 = 10 (but that's beyond x=5). So no. So the only positions reachable are 0, 5, 2. So for x=5, f(5)=3. \n\nBut if x is larger, say x=7, then from 2, the frog can jump +a to 7. So now 7 is reachable. From 7, can it jump -b (3) to 4. So 4 is reachable. From 4, can it jump -b to 1 (since 4-3=1). From 1, can't jump -b (would be -2). Can't jump +a (1+5=6). So 6 is reachable? Let's see: from 0, can we reach 6?\n\nYes: 0 +5 (5) → 5 +5 (10, but if x is 7, then that's invalid. So that path is not allowed. Alternatively, 0 → 5 → 2 → 7 (since x is 7). Then from 7, jump -3 to 4. Then from 4, jump -3 to 1. So 1 is reachable. How about 6? Maybe another path. Let's think: 0 → 5 → 2 → 7 → 4 → 1 → ... but how to reach 6?\n\nAlternatively, can the frog reach 6? Suppose x is 7. Let's see:\n\nIs there a way to reach 6 without stepping outside [0,7]? Let's think of the equation 6 = 5*s -3*t. Let's find integers s and t ≥0 such that 5s -3t =6. For example:\n\ns=3, t=3: 15-9=6. So yes. But how to reach that? Let's think of the path: start at 0, add a three times to reach 15, but that's way beyond x=7. So that's not allowed. So how can we reach 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different path. Let's think of the steps. For example:\n\nFrom 0, jump to 5 (s=1). Then jump to 5-3=2 (t=1). Then jump to 2+5=7 (s=2). Then from 7, jump to 7-3=4 (t=2). From 4, jump to 4+5=9 (invalid). Or from 4, jump to 4-3=1 (t=3). From 1, can't do anything. So no way to reach 6. \n\nSo even though there exists a solution to 5s -3t =6 (s=3, t=3), the frog can't reach 6 when x is 7 because the path requires going to positions beyond x. So the problem isn't just about the existence of such s and t, but also about the possibility of reaching the position through a path that doesn't exceed x.\n\nThis seems really complex. How can we model this for general x?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (the GCD of a and b), and that is ≥ (some value), but how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can perform any number of forward jumps (adding a) and backward jumps (subtracting b), but during the process, all positions must be in [0, x]. \n\nLet me think about the minimal steps required to reach a position. For example, if we want to reach a position k, then k must be reachable via some sequence of jumps. But since the frog can only jump forward or backward, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nFor a given k, there exists some s and t such that k = s*a - t*b, and during the sequence of jumps, the frog never goes below zero or above x. However, this seems too vague.\n\nAnother thought: Let's consider the problem without the x constraint. What positions can the frog reach? Well, since the frog can jump forward and backward, but it can't go below zero. So the positions reachable are those that can be written as k = a*s - b*t, where s and t are non-negative integers, and k ≥ 0. \n\nBut how to find all such k? \n\nThis seems like a variation of the classic problem of finding numbers that can be expressed as linear combinations of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, in this case, it's a bit different because we have one positive term and one negative term. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as k = a*s + (-b)*t, where s and t are non-negative integers. So the problem reduces to finding all non-negative integers k that can be written in that form. \n\nBut how can we find the set of such k? For example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3. So the possible k's are 0 (s=0, t=0), 5 (s=1, t=0), 5-3=2 (s=1, t=1), 5*2 -3*1=7, 5*2 -3*2=4, 5*2 -3*3= -1 (invalid), etc. So the valid ones are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, etc. \n\nSo for the general case, the positions reachable are those numbers that are non-negative and can be written as s*a - t*b, with s and t non-negative integers. \n\nBut how do we find for a given x, how many of these numbers are ≤x?\n\nOnce we can find that, then f(x) is that count, and we need to sum over x from 0 to m.\n\nBut how to compute that count efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the problem again. Let's suppose that d = gcd(a, b). Let me divide everything by d. Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since a and b are multiples of d, their GCD is d, so a' and b' are coprime. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the numbers k that are multiples of d, and for which k/d can be written as s*a' - t*b', with s, t ≥0. \n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, perhaps there's a way to model this.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the equation k = s*a' - t*b'. Since a' and b' are coprime, the set of possible k's is all integers that are ≥ (some value). For example, the classic coin problem says that for two coprime coins of denominations a and b, the largest amount that cannot be formed is ab -a -b. But this is for the case where you can use any number of coins, and the coins are added. However, in our case, it's a mix of adding and subtracting. \n\nBut maybe we can find for the equation s*a' - t*b' = k, where s and t are non-negative integers, what values of k are possible.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation: s*a' = k + t*b'. So for a fixed k, we need to find non-negative integers t and s such that this holds. Which implies that k + t*b' must be divisible by a', and s = (k + t*b')/a' ≥0. \n\nAlternatively, since a' and b' are coprime, for each k, there exists integers t and s such that k = s*a' - t*b'. But we need s and t to be non-negative. \n\nBut how to find for a given k, whether such s and t exist. \n\nLet me think of it as follows: For a given k, we can write the equation as s*a' - t*b' = k. Which can be rewritten as s*a' = k + t*b'. Since a' and b' are coprime, for each t, there exists some s such that this holds, but we need s to be non-negative. \n\nBut perhaps this approach is not helpful. Let's think of the problem differently. Since a' and b' are coprime, we can find for any integer k, integers x and y such that x*a' - y*b' = k. However, x and y may not be non-negative. \n\nBut we need x and y to be non-negative. So the question is: for a given k, does there exist x and y ≥0 such that x*a' - y*b' =k?\n\nThis seems like a Diophantine equation with constraints. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as x*a' = k + y*b'. Since a' and b' are coprime, for each fixed y, there's a unique solution mod a' for x. However, we need x to be non-negative. \n\nLet me fix y. Then k + y*b' must be non-negative and divisible by a'. Let me denote that value as m = k + y*b'. So m must be divisible by a', and m must be ≥0. Then x = m / a' must be ≥0. \n\nBut how can we find such y? \n\nAlternatively, for a given k, we can think of y as varying over integers such that k + y*b' ≥0 and divisible by a'. \n\nBut this seems complicated. However, since a' and b' are coprime, for each residue r mod a', there exists a y such that y*b' ≡ -k mod a'. \n\nLet me explain. For each k, we can find the minimal y such that y*b' ≡ -k mod a'. Since b' and a' are coprime, there exists an inverse of b' mod a'. Let me denote the inverse as inv_b. Then y ≡ (-k) * inv_b mod a'. So the minimal non-negative solution for y is y0 = ((-k) * inv_b) mod a'. \n\nOnce we find this y0, then we can compute m = k + y0*b'. If m is non-negative, then x = m/a' is non-negative. \n\nBut since y can be increased by multiples of a', then for any y = y0 + t*a', where t is a non-negative integer, we can have m = k + (y0 + t*a')*b' = (k + y0*b') + t*a'*b'. Since a' and b' are coprime, this gives us m = m0 + t*a'*b', where m0 is the value when t=0. \n\nNow, if m0 is non-negative, then x = m0 / a' is non-negative. So, for such y, x is non-negative. \n\nBut what if m0 is negative? Then, even increasing t may not help. Because adding t*a'*b' increases m by t*a'*b', which is positive. So if m0 is negative, then for some t, m becomes positive. \n\nBut how do we find the minimal t such that m0 + t*a'*b' ≥0?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that for a given k, we find the minimal y0 (mod a') such that y0*b' ≡ -k mod a'. Then, m0 = k + y0*b' must be divisible by a', and m0 = a' * x. \n\nBut since m0 = k + y0*b', and y0 is chosen such that y0*b' ≡ -k mod a', then m0 is a multiple of a'. \n\nSo, m0 = a'*x. \n\nBut since y0 is chosen as the minimal non-negative solution, then y0 can be in the range [0, a'-1]. \n\nSo, m0 = k + y0*b'. \n\nIf m0 is non-negative, then x is non-negative, and thus we have a solution. \n\nIf m0 is negative, then we can add t*a'*b' to m0, which will increase it. So m = m0 + t*a'*b' = a'*(x + t*b'). \n\nWe need m ≥0. So, solving for t: \n\nm0 + t*a'*b' ≥ 0 \n\nt ≥ ceil( (-m0) / (a'*b') )\n\nSince a'*b' is positive. \n\nSo, for such t, the corresponding y would be y = y0 + t*a'. \n\nBut then, since y must be non-negative, we need y0 + t*a' ≥0. Since y0 is non-negative and t is non-negative, this is automatically satisfied. \n\nTherefore, for a given k, there exists a solution (x,y) ≥0 if and only if there exists some t ≥0 such that m0 + t*a'*b' ≥0. \n\nBut since m0 = k + y0*b', and y0 is chosen as the minimal non-negative solution, then:\n\nIf k is such that there exists some t ≥0 for which k + y0*b' + t*a'*b' ≥0, then there exists a solution. \n\nBut since a'*b' is positive, this is always possible for sufficiently large t. However, what about for small k? \n\nWait, for example, if k is negative, then obviously no solution. But since we're looking for k ≥0, we can ignore that. \n\nSo, for a given k ≥0, we can find y0 as described, compute m0 = k + y0*b', and check if m0 is non-negative. If yes, then there's a solution. If not, then we can choose t such that m0 + t*a'*b' ≥0. \n\nBut for this to be possible, since a'*b' is positive, we can choose t such that t ≥ ceil( (-m0) / (a'*b') ). \n\nOnce that is done, then m = m0 + t*a'*b' is non-negative, and x = m / a' = (m0 + t*a'*b') / a' = x0 + t*b', where x0 = m0/a'. \n\nThus, x = x0 + t*b' ≥0, since x0 is (k + y0*b')/a', which is an integer, and t is non-negative. \n\nBut wait, m0 = a' * x0. So, m0 = a' * x0. Therefore, x0 = (k + y0*b')/a'. \n\nBut since m0 = k + y0*b' must be divisible by a', which we ensured by choosing y0 as the solution to y0*b' ≡ -k mod a'. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that for any k ≥0, there exists a solution (x,y) ≥0 if and only if there exists some t ≥0 such that m0 + t*a'*b' ≥0. Which is always true, because as t increases, m increases. However, this is only possible if there exists such a t. But since m0 + t*a'*b' approaches infinity as t increases, there must be some t for which this is true. \n\nWait, but what if m0 is negative? Then, for some t, m becomes non-negative. So, for example, if m0 is -5, and a'*b' is 10, then t=1 gives m = -5 +10=5 ≥0. \n\nSo, this suggests that for any k ≥0, there exists a solution (x,y) ≥0. But that contradicts the first sample input. \n\nWait in the first sample, when x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. But according to this reasoning, for k=4, there should be a solution. Let me check. \n\nLet me take the first sample: a=5, b=3. d=1. So a'=5, b'=3. They are coprime. \n\nTake k=4. Let's find y0 such that y0*b' ≡ -k mod a'. \n\nSo, -k = -4 mod 5. Which is 1 mod 5. \n\nWe need to find y0 such that 3*y0 ≡ 1 mod 5. The inverse of 3 mod 5 is 2 (since 3*2=6≡1 mod5). So y0 = (-4)*2 mod 5. \n\n-4 mod5 is 1. 1 * 2 mod5 is 2. So y0=2. \n\nThen m0 = k + y0*b' =4 + 2*3=4+6=10. Which is divisible by a'=5. So x=10/5=2. So x=2, y=2. \n\nWhich means 2*5 - 2*3 = 10-6=4. So yes, 4 is reachable. \n\nBut according to the first sample, for x=5, the frog can't reach 4. Why? Because the path to reach 4 would require steps that go beyond x=5. \n\nAh! So the previous reasoning assumes that the frog can reach the position, but doesn't account for the fact that during the jumps, the frog may have to go beyond x. \n\nSo the problem is that the existence of a solution (x,y) ≥0 is necessary but not sufficient. Because the actual path to reach k may involve intermediate steps that go beyond x. \n\nThus, the previous analysis only tells us whether the frog can reach k in the absence of the x constraint. But when x is limited, even if k is reachable in theory, it may not be reachable if the path requires steps outside [0, x].\n\nThis seems very complex. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: For the frog to reach position k, there must be some way to reach it without ever leaving [0, x]. This is equivalent to saying that there exists a sequence of jumps from 0 to k, where each step is either +a or -b, and all intermediate positions are between 0 and x.\n\nBut how can we model this for all x?\n\nPerhaps we can think of it as follows: the frog can reach any position that is reachable in the unconstrained case (i.e., can be expressed as s*a - t*b for non-negative s, t) and is ≤x. But also, the position must be reachable via a path that doesn't go beyond x. However, how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are reachable in the unconstrained case. For example, when x is larger than some threshold. Once x is larger than that threshold, then all positions that are reachable in the unconstrained case and ≤x are indeed reachable.\n\nBut what is that threshold?\n\nLet me think of the example where a=5, b=3. For k=4, which is reachable in the unconstrained case. How can the frog reach it without stepping beyond x=4?\n\nLet's see: the frog starts at 0. It can jump forward by a=5, which would take it to 5, but that's beyond x=4. So that's not allowed. So the frog can't take that jump. Alternatively, can it reach 4 via other steps?\n\nWhat about starting at 0 and making a series of backward jumps? No, because it's at 0 and can't subtract b=3. So no. Thus, for x=4, the frog can't reach 4. But according to the unconstrained case, it's reachable. Hence, the threshold for x needs to be high enough that the frog can reach the position via a path that doesn't exceed x.\n\nSo, for a given k, what is the minimal x such that the frog can reach it? Once x is at least that minimal value, then it's included in f(x). \n\nBut how to find this minimal x for each k?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach k if and only if there exists a sequence of jumps that starts at 0 and ends at k, with all intermediate positions between 0 and x. \n\nBut for a given k, the minimal x needed to reach it is the maximum position encountered along the path. \n\nBut how to find this minimal x for each k?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.\n\nLet me think of the example where k is reachable via the equation s*a - t*b =k. For example, k=4, which can be achieved with s=2 and t=2 (2*5 - 2*3=10-6=4). The path would be:\n\nStart at 0 → add a (5) → 5 → subtract b (3) → 2 → add a (5) → 7 → subtract b (3) → 4. \n\nBut this path requires x ≥7 to be allowed. So for x=7, this path is allowed. Hence, for x≥7, the frog can reach 4. \n\nBut for x=4, this path is not allowed. However, is there another path that reaches 4 with x=4? Let's see. \n\nAnother possible path: 0 → add a (5) is not allowed. So no. Or 0 → subtract b is not allowed. So no. Hence, for x=4, the frog cannot reach 4. \n\nThus, the minimal x needed for k=4 is 7. \n\nSo, for each k that is reachable in the unconstrained case, there's a minimal x_min(k) such that when x ≥ x_min(k), the frog can reach k. \n\nBut how to find x_min(k)? \n\nLet me think about the path that achieves k. The path involves adding a's and subtracting b's. To minimize the maximum position along the path, perhaps we can find a path that doesn't go too high. \n\nFor example, in the case of k=4, the path that goes 0→5→2→7→4 has a maximum of 7. Is there a shorter path with lower max?\n\nLet's see. Another possible way: 0 → add a (5) is not allowed for x=4. So no. What about subtracting b? Not allowed. So no. So no alternative path. Hence, x_min(k) for k=4 is 7.\n\nBut how to find this x_min(k) for general k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x required to reach k is the maximum of the positions visited during the path. To find this, we need to find a path that minimizes this maximum. \n\nThis sounds like a problem of finding the minimal maximum position required to reach k, given that the frog can only jump forward or backward. \n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, but for large k, that's impractical. \n\nAnother observation: For the frog to reach k, it must be able to reach it via some sequence of jumps that doesn't require going beyond x. Let's assume that x is large enough. Then, the frog can reach k. But for smaller x, it may not be possible. \n\nBut how to determine for a given x, how many of the unconstrained reachable positions are ≤x and can be reached via some path that doesn't exceed x?\n\nThis seems difficult. Perhaps there's a way to find for each x, the number of positions that are reachable in the unconstrained case and are ≤x, and also satisfy some condition based on their relation to a and b. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach all positions that are reachable in the unconstrained case and are ≥ (some value), and also ≤x. \n\nBut what is that value? \n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime. For example, a=5, b=3. \n\nWe know that the frog can reach any k that is a multiple of d (which is 1) and can be written as s*a - t*b for non-negative s and t. For such k, the minimal x needed to reach it is the maximum of the positions in the path used to reach it. \n\nBut how to find this for all k?\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the sample: perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are ≥ (a - b) and are multiples of d. But this seems incorrect. For example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3. The position 2 is reachable, which is less than (a -b) = 2. So it's equal to it. \n\nAnother idea: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is ≥ (some value). Let's call this value the \"threshold\". Once x is >= threshold, then all such positions up to x are reachable. \n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is ≥ (some value), and for x ≥ that value, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1 minus the number of positions below the threshold that are not reachable. \n\nBut how to find the threshold?\n\nLet me think about the case where a and b are coprime. For example, a=5, b=3. \n\nThe unconstrained reachable positions are all integers that can be expressed as 5s -3t for s,t ≥0. \n\nWhat is the minimal value of k such that all k ≥k_min are reachable? In the classic coin problem, the largest non-representable number is ab -a -b, but that's for sums. In our case, it's different.\n\nBut perhaps there's a similar concept. For example, for the equation 5s -3t =k, with s,t ≥0. \n\nLet me think of the values of k that can be achieved. \n\nFor s=0: k = -3t. But since k must be ≥0, this is only possible for t=0 → k=0.\n\nFor s=1: 5 -3t ≥0 → t ≤ 1. So k=5, 2.\n\nFor s=2: 10 -3t ≥0 → t ≤3. So k=10,7,4,1.\n\nFor s=3: 15-3t ≥0 → t ≤5. So k=15,12,9,6,3,0.\n\nFor s=4: 20-3t → t ≤6 (since 3*6=18 ≤20). So k=20,17,14,11,8,5,2.\n\nFor s=5: 25-3t → t up to 8 (3*8=24). So k=25, 22, 19, 16, 13, 10, 7, 4, 1.\n\nObserving these, it seems that after a certain point, all numbers are covered. For example, looking at the numbers generated:\n\nLooking at the numbers for s=1, 2, 3, etc.:\n\nThe numbers include 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, etc. \n\nBut what about 1? For s=3, t=5 → 15-15=0. Or s=4, t=6 → 20-18=2. Hmm, but earlier for s=3 and t=5, it's 15-15=0. How to get 1?\n\nAh, for s=2 and t=3: 10-9=1. Yes. So 1 is achievable. \n\nSo, for k=1, it's achievable. For k=3, it's achievable with s=3, t=3 (15-9=6?), no. Wait, earlier for s=3, t=5: 15-15=0. For s=3, t=4: 15-12=3. Yes. So 3 is achievable. \n\nSo what about numbers like 6? Yes, s=3, t=3: 15-9=6. \n\nSo, what is the minimal k for which all larger numbers are achievable? It seems that once k reaches a certain value, all larger numbers are achievable. \n\nIn the case of a=5 and b=3, let's see: \n\nAfter k=5, we have 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. For example, 6 is achievable, 7 is achievable, 8 is achievable (s=4, t=4: 20-12=8), 9 is achievable, etc. \n\nBut what about k=1? It is achievable. So perhaps for a and b coprime, all numbers",
