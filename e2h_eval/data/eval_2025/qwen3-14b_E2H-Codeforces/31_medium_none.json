Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to balance that with adding some cards whose values are between -x and x. \n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let me think: the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards that sum up to -S, where each card's value is between -x and x. \n\nBut how do I find the minimal number of cards required to reach a certain target sum? Let's think about the target sum being T = -S. Let me consider the absolute value of T. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the sum. So, the minimal number of cards would be the ceiling of |T| divided by x. Wait, but maybe there's a catch here. Let me think.\n\nFor example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to 2. So 5 / 2 is 2.5, which means we need 3 cards. Because 2+2+1=5. But since each card can be any value between -x and x, but we want to maximize the contribution per card. So for the minimal number of cards, each card should contribute as much as possible. So, the minimal number is ceil(|T| / x). But wait, what if T is exactly divisible by x? Then it's |T|/x. Otherwise, it's (|T|//x) + 1. So yeah, that's the formula.\n\nBut wait, let's take the first example. The input is 3 2, with numbers -1, 1, 2. The sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. Divided by x=2 gives exactly 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 2 3, numbers -2, -2. Sum is -4. So T is 4. x is 3. So 4/3 is 1.333..., so we need 2 cards. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards. Let's call it current_sum.\n2. The target sum needed from the new cards is T = -current_sum.\n3. The minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| divided by x. But how to compute that?\n\nWait, but how to compute ceiling in Python. For example, for |T| divided by x, if there's a remainder, we add 1. So for |T| = 5, x=2, 5//2 is 2, remainder 1. So 2+1=3. So the formula is (abs(T) + x - 1) // x. That's a common way to compute ceiling without using floating points.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\nCalculate current_sum. Then T = -current_sum. Then compute the minimal number of cards as (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero. Because no cards are needed. So that's a special case. But in that case, the code would compute (0 + x -1 ) // x. Which would be (x-1)//x, which is zero. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x. Read the list of numbers. Compute current_sum. Then T is -current_sum. Then compute (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x. But wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero. So that's covered.\n\nBut let me test with some examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3, x=2, numbers -1,1,2. sum is 2. T is -2. abs(T)=2. (2 +2-1)/2 = (3)/2 = 1.5 floored to 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 4, x=3. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x=3. (3 +3-1)/3 = 5/3=1.666 floored to 1. Which is correct. Because 3 can be achieved with one card of 3.\n\nAnother case: sum is 0. Then answer is 0.\n\nSo yes, this formula works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All found cards sum to zero. Then answer is zero.\n\nEdge case 2: sum is 1, x=1. Then (1 +1-1)/1 = 1/1=1. Correct. One card of 1.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x=2. Then (1 +2-1)/2 = 2/2=1. Correct. One card of 1.\n\nAnother case: sum is 2, x=1. Then (2 +1-1)/1 = 2/1=2. Which is correct. Two cards of 1 each.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and x from input. Then read the list of numbers. Compute their sum. Then compute T = -sum. Then compute (abs(T) + x -1) // x. Output that.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the numbers on the cards can be any integer between -x and x. So for example, if T is 5 and x is 3. Then 5 can be achieved with two cards: 3 and 2. So the minimal number is 2. Which is (5 +3-1)/3 = 7//3=2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now let's code it.\n\nNow, for the input, the first line is two integers n and x. The second line is n integers. So in Python, read the first line as input().split(), then split into n and x. Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(nums)\nt = -current_sum\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    res = (abs(t) + x -1) // x\n    print(res)\n\nWait, but why the 'if t ==0'? Because when t is zero, the code (abs(t) + x -1 )//x would be (0 + x-1)//x. Which is (x-1)//x, which is 0. So the code can just compute it without checking. So the code can be simplified as:\n\nprint( (abs(t) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nBut let me check for t=0. For example, if t is zero, then (0 + x-1 )//x = (x-1)//x. Which is 0 for x >=1. So yes. So the code can be written without the if condition.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(nums)\nt = -current_sum\nprint( (abs(t) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2 → t is -2. So abs(t) is 2. (2 + 2-1 )//2 → (3)//2 = 1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4 → t is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case where sum is zero. Let's say input is 1 5, and the number is 0. Then sum is 0. t is 0. (0 +5-1)/5 → 4//5=0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x=3 → (3 +3-1)/3 =5//3=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 4, x=3 → (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2. Correct.\n\nSo this code works.\n\nSo the code is as simple as that. Let me check for possible errors.\n\nWait, what if x is zero? No, the constraints say x is at least 1. Because in the input description, x is given as 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. So no division by zero.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as written above.\n",

Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum required from the new cards to balance the total sum to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Compute Minimum Cards Needed**: Using the target sum, calculate the minimum number of cards required. This is done by determining how many cards with the maximum absolute value (x) are needed to reach the target sum. The formula used is derived from the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum by x, which can be efficiently computed using integer arithmetic as `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(nums)\ntarget = -current_sum\nprint((abs(target) + x - 1) // x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card), followed by a list of `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more is needed to balance the total sum to zero.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target sum needed from the new cards is the negative of the current sum of the found cards.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, we compute the minimum number of cards required to achieve the target sum.
