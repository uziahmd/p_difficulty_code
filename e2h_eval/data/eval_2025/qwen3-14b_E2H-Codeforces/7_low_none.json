The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me think about the structure of such a graph.\n\nThe description says that the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) are each connected to k new vertices. And this process is repeated at least once. So the construction is like a tree where each node added in a certain step has exactly k children. But how does this translate into the total number of vertices?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the steps:\n\n- Step 0: 1 node (the root).\n- Step 1: Add k nodes connected to the root. Now total nodes: 1 + k.\n- Step 2: Each of the k nodes from step 1 adds k new nodes. So adding k * k nodes. Total becomes 1 + k + k².\n- Step 3: Each of the k² nodes from step 2 adds k new nodes. So adding k³. Total is 1 + k + k² + k³.\n- And so on, until some step m.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the process of adding new nodes (the step where each leaf adds k children) must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step is adding the first layer (k children to the root). Then, the next step is adding k children to each of those nodes. So the minimum is two steps: the initial step and then at least one more. Wait, the problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf is done at least once. So for example, the minimal snowflake for k=4 would have 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 +4 +16= 21? But the example input says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the example.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample input includes 13, which outputs YES. Let's think about possible k and steps. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the snowflake is built with steps up to m layers. The total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. But wait, the initial step is adding k nodes (so step 1), then step 2 adds k^2, etc. However, the problem says that after the initial step, the process of adding k children to each leaf must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two layers. For example, if m=2, then total nodes is 1 +k +k². Let's see for k=3, 1+3+9=13. Oh right! So for n=13, it's possible with k=3 and m=2. That's why the sample says YES.\n\nSo the general formula is that the total number of nodes is a sum of a geometric series. Let me formalize this. Let's say that the snowflake is built with m layers. The first layer (step 1) adds k nodes. Then step 2 adds k^2 nodes, etc., up to step m. The total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. But the problem says that the step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. Which implies that m must be at least 2? Because the initial step is adding k nodes (the first layer), and then the second step is adding k^2 nodes. So the minimal case is m=2, which gives S = 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but what if m=1? Then the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding k children to each leaf (which would be the first layer) must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step is adding the first layer (the k nodes connected to the root). Then the step of adding k children to each leaf (the first layer nodes) must be done at least once. So the process requires that after the initial step, we do at least one more step. So the minimal m is 2. Thus, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k². \n\nSo for a given n, we need to check if there exists integers k>1 and m≥2 such that n = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. \n\nAlternatively, the sum S can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) - 1? Wait, no. Let me think again.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as described. The key insight is that the number of vertices in such a snowflake graph follows a geometric series pattern with certain constraints on the parameters.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Structure**\n\nA snowflake graph is constructed in layers:\n- Start with one vertex.\n- Add `k` new vertices connected to the root (first layer).\n- Then, each vertex from the previous layer adds `k` new vertices (second layer), and so on.\n- This process must be repeated at least once after the initial step, i.e., there must be at least two layers of nodes.\n\nThus, the total number of vertices in a snowflake with `m+1` layers (starting from 0) is:\n\n$$\nn = \\sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1}\n$$\n\nWhere `k > 1` and `m ≥ 1`, which ensures at least two layers (since the first layer is the initial `k` nodes).\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\nWe need to check if for any `n`, there exists a value of `k > 1` and an integer `m ≥ 1` such that:\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1}\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to checking if `n` can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series starting from 1, with ratio `k > 1`, and with at least two terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Algorithm Overview**\n\nFor each test case with a given `n`, we:\n1. Try all possible values of `k` from 2 up to a reasonable upper bound (since `k^m` grows exponentially).\n2. For each `k`, compute the sum of the geometric series until the sum exceeds `n`.\n3. If at any point the sum equals `n`, return \"YES\".\n4. If none of the values of `k` produce a valid sum equal to `n`, return \"NO\".\n\nWe optimize by iterating over `k` from 2 to `cube_root(n)` since higher values of `k` will grow too quickly and not yield enough combinations to reach `n`.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Details**\n\n- We iterate over `k` from 2 to the cube root of `n`, because for larger `k`, the geometric series will grow too fast.\n- For each `k`, we simulate the geometric sum and check if it equals `n`.\n- Since `n` can be as large as $10^{18}$, we use Python's arbitrary precision integers and avoid overflow.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake_possible(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False  # Minimum number of nodes for k=2, m=1 is 1 + 2 = 3\n\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/3)) + 2  # Limiting k to avoid excessive iterations\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1\n        current = 1\n        for _ in range(100):  # Prevent infinite loop in case of overflow\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            elif total > n:\n                break\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        if is_snowflake_possible(n):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Sample Input and Output**\n\n- For `n = 13`: Possible with `k = 3`, `m = 2` → `1 + 3 + 9 = 13` → YES\n- For `n = 15`: Possible with `k = 2`, `m = 3` → `1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15` → YES\n- For `n = 6`: No valid `k > 1` and `m ≥ 1` gives 6 → NO\n- For `n = 255`: Possible with `k = 2`, `m = 7` → `1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 128 = 255` → YES\n\nThis solution efficiently checks all feasible configurations of `k` and `m` for large values of `n`, up to $10^{18}$, using a bounded search strategy.",
