Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between R spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. And since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible matchings?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The key point is that any two line segments (from a spaceship to a base) must not cross each other. So for a given perfect matching, we need to check that all pairs of line segments are non-intersecting.\n\nBut how do I check if two line segments intersect? Oh right, there's a computational geometry method for that. But since the input ensures that no three points are colinear, maybe that simplifies things. Because if three points are colinear, then two line segments could be overlapping, but the problem says that no three points are on the same line, so any two line segments can't have overlapping parts except possibly at endpoints. Wait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So for two line segments between (A,B) and (C,D), if they cross each other, then their intersection would be a single point, but that point can't be part of any three points. So maybe the problem is that two line segments cross each other in the middle, not touching any other points.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check if R equals B. Because a perfect matching requires that the number of spaceships and bases are equal. If R != B, output No immediately.\n\nWait, the first line says R and B. So for example, if R is 3 and B is 3, then possible. Otherwise, if R != B, then it's impossible. So the first check is if R != B, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nThen, for the case where R = B, we need to check all possible perfect matchings (permutations) between the spaceships and bases. For each permutation, check if all the line segments between the matched pairs don't intersect with each other.\n\nBut since R and B are up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! which is 3.6 million. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments. For each pair, check if they intersect. For 10 elements, each permutation has 10 line segments. The number of pairs is C(10, 2) = 45. So total operations would be around 3.6e6 * 45 = 1.6e8 operations. Hmm, but that's a lot, but for Python, maybe acceptable given that the constraints are small. Let me think: 1e8 operations might take time, but perhaps with optimizations, it's manageable. But maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges represent non-crossing pairs, and then check if there's a perfect matching. However, since the problem requires that all edges in the matching are non-crossing with each other, it's not just about individual edges, but the entire set. So even if two edges don't cross each other, adding a third edge might cause conflicts. Therefore, the only way is to check all possible permutations.\n\nBut for small N (like N=10), checking all permutations is feasible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Check if R != B. If yes, output No.\n- Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each spaceship is matched to exactly one base).\n- For each permutation, check if all the line segments between the spaceship and base in the permutation do not cross each other.\n- If any permutation satisfies this condition, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nNow, the key is how to check if two line segments intersect.\n\nLet me recall the line segment intersection algorithm.\n\nGiven two line segments AB and CD, how to check if they intersect.\n\nThe standard approach is to use the orientation method. First, check if the two segments straddle each other. The steps are:\n\n1. Check if the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different. Also, check if the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different. If both are true, then the segments intersect.\n\nBut also, need to handle cases where a point lies on the other segment. However, the problem states that no three points are colinear. So, if a segment AB and CD share a common point, like C is A, then since the problem says that no two points coincide, but that's allowed. Wait, the problem says that no two points coincide. So the input ensures that all points are distinct. So in the case where a line segment from A to C (if C is a base and A is a spaceship), but another line segment from C to D.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting line segments intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the bases for each spaceship and ensuring that no two line segments intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Equality of Spaceships and Bases**: If the number of spaceships (R) is not equal to the number of bases (B), it's immediately impossible to form a perfect matching, so we output \"No\".\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of the bases, check if all line segments from spaceships to their assigned bases do not intersect.\n3. **Check Line Segment Intersection**: For each permutation, check every pair of line segments to ensure they do not intersect.
