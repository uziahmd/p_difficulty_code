String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. Let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nA beautiful string s must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. Then, we can perform some modifications on s to get a character g (either 0 or 1). The modification process involves replacing the last two characters with one, according to certain rules. For example, if two zeros are replaced, the new character is 1, otherwise it's 0. And this operation can be done any number of times (including zero), as long as the string length is at least two.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the string s itself must be such that after performing some modifications, you end up with g. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that we can obtain character g from string s with some number of modifications. So the string s must be such that through these operations, you can eventually get to the character g. But how does that work?\n\nLet me think about the process of modifying the string. Each modification reduces the length of the string by 1. Because you take two characters and replace them with one. So, for example, starting with a string of length k, after one modification, it becomes k-1. So, after several modifications, you can eventually get down to a single character. But the problem says that the modifications can be done any number of times (possibly zero) as long as the string length is at least two. So, the process ends when the string has length 1, and that character is the result.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the character g equals either 0 or 1. So, the question is: for the given string s (with n 0s and m 1s), can we perform some sequence of modifications until we get a single character equal to g? And we need to count all such s that satisfy this condition.\n\nSo our task is to find the number of binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s such that, through some sequence of modifications, the final character is g.\n\nBut how do we determine whether a given string s can be reduced to g?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the process of modifying the string. Each modification replaces the last two characters with a new one. The rule is: if the two characters are both 0, replace with 1. Otherwise, replace with 0. Wait, the problem says: \"replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\n\nSo for two characters:\n\n- If they are '00', then replace with '1'.\n\n- If they are '01', '10', or '11', then replace with '0'.\n\nSo the replacement depends on the two characters being replaced. Now, the key is to model what possible final characters can be achieved from a given string.\n\nBut since the order of operations matters, but perhaps there's a way to model this recursively or find an invariant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the final character depends on the parity of the number of 0s and 1s in the original string. Or perhaps some other property.\n\nLet me think of some examples. Let's take the first sample input: n=1, m=1, g=0. The possible strings are \"01\" and \"10\". Let's see what happens when we modify them.\n\nTake \"01\". The string has length 2. We can perform one modification. The last two characters are '0' and '1' — which are not both 0. So replace them with 0. So the result is '0', which matches g=0. So this string is valid.\n\nSimilarly for \"10\", same thing. So both are valid. Hence the answer is 2.\n\nIn the third sample input: n=1, m=1, g=1. The same strings \"01\" and \"10\" would be modified to 0, so they can't reach 1. Hence the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is n=2, m=2, g=0. The output is 4. Let's see why. For example, take the string \"0011\". How can we modify it to get 0?\n\nLet's think about the steps. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string is \"0011\" (length 4).\n\nFirst modification: replace last two (11) with 0. Now the string becomes \"000\" (length 3). Then, replace last two (00) with 1. Now the string is \"01\" (length 2). Then replace them with 0. So the final result is 0. So yes, possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to get to 0 regardless of the order. But perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the number of 0s and 1s. Or maybe the parity of the total number of 0s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the number of 0s. Let me think about the process.\n\nEach modification reduces the length of the string by 1. So, starting with a string of length L = n + m, after (L - 1) modifications, we get a single character.\n\nBut how does each modification affect the count of 0s and 1s?\n\nLet me think of each operation as replacing two characters with one. Let's track how the counts change.\n\nSuppose we have two characters. Let's say they are both 0. Then replacing them with 1: the count of 0s decreases by 2, and 1 increases by 1. So net change: 0s: -2, 1s: +1.\n\nIf the two characters are not both 0, then replacing them with 0. So, for example, if they are 0 and 1: then 0s decrease by 1 (since one 0 is removed) and 1s decrease by 1. Then adding one 0. So net change: 0s: -1 +1 = 0; 1s: -1. So overall, 1s decrease by 1.\n\nSimilarly for other combinations (like 10, 11). For example, if the two are 1 and 1: replacing with 0. So 1s decrease by 2, 0s increase by 1.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting complicated. Maybe there's an invariant here. Let's think about the parity of the number of 0s. Because each operation affects the count of 0s in different ways.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a way to compute a certain value based on the initial counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that each modification is equivalent to applying some operation on the current state. However, since the order of operations can vary, perhaps the final result depends only on the initial counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nSuppose we have a string with a certain number of 0s and 1s. Let's denote the number of 0s as c0 and 1s as c1. What is the final character after all possible operations?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the string is reduced to a single character. Let's think about the parity of the number of 0s. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of some small examples.\n\nCase 1: n=1, m=1. So c0=1, c1=1. The possible strings are \"01\" and \"10\". As discussed earlier, the result is 0. So the final character is 0. Which is the same as the XOR of the counts? Not sure.\n\nWait, what's the final result in this case? It's 0. Let's think about the sum of 0s and 1s. But that's 2, which is even. Hmm.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2. The sample says that the answer is 4 when g is 0. So for those strings, the final result is 0. Let's think about what the final result depends on.\n\nAnother approach: think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 0s. Because each operation might affect the parity.\n\nLet me think of the following: each time you perform a modification, how does the count of 0s change?\n\nIf you replace two 0s with 1: the count of 0s decreases by 2 (so parity remains the same).\n\nIf you replace two 1s with 0: count of 0s increases by 1 (parity flips).\n\nIf you replace a 0 and 1 with 0: count of 0s remains same (since you remove one 0 and one 1, then add one 0. So net change is 0 for 0s, and -1 for 1s).\n\nIf you replace a 0 and 1 with 0: same as above.\n\nIf you replace a 1 and 0 with 0: same as above.\n\nIf you replace a 1 and 1 with 0: then count of 0s increases by 1 (from -2 in 1s, +1 in 0s).\n\nSo, the parity of the count of 0s can change depending on the operation. But maybe there's a way to find the final result based on the initial counts.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 0s. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of some examples.\n\nTake the case where the initial string is \"00\" (n=2, m=0). How can we modify it? The first step is to replace the two 0s with a 1. The final character is 1. So the final result is 1. Here, initial count of 0s is 2, which is even. The final result is 1.\n\nAnother example: initial string is \"000\" (n=3, m=0). Let's see:\n\nWe can perform operations. Let's say first replace the last two 0s with 1. Now the string is \"01\". Then replace them with 0. Final result is 0. So initial count of 0s was 3 (odd), final result is 0.\n\nAnother example: initial string is \"0000\" (n=4, m=0). Let's see:\n\nOption 1: Replace first two 0s with 1 → \"100\". Then replace last two 0s with 1 → \"11\". Then replace with 0. Final result is 0. Initial count of 0s is 4 (even), result is 0.\n\nAnother option: replace the last two 0s first. \"0000\" → replace last two with 1 → \"001\". Then replace last two (0 and 1) with 0 → \"00\". Then replace with 1. Final result is 1. So here, the same initial conditions (even count of 0s) can lead to different results. Wait, that's conflicting. How is that possible?\n\nWait, this suggests that the final result depends on the order of operations, which contradicts the problem's requirement that the string is considered beautiful if there exists at least one way to perform the modifications to reach g.\n\nBut the problem says that the string is beautiful if there exists some way to perform modifications to get to g. So, for the string \"0000\", which has 4 0s and 0 1s, can it reach both 0 and 1? Then, for the problem's purpose, if the desired g is 0 or 1, then the string would be counted if there's at least one path to reach g.\n\nBut this seems to complicate things. How can we determine for a given n and m whether there exists a way to reach g?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the possible final results based on the initial counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think again. The problem requires that the final character is g. So, for a given n and m, we need to find all binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s such that there exists a sequence of operations leading to g.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternative idea: the final result depends on the parity of the number of 0s and the parity of the number of 1s, or something similar.\n\nBut the previous example shows that for n=4, m=0, the string can be reduced to 0 or 1, depending on the steps. So that suggests that there are multiple possibilities. Therefore, the problem is to find whether there exists at least one way to reach g, given the initial counts.\n\nBut how can we model that?\n\nLet me think of the process as a game. Each operation reduces the string length by 1. The final character is determined by the sequence of operations. The key is to find whether it's possible to reach g given the initial counts.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's denote f(c0, c1) as the set of possible final characters that can be achieved from a string with c0 0s and c1 1s.\n\nWe need to find whether g is in f(n, m).\n\nWhat's the base case? When c0 + c1 = 1. Then the string is already a single character, so f(c0, c1) is {0} if c0 is 1, else {1}.\n\nFor other cases, we can think of the possible ways to perform the first operation. But the problem is that the first operation can be applied to any pair of characters, but since the order of operations may vary, perhaps the choice of which pair to replace first affects the outcome.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this without considering all possibilities. For example, perhaps the final result depends on the parity of (c0 - c1) or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the parity of the number of 0s. Let me look back at the previous examples.\n\nIn the first example, n=1, m=1. The final result is 0. The parity of c0 is odd (1 is odd). The result is 0.\n\nIn the case of n=2, m=0. The string can be reduced to 1 (if you do the first operation) or to 0 (if you do other steps?), but earlier example showed that for n=4, m=0, it can be reduced to 0 or 1. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: the final character depends on the parity of the total number of 0s. Let's check:\n\nFor the first example (n=1, m=1): parity of 0s is 1 (odd). Final result is 0.\n\nFor n=2, m=0: parity is even. The final result can be 1 (as per the first operation). But what if there's another way? For example, if I have \"0000\", and I perform operations in a way that leads to 0. Let me try again:\n\nTake \"0000\" (n=4, m=0). Let's perform the following steps:\n\nStep 1: replace the first two 0s with 1 → \"100\".\n\nNow, the string is \"100\". Step 2: replace the last two 0s with 1 → \"11\". Step 3: replace them with 0. Final result is 0. So, for even c0 (4), we can get 0. Also, in another way, for the same initial string, we could get 1. So this suggests that the parity of c0 is not sufficient to determine the possible outcomes.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's another way to model this. Let's think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 0s minus something. Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the XOR of the counts.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: Each operation reduces the string length by 1. The final character is determined by the entire process. Let's think about the process as a series of operations where each operation is replacing two characters with one. The key observation might be that the final result depends on the parity of the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the process of reducing the string to a single character is equivalent to computing the XOR of the counts of 0s and 1s. But I'm not sure. Let's think.\n\nLet me think about the example where the initial string is \"00\" (n=2, m=0). The final result is 1. Here, the number of 0s is 2, which is even. The result is 1. Another example: initial string is \"000\" (n=3, m=0). The result can be 0. Let me think of another example.\n\nWait, perhaps the final result is determined by the parity of the number of 0s. For example, if the number of 0s is even, the final result is 1? No, because for n=4, m=0, we can get 0.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Let me think of the following: the process of merging two characters into one is similar to evaluating a binary tree where each node represents the merge operation. The final result depends on the order of merges. However, perhaps there's a way to find the possible outcomes based on the initial counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the number of 0s modulo 2. Let's think:\n\nIn the case of \"00\" (n=2, m=0): parity is 0. Result is 1. For \"000\" (n=3, m=0): parity is 1. Result is 0. For \"0000\" (n=4, m=0): parity is 0. Result can be 0 or 1. So this suggests that the parity is not sufficient.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let me think differently.\n\nEach modification operation is a function that takes two characters and returns one. Let's think about the possible values that can be obtained based on the initial counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think about the total number of 0s and 1s. Let me think of the entire process as a way to reduce the counts until there's one character left.\n\nBut how does each operation affect the counts?\n\nLet me define the following:\n\nWhen you replace two characters with a new one, the new character depends on the two replaced characters. Let's consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: Replacing two 0s → new character is 1. So, the count of 0s decreases by 2, and count of 1s increases by 1.\n\nCase 2: Replacing two 1s → new character is 0. So, count of 1s decreases by 2, count of 0s increases by 1.\n\nCase 3: Replacing one 0 and one 1 → new character is 0. So, count of 0s decreases by 1 (because one 0 is removed) and count of 1s decreases by 1 (because one 1 is removed). Then, adding one 0 → net change for 0s: -1 + 1 = 0. For 1s: -1.\n\nSo, the count of 0s remains the same, and count of 1s decreases by 1.\n\nCase 4: Replacing one 1 and one 0 → same as case 3.\n\nSo, in any case, the operation changes the counts in a certain way.\n\nBut how can we model this to find the final character?\n\nLet me think of the following: the parity of the number of 1s. Because in some operations, the count of 1s changes by +1, -1, or -2.\n\nWait, in case 1: count of 1s increases by 1. In case 2: count of 1s decreases by 2. In case 3: count of 1s decreases by 1. So the parity of the count of 1s can change in different ways.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of (number of 0s) plus (number of 1s) is fixed. Since the total number of characters decreases by 1 each time, and starts at n + m. The final character is 1, which is 1 character. So the total length is always (initial length) - (number of operations). But I don't know if that helps.\n\nAnother thought: since each operation replaces two characters with one, the total number of characters decreases by 1. So, for the initial length L = n + m, after L-1 operations, we get to 1 character. So, regardless of the order of operations, the number of operations is fixed. But the final result depends on the sequence of operations.\n\nBut how can we find what the final result is, given the initial counts?\n\nLet me think of the following: the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 0s and 1s. For example, if there are more 0s than 1s, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a way to compute the XOR of the counts. For example, the final result is 0 if the number of 0s is even, else 1. But earlier examples contradict this.\n\nWait, in the first example, n=1, m=1. Number of 0s is 1 (odd), and the final result is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 0s minus the number of 1s. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a way to reduce the string to a single character, and that character depends on the initial counts modulo something.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's define a function f(c0, c1) that returns the possible final characters.\n\nBase case: if c0 + c1 == 1, then return 0 if c0 == 1 else 1.\n\nOtherwise, for the general case, the possible final characters depend on the choices made during the operations. But since we can choose any pair of characters to replace, perhaps there's a way to find all possible outcomes based on the current counts.\n\nBut since the order of operations can vary, perhaps we can find that for a given (c0, c1), the possible outcomes are determined by some condition.\n\nLet me think of the following: for any string with c0 0s and c1 1s, it's possible to reach any of the possible outcomes based on the parity of (c0 - c1) or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: the final character is 0 if the number of 0s is even, and 1 otherwise. But earlier examples show that this isn't the case. For example, with c0=2 and c1=0, the final character is 1 (when you replace the two 0s first), but if you have c0=4 and you can reach 0 via some steps.\n\nWait, maybe the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 0s minus the number of 1s. Let me think.\n\nIn the first example, c0=1, c1=1. c0 - c1 = 0, even. Final result is 0. That fits. For the case of c0=2, c1=0: c0 - c1 = 2, even. Final result is 1. Which doesn't fit. So that idea is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 0s. Because each operation can change the parity of the count of 0s in certain ways.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn case 1 (replacing two 0s with 1): the count of 0s decreases by 2 → parity remains the same.\n\nIn case 2 (replacing two 1s with 0): count of 0s increases by 1 → parity flips.\n\nIn case 3 (replacing 0 and 1 with 0): count of 0s remains the same → parity remains the same.\n\nSo, the parity of the number of 0s can change only when we perform case 2 operations.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nLet me think of the final character. Let's say that after all operations, the final character is x. What is x in terms of the initial counts?\n\nIf the final character is x, then the total number of operations must be such that we have reduced the string to x.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a direct connection.\n\nAlternative approach: think about the parity of the total number of operations that are of type 2 (replacing two 1s with 0). Because each such operation flips the parity of the count of 0s.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think about the total number of 0s and 1s. Let me consider that each operation reduces the total number of characters by 1. The final character is either 0 or 1. Let's think of the total number of 0s and 1s in terms of the operations.\n\nLet me denote that the initial total number of 0s is c0 and 1s is c1. The final character is x. Let's think about the parity of (c0 + c1 - 1) since the final length is 1. But not sure.\n\nAnother idea: think of the entire process as a series of operations that effectively reduce the string to a single bit, and that this bit is determined by the initial counts. For example, the final bit is 0 if the number of 0s is even, and 1 otherwise. But this doesn't hold in previous examples. For instance, c0=2, c1=0: the final result can be 1 (if you do the first operation), but the number of 0s is even. So this suggests that this idea is wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe the final result depends on whether the total number of 0s is even or odd, but with some exceptions. Like, if the total number of 0s is even, the result is 1 if there are no 1s, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: every time you replace two 0s with a 1, you're effectively converting two 0s into one 1. Similarly, replacing two 1s into a 0 converts two 1s into one 0. Replacing a 0 and a 1 into a 0 converts one 0 and one 1 into one 0, which reduces the count of 1s by one.\n\nLet me think of the entire process as trying to eliminate pairs of 0s and 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a way to calculate the XOR of the number of 0s and 1s. For example, the final result is 0 if the number of 0s is even, else 1. But earlier example shows that this is not the case.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should look for patterns in small cases.\n\nLet me create a table for small values of c0 and c1.\n\nCase 1: c0=1, c1=0 → string is \"0\". Can't perform any modifications. So the final character is 0. So for this case, the final character is 0.\n\nCase 2: c0=2, c1=0 → string is \"00\". Perform one operation: replace with 1. Final result is 1.\n\nCase 3: c0=3, c1=0 → string is \"000\". Possible operations:\n\nOption 1: Replace first two 0s with 1 → \"10\". Then replace them with 0 → final result 0.\n\nOption 2: Replace last two 0s with 1 → \"01\" → replace with 0. Final result 0.\n\nSo in this case, the final result is 0.\n\nCase 4: c0=4, c1=0 → string is \"0000\". Possible ways:\n\nOption 1: Replace two 0s → 1, then replace the rest as before. For example:\n\n\"0000\" → replace first two 0s → \"100\". Then replace last two 0s → \"11\" → replace with 0. Final result 0.\n\nOption 2: Replace two 0s in a different way:\n\n\"0000\" → replace two 0s with 1 → \"100\" → replace last two 0s → \"11\" → replace to 0.\n\nAnother option: replace the first two 0s with 1, then replace the next two 0s with 1 → \"11\" → replace to 0. Same result.\n\nAlternatively, what if we do:\n\n\"0000\" → replace the first and second 0s with 1 → \"100\". Then replace the first and third 0s? No, because the string is now \"100\", which has length 3. To perform a modification, we need to replace the last two characters. So replace \"00\" → 1 → \"11\" → replace to 0.\n\nSo the final result is 0. So for c0=4, c1=0, the final result is 0.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that there was a way to get 1. Did I make a mistake there?\n\nLet me re-examine that. Earlier I thought that for \"0000\", I could get 1, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think:\n\nIs there a way to get 1 from \"0000\"?\n\nLet me try:\n\n\"0000\" → replace the last two 0s with 1 → \"001\" (length 3). Then replace the last two characters (0 and 1) with 0 → \"00\" (length 2). Replace them with 1. Final result is 1. Oh! So in this case, it is possible to get 1.\n\nSo for c0=4, c1=0, it's possible to get both 0 and 1. Hence, for this case, the final result can be either 0 or 1, depending on the operations. Thus, for the problem, if the desired g is 0 or 1, the string is valid.\n\nSo this implies that for some (c0, c1), both 0 and 1 are possible outcomes. Thus, the problem becomes: for given n and m, determine whether it is possible to reach g through some sequence of operations, and if so, count the number of such strings.\n\nBut how to determine this for arbitrary n and m?\n\nLet me think of the following: the final result is determined by the parity of (c0 + c1) and the parity of (c0 - c1) or something similar.\n\nBut for the case c0=4, c1=0: c0 + c1 = 4, even. And the final result can be 0 or 1. So this doesn't seem to help.\n\nAlternative idea: think of the process as being able to generate any possible result, provided that certain conditions are met. For example, if there are at least two 0s or two 1s, then you can perform operations to change the final result.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think about the following: the final character is 0 if and only if the number of 0s is congruent to 0 modulo 1? No, that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: think of the entire process as a way to simulate the evaluation of the string as a binary expression, where each operation is combining two bits into one. But the rules for combining are not standard.\n\nLet me think of the operation as a binary operation. For example, combining two bits a and b into a new bit c. The rule is: if a and b are both 0, then c is 1; else c is 0.\n\nLet me define this operation as a binary function f(a, b) = 1 if a == b == 0, else 0.\n\nNow, the question is: for a given multiset of bits (with c0 0s and c1 1s), can we find a way to combine them using this operation to get g?\n\nBut since the order of operations matters, it's not clear.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a way to represent the final result in terms of the initial counts. For example, the final result is 0 if the number of 0s is even and the number of 1s is even, or something like that.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the case when there are no 1s (c1=0). Then the string consists of all 0s. Let's see what happens:\n\nFor c0=1: final result is 0.\n\nFor c0=2: final result is 1.\n\nFor c0=3: final result is 0 (as shown earlier).\n\nFor c0=4: final result can be 0 or 1, as shown.\n\nSo, for c1=0, the final result depends on whether the number of 0s is even or odd, but with some exceptions.\n\nWait for c0=3: it's odd, and the final result is 0. For c0=1, it's odd and result is 0. For c0=5, it would be 0 (assuming similar steps). But for c0=2 (even), the result is 1. For c0=4 (even), it can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo this suggests that when there are no 1s, the final result depends on the number of operations performed, but there's no single value. So the possibility to reach both 0 and 1 depends on the number of 0s.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nMaybe the key is to realize that for any string with at least two 0s or two 1s, you can perform operations to change the final result between 0 and 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the case where there are both 0s and 1s. For example, c0=2, c1=1. How can this be reduced?\n\nString is \"001\". Let's see:\n\nOption 1: Replace the last two characters (0 and 1) → 0. New string is \"00\". Replace them with 1. Final result is 1.\n\nOption 2: Replace the first two 0s with 1 → \"11\". Replace them with 0. Final result is 0.\n\nSo, for c0=2, c1=1, it is possible to reach both 0 and 1. So the final result can be either.\n\nThis suggests that whenever there are at least one 0 and one 1, and the total number of characters is greater than 1, it is possible to reach both 0 and 1. But this seems to be the case.\n\nBut what about when there are only 0s or only 1s?\n\nLet me think about when there are only 0s. For example, c0=3, c1=0. As before, the final result can be 0. But if you have c0=4, you can get 0 or 1.\n\nSo, for strings with only 0s:\n\nIf the number of 0s is 1: final result is 0.\n\nIf the number of 0s is 2: final result is 1.\n\nIf the number of 0s is 3: final result is 0.\n\nIf the number of 0s is 4: can get 0 or 1.\n\nSo, for even numbers of 0s >= 2, it's possible to get both 0 and 1. For odd numbers of 0s >= 1, it's possible to get 0.\n\nWait, for c0=4: how can you get 1? Let's see:\n\nStart with \"0000\".\n\nReplace the first two 0s with 1 → \"100\".\n\nReplace the last two 0s with 1 → \"11\".\n\nReplace with 0 → final result is 0.\n\nHmm, but earlier I thought there was a way to get 1. Let me try again:\n\nAnother way: \"0000\" → replace the last two 0s with 1 → \"001\".\n\nThen replace the first two 0s with 1 → \"11\".\n\nReplace with 0 → final result 0.\n\nWait, how can I get 1? Maybe it's not possible. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nLet me think again. For c0=4, c1=0, is it possible to get 1?\n\nLet me try:\n\n\"0000\" → replace the last two 0s with 1 → \"001\" (length 3). Now, replace the last two characters (0 and 1) with 0 → \"00\" (length 2). Replace with 1. Final result is 1. Ah, yes! So this path gives 1.\n\nSo for c0=4, it's possible to get both 0 and 1. So for even c0 >= 2, it is possible to get both 0 and 1.\n\nSo for strings with only 0s:\n\n- If c0 is 1: only 0 possible.\n\n- If c0 is even and >= 2: both 0 and 1 possible.\n\n- If c0 is odd and >=3: only 0 possible.\n\nSimilarly for strings with only 1s.\n\nSo, this suggests that the possibility to achieve g depends on the following:\n\n- If there are both 0s and 1s in the string, then it is possible",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of beautiful strings that can be reduced to a given character `g` through a series of specified operations.
