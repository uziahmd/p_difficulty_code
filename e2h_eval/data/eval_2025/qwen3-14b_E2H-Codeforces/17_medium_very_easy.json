He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign each of these input strings as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings in order. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that fits the assignments.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I think the main idea is to find the correct string s, then check which of the input strings are prefixes and suffixes of s. But since there might be multiple possible s's, how do we choose?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, it's sufficient to find any valid assignment. So maybe we can find the correct s by checking which of the input strings could be the full string. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the given input includes all improper prefixes and suffixes. For example, the full string s has prefixes of lengths 1 to n-1, and suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1. So, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1].\n\nBut here's an idea: The correct string s must be such that there exists a prefix of length n-1 and a suffix of length n-1. Also, those two must overlap correctly. For example, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must have their first n-2 characters matching except for the last character. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nLet's say s is the correct string. Then, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So, combining these two, the entire string s can be reconstructed as the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Because the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the entire string s is (prefix of length n-1) + (last character of suffix of length n-1). Or alternatively, the entire string is (first character of prefix of length n-1) + (suffix of length n-1). Wait, no. Let me think again:\n\nIf the prefix of length n-1 is P, then s is P + c, where c is the last character of the string. The suffix of length n-1 is S, which is the last n-1 characters of s. So S is s[1..n-1], which is (P[1..n-2] + c). Therefore, the first character of the prefix P is the first character of s, and the last character of the suffix S is the last character of s.\n\nSo, if I can find a candidate for the prefix of length n-1 and a candidate for the suffix of length n-1, then combining them would give me the possible s. But how to find which ones are those?\n\nIn the input, there are two strings of length n-1. One is the prefix of length n-1, and the other is the suffix of length n-1. So, for these two strings, their combination must form the correct s.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n- Find all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them. Let's call them A and B.\n\n- For each possible pair (A, B), check if they can form a valid s. That is, check if A's first n-2 characters are equal to B's first n-2 characters. Because:\n\n   s = A + [last_char], and B is the suffix of length n-1. So B should be s[1..n-1], which is A[1..n-2] + last_char. So, B must be equal to A[1..n-2] + last_char. But since A is of length n-1, then A[1..n-2] is of length n-2. So, B must be A[1..n-2] + (the last character of B). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if s is A + c (where A is length n-1 and c is the last character), then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], which is A[1..n-2] + c. So B must be equal to that. So B should be A[1..n-2] + c. But B is a string of length n-1. So, B's first n-2 characters should be A[1..n-2], and the last character of B is c. But since B is a suffix of length n-1, its last character is the same as the last character of s, which is c. So, for the pair (A, B), we can check if B is equal to A[1:] + B[-1], or something like that? Wait, A is of length n-1. A[1:] is of length n-2. So adding B's last character would make it length n-1. So B must be equal to A[1:] + B[-1]. Which is equivalent to B[:-1] == A[1:] ?\n\nYes! Because B is supposed to be A[1:] + c, where c is B's last character. So B's first n-2 characters (B[:-1]) must equal A[1:], which is of length n-2.\n\nSo for each pair of strings of length n-1 (there are two of them, so two possibilities), we can check if this condition holds. If yes, then the candidate s is A + B[-1], or B + A[-1]? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf A is the prefix of length n-1, then the full string is A + c, where c is the last character. The suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1] = A[1..n-2] + c. Which is A[1:] + c. So, B must be equal to A[1:] + c. But B is of length n-1. So B's first n-2 characters are A[1:], and the last character is c. Therefore, B's last character is c, which is the last character of the full string s. Therefore, the full string s is A + (B's last character). Alternatively, if B is the suffix of length n-1, then the full string s can be formed as (B's first character) + B[1:] ?\n\nNo. Because if B is the suffix of length n-1, then s is of length n, and B is s[1..n-1]. So the full string s is s[0] + B. But what is s[0]? It's the first character of the prefix of length n-1. But if the prefix of length n-1 is A, then s is A + c. So, if B is the suffix of length n-1, then B = s[1..n-1] = A[1..n-2] + c. So, s is A[0] + B.\n\nSo, for the pair (A, B), if B[:-1] == A[1:], then s is A + B[-1]. Also, for the pair (B, A), if A[:-1] == B[1:], then s is B + A[-1].\n\nTherefore, the approach would be:\n\n- Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates.\n\n- For each possible pair (a, b) in these two candidates (there are two possibilities: (a, b) and (b, a)), check whether b[:-1] == a[1:]. If yes, then the possible s is a + b[-1].\n\nOnce we have a candidate s, then we can check for all the input strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut how to know which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nOnce we have the correct s, we can generate all the prefixes (for lengths 1 to n-1) and all the suffixes (for lengths 1 to n-1). Then, for each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s. However, since the input contains exactly two strings for each length (one prefix and one suffix), we need to assign each input string as P or S accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the input may have duplicates. For example, in the second sample input, the input is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nWhich corresponds to the string \"aaa\". The prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\", and the suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". So the input has two \"a\" and two \"aa\".\n\nSo, when generating the prefixes and suffixes of s, we need to collect all of them, and then check for each input string which of them is present in the prefix list or suffix list.\n\nBut how to assign the P and S labels correctly?\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s (of some length) or a suffix of s (of some length). However, since the input has exactly two entries for each length (from 1 to n-1), and the correct s will have exactly one prefix and one suffix for each length, we can create a list of all prefixes and suffixes of s, and then for each input string, determine if it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how to handle duplicates? For example, in the case of the string \"aaa\", the prefix of length 1 is \"a\", the suffix of length 1 is also \"a\". So in the input, there are two \"a\" strings. For each of these, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, when building the list of prefixes and suffixes for s, we can collect all of them. Then, for each input string, we need to assign it as P if it's in the prefix list, and S if it's in the suffix list. However, since there are two entries for each length, we need to ensure that each input string is matched correctly.\n\nBut how do we do that? Because for example, if the input has two \"a\" strings, and both are in the prefix and suffix lists (like in the case of \"aaa\"), then each of them can be assigned as P or S, but the total number of P and S must be equal (each of the 2n-2 entries must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's).\n\nBut the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment. So, perhaps once we have the correct s, we can generate all prefixes and suffixes, and for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes or suffixes. Then, for each input string, assign 'P' if it's in the prefixes, else 'S'.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix of s? Like the example above. For example, in the case of \"aaa\", the string \"a\" is both a prefix and a suffix. So, when processing the input strings, which have two \"a\"s, each of them must be assigned as P and S. But how?\n\nBut the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. However, for a string that is both, how to decide which to assign?\n\nBut in that case, the problem allows any assignment as long as the counts are correct. For example, in the second sample input, the output can be PPSS, which would mean that the first \"a\" is a prefix, the second \"a\" is a suffix, etc. But how to assign them in code.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, generate all prefixes (for lengths 1 to n-1) and all suffixes (for lengths 1 to n-1). Then, for each input string, check if it is present in the prefix list. If so, assign P. Else, assign S. However, since the same string can be present in both prefix and suffix lists, we need to make sure that each input string is accounted for once. But since the input is guaranteed to be correct, each input string is present in at least one of the lists.\n\nBut how to handle duplicates? For example, if the input has two copies of a string that is both a prefix and suffix. Then, for each of them, we need to assign one as P and one as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code. Well, perhaps for each input string, we can check if it's in the prefix list. However, since there are exactly two strings of each length, and the prefixes and suffixes for each length are unique (for example, for length l, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix), but in some cases, the prefix and suffix for length l could be the same string.\n\nBut the input has exactly two strings of each length. So, for each length l, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. So, for each input string of length l, it must be either the prefix or the suffix of that length.\n\nSo, for example, for a given length l, the input has two strings. One of them is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l. So, for each input string, we can check for its length l, and see which of the two (prefix or suffix) it is.\n\nBut how to find that? Well, once we have the correct s, for each length l, the prefix is s[:l], and the suffix is s[-l:]. So, for each input string of length l, we can check if it equals the prefix or the suffix. If it's equal to the prefix, assign 'P', else 'S'.\n\nYes! That's the key. Because for each input string, we can check for its length l. Then, compare it to the prefix of length l of s. If equal, then it's a prefix, else it's a suffix. Because the input is guaranteed to be valid, so each input string must be either the prefix or the suffix for its length.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the correct s. To do that, look for the two strings of length n-1. Check which pair (a, b) satisfies that b[:-1] == a[1:]. Then, s is a + b[-1].\n\nBut wait, there are two strings of length n-1. Let's call them str1 and str2. So, for the pair (str1, str2), check if str2[:-1] == str1[1:]. If so, then s is str1 + str2[-1]. Similarly, check if str1[:-1] == str2[1:], in which case s is str2 + str1[-1]. If neither is true, then perhaps I made a mistake. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there must be a correct s.\n\nSo once we find the correct s, we can proceed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read all input strings.\n\n- Find the two strings of length n-1.\n\n- Check which of the two possibilities forms a valid s.\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check for its length l. Then compare to the prefix of length l of s. If equal, assign 'P'; else, assign 'S'.\n\nBut how to find the two strings of length n-1?\n\nWell, for the input, there are 2n-2 strings. For each of them, their lengths are between 1 and n-1. And for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings. So, for l = n-1, there are two strings.\n\nSo, in code, we can collect all the input strings, and select those with length n-1.\n\nOnce we have those two, we check the possible combinations.\n\nSo, let's proceed with code steps.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read 2n-2 lines, which are the input strings. Let's store them in a list called inputs.\n\nThen, collect all the strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates.\n\nThen, for each possible pair (a, b) in candidates (since there are two, there are two possibilities: (a, b) and (b, a)), check if b[:-1] == a[1:]. If yes, then s_candidate = a + b[-1]. Then, check if for this s_candidate, the other strings (the ones not of length n-1) are prefixes or suffixes.\n\nWait, but how do we know that this s_candidate is correct? Because the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there must be at least one s. So, for the two candidates of length n-1, exactly one of the two possibilities (a and b) will form a valid s.\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, then we can proceed to check for all input strings.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where both possibilities are valid. For example, if a and b are the same string. But in that case, the input would have two identical strings of length n-1. However, according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, but that's possible.\n\nBut regardless, once we find a valid s_candidate, we can proceed.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nFind the two candidates of length n-1.\n\nCheck for each possible pair (a, b) in the candidates (there are two possibilities):\n\nif b[:-1] == a[1:], then s_candidate is a + b[-1].\n\nOnce found, proceed.\n\nOnce s_candidate is found, then for each input string, check for its length l. Compare to s_candidate[:l], if equal, then assign 'P', else 'S'.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the input string is both a prefix and a suffix for some l? For example, in the case of s_candidate being 'aaa', for l=1, the prefix and suffix are both 'a'. Then, for each input string of length 1, which is 'a', we need to assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\nBut according to the code logic, for each input string, we check if it equals the prefix of length l. Since for that l, there are two input strings, one of which is the prefix and the other is the suffix. But in this case, the input strings are both equal to the prefix and suffix. So, for example, the code would compare the input string to the prefix, which it is, and assign 'P'. But then, the other input string would also be compared to the prefix and assigned 'P', which would result in two 'P's for that length, which is invalid.\n\nWait, but this can't happen because for each length l, there are exactly two input strings. One is the prefix, and one is the suffix. So, for each l, the prefix is s_candidate[:l], and the suffix is s_candidate[-l:]. So, for the input strings of length l, exactly one of them is equal to the prefix, and exactly one is equal to the suffix. However, if the prefix and suffix are the same (as in the case where the string is all same characters), then both input strings for that l are equal to the prefix and the suffix. So, when comparing each input string to the prefix, they would match, and thus both would be assigned 'P', but that's wrong, since one should be 'P' and the other 'S'.\n\nAh, here's a problem. So the code logic as described would fail in such cases.\n\nSo, how to handle that?\n\nBecause for a given input string of length l, if it's equal to the prefix of length l, then it's a prefix, else it's a suffix. However, if the prefix and suffix are the same, then both input strings would be equal to the prefix and thus would be considered as 'P's. But that would result in two 'P's for that length, which is invalid.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for each length l, the two input strings must be the prefix and suffix of that length. But if the prefix and suffix are the same, then the two input strings must be the same. Which is allowed.\n\nSo, in that case, how to assign 'P' and 'S' for the two input strings of that length?\n\nIn this case, the code's current approach would assign both as 'P's, which is incorrect. So we need a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For each input string, we need to determine whether it is the prefix of its length or the suffix of its length. However, for a given length l, the prefix and suffix may be the same. So, how to distinguish between them?\n\nBut in this case, since the input has exactly two strings of length l, and the correct s has exactly one prefix and one suffix of that length, which are the same. So, the two input strings are the same. Thus, when generating the answer, we can assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\nBut how to do that in code. Because, for example, if the input has two identical strings of length l, and they are both the prefix and suffix of s, then for each of them, we need to assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\nBut how can the code know which one to assign?\n\nThe problem allows any valid assignment. So, for example, in this case, we can assign the first occurrence as 'P' and the second as 'S', or vice versa.\n\nBut how to track that in code.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor each input string, for its length l, check if it is equal to the prefix of l. If yes, then assign 'P' if it hasn't been assigned yet. Otherwise, assign 'S'.\n\nBut how to track which ones have been assigned. However, since the input is given in arbitrary order, and for each length l, there are two input strings, which are the same (prefix and suffix), we need to assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\nBut how to do that in code. Maybe, for each length l, we can count how many times the prefix has been assigned. For example, for each l, the prefix is s[:l], and the suffix is s[-l:]. So, for each input string of length l, if it's equal to the prefix, then we can assign 'P' only once, and the other as 'S'.\n\nBut how to track that. Perhaps, for each length l, we can note that there are two input strings. For each of them, when processing, if the first one is equal to the prefix, assign 'P', and the next one assign 'S'.\n\nBut how to track which input strings are for which length and their order.\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, check if it's the prefix of its length. If it is, then assign 'P' if we haven't already assigned a prefix for that length. Otherwise, assign 'S'.\n\nBut how to track that. So, for each length l, we can have a counter for how many 'P's have been assigned. For example, for l in 1..n-1, we need exactly one 'P' and one 'S'.\n\nSo, during processing, for each input string, we check for its length l. Then, if the string is equal to the prefix of l, and we haven't assigned a 'P' for that l yet, then assign 'P' and increment the counter. Else, assign 'S'.\n\nThis way, for each l, exactly one 'P' and one 'S' are assigned.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, in code, we can create a dictionary for each length l, keeping track of how many 'P's have been assigned so far. Let's call it count_p. Initially, all are zero.\n\nThen, for each input string in order:\n\n   l = len(string)\n\n   if string == s[:l]:\n\n       if count_p[l] == 0:\n\n           assign 'P'\n\n           count_p[l] += 1\n\n       else:\n\n           assign 'S'\n\n   else:\n\n       assign 'S'\n\nBut wait, what if the string is not the prefix, but is the suffix? Because in that case, it should be assigned 'S'.\n\nBut how to know that. Because for a given l, the string could be the suffix but not the prefix. So, for example, if the string is equal to s[-l:], but not equal to s[:l], then it's a suffix, so assign 'S'.\n\nBut in the case where the string is equal to both (prefix and suffix), then we need to assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\nSo, the code logic would be:\n\nfor each input string in the order they were given:\n\n   l = len(string)\n\n   if string == s[:l]:\n\n       if count_p[l] < 1:\n\n           assign 'P'\n\n           count_p[l] += 1\n\n       else:\n\n           assign 'S'\n\n   else:\n\n       assign 'S'\n\nBut this would work. Because for each l, exactly one of the two input strings is the prefix (and the other is the suffix). However, in cases where the string is equal to both (i.e., prefix and suffix are same), then the first input string would be assigned 'P', and the second would be assigned 'S'.\n\nYes. That seems correct.\n\nSo, in code, after finding the correct s, we can process each input string in the order they were given, and for each, check if it's the prefix of its length. If so, assign 'P' if we haven't done so for that length yet. Otherwise, assign 'S'.\n\nThis way, for each length l, exactly one 'P' and one 'S' are assigned.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string in order:\n\n   l = len(str)\n\n   if str == s[:l]:\n\n       if count_p[l] is 0:\n\n           add 'P' to result, increment count_p[l]\n\n       else:\n\n           add 'S'\n\n   else:\n\n       add 'S'\n\nBut how to handle the case where the string is the suffix but not the prefix. Because, in that case, it's not equal to the prefix, so the code would assign 'S'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- Find the correct s.\n\n- For each input string, check if it is the prefix of its length. Assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly, ensuring that for each length, exactly one 'P' is assigned.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to how to find the correct s.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the correct s. Let's think again.\n\nWe have two candidates of length n-1. Let's call them a and b.\n\nWe need to check if a is the prefix of length n-1 and b is the suffix of length n-1. Or vice versa.\n\nSo, for the first case, the full string would be a + (last character of b). But the last character of b is the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Which is the last character of the full string s.\n\nBut also, the suffix of length n-1 is b, which must be s[1..n-1]. So, s is a[0] + b.\n\nWait, no. If a is the prefix of length n-1, then s is a + c, where c is the last character. And the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1] = a[1:] + c. Which must be equal to b. So, b must be equal to a[1:] + c. But since b is of length n-1, and a[1:] is of length n-2, then c is the last character of b. Therefore, b must be a[1:] + b[-1]. Which implies that b[:-1] == a[1:].\n\nSo, if this condition is met, then the full string is a + b[-1].\n\nSimilarly, if we consider that b is the prefix of length n-1, then the full string is b + c, where c is the last character. And the suffix of length n-1 is a, which must be equal to b[1:] + c. Therefore, a[:-1] must be equal to b[1:].\n\nSo, for the two candidates a and b, we can check these two possibilities.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncandidates = [s for s in inputs if len(s) == n-1]\n\nfor a in candidates:\n\n    for b in candidates:\n\n        if a != b:\n\n            # check if a is prefix and b is suffix\n\n            if b[:-1] == a[1:]:\n\n                s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n\n                # proceed with this s_candidate\n\n            # check if b is prefix and a is suffix\n\n            if a[:-1] == b[1:]:\n\n                s_candidate = b + a[-1]\n\n                # proceed with this s_candidate\n\nBut since there are two candidates, and they can be the same? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to have exactly two strings for each length. So, for length n-1, there are two strings. They can be the same (if the original string s has the same prefix and suffix of length n-1). For example, if s is \"aaaaa\", then the prefix of length 4 is \"aaaa\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"aaaa\". So the two candidates would be the same string. In this case, the code would have a loop that checks a and b, but a and b are the same. So, the code would check if a is prefix and b is suffix (same string). Then, check if b[:-1] == a[1:], which is a[:-1] == a[1:]. For a of length n-1, which is 4, for example, a[:-1] is length 3, a[1:] is length 3. So, for a string like \"aaaa\", a[:-1] is \"aaa\", a[1:] is \"aaa\", so the condition holds. Then, the s_candidate would be a + b[-1] = a + a[-1] = a + 'a' = \"aaaaa\", which is correct.\n\nSo, in code, the candidates could be the same. So, the code needs to check all possibilities. But how to avoid checking the same pair twice?\n\nBut perhaps the code can check both possibilities for the two candidates, even if they are the same. For example, for candidates a and a (same string), check if a[:-1] == a[1:], which is true. Then, s_candidate is a + a[-1], which is a + last character of a (which is same as a's last character). So, the s_candidate is a + a[-1] = a + (a[-1]) = a + a[-1]. But since a is of length n-1, adding one character makes it length n.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nIn code, for the two candidates (could be same or different), we can generate all possible pairs (a, b) where a and b are the two candidates (but possibly same). But since there are two candidates, the code can iterate through all possible permutations (a, b) and (b, a), but if they are same, then both cases would be same.\n\nBut perhaps the code can check for the two possibilities:\n\nCheck if the first candidate is the prefix and the second is the suffix.\n\nCheck if the second candidate is the prefix and the first is the suffix.\n\nSo, for the two candidates, say, [c1, c2], check:\n\nif c2[:-1] == c1[1:], then s_candidate = c1 + c2[-1]\n\nif c1[:-1] == c2[1:], then s_candidate = c2 + c1[-1]\n\nOnce we find a valid s_candidate, proceed.\n\nBut how to find which one is valid. Because there may be two possibilities. However, since the input is valid, there must be at least one valid possibility.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncandidates = list of the two strings of length n-1.\n\nfor possible_s in [ (candidates[0], candidates[1]), (candidates[1], candidates[0]) ]:\n\n    a, b = possible_s\n\n    if b[:-1] == a[1:]:\n\n        s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n\n        break\n\n    elif a[:-1] == b[1:]:\n\n        s_candidate = b + a[-1]\n\n        break\n\nBut wait, perhaps both possibilities are valid. For example, if the two candidates are the same string, then both conditions would be true, leading to same s_candidate.\n\nBut regardless, once we find a valid s_candidate, proceed.\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, then proceed to generate the answer.\n\nSo, putting this into code.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 strings into a list called inputs.\n\nCollect the candidates of length n-1.\n\nThen, try the two possibilities (a, b) and (b, a) to find s_candidate.\n\nOnce s_candidate is found, process each input string in order.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut how to collect the candidates of length n-1.\n\nIn Python:\n\ncandidates = [s for s in inputs if len(s) == n-1]\n\nOnce that is done, proceed.\n\nNow, code for checking the two possibilities.\n\nOnce we find s_candidate, then proceed.\n\nNow, for the example in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nThe candidates are the two strings of length 4 (since n=5, n-1=4). Looking at the input, the strings are:\n\nLooking at the input:\n\nThe input is:\n\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba']\n\nWait, the first line is 5, then the next 8 lines (since 2*5-2=8) are the strings.\n\nThe strings are:\n\nba (len 2)\n\na (len 1)\n\nabab (len 4)\n\na (len 1)\n\naba (len 3)\n\nbaba (len 4)\n\nab (len 2)\n\naba (len 3)\n\nSo the candidates of length 4 are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nSo, check the two possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: a is 'abab', b is 'baba'.\n\nCheck if b[:-1] == a[1:] ?\n\nb[:-1] is 'bab' (since b is 'baba', length 4, so b[:-1] is first 3 chars: 'bab').\n\na[1:] is 'bab' (since a is 'abab', a[1:] is 'bab'). So yes. So s_candidate is a + b[-1] = 'abab' + 'a' → 'ababa', which is correct.\n\nThus, the code would proceed with s_candidate = 'ababa'.\n\nOnce that is determined, process each input string.\n\nNow, for each input string, check for its length l, and compare to s_candidate[:l].\n\nFor example, the first input string is 'ba' (len 2). s_candidate[:2] is 'ab', so 'ba' is not equal. Assign 'S'.\n\nThe second input is 'a' (len 1). s_candidate[:1] is 'a' → assign 'P'.\n\nThird input is 'abab' (len 4). s_candidate[:4] is 'abab' → assign 'P'.\n\nFourth input is 'a' (len 1). s_candidate[:1] is 'a' → but for len 1, we have already assigned one 'P' (the second input). So this one would be assigned 'S'.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the code's logic for assigning P/S would handle that.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 lines. So:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ninputs = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(2*n - 2)]\n\nThen, collect the candidates of length n-1.\n\ncandidates = [s for s in inputs if len(s) == n-1]\n\nThen, check the two possibilities.\n\nOnce we find the correct s_candidate.\n\nOnce that is done, process each input string.\n\nNow, code for finding s_candidate:\n\nfor a, b in [(candidates[0], candidates[1]), (candidates[1], candidates[0])]:\n\n    if len(a) == n-1 and len(b) == n-1:\n\n        # check if b[:-1] == a[1:]\n\n        if b[:-1] == a[1:]:\n\n            s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n\n            break\n\n        # check if a[:-1] == b[1:]\n\n        elif a[:-1] == b[1:]:\n\n            s_candidate = b + a[-1]\n\n            break\n\nBut wait, in the code, the first check is for (a, b) being the first pair. If that passes, then we take that s_candidate. Else, check the other possibility.\n\nBut in code, the first check is for the first pair (candidates[0], candidates[1]). If the first condition is true, then we take that. Else, check if the second condition is true (a[:-1] == b[1:]), which would be for the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to assign each input string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidates for Full String**: The unknown string `s` can be reconstructed using the longest improper prefixes and suffixes. These are the strings of length `n-1` from the input. By checking if these two strings can form a valid `s`, we can determine the correct string.\n2. **Reconstruct the String `s`**: Using the two candidate strings of length `n-1`, we check if they can form a valid string `s` by ensuring the overlap between the prefix and suffix is correct.\n3. **Determine Prefix and Suffix Assignments**: Once `s` is determined, for each input string, we check if it matches the prefix or suffix of `s` for its respective length. This helps in assigning 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    inputs = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n    \n    # Find the two candidates of length n-1\n    candidates = [s for s in inputs if len(s) == n-1]\n    \n    # Try both possible pairs to find the correct s_candidate\n    s_candidate = None\n    for a, b in [(candidates[0], candidates[1]), (candidates[1], candidates[0])]:\n        # Check if a is prefix and b is suffix\n        if b[:-1] == a[1:]:\n            s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n            break\n        # Check if b is prefix and a is suffix\n        if a[:-1] == b[1:]:\n            s_candidate = b + a[-1]\n            break\n    \n    # Now process each input string to determine P/S\n    result = []\n    count_p = {}  # To track how many P's assigned per length\n    for l in range(1, n):\n        count_p[l] = 0\n    \n    for s in inputs:\n        l = len(s)\n        if s == s_candidate[:l]:\n            if count_p[l] == 0:\n                result.append('P')\n                count_p[l] += 1\n            else:\n                result.append('S')\n        else:\n            result.append('S')\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list. The first value is the length `n` of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential parts of the full string `s`.\n3. **Reconstructing `s`**: By checking the overlap conditions between the two candidate strings, we determine the correct string `s`.\n4. **Assigning Prefix and Suffix**: For each input string, we check if it matches the prefix of `s` for its length. If it does, it is marked as 'P'; otherwise, it is marked as 'S'. This ensures that each length has exactly one prefix and one suffix assigned correctly.\n\nThis approach efficiently reconstructs the unknown string and assigns the appropriate labels to each input string, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
