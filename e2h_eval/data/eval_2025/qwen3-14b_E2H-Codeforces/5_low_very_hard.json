Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question mark is compatible with any color. The task is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nHmm. The key is to maximize the number of such pairs. How do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the possible strategies. Since each pair uses exactly one left and one right boot, we need to match them optimally.\n\nFirst, I should consider that for specific colors (non-?), they can only be matched with same color or ?. For example, a left boot with color 'a' can be paired with a right boot that is 'a' or '?'. Similarly, a right boot with 'b' can be paired with a left boot that is 'b' or '?'.\n\nBut since ? can be anything, maybe we need to handle them carefully. Maybe first pair specific colors with each other, then use the ?s to cover remaining ones.\n\nLet me think about steps:\n\n1. For each color (excluding ?), count how many left and right boots have that color. Then, for each color, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of left count and right count. These pairs can be formed between left and right of the same color.\n\n2. But after that, the remaining ?s can be used to pair with any remaining boots. However, since ? can be used as any color, we need to pair them optimally.\n\nWait, but maybe the order in which we process the colors matters. For example, if we have a color that has more left boots than right, we can pair as much as possible, and then the remaining left boots can be paired with ?s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- First, process all non-? colors. For each color c, pair as many left and right boots as possible. This would be min(left[c], right[c]). Then, subtract these from the counts of left and right.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either ? or unpaired specific colors), pair them using the ?s. Because each ? can be used as a wildcard. So, the maximum number of pairs here would be the minimum of the total remaining left boots (including ?) and the total remaining right boots (including ?). But how to pair them?\n\nWait, but the remaining left and right boots may include both ? and other colors. For example, suppose after processing the specific colors, we have some left boots with color 'a' and some right boots with color 'b', but also some ?s. How do we pair them?\n\nBut in that case, the ?s can be used to pair with any. So, for the remaining left and right boots, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of the number of left and right ?s, but perhaps not. Wait, no. Because the remaining left and right boots are the ones that couldn't be paired with their specific colors. So, for example, if there are 3 left ?s and 5 right ?s, then we can pair 3 pairs (each left ? with a right ?). Also, if there are left ?s and right non-?s, the ?s can be used to pair with those non-?s.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the best way is:\n\nAfter pairing all specific colors, collect the remaining left and right boots. Let's call them left_remaining and right_remaining. These are the boots that couldn't be paired with their specific colors. Now, the left_remaining includes:\n\n- Left boots with color c (non-?), which couldn't be paired with a right boot of color c. Because there were not enough right boots of color c.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nBut in this case, the left_remaining and right_remaining can be paired using the ?s.\n\nBut how to maximize the pairs here. Let's think of it as:\n\nEach left boot in left_remaining can be paired with any right boot in right_remaining, provided that either:\n\n- The left is a ?, or the right is a ?, or both.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum matching between left_remaining and right_remaining, where each left and right can be matched if either is ?.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of such pairs is the sum of the number of left_remaining and right_remaining, minus the maximum between the two. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of the total number of left_remaining and right_remaining. Because each pair uses one left and one right. So, the maximum possible pairs is min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining)).\n\nBut how to pair them such that the compatibility condition is met.\n\nBut since the ? can be used to match any, we",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility is defined such that specific colors must match exactly, while question marks ('?') can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Specific Colors**: First, count the occurrences of each specific color (excluding '?') in both left and right boots. For each color, form as many pairs as possible between the left and right boots of that color.\n2. **Handle Remaining Boots**: After pairing specific colors, handle the remaining boots which include both specific colors and question marks. These remaining boots can be paired using the flexibility of question marks.\n3. **Pairing with Question Marks**: Use the remaining question marks to pair with any remaining specific color boots or other question marks. This ensures that we utilize all possible compatible pairs efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # For the first test case, but the input seems to have multiple test cases?\n    # Wait, looking at the example input, it's given as a list of test cases.
