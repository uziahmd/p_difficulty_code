In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimum number of tiles required.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, then the answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimum number of tiles to add to make it possible.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFor each input case (each of the three tiles), I need to check if there's already a mentsu. If not, determine how many more tiles are needed.\n\nSo, for each input, the process is:\n\nCheck if the three tiles form a triplet (all same) or a sequence (consecutive numbers in same suit). If yes, output 0.\n\nIf not, then figure out what's the minimum number of tiles to add to get either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how to approach that?\n\nLet me think about the possibilities. Since the initial hand is three tiles, maybe we can check for all possible ways to form a triplet or sequence by adding some tiles.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, check for existing mentsu. Let's start with that.\n\nFor example, if the three tiles are all same, then it's a triplet. So answer is 0.\n\nFor sequence: check if they are consecutive numbers in same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But the order doesn't matter, so we can sort them.\n\nSo for the three tiles, check if they are all same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence when sorted.\n\nIf either of those conditions is true, then output 0.\n\nElse, need to calculate the minimum tiles needed.\n\nNow, when there's no existing mentsu, what's the minimal steps?\n\nLet me think about possible cases.\n\nCase 1: Can form a triplet by adding one tile. For example, if two tiles are same. Then adding another same tile would make triplet. So the answer is 1.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to form a sequence with fewer tiles. So need to compare possibilities.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after drawing any number of tiles (including zero), she must have at least one mentsu. So the minimal number is the minimal between the options to form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo for each possible scenario, we need to compute the minimal steps required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for the triplet case: how many tiles are needed to form a triplet?\n\nSuppose the current three tiles have counts of each tile. For example, if there are two tiles of the same type, then adding one more would make a triplet. So the required number is 1. If there are three different tiles, then you need to add two tiles of the same type. Wait, but that's not possible? Because for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3m. Then to form a triplet, you need to add two more of any tile, but that's not helpful. Wait, but maybe the triplet can be formed by adding two more of one of the existing tiles. For example, if you have two 1m, then adding one more gives a triplet. But if you have one of each, then you need to add two more of any one tile. But that would require two tiles. However, maybe there's a better way to form a sequence.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, the required number of tiles is:\n\nFor each tile type in the current hand, count how many there are. For example, if there are two of a certain tile, then need 1 more. If there are one, then need 2 more. But if there are three, then 0. But since the original three tiles don't form a triplet, then there's no three same tiles. So for triplet, the minimal number is either 1 (if there are two same tiles) or 2 (if there are one of each, but that's possible only if all three are different).\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then to form a triplet, you can add one 1m (so total three) or add one 2m to make three 2m. But the first option requires adding one tile. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, the minimal tiles needed is (3 - max_count) where max_count is the maximum count of any tile in the current hand. Because if the max count is 2, then adding 1. If max count is 1, then adding 2.\n\nBut wait, in the case where there are two different tiles with count 2. Like, say, two 1m and one 1p. Then the max count is 2. So adding 1 tile of 1m gives a triplet. So yes.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, the required number is (3 - max_count) where max_count is the maximum count of any tile in the current hand.\n\nBut then, for the sequence possibility, how do we compute the minimal tiles needed?\n\nFor the sequence, the current three tiles may be able to form a sequence with adding some tiles. For example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then adding a 3s would form a sequence. So that requires one tile.\n\nAlternatively, if the three tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s. Then adding 2s and 4s would form a sequence (but that's two tiles). But maybe there's another way. Wait, no. Because the sequence is three consecutive numbers. So for example, in the case of 1s, 3s, 5s, you need to add 2s and 4s to form a sequence. But that's two tiles. But perhaps there's another way. Alternatively, maybe you can form a sequence by adding two tiles. But maybe the minimal steps here is two.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nSo for the sequence possibility, the idea is to check if the current tiles can be part of a sequence, and how many tiles are needed to complete it.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: the sequence requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for the current three tiles, we can check if they are in the same suit. If not, then to form a sequence, you need to add tiles that can form a sequence, but that might require more steps.\n\nSo first, check if all three tiles are in the same suit. If not, then forming a sequence would require adding tiles that can form a sequence. But for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then they are all different suits. So to form a sequence, you need to add two tiles. For example, if you add 2m and 3m, then you can form 1m, 2m, 3m. But that requires adding two tiles. Alternatively, maybe other possibilities. But in this case, the minimal is two.\n\nBut how to compute this in code?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to consider all possible sequences that can be formed with the current tiles plus some added tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut given that the current hand is three tiles, perhaps the minimal steps for a sequence can be determined by looking at the current tiles in the same suit (if any) and see how many tiles are needed to form a sequence.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\nFor the sequence possibility, first check if all three tiles are in the same suit. If not, then we can't form a sequence unless we add tiles to get three in the same suit. But that's complicated. However, perhaps the minimal steps for forming a sequence is to focus on the suit that has the most tiles.\n\nFor example, suppose the three tiles are in two different suits. Like 1m, 2m, 3p. Then, the best way to form a sequence is to add tiles in the same suit as the first two (m), which is already a sequence (1m, 2m, and adding 3m). That would take 1 tile. So the answer would be 1. Alternatively, adding two tiles in p suit, but that would require 2 tiles. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for the sequence, the approach is:\n\nCheck for each suit present in the current tiles, and see how many tiles are in that suit. For example, if there are two tiles in suit 'm', then we can try to form a sequence in that suit. For the third tile, we need to see if adding tiles can make a sequence.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have two tiles in the same suit. Let's say, 1m and 2m. Then, adding a 3m would form a sequence. So that's 1 tile. Alternatively, if the two tiles are 1m and 3m, then adding 2m would form a sequence. Also 1 tile.\n\nIf the two tiles are 1m and 4m, then we need to add two tiles (2m and 3m) to form a sequence. Or, maybe add 5m and 4m? No, that's not. Wait, the sequence is three consecutive numbers. So if the two tiles are 1m and 4m, then possible sequences could be 1-2-3 (need to add 2,3), or 2-3-4 (need to add 2,3), or 4-5-6 (add 5,6). So in any case, two tiles needed.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to form a sequence with less steps. For example, if the current tiles are 1m, 1m, 3m. Then, to form a sequence, you can add 2m (so you have 1,1,2,3. Then you can take 1,2,3. But that's a sequence. So you need to add one tile. But the current hand has 1m, 1m, 3m. So the three tiles in the hand are 1m, 1m, 3m. So the sequence would require adding 2m. So that's one tile.\n\nSo, the idea is that for the same suit, we can collect the numbers of the tiles and see what's the minimal steps to form a sequence.\n\nSo for a given suit, let's collect all the numbers present in the current hand. For example, if the suit is 'm' and the current hand has 1m, 1m, 3m. Then the numbers are [1,1,3]. Now, we need to find a sequence of three consecutive numbers, and see how many tiles are needed to complete it.\n\nBut how?\n\nOne approach is to generate all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers in that suit (from 1-2-3 up to 7-8-9), and for each such sequence, calculate how many tiles are missing in the current hand. The minimal of these would be the minimal steps required to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nBut since we can add any number of tiles, the question is: for a given sequence of three consecutive numbers (like x, x+1, x+2), how many of those numbers are already present in the current hand for that suit. The number of tiles needed is 3 minus the count of those numbers present in the hand. But since the current hand may have multiple copies of some numbers, but for the sequence, we need exactly one of each.\n\nWait, for example, if the current hand has two 1m and one 3m, then for the sequence 1,2,3, the current hand has 1 and 3. So we need to add 2. So one tile. For the sequence 2,3,4, we need to add 2 and 4. So two tiles. So for each possible sequence, we calculate how many tiles are needed.\n\nBut how do we generate all possible sequences for a given suit?\n\nFor example, for the numbers in the current hand, we can check all possible sequences that can be completed with adding some tiles. But perhaps it's easier to generate all possible sequences (1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9) and for each of them, check how many of the numbers are already present in the current hand for that suit.\n\nBut for the current hand, if there are multiple numbers in the same suit, then for each possible sequence, the number of existing numbers in the hand for that sequence is the count of how many of the three numbers are present. For example, if the current hand has 1m, 1m, 3m, then for the sequence 1-2-3, the numbers 1 and 3 are present. So that's two numbers. So we need to add 1 tile (the 2m). For the sequence 2-3-4, we need to add 2 and 4 (two tiles). So the minimal for that suit is 1.\n\nSo for each suit, we can generate all possible sequences and compute the minimal required tiles for that suit, then take the minimal across all suits.\n\nBut in the case where the current hand has tiles in multiple suits, we can check each suit separately and take the minimal.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor the sequence possibility:\n\nCheck all suits that are present in the current hand. For each suit, collect all the numbers in that suit. Then, for each possible sequence (x, x+1, x+2) in that suit, compute how many numbers are missing. The minimal required for that suit is the minimal of (3 - count) over all sequences, where count is the number of numbers in the sequence that are present in the current hand (regardless of duplicates). Then, the overall minimal for the sequence possibility is the minimal among all suits' minimal values.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the current hand has two 1m and one 2m. Then for the sequence 1-2-3, the count is 2 (since 1 and 2 are present). So we need 1 tile (3). For the sequence 2-3-4, count is 1 (only 2 present). Need 2 tiles. So the minimal for this suit is 1. So that's correct.\n\nSo the steps for the sequence possibility are:\n\nFor each suit in the current hand:\n\n   collect the numbers present in that suit (as a set, perhaps? because duplicates don't matter for the sequence, as long as you have at least one of each number in the sequence)\n\n   for each possible x in 1 to 7:\n\n       sequence is x, x+1, x+2\n\n       count how many of these numbers are present in the current suit's numbers\n\n       required = 3 - count\n\n       track the minimal required for this suit\n\nThen, the minimal required for the sequence possibility is the minimal of all the above minima across suits.\n\nBut also, if there are no suits with at least one tile (but that's impossible since the current hand has three tiles). So for example, if the three tiles are in three different suits, then for each suit, there's only one tile. So for each suit, the minimal required would be 2 (for example, for the first suit, the sequence would require adding two tiles to get two more numbers, but that's not possible. Wait, for example, if the suit has only one tile, say 1m. Then, for the sequence 1-2-3, we have one number present, so required is 2 tiles (add 2 and 3). For the sequence 2-3-4, required is 3 (we need to add 2,3,4). So the minimal for this suit is 2. So for each suit, the minimal required is 2. Then, the overall minimal for the sequence is 2. So in this case, the minimal steps to form a sequence is 2 (add two tiles to one suit to form a sequence). But if there are three different suits, then the minimal steps for the sequence is 2.\n\nSo, combining this with the triplet possibility.\n\nOnce we have the minimal steps for triplet (triplet_min) and the minimal steps for sequence (sequence_min), then the answer is the minimum between triplet_min and sequence_min.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\nFor the given three tiles:\n\nCheck if they already form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, compute triplet_min and sequence_min as explained, and return the minimum of the two.\n\nBut how to check if they already form a mentsu?\n\nCheck for triplet: all three tiles are same.\n\nCheck for sequence: all three are same suit, and their numbers are consecutive when sorted.\n\nSo, for the initial check:\n\nCheck if all three are same (triplet). Or, check if they are same suit and sorted numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s → yes. Or 3s, 2s, 1s → yes.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nParse the three tiles into a list. Let's say tiles = [tile1, tile2, tile3]\n\nCheck for triplet:\n\nif all three are same. For example, tile1 == tile2 == tile3.\n\nCheck for sequence:\n\nif all three have same suit. Then, extract their numbers as integers, sort them, check if they are consecutive. For example, numbers sorted are [a, b, c], check if b == a+1 and c == b+1.\n\nIf either condition is true, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed to compute triplet_min and sequence_min.\n\nNow, compute triplet_min:\n\ncount the frequency of each tile. For example, using a Counter.\n\nmax_count = max of the counts. So for example, if two tiles are same, max_count is 2. So triplet_min is 3 - max_count.\n\nBut what if there are three different tiles? Then max_count is 1, so triplet_min is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nSo triplet_min is 3 - max_count.\n\nThen compute sequence_min:\n\nfor each suit present in the tiles:\n\n   collect the numbers in that suit. For example, for suit 'm', collect all the numbers from the tiles that are in 'm'.\n\n   create a set of these numbers.\n\n   for each possible sequence (x, x+1, x+2):\n\n       count how many of x, x+1, x+2 are present in the set.\n\n       required_tiles = 3 - count.\n\n       track the minimal required for this suit.\n\nThen, the sequence_min is the minimal among all these required_tiles across all suits.\n\nBut if there are no suits (unlikely, since there are three tiles), but for example, if all three are in different suits, then for each suit, the set contains one number. So for each suit, the minimal required for that suit is 2 (since for any x, the sequence would need two more numbers). So the overall sequence_min is 2.\n\nOnce we have triplet_min and sequence_min, the answer is the minimum between the two.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the current tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then triplet_min is 1 (since max_count is 2). For the sequence, in suit m, numbers are {1,2}. So for the sequence 1-2-3, count is 2, required is 1. For the sequence 2-3-4, count is 1 (only 2), required is 2. So the minimal for the suit is 1. So sequence_min is 1. So the answer is min(1, 1) → 0? No, because the initial check didn't find a mentsu. Wait, in this case, the initial check would not find a mentsu. Because the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Not all same (triplet?), no. They are not a triplet. So triplet_min is 1. And sequence_min is 1. So the answer is 1. Which is correct. Because adding one tile (3m) would give 1,1,2,3 → which allows a sequence (1,2,3) → so the answer is 1.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: the third input in the sample is '3p 9m 2p'. So the three tiles are 3p, 2p, 9m. The initial check: are they same? No. Are they same suit? No. So the answer is not 0.\n\nTriplet_min: the counts are 3p (1), 9m (1), 2p (1). Max count is 1. So triplet_min is 3-1=2.\n\nSequence_min: check each suit.\n\nFor suit p: numbers are 3 and 2. So the set is {2,3}.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\nFor x=1: 1,2,3 → count is 2 (2 and 3 are present). Required is 1 (add 1).\n\nFor x=2: 2,3,4 → count is 2 (2 and 3). Required 1 (add 4).\n\nFor x=3: 3,4,5 → count is 1 (3). Required 2.\n\nSo the minimal for suit p is 1.\n\nFor suit m: only 9. So possible sequences:\n\nx=7: 7,8,9 → count is 1 (9). required 2.\n\nx=8: 8,9,10 → invalid (since numbers go up to 9). So x can be up to 7.\n\nSo for suit m, the minimal is 2.\n\nSo overall sequence_min is 1. So the answer is min(2, 1) = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, parse the input. The input is three strings. For example, the sample input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] — but wait, the input is given as a single line with three strings. Wait, the input description says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSo for example, for the sample input, the input is something like:\n\n\"1s 2s 3s 9m 9m 9m 3p 9m 2p\" — no, no. Wait, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nIn the example, the input is written as:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem statement says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nWait, no. Oh, the input is three strings. Each string is a tile. For example, the first example input is three tiles: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\".\n\nBut the sample input given is written as ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] — but that seems to be three separate test cases. For example, the first input is three tiles: 1s, 2s, 3s. The output is 0. The second input is three tiles: 9m, 9m, 9m. Output is 0. Third input is three tiles: 3p, 9m, 2p. Output is 1.\n\nBut the actual input format is that the input is a single line containing three strings. So for example, the first test case input would be \"1s 2s 3s\" — but that's three tiles separated by spaces. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit...\n\nSo each of the three strings is a tile. So for example, the first input line would be \"1s 2s 3s\" — but that's three strings, each being a tile. So the input is read as a list of three strings.\n\nWait, but in Python, the input is read as a single line. So for example, if the input is given as a line with three space-separated strings, like \"1s 2s 3s\", then splitting by whitespace would give three elements. So in the sample input, the first input line would be \"1s 2s 3s\", which is three tiles.\n\nSo the code should read the input line, split into three parts, and process each as a tile.\n\nSo the code would read the input as:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nAssuming that the input is given as three space-separated strings. For example, the sample input for the third case would be \"3p 9m 2p\".\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nThen, the three tiles are in tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2].\n\nNow, the first step is to check if the current tiles already form a mentsu.\n\nCheck for triplet: all three are same.\n\nCheck for sequence: same suit, and sorted numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for code:\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n    # check triplet\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return True\n    # check sequence\n    # check same suit\n    suit = tiles[0][-1]\n    if all(t[-1] == suit for t in tiles):\n        nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n        if nums[1] == nums[0]+1 and nums[2] == nums[1]+1:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nBut wait, for example, the tiles are 2s, 3s, 1s. Then sorted nums would be [1,2,3], which is valid.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nIf this returns True, then the answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, compute triplet_min:\n\nWe need to count the frequency of each tile.\n\nFor example, using a Counter.\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounts = Counter(tiles)\nmax_count = max(counts.values())\ntriplet_min = 3 - max_count\n\nBut for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m → counts is {'1m': 2, '2m':1} → max_count is 2 → triplet_min is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nThen compute sequence_min.\n\nFor that, we need to process each suit present in the tiles.\n\nSo, for each suit in the tiles, collect the numbers present in that suit.\n\nFor example, for each tile, extract its suit and number.\n\nSo, for each tile in tiles, we can split into number and suit.\n\nnumbers_by_suit = defaultdict(set)\n\nfor t in tiles:\n    num = int(t[0])\n    suit = t[1]\n    numbers_by_suit[suit].add(num)\n\nThen, for each suit in numbers_by_suit:\n\ncurrent_numbers = numbers_by_suit[suit]\n\nfor x in 1 to 7:\n\nsequence = [x, x+1, x+2]\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor n in sequence:\n\nif n in current_numbers → count +=1\n\nrequired = 3 - count\n\ntrack the minimal for this suit.\n\nSo for each suit, compute the minimal required, then take the overall minimal.\n\nSo:\n\nsequence_min = infinity\n\nfor suit in numbers_by_suit:\n    current_nums = numbers_by_suit[suit]\n    min_required_for_suit = infinity\n    for x in range(1, 8):  # x can be 1 to 7, since x+2 is 3 to 9\n        seq = [x, x+1, x+2]\n        cnt = 0\n        for num in seq:\n            if num in current_nums:\n                cnt +=1\n        required = 3 - cnt\n        if required < min_required_for_suit:\n            min_required_for_suit = required\n    if min_required_for_suit < sequence_min:\n        sequence_min = min_required_for_suit\n\nBut what if there are no suits (unlikely, since there are three tiles). But in code, numbers_by_suit will have at least one suit.\n\nOnce sequence_min is found, the answer is min(triplet_min, sequence_min).\n\nSo putting all together.\n\nBut what about the case where there are multiple suits?\n\nFor example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3p. Then, for suit 'm', the numbers are {1,2}, and for suit 'p' {3}.\n\nFor suit 'm', the minimal required is 1 (adding 3m). For suit 'p', the minimal required is 2 (adding 1p and 2p). So sequence_min is 1. So the answer would be min(triplet_min, 1).\n\nNow, triplet_min for this case is 1 (since counts are 1m, 1m, 1p? No. Wait, the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3p. So counts are 1m:1, 2m:1, 3p:1. So max_count is 1. triplet_min is 3-1=2. So the answer is min(2, 1) = 1.\n\nWhich is correct, as adding 3m would form a sequence.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about when the three tiles are in different suits, and the minimal sequence requires adding two tiles?\n\nLike, 1m, 2p, 3s. Then for each suit, the numbers are {1}, {2}, {3}.\n\nFor each suit, the minimal required is 2 (for example, for suit m, the sequence 1-2-3 requires adding 2 and 3, which is 2 tiles). So sequence_min is 2. triplet_min is 2. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo the code returns 2.\n\nWhich is correct. Because adding two tiles (e.g., 2m and 3m) would allow a sequence.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if already mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute triplet_min and sequence_min as described.\n\nThe answer is min(triplet_min, sequence_min).\n\nSo the code.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut need to handle the case where the numbers_by_suit is empty? No, since there are three tiles.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter, defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    tiles = input().split()\n    # Check if already mentsu\n    if len(tiles) != 3:\n        # but input is three tiles\n        pass\n    # Check for triplet\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    # Check for sequence\n    suit = tiles[0][-1]\n    same_suit = True\n    for t in tiles:\n        if t[-1] != suit:\n            same_suit = False\n            break\n    if same_suit:\n        nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n            print(0)\n            return\n    # Not mentsu yet. Compute triplet_min and sequence_min\n    # Compute triplet_min\n    counts = Counter(tiles)\n    max_count = max(counts.values())\n    triplet_min = 3 - max_count\n    # Compute sequence_min\n    numbers_by_suit = defaultdict(set)\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suit = t[1]\n        numbers_by_suit[suit].add(num)\n    sequence_min = float('inf')\n    for suit in numbers_by_suit:\n        current_nums = numbers_by_suit[suit]\n        min_required_for_suit = float('inf')\n        for x in range(1, 8):  # x can be 1-7\n            seq = [x, x+1, x+2]\n            cnt = 0\n            for num in seq:\n                if num in current_nums:\n                    cnt += 1\n            required = 3 - cnt\n            if required < min_required_for_suit:\n                min_required_for_suit = required\n        if min_required_for_suit < sequence_min:\n            sequence_min = min_required_for_suit\n    # Now, answer is min(triplet_min, sequence_min)\n    print(min(triplet_min, sequence_min))\n\nBut wait, in the sample input where the third case is '3p 9m 2p' (so tiles are ['3p', '9m', '2p']), the code would process:\n\nCheck triplet: no. Check sequence: same suit? 3p, 9m, 2p → no. So proceed.\n\ntriplet_min: counts are {'3p':1, '9m':1, '2p':1} → max_count 1 → triplet_min is 2.\n\nsequence_min:\n\nnumbers_by_suit for 'p' has {3,2} (since 3p and 2p). For suit 'm' has {9}.\n\nFor suit 'p':\n\nloop x from 1-7.\n\nFor x=1: sequence is 1,2,3. current_nums has 2 and 3. cnt=2 → required 1.\n\nFor x=2: sequence 2,3,4 → cnt=2 → required 1.\n\nFor x=3: sequence 3,4,5 → cnt=1 (3) → required 2.\n\netc. So the minimal for suit 'p' is 1.\n\nFor suit 'm' (numbers {9}):\n\nx can be 7, 8, etc. For x=7: sequence 7,8,9 → cnt=1 (9) → required 2.\n\nx=8: sequence 8,9,10 → 9 is present, others not → cnt=1 → required 2.\n\netc. So the minimal for suit 'm' is 2. So overall sequence_min is 1.\n\nThus, the answer is min(2,1) = 1 → correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1m 1m 1m → triplet. Output 0.\n\nAnother case: input is 1m 1m 2m. triplet_min is 1. sequence_min: for suit m, current_nums is {1,2}.\n\nFor x=1: sequence 1-2-3 → cnt=2 → required 1. So sequence_min is 1. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: input is 1m 3m 5m. For triplet_min: max_count is 1 → triplet_min is 2. sequence_min for suit m: check all sequences. For x=1: sequence 1-2-3 → current has 1, so cnt=1 → required 2. For x=3: 3-4-5 → current has 3 and 5 → cnt=2 → required 1. For x=5: 5-6-7 → current has 5 → cnt=1 → required 2. So the minimal for suit m is 1. So answer is min(2,1) = 1. So adding 4m would allow sequence 3-4-5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when the three tiles are in different suits and no possible sequence? Like 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, for each suit, the numbers are {1}, {2}, {3}.\n\nFor each suit, the minimal required is 2. So sequence_min is 2. triplet_min is 2. So answer is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: two tiles same, and one different. Like 1m, 1m, 2p. triplet_min is 1 (add another 1m). For sequence, check for suit m: numbers {1, 1} → set {1}. For sequences:\n\nx=1: 1-2-3 → current has 1. required 2 (add 2 and 3).\n\nx=0: no. So for suit m, the minimal is 2. For suit p: numbers {2} → minimal required is 2. So sequence_min is 2. So answer is min(1,2) → 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, reading from stdin and outputting the correct answer.\n\nBut the sample input is given as a list of three cases, but the actual input is a single line with three tiles. For example, the first example input is \"1s 2s 3s\", which outputs 0.\n\nSo the code should read the input line, split into three parts, process, and output the correct answer.\n\nSo the code above should work.\n\nBut in the code, after checking for the triplet and sequence, the code proceeds to compute triplet_min and sequence_min. But what if the code can form a mentsu by adding some tiles, but the code's calculation is correct?\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let me test the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut the actual input is",
