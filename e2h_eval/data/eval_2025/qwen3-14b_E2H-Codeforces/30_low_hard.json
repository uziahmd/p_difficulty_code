Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about Homer and Marge choosing turns to take digits from a number A such that each makes exactly n moves (since the total length is 2n). The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of H and M moves that achieves this maximum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Each time, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number. Then that digit is removed from A. So, for example, if the initial A is 1234 (n=2), then the first move could be H taking 1, then M takes 2, etc. But the order of choices affects the digits each gets.\n\nThe key here is that both players are trying to maximize the total sum of their own numbers. Wait, but the problem says that they want to maximize their total prize. So the total is S1 + S2. But since each digit is taken by either Homer or Marge, the total sum is just the sum of all digits multiplied by 10^something? Or wait, no. Wait, the numbers S1 and S2 are numbers formed by the digits they took. For example, if Homer takes digits 1 and 2, then his number is 12, which is 1*10 + 2. Similarly for Marge. The sum would be 12 + whatever Marge's number is.\n\nBut the problem requires that we maximize this sum. However, since each digit is part of either S1 or S2, the total sum S1 + S2 depends on the positions of the digits in their respective numbers. For example, if a digit is taken early (like the first move) by a player, it contributes more to their number than if it's taken later. Because each digit's contribution is multiplied by 10^k where k is the number of digits taken after it. Wait, let me think:\n\nSuppose a player takes digits in the order d1, d2, d3. Then their number is d1 * 10^{m-1} + d2 * 10^{m-2} + ... + dm * 10^0, where m is the number of digits they have. Since each player has exactly n digits, m = n. So each digit's contribution depends on when it was taken. For example, the first digit taken by a player contributes 10^{n-1}, the second 10^{n-2}, etc., down to the last digit contributing 10^0.\n\nSo the total sum S1 + S2 can be thought of as the sum for each digit of (digit) multiplied by (10^position_in_their_number). But since each digit is assigned to either Homer or Marge, and their position in their own number depends on the order in which they take digits.\n\nBut how can we model this? The problem is to choose which player takes which digits, with the constraint that each takes exactly n digits, and the order of taking determines their positions.\n\nBut the challenge is to find the sequence of choices (H and M) that maximizes the total sum. Since the order of taking affects the value of each digit's contribution.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let's think about the state. At any point, the number of digits remaining is 2n - k, where k is the number of digits already taken. But since each player must take exactly n digits, the state should also track how many H and M moves have been made so far.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a state (h, m), where h is the number of digits Homer has taken so far, and m is the number of digits Marge has taken. The total digits taken is h + m, and the remaining digits are 2n - (h + m). The next move can be either H or M, provided that h < n or m < n respectively.\n\nAt each state, the choice is to take H or M, and the decision depends on which choice leads to a higher total sum. However, since the digits are being taken from the front of A, the current state also depends on how many digits have been taken so far. So the state must also include the current position in the original A string.\n\nWait, for example, if we have taken k digits already, the next digit to take is at position k of the original string. So the state can be represented by (h, m), where h is the number of digits Homer has taken, m is the number of digits Marge has taken. Since h + m = k, and the next digit is the (h + m)th digit (assuming zero-based or one-based?), but the original A is given as a string. Let's say",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that the total prize money they receive is maximized. The key challenge is to decide at each step whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit from the number A, considering the impact on their respective numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a recursive approach with memoization to explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently. The state in our DP function will be defined by the number of digits each player has taken so far and the current position in the string A.\n2. **Greedy Strategy with Backtracking**: At each step, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and recursively determine which choice leads to a higher total prize. This approach ensures we explore all potential paths while avoiding redundant calculations through memoization.\n3. **Memoization Cache**: To optimize performance, we use a cache to store results of previously computed states, preventing redundant computations and reducing the time complexity significantly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        pos = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[pos])\n        best_total = -1\n        best_seq = \"\"\n        \n        # Try Homer's move if possible\n        if h < n:\n            next_total, next_seq = dp(h + 1, m)\n            total = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - h)) + next_total\n            if total > best_total or (total == best_total and (next_seq is None or len(next_seq) == 0)):\n                best_total = total\n                best_seq = \"H\" + next_seq\n        \n        # Try Marge's move if possible\n        if m < n:\n            next_total, next_seq = dp(h, m + 1)\n            total = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - m)) + next_total\n            if total > best_total or (total == best_total and (next_seq is None or len(next_seq) == 0)):\n                best_total = total\n                best_seq = \"M\" + next_seq\n        \n        return (best_total, best_seq)\n    \n    _, result = dp(0, 0)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number `n` and the string `A`.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function is defined with memoization to store intermediate results. It takes the current count of digits taken by Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`) as parameters.\n3. **Base Case**: When all digits have been taken (`h + m == 2 * n`), the function returns a total prize of 0 and an empty string.\n4. **Recursive Case**: For each state, the function checks if Homer or Marge can take the next digit. It recursively computes the total prize for both possibilities and selects the one that yields the maximum total prize.\n5. **Digit Contribution Calculation**: Each digit's contribution to the total prize depends on its position in the respective player's number, calculated using powers of 10 based on the number of digits remaining for the player.\n6. **Result Construction**: The optimal sequence of moves is built recursively and returned as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible sequences of moves while leveraging memoization to avoid redundant calculations, leading to an optimal solution.",
