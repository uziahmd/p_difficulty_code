The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement to make sure I get the construction rules right. \n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, that initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those leaves) are each connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So, the process involves adding layers where each existing leaf gets k new children. \n\nWait, so the initial step is creating a central node connected to k nodes. Then, each of those k nodes (which are leaves) are each connected to k new nodes. So each time we add a layer. But this step (adding new nodes to the leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal case for k=4 would be the initial node plus 4 nodes, then each of those 4 is connected to 4 new nodes. So total nodes: 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 +4 +16=21? Wait, but the example given says that for n=6, the answer is no, and for n=13 it's yes. Let me think about that.\n\nWait the sample input includes n=6, output is NO. Let's see. Let me think about possible values of n.\n\nLet me model the snowflake's structure. The snowflake is built in layers. Let's think recursively. \n\nLet me think of the construction steps:\n\n- The first step is the root node. Let's call this level 0. It has 1 node.\n\nThen, the first expansion: connect the root to k nodes. Now, level 1 has k nodes. Total nodes so far is 1 + k.\n\nThen, each of these level 1 nodes (which are leaves) are connected to k new nodes. So level 2 adds k * k nodes. Total nodes now is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut this step (the expansion) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when we have done this expansion once. So the minimal number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. For example, if k=2, then minimal is 1+2+4=7. But according to the sample input, when n=6, the answer is NO. Which makes sense because 6 isn't of the form 1 +k +k^2 for any k>1. Let's check for k=2, 1+2+4=7. For k=1, but k must be >1. So the minimal possible n is 1 +k +k^2, where k >=2. But maybe there are other possibilities where more layers are added?\n\nWait, the process can be repeated multiple times. So after the first expansion (level 1), you can do another expansion on the leaves (level 1 nodes) again. Wait, no. Because after the first expansion, the leaves are the level 1 nodes. When you add their children, those become the leaves. Then, if you do another expansion, you take those leaves (level 2 nodes) and add k children each. So the total nodes would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. But the problem says that the step (adding new nodes to the leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal is when you have done it once. So the snowflake can be constructed with any number of layers as long as there are at least two layers (the first expansion is required).\n\nSo the general formula for the number of nodes is 1 + k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )) where m is the number of expansions. Wait, let's think again. Let me think of the number of layers. The initial node is level 0. Then, each expansion adds a new level. For example:\n\n- After 0 expansions: just the root (n=1). But according to the problem statement, the initial step is to connect the root to k new nodes. So the first expansion is required. Wait, the problem says that the initial step is adding the root's k children, then the step of adding to leaves is done at least once. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step (connecting the root to k nodes) is mandatory. Then, the step",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem's rules. The key insight is understanding the structure of the snowflake graph and how it expands in layers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with a single vertex (root). This root is connected to `k` new vertices (where `k > 1`). Each subsequent layer adds `k` new vertices to each leaf node from the previous layer. This process must be done at least once.\n2. **Formulas for Valid Numbers**: The number of vertices in such a graph can be represented by the sum of a geometric series. For `m` layers (including the initial expansion), the total number of vertices is given by:\n   $$\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + \\ldots + k^m\n   $$\n   This can be simplified to:\n   $$\n   n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1}\n   $$\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each test case, we check if `n` can be represented in the form of the above formula for some integer `k > 1` and `m >= 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Try all possible k values\n    # We need to find if there exists k > 1 and m >= 1 such that n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)\n    # Also, note that for m >= 1, the minimal form is 1 + k + k^2 = (k^3 - 1)/(k - 1)\n    # So we can iterate over possible k and check if n fits into the formula\n    # Since k must be at least 2, and m at least 1\n    # Let's try all possible k up to cube root of n, because for m=1, n = 1 + k + k^2\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/3)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        # Check if there exists m >= 1 such that (k^(m+1) - 1) // (k - 1) == n\n        # We can compute this iteratively\n        total = 1  # starting with 1 (the root)\n        m = 0\n        while True:\n            m += 1\n            total += k ** m\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            elif total > n:\n                break\n    # Also check for m=1, which gives n = 1 + k + k^2\n    # But we already did that in the loop above\n    # Now check for cases where m is large and k is small, like k=2\n    # Another approach: For each possible m, check if there exists k such that n = (k^{m+1} - 1) / (k - 1)\n    # But since m can be large, we need to bound it\n    # Let's check for m up to log2(n), since for k=2, the minimal m is such that 2^{m+1} - 1 <= n\n    max_m = int(math.log(n, 2)) + 2\n    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):\n        # We need to find k such that (k^{m+1} - 1) / (k - 1) == n\n        # Which is equivalent to k^{m+1} - 1 = n*(k - 1)\n        # Or k^{m+1} - n*k + (n - 1) = 0\n        # But solving this equation is hard, so instead, we can perform binary search on k\n        low = 2\n        high = n\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            # Compute the sum 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^m\n            # Which is (mid^(m+1) - 1) // (mid - 1)\n            # To avoid overflow, we can compute it iteratively\n            try:\n                total = 0\n                for i in range(m + 1):\n                    total = total * mid + 1\n                if total == n:\n                    return True\n                elif total < n:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n            except:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Checking Validity**: The function `is_snowflake` checks if `n` can be expressed in the required form by iterating over possible values of `k` and checking if the corresponding geometric series sum matches `n`.\n3. **Efficient Checks**: The solution uses both iterative checks for small values of `k` and binary search for larger values of `m`, ensuring efficiency even for very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
