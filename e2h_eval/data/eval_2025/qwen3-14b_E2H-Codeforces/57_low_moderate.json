His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But since the actual points for Vasya are not given, we have to consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i is from the first tour's list and b_j from the second's, such that their sum is >=x. Then, for each such possible pair, determine how many people have a higher total than him, and how many are equal. But since the jury can assign positions in case of ties, the best possible rank is when Vasya is considered as high as possible, and worst when he's as low as possible.\n\nWait, but how do I model this?\n\nFor the best possible rank: We want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he has the highest possible sum), and then count how many people have strictly higher sums. Because if there are others with same sum, the jury can put him first. So the best rank is 1 plus the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's maximum possible sum.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the best possible scenario for Vasya is when his sum is as high as possible. For example, if he can get a sum of S, then the best possible rank is 1 plus the number of people with sum > S. Because all those people are ranked above him, and he can be placed first among those with same sum.\n\nSo to compute the best possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (which would be the maximum a_i + b_j where a_i and b_j are from the two lists, and their sum is at least x). Then, count how many people have a sum strictly greater than that maximum. Then the best rank is that count + 1.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a higher sum possible. Let me think again. Since Vasya's sum must be at least x. So the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum possible a_i + b_j (since that would be the best possible for him). But we need to ensure that this sum is >=x. However, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of all possible a_i + b_j. Because even if that maximum is higher than x, it's allowed. So for best rank, we take the maximum possible sum (max_sum) that Vasya can have. Then, the best rank is the number of participants with sum > max_sum plus 1.\n\nBut how do I compute that? Because the other participants' sums are a_i + b_i? No, no. Wait, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So the original data is that for each participant, they have some a_i and some b_j. But the problem is that the teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but they are not matched. So for each participant, their first tour score is in the a array, and their second tour score is in the b array. But the problem is that the a and b arrays are not paired. So for example, participant 1 has a_1 in first tour, but their second tour score is some b_k, but the teacher doesn't know which. So the teacher has to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j, but for the actual participants, each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, but the teacher doesn't know which. But for Vasya, the teacher is trying to find the best and worst possible rank, considering that Vasya's actual pair (a_i, b_j) is such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points in total. So the actual Vasya's total is some value >=x. However, the teacher has to consider all possible possibilities of how the a and b arrays could be paired (for all participants, including Vasya). But since the teacher wants to find the best and worst possible rank for Vasya, considering all possible pairings that are valid (i.e., that there exists at least one pair for Vasya with sum >=x).\n\nBut how to model this? Because for the other participants, their total is a_i + b_j, but the pairing is fixed. But for the purpose of determining the best and worst possible rank for Vasya, we need to imagine that for the other participants, their a and b scores are paired in such a way that allows Vasya's possible pair to achieve the best or worst rank.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves considering all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to find the optimal scenarios for Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank for Vasya, we need to maximize his total score. This is done by finding the maximum possible sum of any pair from the first and second tour scores. The best rank is determined by counting how many participants have a higher total score than this maximum possible sum for Vasya.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank for Vasya, we need to minimize his total score while ensuring it is at least `x`. This is done by finding the minimum possible sum of any pair from the first and second tour scores that is at least `x`. The worst rank is determined by counting how many participants have a higher total score than this minimum possible sum for Vasya, and adding 1 for Vasya himself in case of ties.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort the arrays\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    # For best rank: find maximum possible sum\n    max_sum = 0\n    i = n - 1\n    j = n - 1\n    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\n        current = a[i] + b[j]\n        if current >= x:\n            max_sum = current\n            break\n        elif current < x:\n            if a[i] < b[j]:\n                j -= 1\n            else:\n                i -= 1\n    # Now, find how many pairs have sum > max_sum\n    # We can compute this by using two pointers approach\n    count_best = 0\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        current = a[i] + b[j]\n        if current > max_sum:\n            count_best += 1\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    \n    # For worst rank: find the minimal possible sum >=x\n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        current = a[i] + b[j]\n        if current >= x:\n            min_sum = current\n            break\n        elif a[i] < b[j]:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    # Now, find how many pairs have sum > min_sum\n    count_worst = 0\n    # To find the number of pairs with sum > min_sum\n    # Use two pointers approach again\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        current = a[i] + b[j]\n        if current > min_sum:\n            count_worst += 1\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    # Worst rank is count_worst + 1\n    best_rank = count_best + 1\n    worst_rank = count_worst + 1\n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum points `x`, and the scores from the two tours.\n2. **Sorting**: The scores from both tours are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing.\n3. **Best Rank Calculation**: Using a two-pointer technique, we find the maximum possible sum Vasya could have. Then, we count how many participants have a higher total score than this maximum.\n4. **Worst Rank Calculation**: Similarly, we find the minimum possible sum Vasya could have (while still meeting the minimum requirement `x`). We then count how many participants have a higher total score than this minimum, and add 1 to account for Vasya's possible tie.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine both the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve using sorting and two-pointer techniques, resulting in an optimal solution.",
