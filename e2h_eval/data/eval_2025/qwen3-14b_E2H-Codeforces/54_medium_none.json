Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The output should be the three vertices v1, v2, v3. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles in a regular polygon work. Let me think about the formula for the angles formed by three vertices.\n\nIn a regular n-gon, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But that's the angle of the polygon itself. However, when we select three vertices, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart the other two vertices are from v2.\n\nLet me think: For a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. When you pick three vertices v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the vertex of the angle, the angle formed depends on the number of sides between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. But since the polygon is regular, maybe the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. However, since the polygon is convex, the angle formed at v2 must be less than 180 degrees.\n\nWait, but how to calculate the angle at v2 for three vertices. Let me think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a circle. Then, the angle at v2 would be an inscribed angle. Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\nBut in this case, the angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. So, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, no. Because if the polygon is regular, then the arc between v1 and v3 (the one that doesn't contain v2) would be determined by how many steps apart they are. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the polygon has n vertices. Let's say that between v2 and v1, there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3, there are m steps clockwise. But since the polygon is regular, the positions are symmetric. However, for the angle at v2, the actual arc that determines the angle is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Because the angle is formed by two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The inscribed angle theorem says that the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that's opposite to it, i.e., the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nSo, let's suppose that between v1 and v3, there are d steps along the perimeter. Then the arc length is d*(360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 is half of that arc's measure. Wait, no. Wait, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the measure of the arc that it subtends. So if the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is x degrees, then the angle at v2 is x/2 degrees.\n\nBut how to find x? Well, the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is determined by the number of edges between them. Let's say that the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2 is k. Then x is k*(360/n) degrees. Therefore, the angle at v2 is (k * 360 / n ) / 2 = (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nWait, but this seems to suggest that the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3. However, since the polygon is regular, for any three vertices, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps are between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't include v2.\n\nBut how do we find k? Let me think of an example. Take a square (n=4). Suppose v2 is vertex 1. Then, if v1 is vertex 2 and v3 is vertex 4, then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 2 steps (from 2 to 3 to 4), which is 2*(360/4) = 180 degrees. The angle at v2 would be 180/2 = 90 degrees. Which makes sense because in a square, the angle between adjacent vertices is 90 degrees. Wait, but in that case, if v1 is 2, v2 is 1, v3 is 4, then the angle at v2 (vertex 1) is between the lines connecting to 2 and 4. That's a right angle, yes.\n\nAnother example: take a regular pentagon (n=5). Suppose we have vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's take v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 4. The arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is from 2 to 3 to 4. That's two steps. So k=2. The angle would be 2*180/5 = 72 degrees. But what's the actual angle? Let's see. The central angle between 2 and 4 is 2*(72) = 144 degrees (since each step is 72 degrees for a pentagon). The inscribed angle would be half of that, which is 72 degrees. Yes. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is k steps. How do we compute k?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the entire perimeter is some value. But since the polygon is regular, the arc that does not contain v2 would be the shorter arc between v1 and v3. Wait, no. Because if the arc that contains v2 is longer, then the arc that does not contain v2 is shorter. But in the case where the arc is exactly half the polygon, then it's ambiguous. However, since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 is formed by two adjacent edges, but when choosing three vertices, the angle can be formed in different ways.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem, the key is to find, for each possible k, the angle that can be formed. Let me think: For any three vertices, the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Let me call this number of steps as d. Then, the angle is (d * 180)/n degrees. But since the polygon is regular, the number of steps d must be between 1 and n-2. Because if d is 0, then v1 and v3 are the same, which is invalid. And if d is n-1, then the arc would be almost the full circle, but then the angle would be (n-1)*180/n degrees. However, since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 must be less than 180 degrees. Let me check that.\n\nFor example, if d = n-2 steps, then angle is (n-2)*180/n. For n=3, that's 1*180/3 = 60 degrees. Which is correct. For n=4, d=2 steps gives 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct. If d is n-1 steps, then angle would be (n-1)*180/n. For example, n=4, d=3 steps would be 3*180/4 = 135 degrees. But that's larger than 180? No, 135 is less than 180. Wait, but if d is n-1, then the arc between v1 and v3 (without v2) is n-1 steps. But that would mean that the arc is almost the full circle. However, the angle at v2 would be (n-1)*180/n. Let's take n=5, d=4 steps. The angle is 4*180/5 = 144 degrees. Which is less than 180. So that's allowed. But how is that possible? Because if the arc between v1 and v3 is 4 steps (which is 4*72=288 degrees), then the angle at v2 is half that arc, 144 degrees. But that's possible because the angle is formed inside the polygon. Wait, but how can the arc be more than 180 degrees? Because the arc that's not containing v2 can be longer than 180 degrees. But the inscribed angle would be half that arc. However, in that case, the angle would be larger than 90 degrees. But in a regular polygon, when you choose three points such that the arc between v1 and v3 is larger than 180 degrees, the angle at v2 would be larger than 90 degrees. However, the problem states that the polygon is convex, so all internal angles are less than 180 degrees. But the angle formed by three vertices can be larger than the internal angle of the polygon. For example, in a square, the internal angle is 90 degrees, but if you take three vertices where the angle is formed between two non-adjacent vertices, like the example where the angle is 90 degrees. Wait, but in the square, if you take vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 is between the lines to 1 and 4. That's a 45-degree angle? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. For a square, each internal angle is 90 degrees. But when you take three vertices, like 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 is between the line from 2 to 1 (which is adjacent) and from 2 to 4 (which is two steps away). How much is that angle?\n\nIn the square, the coordinates could be (assuming unit circle for simplicity):\n\nVertex 1: (1, 1)\nVertex 2: (-1, 1)\nVertex 3: (-1, -1)\nVertex 4: (1, -1)\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think of a square centered at the origin. Let's consider coordinates for easier calculation. Suppose the square is inscribed in a unit circle. Then, the coordinates of the vertices are:\n\nVertex 1: (1, 0)\nVertex 2: (0, 1)\nVertex 3: (-1, 0)\nVertex 4: (0, -1)\n\nWait, no. That's a square rotated by 45 degrees. Alternatively, if the square has vertices at (1,1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1), then the center is at (0,0). But the angle between adjacent vertices would be 90 degrees. Let's take vertex 2 as (0,1), vertex 1 as (1,1), vertex 4 as (0,-1). Then, the angle at vertex 2 between 1 and 4 would be between the vectors from 2 to 1 (right direction) and from 2 to 4 (down direction). The angle between those vectors is 90 degrees plus 90 degrees? Wait, no. The vector from 2 to 1 is (1,1) - (0,1) = (1,0). The vector from 2 to 4 is (0,-1) - (0,1) = (0,-2). The angle between (1,0) and (0,-2) is 90 degrees. Wait, yes. Because the dot product is zero. So the angle is 90 degrees. So in that case, even though the arc between v1 and v3 (vertices 1 and 4) is two steps (along the arc that doesn't contain v2), which is 2*(360/4) = 180 degrees. Then the angle at v2 is 180/2 = 90 degrees. Which matches. So that's correct.\n\nBut if I take another example where the arc between v1 and v3 is more than 180 degrees. Let's say n=5, and d=3 steps. Then the arc would be 3*(72) = 216 degrees. The angle at v2 would be 216/2 = 108 degrees. Which is less than 180. So that's valid. So the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo the formula for the angle at v2 is (d * 180)/n, where d is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. And d can range from 1 to n-2. Because if d is n-1 steps, then the arc is (n-1)* (360/n) degrees. Divided by 2, that's (n-1)*180/n degrees. Which for n=5 would be 4*180/5 = 144 degrees. Which is less than 180.\n\nWait, for d = n-2 steps, the angle is (n-2)*180/n. For example, n=5, that's 3*180/5 = 108 degrees. Which is the internal angle of the regular pentagon. Because each internal angle of a regular pentagon is (5-2)*180/5 = 108 degrees. So that makes sense. So the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 is determined by the value of d, which is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. And d can be from 1 to n-2. Because if d is larger than n-2, then the arc would be longer than the arc that contains v2, but since we take the arc that does not contain v2, the maximum d is n-2 steps. Because if d is n-1 steps, then the arc that contains v2 would be 1 step, and the arc that does not contain v2 is n-1 steps. But since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 is formed by two lines that go out from v2 to v1 and v3, which are on the perimeter. So the formula holds.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the value of d (between 1 and n-2) such that the angle (d * 180)/n is as close as possible to a given a. Once we find the optimal d, then we can choose any three vertices that form that d.\n\nBut how to find the optimal d?\n\nLet me think. For each possible d (from 1 to n-2), compute the angle theta = (d * 180)/n. Find the d that minimizes |theta - a|. Then, once we find that d, we can construct the triplet (v1, v2, v3) that corresponds to this d.\n\nSo first, I need to find the best d. Let's think about how to find this d.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation theta = (d * 180)/n. We want theta ≈ a. Solving for d:\n\nd ≈ (a * n)/180.\n\nBut since d must be an integer between 1 and n-2, we can compute the closest integer to (a * n)/180, and check the floor and ceiling values to find the best d.\n\nHowever, since a can be up to 180, and for d up to n-2, let's think about possible cases.\n\nFor example, when a is 180 degrees, the best d is (n-2) because theta would be (n-2)*180/n. But for n=3, n-2=1, theta is 180/3=60 degrees. Which is the only possible angle.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute the ideal d as (a * n) / 180. Since d must be an integer, we can check the floor and ceiling of that value, and also ensure that d is within [1, n-2]. Then, compare the angles for these candidates to find the minimal difference.\n\nBut how to handle when the ideal d is not an integer. For example, if the ideal is 2.3, then we check d=2 and d=3. But also, need to make sure that d is within the allowed range.\n\nOnce the best d is found, the next step is to find any triplet of vertices that forms this d.\n\nNow, how to choose the triplet. Let's say we have chosen d. Then, for any vertex v2, we can choose v1 and v3 such that there are d steps between them along the arc that doesn't contain v2. For example, if we pick v2 as vertex 1, then v1 could be vertex 2 (one step away from v2), and v3 would be vertex 2 + d steps away from v1? Or perhaps, for a given v2, v1 is one step clockwise, and v3 is d+1 steps clockwise from v2? Wait, maybe I need to think about how to arrange the three points.\n\nLet me think of the regular polygon as arranged in a circle. Let me fix v2 as vertex 1. Then, to have d steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2, the positions of v1 and v3 must be such that moving clockwise from v1 to v3, passing through d steps, and not passing through v2.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to select v2 as any vertex, say vertex 1, then choose v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + d) mod n? Wait, but need to make sure that the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is exactly d steps.\n\nWait, for example, if n is 5, d is 2. Let's say v2 is vertex 1. Then, if v1 is vertex 2 (adjacent to v2), then v3 needs to be two steps away from v1 along the arc that does not contain v2. So from v1 (vertex 2), moving clockwise, two steps would be vertex 3 and 4. So v3 is vertex 4. Then the arc between v1 and v3 (vertex 2 to 4) is two steps. The arc that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) is indeed two steps. So the angle at v2 (vertex 1) would be 2*180/5 = 72 degrees. So that's correct.\n\nSo the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=4. But how to generalize this?\n\nIn general, for a given d, we can choose any v2, then choose v1 as the next vertex clockwise from v2, and v3 as the vertex d+1 steps away from v2 (since between v1 and v3, there are d steps). Wait, for example, if v2 is vertex 1, then v1 is vertex 2 (one step clockwise). Then, v3 is vertex 2 + d steps? Or perhaps, v3 is vertex 1 + (d+1) steps? Let me think.\n\nIf between v1 and v3, there are d steps along the arc not containing v2. Let me imagine that v2 is fixed. Then, if I move clockwise from v2, the next vertex is v1. Then, moving d steps from v1 along the arc that does not contain v2, which would be the same as moving d steps clockwise from v1. So the position of v3 would be v1 + d steps. But since v1 is one step clockwise from v2, then v3 would be v2 + 1 + d steps. However, since the polygon is cyclic, we need to take modulo n into account.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, perhaps the simplest way is to pick v2 as vertex 1, v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + d) mod n. Wait, but for example, in the case where n=5, d=2, then 2 + d = 4. Which is correct. So v3 is vertex 4. That works.\n\nBut when adding d steps, we have to make sure that the path from v1 to v3 does not pass through v2. So if d is such that the steps from v1 to v3 is exactly d steps, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is d steps. So the selection of v1 and v3 as adjacent to v2 and then d steps away seems correct.\n\nBut for this to work, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is exactly d. So for any d, this is possible.\n\nSo for any d, the triplet can be constructed as follows: choose v2 as any vertex, say vertex 1. Then v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex (v2 + 1 + d) mod n? Or perhaps v3 is vertex (v1 + d) mod n. Let me think again.\n\nIf v2 is vertex 1, then v1 is vertex 2. Then, the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't contain v2 must be d steps. So moving clockwise from v1 (vertex 2), taking d steps would reach vertex 2 + d. But since the polygon is numbered from 1 to n, we need to adjust for the modulo. So for example, if vertex 2 + d exceeds n, then wrap around. But since d is between 1 and n-2, adding d to 2 may or may not exceed n. However, since the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is d steps, then the position of v3 is (v1 + d) steps clockwise. So for example, in the case where v1 is 2, and d is 2 steps, then v3 is 2 + 2 = 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut if d is such that v1 + d exceeds n, then we need to wrap around. However, since d can be up to n-2, and v1 is 2, then 2 + d can be up to 2 + (n-2) = n. So in that case, v3 is n. Which is okay. For example, n=5, d=3, v1=2, then v3 is 2+3=5. The arc between 2 and 5 is 3 steps (2→3→4→5), and the arc that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) is indeed 3 steps. The angle would be 3*180/5 = 108 degrees.\n\nSo yes, this approach works. Therefore, for any d, the triplet can be constructed as v1 = v2 + 1, v3 = v1 + d. But since the vertices are numbered from 1 to n, we need to adjust for the modulo. However, since in the case where v1 + d exceeds n, the code can handle it by using modulo n. Wait, but for example, if v1 is n, and d is 1, then v3 would be n+1, which is 1. But in that case, the arc between v1 (n) and v3 (1) is 1 step, but the arc that does not contain v2 (which is n-1, assuming v2 is n-1?) Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the selection of v2.\n\nAlternatively, let's fix v2 as vertex 1. Then, v1 is vertex 2. Then, v3 is vertex (2 + d) if 2 + d <=n, else (2 + d - n). But since d can be up to n-2, then 2 + d can be up to 2 + (n-2) = n. So in that case, v3 is n. Which is correct.\n\nSo the triplet is v1 = 2, v2=1, v3 = 2 + d. But in the case where d is such that 2 + d exceeds n, then we need to take modulo n. Wait, but for example, n=5, d=3. Then 2 + 3 = 5, which is okay. For n=4, d=2, then 2 + 2 =4. Which is okay.\n\nBut what if d is such that 2 + d exceeds n? For example, n=4, d=2. Then 2 + 2 =4. Which is okay. For n=4, d=3 is not allowed because d can be up to n-2 = 2. So no problem.\n\nTherefore, for any valid d (between 1 and n-2), the triplet (v1, v2, v3) can be (2, 1, 2+d). However, if 2 + d exceeds n, then 2 + d - n. Wait, but for d up to n-2, 2 +d can be up to 2 + n-2 = n. So no need for modulo. So v3 is 2 + d. But in that case, for example, when n=5 and d=3, 2+3=5 which is valid. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if the d is such that the arc between v1 and v3 includes v2? For example, if d is small. Wait, no. Because the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is d steps. So when v1 is 2 and v3 is 2 + d, and v2 is 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2 is d steps. Because moving clockwise from v1 (2) to v3 (2 +d), which is d steps. The arc that includes v2 would be the other way around, which is longer. So this setup ensures that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is exactly d steps.\n\nThus, the triplet (2, 1, 2 +d) is valid. However, there's a possibility that 2 +d is equal to 1. For example, if n=3, d=1. Then 2 +1 =3. Which is okay. The triplet is 2, 1, 3. Which is valid.\n\nSo, once we find the best d, we can output the triplet (v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+d). However, there are other possible triplets. For example, the triplet could be (v1=1, v2=2, v3= 1 +d). Or other permutations. But according to the problem statement, any valid triplet is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem requires that the vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. So, for example, in the first sample input, n=3 and a=15. The only possible angle is 60 degrees. So any triplet is acceptable, like 1 2 3.\n\nSo, the code can choose any triplet that satisfies the d value. The easiest is to choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 2 +d.\n\nBut what if d is 0? Well, since d ranges from 1 to n-2, that's not possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the ideal d as (a * n) / 180. Since d must be integer, we can check floor and ceiling of this value, and also check the closest ones.\n\nBut since a can be up to 180, and n can be up to 1e5, how to compute the best d?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- For a given n and a, compute the target angle a.\n\n- For each possible d in 1..n-2, compute theta = (d * 180)/n.\n\n- Find the d that minimizes |theta - a|.\n\nBut for large n (up to 1e5), checking all possible d's is O(n), which would be too slow for n=1e5. However, since n can be up to 1e5 and per test case, but the problem says that the input is a single line (so one test case?), but the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking back, the input is first and only line contains two integers. So the code is supposed to process one test case. So for n up to 1e5, checking all possible d's is O(n) time, which for 1e5 is acceptable. However, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nBut for n=1e5, O(n) is manageable. However, perhaps the optimal d can be calculated mathematically.\n\nLet me think again. The ideal d is (a * n)/180. Let's call this value d_ideal. Since d must be integer, we can check floor(d_ideal), ceil(d_ideal), and possibly nearby values. Because the minimal difference could be either floor or ceil, or even other values if d_ideal is exactly halfway between two integers.\n\nBut how to find the best d in that case?\n\nLet me think. For example, if d_ideal is 2.3, then check d=2 and d=3. For d_ideal=2.5, check d=2 and d=3. For d_ideal=2.6, check d=2 and 3. So the optimal d is either floor(d_ideal) or ceil(d_ideal), but need to check which one is closer.\n\nBut also, need to ensure that the computed d is within the valid range [1, n-2].\n\nSo the steps for finding d:\n\nCompute d_ideal = (a * n) / 180.\n\nThen, check d_candidate = floor(d_ideal), ceil(d_ideal), and possibly others if needed.\n\nBut how to handle the case when d_ideal is not in the valid range. For example, if a is very small, then d_ideal could be less than 1. In that case, the best d is 1. Similarly, if d_ideal is larger than n-2, then best d is n-2.\n\nSo the algorithm for finding the best d is:\n\nCompute d_ideal = (a * n) / 180.\n\ncandidates = set()\n\nAdd floor(d_ideal) and ceil(d_ideal) to candidates.\n\nAlso, check if d_ideal is exactly integer, then add that.\n\nBut also, ensure that the candidates are within [1, n-2]. So after generating the candidates, check them, and also check the boundaries if necessary.\n\nOnce the candidates are generated, compute the absolute difference between their theta and a, and select the d with minimal difference. If multiple d's have the same difference, choose any (e.g., the smallest d, or the largest, etc.)\n\nOnce the best d is found, construct the triplet.\n\nBut why not use this approach instead of checking all possible d's? Because for large n, this approach is O(1) time, which is better.\n\nSo let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute d_ideal = (a * n) / 180.0.\n\nBut since a and n are integers, and division is floating point.\n\nThen generate candidate d's around d_ideal.\n\nBut also, need to consider that for some cases, the closest d could be outside the floor and ceil. For example, if d_ideal is 2.9, then floor is 2, ceil is 3. But if the actual optimal is 3, but if there's another d that's further away but due to some rounding, but I think that floor and ceil are sufficient.\n\nSo generate candidates as:\n\ncandidates = [floor(d_ideal), ceil(d_ideal), floor(d_ideal) -1, ceil(d_ideal)+1]\n\nWait, but perhaps not. Maybe just floor and ceil, and then clamp them to the valid range. Also, need to check if d_ideal is outside the valid range. For example, if d_ideal is less than 1, then the best is 1. If d_ideal is larger than n-2, then best is n-2.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nCompute d_ideal = a * n / 180.0.\n\nThen, generate possible candidates:\n\ncandidates = [math.floor(d_ideal), math.ceil(d_ideal)]\n\nBut also, need to include the integer parts. Also, need to check if d_ideal is exactly integer. For example, if d_ideal is 3.0, then floor and ceil are both 3. So candidates would have 3 once.\n\nOnce the candidates are generated, we need to collect all possible candidates, and then filter them to be within [1, n-2], and then check which one gives the minimal difference.\n\nBut perhaps also need to check the boundaries. For example, if d_ideal is 0.5, then the candidates are 0 and 1. But 0 is invalid, so the only candidate is 1. Similarly, if d_ideal is larger than n-2, then the candidate is n-2.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nGenerate a list of possible candidate d values. For example, floor(d_ideal), ceil(d_ideal), and also possibly d_ideal rounded to nearest integer.\n\nBut perhaps the safest way is to generate floor(d_ideal) -1, floor(d_ideal), floor(d_ideal)+1, ceil(d_ideal)-1, ceil(d_ideal), ceil(d_ideal)+1, but that might be overkill. Alternatively, generate floor and ceil, and then check those, and also check the boundaries.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to generate all possible d's that are in the vicinity of d_ideal, but within the valid range.\n\nOnce the candidates are generated, we can loop through them, and for each, check if it is in the valid range. Then, among all valid candidates, compute their theta and find the best.\n\nBut what if there are multiple candidates that are equally good? For example, two d's with same difference. Then, any of them can be chosen.\n\nOnce the best d is found, then construct the triplet.\n\nBut how to construct the triplet? For example, for d=2, the triplet is (2, 1, 2 + 2) = 2, 1, 4. But in the sample input for n=4, a=67. The best d is 1 (because theta is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees, which is closer to 67 than 90). So the triplet would be 2, 1, 3. Which is the sample output's second case: \"2 1 3\".\n\nYes, which matches the sample input.\n\nSo the code can generate the triplet as (v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 +d). However, need to make sure that 2 +d is <=n. But since d is up to n-2, 2 +d can be up to 2 + n-2 =n, which is valid.\n\nBut in code, for example, when n=4 and d=1, 2 +1=3, which is valid.\n\nSo the code can output 2, 1, 2 +d. But what if 2 +d exceeds n? Well, for d up to n-2, 2 +d can be up to 2 + (n-2) =n. So no problem.\n\nBut what if d is 0? Well, since d is in [1, n-2], that's not possible.\n\nSo the code can generate the triplet as follows:\n\nv2 = 1\n\nv1 = 2\n\nv3 = 2 +d.\n\nBut need to check that v3 is not equal to v2 or v1. But since d >=1, v3 is at least 3. So v3 is distinct from v1 and v2.\n\nBut what if n=3, d=1. Then v3 is 2+1=3. So the triplet is 2, 1, 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can generate the triplet (2, 1, 2 +d).\n\nBut what if there are multiple valid triplets? For example, the problem allows any triplet. So this approach is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=3, a=15. The only possible d is 1. The angle is 1*180/3=60 degrees. The triplet is 2,1,3. Which is correct.\n\nCase 2: n=4, a=67. The ideal d is (67 *4)/180 = 268/180 ≈ 1.488. So candidates are 1 and 2. For d=1, theta is 45 degrees. For d=2, theta is 90 degrees. Which is closer to 67? 67-45=22, 90-67=23. So 45 is better. So d=1. The triplet is 2,1,3. Which matches the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves calculating the optimal number of steps between vertices to form the closest possible angle and then constructing the required triplet.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: The angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices in a regular n-gon can be determined by the number of steps between those vertices along the arc that does not include the vertex of the angle. This angle can be calculated using the formula: `theta = (d * 180) / n`, where `d` is the number of steps between the vertices.\n2. **Finding Optimal d**: Calculate the ideal number of steps `d` that would make the angle closest to `a`. This is done by evaluating values around the calculated ideal `d` (using floor and ceiling functions) and checking which gives the closest angle.\n3. **Constructing the Triplet**: Once the optimal `d` is found, construct the triplet of vertices using the calculated steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n    \n    # Compute ideal d\n    d_ideal = (a * n) / 180.0\n    candidates = set()\n    candidates.add(math.floor(d_ideal))\n    candidates.add(math.ceil(d_ideal))\n    candidates.add(math.floor(d_ideal) - 1)\n    candidates.add(math.ceil(d_ideal) + 1)\n    \n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_d = 1\n    \n    for d in candidates:\n        if d < 1 or d > n - 2:\n            continue\n        theta = (d * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(theta - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_d = d\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Choose the smaller d for consistency\n            if d < best_d:\n                best_d = d\n    \n    # Also check boundaries in case the ideal is outside the range\n    for d_candidate in [1, n-2]:\n        theta = (d_candidate * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(theta - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_d = d_candidate\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            if d_candidate < best_d:\n                best_d = d_candidate\n    \n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_d\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (the target angle).\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: Directly handle the case where `n` is 3, as it only forms one possible angle.\n3. **Ideal d Calculation**: Calculate the ideal number of steps `d` that would give the closest angle to `a` using floating-point arithmetic.\n4. **Candidate Evaluation**: Generate candidate values for `d` around the ideal value and evaluate each to find the one that minimizes the difference from `a`.\n5. **Boundary Check**: Ensure the optimal `d` is within valid bounds and check boundary values if necessary.\n6. **Triplet Construction**: Construct the triplet using the optimal `d` and print the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `d` to find the closest angle and constructs the required triplet, ensuring the solution is both optimal and efficient.",
