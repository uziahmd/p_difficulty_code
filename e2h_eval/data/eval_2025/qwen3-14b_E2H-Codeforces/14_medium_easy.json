He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the main idea is: for a given m, find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. 5! has one zero. 6! is 720, which also has one. Similarly up to 9! which is 362880. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause when you increase n, the number of trailing zeros can increase by 1 or more. For example, when n is 25, the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So for some m, there might be no n that gives exactly that m. Or maybe there are multiple n's.\n\nBut how do we find the possible n's for a given m?\n\nThe approach I need to take is:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are other n's that also give m.\n\nBut wait, how do we find that? Let's think about the function f(n) which counts the trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing. So for each m, there could be a range of n's that give exactly m.\n\nBut how to find the possible n's?\n\nLet me think. For example, if m is 5, then what's the possible n?\n\nLet me compute f(24) = 24/5 =4 + 24/25=0 → 4. f(25) is 25/5 + 25/25 =5+1=6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo the problem is that for certain m's, there's no n. But for others, there's a range of n's.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\n- First, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are other numbers after that which also have f(n) = m.\n\nWait, but how to find if such n exists. Because for example, when m is 1, the minimal n is 5. Then 6,7,8,9 also have the same count. But when you reach 10, f(10) is 2. So the numbers that contribute to m=1 are 5-9.\n\nSo the idea is that for each m, there's a range of numbers where f(n) = m. But how long is that range?\n\nThe key is that when you have a number n where f(n) = m, then the next number, n+1, will have f(n+1) = m or m+1. Because adding 1 to n may not add any new factors of 5. Unless n+1 is a multiple of 5.\n\nSo the possible numbers for a given m are consecutive numbers. So if there exists at least one n with f(n)=m, then the numbers are from some lower bound to upper bound.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFind the smallest n where f(n) = m. Then check if the next numbers (n+1, etc.) also have f(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, find the lower and upper bounds of n such that f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, find the possible n's where f(n) = m. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, the possible values of n would form a contiguous range. So the number of such n's is either 0 or 5 (like in the sample), or maybe some other number?\n\nWait, why 5? Because when you have a number like 5, which adds one 5. Then numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all have the same count. Because when you reach 10, you get another 5 (from 10). So the count increases by 1 again. So between the numbers where the count increases by 1, there's a range of 5 numbers.\n\nBut that's only when the count increases by 1. However, if there's a number that adds two 5s (like 25), then the count jumps by 2. So for example, for m=5, there's no solution. Because the count jumps from 4 (for 24) to 6 (for 25). So m=5 is skipped.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor a given m, check if there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If yes, then the number of such n's is 5 (or maybe 4?), but how?\n\nWait, the sample shows that for m=1, there are 5 numbers. Let's think about how many numbers are there between the first occurrence of m and the next occurrence of m+1.\n\nSuppose that the first occurrence of m is at n_min. Then the next occurrence of m+1 is at some n_max. Then the numbers from n_min to n_max-1 would have f(n) = m. How many numbers is that?\n\nWell, the difference between n_max and n_min. For example, for m=1, the first occurrence is at 5, and the next occurrence of m+1=2 is at 10. So numbers 5-9, which is 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9).\n\nSo the count is (n_max - n_min) ?\n\nWait, 10 -5 =5, but 5 numbers. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the problem becomes:\n\nFind the minimal n where f(n) = m, and the minimal n where f(n) = m+1. Then the numbers between them (exclusive) are the ones that have exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find these n's?\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the smallest n such that f(n) = m. Let's call it low.\n\n2. Find the smallest n such that f(n) = m+1. Let's call it high.\n\n3. Then, the numbers from low to high-1 are the numbers that have exactly m trailing zeros. So the count is high - low.\n\nBut wait, how do we know that there are numbers between low and high-1?\n\nBecause if the function f(n) increases by 1 between low and high, then the numbers between low and high-1 would have exactly m.\n\nBut what if the function increases by more than 1? For example, when m is 5, and there is no n with f(n) =5. So for that case, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\n- Check if there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If not, output 0.\n\n- If yes, then the count is high - low, and the numbers are from low to high-1.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nTo find low, we can perform a binary search for the minimal n where f(n) = m. Similarly for high, which is the minimal n where f(n) = m+1.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Wait, perhaps we can find the minimal n where f(n) >= m, and then check if it's equal to m.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach:\n\nThe number of trailing zeros for n is given by count_zeros(n). We can use binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. But how to find that?\n\nWait, maybe the approach is to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if that value is exactly m. If not, then there is no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is found.\n\nBut for example, let's say m=1. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1 is 5. Which is exactly m. So that's the low. Then the high is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1 (i.e., 2). That is 10. So the count is 10-5=5. Which gives the numbers from 5 to 9, inclusive.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. The numbers between the first and second minus 1 are the solutions.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m? Well, perhaps we can find the lower bound and upper bound for m.\n\nWait, but maybe there is no n with count_zeros(n) = m. So how to check that?\n\nSo the process is:\n\nCompute the minimal n_low where count_zeros(n_low) = m. Then compute the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) = m+1. Then the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this value x. Then check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then there's no solution. Else, the minimal n is x. Then find the minimal n for m+1, which is y. Then the answer is the numbers from x to y-1.\n\nSo for example, for m=1, x is 5, y is 10. So the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key is to find x and y.\n\nNow, how to compute x and y. For that, binary search can be used.\n\nSo the count_zeros(n) function can be written as:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the binary search for x (the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m). Let's think about the possible range of n. For m up to 1e5, the maximum possible n is 5*m. Because for example, 5*m has count_zeros(5m) >= m. But maybe that's not tight. For example, for m=1, 5*1=5, which is exactly the minimal n. For m=5, the minimal n is 25, which is 5*5=25. But for m=6, the minimal n is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). So 5*m may not be the upper bound. Wait, but for m=6, 5*6=30. But 25 is less than 30. So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. Or maybe even higher. But perhaps 5*m is sufficient.\n\nWait, let's think. For any n, count_zeros(n) is at least n/5 - 1. Because each step divides by 5, so sum is n/5 + n/25 + ... which is less than n/4. So for count_zeros(n) >= m, n must be at least 5*m. Wait, no. For example, m=1, n=5 is 5*1. For m=5, the minimal n is 25, which is 5*5. For m=6, the minimal n is 25. So 5*m is 30, but the minimal n is 25. So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. But perhaps 5*m is not enough. Wait, for m=6, 5*m is 30. But the minimal n is 25. So the upper bound can be 5*m. Because 5*m is larger than the minimal n. So in binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. But maybe even higher. But for the binary search, the upper bound can be 5*m, but perhaps for some cases, it's better to use a higher upper bound. Alternatively, we can use something like m*5. But for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the binary search for x would be between low=0 and high=5*m. Wait, but for m=1, 5*m is 5, which is the correct value. For m=6, 5*m is 30. The minimal n is 25, which is within 5*m. So yes.\n\nSo the steps for finding x (the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m) is:\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m. While low < high:\n\nmid = (low + high) // 2.\n\nif count_zeros(mid) >= m: high = mid.\n\nelse: low = mid +1.\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nOnce we find x, we check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, proceed to find y, which is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nThen, the answer is the numbers from x to y-1. The count is y -x.\n\nSo for example, for m=1, x=5, y=10. So numbers 5-9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's no n with count_zeros(n) =m? For example, m=5. Let's see:\n\nFind x for m=5. Let's compute:\n\nbinary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5.\n\nLet me think:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 → 4. So 24 is 4. 25 is 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So there's no solution, hence output 0.\n\nSo the code would check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then output 0.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe code would:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need for that.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m) (the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m).\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m → output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute y = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthen the numbers are from x to y-1. So the count is y -x.\n\nthen output the count and the numbers.\n\nBut how to generate the numbers? For example, if x is 5 and y is 10, then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the list is [x, x+1, ..., y-1]. So the length is y -x.\n\nBut what if y -x is 0? That would mean that there's no numbers. But that can't happen because if x is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) =m, then y is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. So the numbers between x and y-1 must have count_zeros(n) =m. Because for any n between x and y-1, count_zeros(n) is >=m (since x is the minimal for m), but less than m+1 (since y is the minimal for m+1). So count_zeros(n) =m for all those numbers.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the code structure in Python.\n\nFirst, implement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThen, the binary search function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low =0\n    high =5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for target=0, but since m is >=1, maybe not needed.\n\nSo for the problem:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen compute x = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(x) !=m → output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the answer is the numbers from x to y-1.\n\nSo the count is y -x.\n\nBut how to handle when m is such that there's no solution?\n\nLike for m=5, x is 25, count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to m. So output 0.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nif m is 0, but according to input constraints m is >=1.\n\nSo:\n\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low =0\n    high =5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m+1)\n    res = list(range(x, y))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nWait, but for example, when m=1, x is 5, y is 10. So range(x,y) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, range(x,y) includes x, x+1,..., y-1. So yes.\n\nBut what about the case when m is very large, like 1e5? Let's see, for 5*target, when target is 1e5, 5*target is 5e5. But for binary search, that's acceptable.\n\nBut what about when the target is very large? For example, m=1e5, then 5*m is 5e5. Let's see what the count_zeros(5e5) is. Well, it's 5e5//5 + 5e5//25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + ... which is more than 1e5. So the find_min_n function would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. But for large m, the binary search is O(log (5m)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut what if m is 1e5, and the minimal n is 499999? Well, the code would handle it.\n\nBut what about the high value in find_min_n? For example, if m is such that the required n is larger than 5*m? Is that possible?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose m=1. 5*1=5. The minimal n is 5. So it's correct. What about for m=6? The minimal n is 25. 5*6=30. 25 <30. So the code would work. So the high is 5*target, which is sufficient.\n\nBut what about for m=25? Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(100) = 100//5 + 100//25 + 100//125 = 20 +4 +0=24. So 100 has 24 zeros. 105: 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25. So for m=25, the minimal n is 105. 5*m is 125. So the code would find it.\n\nSo the high is 5*target, which is sufficient.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nx = find_min_n(1). Let's see:\n\nbinary search for target=1.\n\nInitially, low=0, high=5*1=5.\n\nLoop:\n\nlow=0, high=5.\n\nmid=(0+5)//2=2. count_zeros(2) is 0 <1. So low=3.\n\nNow low=3, high=5. mid=4. count_zeros(4) is 0. low=5.\n\nNow low=5, high=5. exit loop. return 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\ny is find_min_n(2).\n\ntarget=2.\n\nhigh=5*2=10.\n\nbinary search:\n\nlow=0, high=10.\n\nmid=5. count_zeros(5)=1 <2 → low=6.\n\nmid= (6+10)/2=8. count_zeros(8)=1 <2 → low=9.\n\nmid= (9+10)/2=9.5 → 9. count_zeros(9)=1 <2 → low=10. Now low=high=10. return 10.\n\nso res is range(5,10) → 5,6,7,8,9. len is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. Let's see:\n\nx = find_min_n(5). Let's compute.\n\ntarget=5.\n\nhigh=5*5=25.\n\nbinary search:\n\nInitially low=0, high=25.\n\nmid=12. count_zeros(12) is 2 (12//5=2, 12//25=0). 2 <5 → low=13.\n\nmid= (13+25)/2=19. count_zeros(19) is 3 (19//5=3). <5 → low=20.\n\nmid=20+25//2=22.5 → 22. count_zeros(22) is 4 (22//5=4). <5 → low=23.\n\nmid= (23+25)/2=24. count_zeros(24) is 4. <5 → low=25.\n\nhigh=25. loop ends. returns 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. Which is not equal to 5. So output 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nBut what about m=6?\n\nx is find_min_n(6). Let's see:\n\ntarget=6. high=5*6=30.\n\nbinary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 → yes. Then y is find_min_n(7).\n\nWhat is find_min_n(7)?\n\nWe need to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So need to check higher numbers.\n\ncount_zeros(25) =6. count_zeros(29) is 29//5=5 + 29//25=1 → 6. count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → 7. So minimal n is 25? No. Wait, 30 is the first n where count_zeros(n) is 7. So find_min_n(7) would return 25? Or 30?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nbinary search for target=7.\n\nhigh is 5*7=35.\n\nlow starts at 0, high=35.\n\nmid=17 → count_zeros(17) is 3 <7 → low=18.\n\nmid= (18+35)/2=26.5 → 26. count_zeros(26) is 5 + 1=6 <7 → low=27.\n\nmid= (27+35)/2=31. count_zeros(31) is 6 + 1=7. So >=7. So high=31.\n\nNow low=27, high=31.\n\nmid= (27+31)/2=29. count_zeros(29) is 5 + 1=6 <7 → low=30.\n\nmid= (30+31)/2=30.5 → 30. count_zeros(30) is 6+1=7. So high=30. Now low=30, high=30. return 30.\n\nSo y is 30. So the numbers from x=25 to y-1=29. So 25,26,27,28,29 → 5 numbers. So for m=6, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nWhich makes sense. Because 25! has 6 zeros, and 29! also has 6 zeros. 30! has 7.\n\nSo the code would output 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when m is 0? According to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, the code needs to read input from stdin, and output the required answers.\n\nBut the input is given as a list, but in the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is ['1', '5'], but the sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, but that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer. But the sample input shows that for input 1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for input 5, output is 0. So the sample input is probably two test cases. But in the problem statement, the user is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin. So the input is a single integer.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases. For example, the first input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, output is 0. But the way the sample is presented is perhaps in a format where the input is given as a list of inputs. However, the actual code should read a single integer m from standard input.\n\nSo the code should read m as input, and output the required answer.\n\nSo the code in Python:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen compute as discussed.\n\nBut in the sample input, perhaps the first input is m=1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code should be written to read m from stdin.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut in the code, for the case where the answer is zero, we print 0. Else, print the length and the numbers.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m = int(input())\n\nImplement the functions.\n\nBut for large m, the code may be slow? Let's see. For m=1e5, the binary search for find_min_n(m) would take log2(5*1e5) steps, which is around 19 steps. Each step involves a count_zeros(n) which is O(log n) steps. So overall, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the code:\n\nBut in Python, for the code, the code is:\n\nRead m.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low =0\n    high =5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nThen:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m+1)\n    res = list(range(x, y))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nWait, but the output requires that for the first line, it's k (the number of values), then the values in increasing order.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' — which is first line 5, then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, when len(res) is printed, then the numbers. So for the first sample, len(res) is 5, then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, the code prints len(res) and then the numbers. But in the sample, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\". So the first line is the count, then the second line is the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, the code prints len(res) followed by the numbers. So for example, the code would print:\n\nprint(len(res))\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nWhich for the first sample would output:\n\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut the sample shows that the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' — which is two lines. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for m=5 is 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the answer is zero? The code would print 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, testing for m=6, the code would output 5 and the numbers 25-29.\n\nBut what about when m=24?\n\nLet me think. For m=24, the minimal x is 99 (count_zeros(99) is 24? Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5 =19, 99//25=3, 99//125=0. Total 22. No. Wait, that's not right. Wait 19+3=22. So not 24.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute for m=24.\n\nWait, let's find x = find_min_n(24). Let's compute count_zeros(100) is 20+4=24. So 100 is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=24. So x=100. count_zeros(100) is 24. Then y is find_min_n(25). Let's compute that.\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(101) is same as 100. count_zeros(104) is same. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25. So find_min_n(25) returns 105. So the numbers from 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers: 100, 101, 102, 103, 104.\n\nSo code would output 5 and those numbers.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: m=25. Let's see:\n\nx = find_min_n(25). The minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=25. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(105) is 25. So x=105. count_zeros(105) is 25. So yes.\n\ny is find_min_n(26). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(109) is 25. count_zeros(110) is 22 + 4 (110//5=22, 110//25=4, 110//125=0. 22+4=26. So find_min_n(26) returns 110. So the numbers are from 105 to 109. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nThus, code outputs 5 and those numbers.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about m=0? According to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so no need to handle.\n\nAnother edge case: m=100000. Let's see. But the code can handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: m=2. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(2) returns 10. Because count_zeros(10) is 2. Then find_min_n(3) returns 15. Because count_zeros(15) is 3. So the numbers from 10 to 14. 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for the case when m=0, but the code is not handling it. But since m is given as per input constraints, no problem.\n\nSo the code:\n\nNow, the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of such integers using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: We use binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that $ n! $ has at least $ m $ trailing zeros. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the range of possible values for $ n $.\n3. **Range Calculation**: Once we find the smallest $ n $ with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we then find the smallest $ n $ with $ m+1 $ trailing zeros. The integers between these two values (exclusive of the upper bound) are the valid solutions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    res = list(range(x, y))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that $ n! $ has at least `target` trailing zeros. The upper bound for the binary search is set to $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, which is a safe estimate based on the distribution of factors of 5.\n3. **Main Logic**: The main part of the code reads the input value $ m $, finds the smallest $ n $ with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, and checks if such an $ n $ exists. If it does, it then finds the smallest $ n $ with $ m+1 $ trailing zeros and determines the range of valid integers between these two values. The results are printed accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of integers using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large values of $ m $.",
