    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the factorial is divisible by 10, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization. But since there are usually more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s in the factors of the numbers up to n.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero. Let's call this function Z(n).\n\nThe problem is, given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m. Then output the count and the numbers sorted.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nLet me think about the properties of Z(n). The function Z(n) is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding a higher number can't decrease the count of 5s. So for example, when n increases by 1, Z(n) either stays the same or increases by 1 (if the new n is a multiple of 5, maybe more).\n\nWait, but when n is a multiple of higher powers of 5, like 25, then Z(n) increases by more than 1. For example, Z(24) is 4 (24/5=4.8 → 4, 24/25=0.96 → 0; total 4). Z(25) is 6 (25/5=5, 25/25=1, 25/125=0 → total 5+1=6). So between n=24 and 25, Z(n) increases by 2. Which means that for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Because when you go from 24 (Z=4) to 25 (Z=6), you skip 5. So for m=5, there's no solution. Therefore, the answer would be 0.\n\nBut in the sample input, for m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check:\n\nZ(5) = 1 (5/5=1). Z(6) is also 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2 → 1). Similarly for 7,8,9. Then Z(10) is 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0). So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So there are 5 numbers here.\n\nSo the key idea is that for some m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. However, for some m's, there are none.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Find the possible n's where Z(n) equals m.\n\nBut how to find them?\n\nFirst, we need to find the lower and upper bounds of n where Z(n) equals m.\n\nBut how? Let's think of binary search. Since Z(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, we can find the minimal n where Z(n) = m, and the maximal n where Z(n) = m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) would be the possible solutions. But wait, how do we find if such n exists?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, we can find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Then check if Z(n) equals m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of n's that give exactly m.\n\nBut how to find the range?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I find the first n where Z(n) = m. Then the next numbers may have the same count until the next multiple of 5. For example, for m=1, the first n is 5, and the next numbers up to 9 (since 10 adds another 5) will have Z(n) =1. So the count is 5 numbers.\n\nBut how to find the first and last n for a given m?\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, the possible n's must lie in the range [a, b], where a is the smallest n such that Z(n) = m, and b is the largest n such that Z(n) = m. The number of such n's is b - a + 1. But how to find a and b?\n\nBut how do I find if there exists any n such that Z(n) = m?\n\nLet me think. For example, if m is such that there is no n with Z(n) = m, then the answer is 0. Like m=5 in the case of 24 and 25.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Find the minimal n where Z(n) = m. If there is no such n, return 0.\n\n- Then find the maximum n where Z(n) = m. Then the numbers from min_n to max_n are all valid.\n\nBut how to find these values?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, we can find the lower and upper bounds using binary search.\n\nBut first, let's think about how to compute Z(n). Let's write a helper function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way.\n\nNow, for a given m, we can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this value low_n. Then check if count_zeros(low_n) == m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, we need to find the upper bound.\n\nWait, but how to find the upper bound? For example, the maximum n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's think: the next number after that will have count_zeros(n) = m+1 or higher.\n\nSo for example, for m=1, the upper bound is 9. Because count_zeros(9) is 1, but count_zeros(10) is 2.\n\nSo how to find the upper bound?\n\nWell, perhaps we can find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. Then the upper bound is that n minus 1.\n\nSo for example, for m=1, the first n where count_zeros(n) is 2 is 10. So upper bound is 9.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem could be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call it lower.\n\n2. Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. Call it upper.\n\n3. Then the numbers from lower to upper-1 are the possible n's. So the count is upper - lower.\n\nBut wait, how to find lower and upper?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the first occurrence of m, and then find the first occurrence of m+1, then the numbers between first occurrence and (first occurrence of m+1 -1) are the valid numbers.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of m?\n\nBut since the count_zeros function is non-decreasing, we can use binary search to find the first n where count_zeros(n) equals m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, to find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m. But how do I know if such n exists?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this x. Then check if count_zeros(x) is equal to m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, the first occurrence is x.\n\nBut then, the upper bound is the first occurrence of m+1 minus 1.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call it left.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(left) is equal to m. If not, then there are no solutions. Return 0.\n\n- Then find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call it right.\n\n- The numbers from left to right-1 are all the numbers that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nThus, the count is (right - left).\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m?\n\nThis can be done with binary search. Let's think about the binary search approach for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe lower bound for n is 0, upper bound can be 5*m. Because for n = 5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least 1, and there are m multiples of 5 in 5*m). Wait, but perhaps 5*m is too big. For example, for m=1, 5*1=5. count_zeros(5) is 1. For m=2, 5*2=10, count_zeros(10) is 2. So yes, 5*m is a safe upper bound. However, maybe there's a better upper bound. But for binary search purposes, even if it's a bit larger, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nSimilarly for the m+1 case.\n\nOnce we have left and right, the numbers between left and right-1 inclusive are the solutions.\n\nBut then, the count is right - left. For example, in the first sample input where m=1, left is 5 (count_zeros(5)=1), and for m+1=2, the minimal n is 10. So right is 10. Then right - left is 5, which is the count. And the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, for the given m, compute left = find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(left) == m. If not, then output 0.\n\nElse, compute right = find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nThen the numbers are from left to right-1 inclusive.\n\nThe count is right - left.\n\nBut how to implement the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m?\n\nLet me think about the binary search function.\n\nLet's write a helper function called find_min_n(target) which returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nHow to implement that?\n\nThe binary search can be between low=0 and high=5*target (or something like that). Because for n=5*target, count_zeros(n) is at least target. Because for example, each multiple of 5 contributes at least one. So 5*target has at least target multiples of 5. But actually, for example, target=5, 5*5=25. count_zeros(25) is 6 (5/5=5, 5/25=1, total 6). Which is more than target. So the upper bound can be 5*target. But perhaps even higher. But for binary search, we can set high to 5*target.\n\nWait, but for m=1, 5*m is 5, which is the correct value. For m=2, 5*2=10, which is correct. For m=6, 5*6=30. count_zeros(30) is 7 (30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). Which is more than 6. So the upper bound is 5*target, but the actual n may be less than that. So the binary search can proceed.\n\nSo the helper function:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for example, when target is 1, the loop starts with low=0, high=5. Let's see:\n\nInitially, low=0, high=5.\n\nmid = (0+5)//2 = 2. count_zeros(2) is 0 < 1 → so set low to 3.\n\nNow low=3, high=5. mid=4. count_zeros(4) is 0 < 1 → low becomes 5.\n\nNow low=5, high=5. Exit loop. return 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: target=6. Let's say we want to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\nLooking for n=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25.\n\nLet's see what the code would do. Let's say target is 6. high is 5*6=30.\n\nInitially low=0, high=30.\n\nmid is 15. count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). 3 <6 → set low=16.\n\nmid=(16+30)/2 = 23. count_zeros(23) is 4 (23//5=4, 23//25=0). Still less than 6. Set low=24.\n\nmid= (24+30)/2=27. count_zeros(27) is 5 (27//5=5, 27//25=1 → 5+1=6? Wait 27//5 is 5 (5*5=25, 27-25=2). 27//25 is 1. So total is 5+1=6. So count_zeros(27) is 6. So the condition is >= target (6). So high is set to 27.\n\nNow low is 24, high is 27. mid is (24+27)//2 = 25.5 → 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 (25//5=5, 25//25=1, 5+1=6). So >=6. high is set to 25. Now low=24, high=25. mid is 24.5 → 24.\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 (since 24//5=4, 24//25=0 → 4). So 4 <6. So set low to 25. Now low=25, high=25. return 25. Which is correct.\n\nSo the helper function works.\n\nOnce we have left = find_min_n(m), check if count_zeros(left) == m. If not, return 0. Else, find right = find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers are left ... right-1. So the count is right - left.\n\nSo for the sample input m=1:\n\nleft is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So okay. right is find_min_n(2) which is 10. So numbers from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother example, m=5. Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(5) returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's compute that.\n\nWhat is count_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 = 4. count_zeros(25) = 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So in this case, the answer is 0. Hence, output is 0.\n\nSo the code would check if count_zeros(left) == m. For m=5, left is 25, count_zeros(25)=6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nSo that's how it works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute left = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m → output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute right = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe numbers are from left to right-1 inclusive.\n\nso the count is right - left.\n\nthen output the count followed by the numbers.\n\nBut for large m (up to 1e5), how efficient is this?\n\nThe binary search for each find_min_n is O(log (5*m)), which is acceptable. For m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, log2(5e5) is around 19. So each binary search is about 20 steps. And each step involves a count_zeros(n) which is O(log n) steps. So overall, the time complexity is acceptable for Python even for m=1e5.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, implement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThen, implement find_min_n(target):\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for very large targets, 5*target could be very big. For example, m=1e5, 5*1e5=5e5. But even for that, the binary search is manageable.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead m from input. But the input is given as a list, but in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'] — but perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input says:\n\nInput\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a way to represent multiple test cases. But the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the user is supposed to read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer. But the sample input shows two cases, perhaps as two separate test cases. However, in the problem statement's example, the input is given as ['1', '5'], but that's probably a way to represent two test cases, but the actual code should read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is two test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. Maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement's example. But according to the problem statement, the code should read a single integer m from input. So the code should process one m per run.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows two examples. For example, the first input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut in the problem's actual code, the input is a single integer. So the code should read m from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code should read m as input, then process.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead m from input. For example:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nBut in the sample input, perhaps the user is to process multiple test cases. However, according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is to process one.\n\nBut in the problem's example, the first input is 1, output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' — which is the first case. The second input is 5, output is '0'.\n\nSo the code needs to process one m per run.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute left = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m → print 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute right = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from left to right-1 inclusive.\n\nSo the count is right - left.\n\nThen, output the count, followed by the numbers in order.\n\nBut for cases where right - left is zero? Well, that can't happen. Because if count_zeros(left) is m, then the right is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So the right is at least left +1. Because if count_zeros(left) is m, then count_zeros(left+1) could be m or m+1. But if it's m, then the right would be higher.\n\nBut in any case, the code would generate the correct numbers.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the code to generate the numbers, for example, if the count is k, then we need to output the numbers from left to right-1.\n\nBut how to generate them? For example, if left is 5 and right is 10, then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is a list from left to right-1.\n\nSo in Python, the list would be [i for i in range(left, right)].\n\nBut for large ranges, this could be a problem. For example, if m is 1, then the range is 5 to 9 (exclusive of 10), which is 5 elements. But for m=1e5, the range could be up to 5 numbers? Or more?\n\nWait, for example, when m is such that there are multiple n's. For example, when m is 24, then the numbers could be from 99 to 104 (assuming that count_zeros(99) is 24 and count_zeros(100) is 24, but count_zeros(105) is 25. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's compute count_zeros(100):\n\n100//5 = 20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0 → total 24.\n\ncount_zeros(101) is same as 100, since 101//5 is 20, etc. So numbers from 100 to 104 would have count_zeros of 24. Then count_zeros(105) is 25 (105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0 → 25).\n\nSo the right would be 105. So the numbers are 100-104 (5 numbers).\n\nSo the code would generate a list of numbers from left to right-1. So in code:\n\nnumbers = list(range(left, right))\n\nBut for large ranges, like if the range is 1e5 numbers, but in practice, how many numbers can there be?\n\nWell, since the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 or more when n increases. For example, for numbers not divisible by 5, the count_zeros(n) is same as count_zeros(n-1). So for numbers that are not multiples of 5, they can contribute to a range. However, when n is a multiple of 5, the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 or more.\n\nBut for the case where there's a range of numbers with same count_zeros(n), the length can be 4, 5, etc. For example, for m=24, the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. So 5 numbers.\n\nBut in general, the maximum possible number of n's for a given m is 5. Because when you have a multiple of 5, the count_zeros increases by 1 (if it's not a multiple of higher powers of 5). For example, n=5, 6,7,8,9 → 5 numbers. But if n is 25, then count_zeros(25) is 6, but count_zeros(24) is 4. So between 24 and 25, the count increases by 2. So for m=5, there's no solution.\n\nSo the possible number of n's for a given m is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Wait, why?\n\nBecause for the case where the first occurrence of m is at a number which is a multiple of 5, but not higher. For example, suppose m=6. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. Then numbers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 → count_zeros(n) is 6. Then 30 would be 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7. So the range is 5 numbers again.\n\nSo the number of n's is always between 0 and 5.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause the next occurrence of count_zeros(n) increasing is when n is a multiple of 5. So for the numbers between the first occurrence of m and the first occurrence of m+1, the numbers are from some n to n+4 (if the next multiple of 5 is 5 steps away). But if the first occurrence of m is at a number that is a multiple of higher power of 5, then the next occurrence of m+1 could be closer.\n\nBut regardless, the maximum number of n's for a given m is 5.\n\nSo in code, generating the list as range(left, right) is manageable even for large m.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut first, let's code the helper functions.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute left = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m → print 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute right = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe numbers are from left to right-1.\n\nSo, the code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nleft = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(left) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    right = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = right - left\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(left, right))))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. But the code would generate range(left, right) which is range(5,10) → [5,6,7,8,9]. So the code would print 5, then the numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut in the code, when we print the numbers, for example, when k is 5, the code prints '5' followed by the numbers. But in the sample output, it's printed as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the code would print the first line as k, then the second line as the numbers.\n\nBut the code as written would print:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nWhich would produce two lines, which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is given as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' — which is the same as two lines.\n\nBut for the case where k is zero, the code outputs 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? According to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nBut let's test for m=5.\n\nleft = find_min_n(5) → let's compute.\n\ntarget is 5.\n\nhigh is 5*5=25.\n\nbinary search:\n\nInitially low=0, high=25.\n\nmid=12 → count_zeros(12) is 2 (12//5=2, 12//25=0 → 2). <5 → low=13.\n\nmid= (13+25)/2=19. count_zeros(19) is 3 (19//5=3). <5 → low=20.\n\nmid=20+25//2=22.5 → 22. count_zeros(22) is 4 (22//5=4). <5 → low=23.\n\nmid=23+25//2= (23+25)/2=24. count_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). <5 → low=25.\n\nNow low=25, high=25. return 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nfind_min_n(6) is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 → yes.\n\nfind_min_n(7) is 25? No. Let's see.\n\ntarget=7.\n\nhigh is 5*7=35.\n\nWe need to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(25) is 6. So need to find higher.\n\nLet's see for n=25: 6.\n\nn=29: 29//5=5, 29//25=1 → total 6.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7. So the minimal n is 25? No. Wait, no. Because 25's count is 6. So the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7 is 25? No. Because count_zeros(25) is 6. So the binary search for target=7 would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nLet me run through the code for target=7.\n\nlow=0, high=35.\n\nmid=17 → count_zeros(17) is 3. <7 → low=18.\n\nmid= (18+35)/2 = 26.5 → 26. count_zeros(26) is 5 (26//5=5, 26//25=1 → 5+1=6? Wait 26//5 is 5. 26//25 is 1. So 5+1=6. Still <7 → low=27.\n\nmid= (27+35)/2=31. count_zeros(31) is 31//5=6, 31//25=1 → 7. So >=7. high=31.\n\nNow low=27, high=31. mid= (27+31)/2=29. count_zeros(29) is 5+1=6 <7 → low=30.\n\nmid= (30+31)/2=30.5 → 30. count_zeros(30) is 6 + 1 =7. So high=30. Now low=30, high=30. return 30.\n\nSo find_min_n(7) returns 30.\n\nSo for m=6, left is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). Then right is find_min_n(7) =30. So numbers from 25 to 29. That's 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works for that case.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m is >=1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when m is given, and the code runs, for example, m=5, the code outputs 0.\n\nNow, the code as written would output the numbers as a space-separated list. For example, for m=1, the code would generate range(5, 10) which is [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. So when we do range(left, right), it's from left to right-1 inclusive. Which is correct.\n\nBut for the code, when right is 10, range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut what about when the right is 0? Well, no. Because for m >=1, the code would have left being find_min_n(m) which is at least 5 (for m=1). So right would be higher.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, for the case when k is zero, the code prints 0. For example, when m=5, the code prints 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, testing the code with sample input:\n\nSample input 1: m=1 → output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Which is correct.\n\nSample input 2: m=5 → output is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6 → output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother test case: m=24 → left is 99 (count_zeros(99) is 24?), let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5 = 19, 99//25=3, 99//125=0 → total 22. Wait, no. Wait 19+3=22. Not 24. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate.\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 100//5 =20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0. Total 24. So for m=24, the left is find_min_n(24). Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(24) would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=24. Let's think:\n\nFor n=99: count_zeros(99) is 19 + 3 (from 99//25) = 22. For n=100, it's 20 +4=24. So the minimal n is 100. Then count_zeros(100) is 24. So the left is 100. Then find_min_n(25) is 105? Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0 → 25. So find_min_n(25) returns 105. So the numbers are from 100 to 104, which is 5 numbers. So the code would output 5 and the numbers 100, 101, 102, 103, 104.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut in the code, when the numbers are printed, for example, when k=5, the code prints the numbers as '5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut when k=0, it prints 0. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code may have an issue when m is very large. For example, m=1e5.\n\nBut the code uses 5*target as high. For target=1e5, 5*target=5e5. But for m=1e5, the code would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1e5. Which is possible.\n\nBut for very large m, the code may take longer. However, since the binary search is O(log (5*m)) steps, and each step is O(log n), it's manageable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nNow, the code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the range of such integers using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: Given the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zero count function, we use binary search to efficiently find the smallest integer `n` such that the count of trailing zeros is at least `m`. We then check if this count exactly matches `m`.\n3. **Range Calculation**: If a valid range exists, we determine the upper bound by finding the smallest integer where the trailing zero count exceeds `m`. The valid integers lie between these bounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nleft = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(left) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    right = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = right - left\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(left, right))))\n    else:\n        print()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by increasing powers of 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least the given target. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the possible values of `n`.\n3. **Main Logic**: The main part of the code reads the input value `m`, uses `find_min_n` to determine the lower bound of valid integers, checks if this bound is valid, and then determines the upper bound. The valid integers are then printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the required range of integers using binary search, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
