Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x, including those not present in the original cards.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. Then, the sum of the missing cards must be -S. The goal is to find the minimal number of cards needed to reach that sum, given that each card can contribute between -x and x.\n\nWait, right. Let's think: the total sum after adding the new cards must be zero. So the sum of the new cards must be equal to -S. Let me denote the required sum as target = -sum_of_found_cards.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards (each with value between -x and x) that sum up to target. But how?\n\nLet me think about how to find the minimal number of cards needed to reach a certain target sum. For example, if the target is T, then each card can contribute at most x. So the minimal number of cards would be ceiling(T / x), but wait, maybe not exactly. Because for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then the maximum per card is 2. So you need 3 cards (2+2+1). But wait, the sum can be achieved with 3 cards. But maybe there's a way to get it with fewer? No, because 2*2=4 <5. So 3 is the minimal.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the sum can be positive or negative. So perhaps the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if T is not zero. Wait, but what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed. So the minimal is zero.\n\nBut let's think again. Suppose T is some value. Let's take absolute value. Let's say the target is T. Then, the minimal number of cards is the minimal k such that k * x >= |T|. Because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value). So the minimal k is ceil( |T| / x ). But since each card can be positive or negative, but the sum must be exactly T. So for example, if T is 3 and x is 2, then the minimal k is 2 (since 2+1=3, but 1 is allowed as it's within x=2). Wait, but how do we know that there's a combination of k numbers (each between -x and x) that sum up to T?\n\nWait, the maximum possible sum for k cards is k*x. The minimum possible sum is -k*x. So if T is between -k*x and k*x, then it's possible. But since we want to reach exactly T, which is a specific value. So for example, if T is 3 and x is 2, then with k=2, the maximum sum is 4. So 3 is possible. How? 2 + 1 =3. So yes. So the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x). But wait, for example, if T is 4 and x is 2, then k=2 (2+2=4). So that's exactly 2. So the formula works here.\n\nAnother example: T is 5, x is 2. Then |T| is 5. Divided by x is 2.5, so ceil(2.5) is 3. So 3 cards. Which would be 2+2+1=5. So yes.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards needed is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if T is not zero. If T is zero, then zero cards are needed.\n\nWait, but what if T is 1 and x is 2. Then the minimal is 1. Because one card with 1. So yes, that's correct. So the formula seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 2 and x is 2. Then the minimal is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is: the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only when T is not zero. If T is zero, then zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards. Let's call it S.\n\n2. Compute T = -S. Because the sum of the new cards must be T.\n\n3. If T is zero, then answer is 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal k such that k * x >= |T|. Which is ceil( |T| / x )\n\nBut wait, let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the newly found ones) equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is a given maximum absolute value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum for the missing cards is the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is non-zero, determine the minimum number of cards required such that their sum can reach the target. This is done by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value of a card (x), and taking the ceiling of this division to ensure we cover any remainder.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        total = sum(arr)\n        target = -total\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        abs_target = abs(target)\n        min_cards = math.ceil(abs_target / x)\n        print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of cards, the maximum absolute value of a card, and the list of found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine the target sum needed from the missing cards.\n- **Target Check**: If the target sum is zero, no cards are needed, and the result is zero.\n- **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For non-zero targets, the minimum number of cards is determined by dividing the absolute value of the target by the maximum card value (x), using the ceiling function to ensure we account for any remainder, thus guaranteeing the sum can be achieved with the minimum number of cards.",
