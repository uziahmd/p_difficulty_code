Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me think. In a regular polygon, each interior angle can be calculated, but here the angle we're talking about isn't necessarily an interior angle. Wait, the problem says that v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides. So, for example, if we pick three vertices, the angle at v2 is formed by connecting v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So the angle between those two lines.\n\nSo, for a regular polygon, what's the measure of such an angle? Let's think about the regular n-gon. Let me recall that in a regular polygon, the central angle (the angle subtended at the center by one side) is 360/n degrees. Also, the interior angle of the polygon is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But how does that relate to the angle formed by three vertices?\n\nLet me consider a regular polygon with n sides. Suppose we pick three vertices v1, v2, v3. Let's assume that they are arranged in order around the polygon. For example, v1 and v3 are k steps away from v2 along the perimeter. Wait, maybe the number of edges between v2 and v1 and between v2 and v3 determines the angle. For instance, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the angle would be the interior angle of the polygon. But if they are further apart, the angle would change.\n\nWait, let's take the case of a square (n=4). If we take vertices 1, 2, 3: the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. If we take vertices 1, 2, 4: then the angle at 2 is 45 degrees. Because connecting 2 to 1 and 2 to 4 forms a diagonal, which splits the square into triangles. So the angle there is 45 degrees. So the angle depends on how many steps between the vertices.\n\nSo, perhaps for a regular n-gon, the angle at v2 when you have k steps between v2 and v1, and m steps between v2 and v3 (but since the polygon is regular, maybe it's symmetric, so perhaps we can assume that the number of steps between v2 and v1 is the same as between v2 and v3, but in opposite directions? Or maybe the total number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon is some value.)\n\nAlternatively, think of the angle formed by three points on a circle (since regular polygons are inscribed in a circle). The central angles would be important here. Let me think about the inscribed angle theorem. The angle at v2 would depend on the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, in a circle, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that subtended at the circumference. So, if the arc between v1 and v3 is θ degrees, then the angle at v2 (which is on the circumference) would be θ/2. But wait, that's only if v2 is on the circumference and the arc is opposite to the angle. Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me imagine a regular polygon inscribed in a circle. Let's suppose that the three points v1, v2, v3 are on the circumference. The angle at v2 is formed by the lines v2v1 and v2v3. The measure of this angle depends on the arcs between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. Wait, no. Let me think of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Let me denote that arc as α. Then, the angle at v2 would be half of α. Because according to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle formed at a point on the circumference is half the measure of the arc that it subtends. So if the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is α degrees, then the angle at v2 is α/2 degrees.\n\nBut how do I compute α? Well, in a regular polygon, each side corresponds to an arc of 360/n degrees. So, if between v1 and v3 there are k steps (i.e., k edges) along the arc that doesn't contain v2, then the arc length is k * (360/n) degrees. Therefore, the angle at v2 would be (k * 360 / n) / 2 = k * 180 / n degrees. Wait, but this seems to suggest that the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc.\n\nBut how do we determine k? Let's say that in the polygon, the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2 is k. Since the polygon is regular, the number of steps between v1 and v3 can be determined based on their positions.\n\nBut for the angle at v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 must be such that when you connect v1 to v2 to v3, the angle at v2 is formed. So, for example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the arc between them (not containing v2) would be (n-2) steps? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take the square example. Let's take vertices 1, 2, 4. The arc between 1 and 4 that does not pass through 2 is two edges (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4? No, that's passing through 2. Wait, the arc that does not contain v2 (which is 2) would be from 1 to 4 going the other way around the square. So in a square, the arc from 1 to 4 not passing through 2 would be just one edge (since the square has four vertices, the arc between 1 and 4 can be either 3 edges (passing through 2 and 3) or one edge (passing through 4? Wait, no. Wait, the square's vertices are arranged clockwise as 1, 2, 3, 4. So between 1 and 4, the arc that does not contain 2 would be the direct edge from 1 to 4? No, because that's not part of the square. Wait, the square's edges are between consecutive vertices. So the arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain 2 is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 via 3, which is two edges (1-2-3-4? No, that includes 2. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to think in terms of steps between the points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is equal to (n - k), where k is the number of steps between them along the arc that contains v2. Wait, perhaps I need to find for any three points, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Let me think of the square example again. Suppose we have points 1, 2, 4. The arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain 2 is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 through 3. That's two edges (from 1 to 2 is one step, but that's not part of this arc. Wait, maybe the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 would be the arc that passes through 3. So that's two steps: from 1 to 4 via 3 is one step (if the square is considered as a circle, then between 1 and 4, the arc that doesn't pass through 2 would be the shorter arc? Well, in a square, the arc between 1 and 4 is either two steps (1-2-3-4?) No, that's three steps. Wait, the square has four vertices. The arc from 1 to 4 can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise. The clockwise arc from 1 to 4 is three edges (1→2→3→4). The counter-clockwise arc is one edge (1→4?), but that's not a direct edge. Oh right, the edges are only between consecutive vertices. So the arc from 1 to 4 that doesn't pass through 2 would be the arc that goes counter-clockwise from 1 to 4, which is one step? But that's not possible because there's no edge between 1 and 4. So perhaps the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is two steps (like 1→4 is not connected directly, but maybe the arc is 1→n→...? Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the general case.\n\nLet me think of the regular n-gon inscribed in a circle. Let me fix v2 as the vertex where the angle is formed. Then, v1 and v3 are two other vertices. Let me imagine that between v2 and v1, there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3, there are m steps counter-clockwise. Wait, but perhaps the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is (n - (k + m + 1))? Not sure. Alternatively, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2 is (n - d), where d is the minimal number of steps between them along the arc that contains v2. \n\nAlternatively, the key idea here is that for any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Let me denote this number as k. Then, the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. Wait, earlier example with square: when v1 is 1, v2 is 2, v3 is 4. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 through 3. How many steps is that? From 1 to 3 is two steps (1→2→3?), but that's passing through v2. Wait, no. If v2 is 2, then the arc that doesn't contain v2 would be from 1 to 4 via 3. The number of steps between 1 and 4 along that arc is 2 steps (1→4 is not possible, but perhaps the arc is 1→n→...? Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me look for a formula for the angle. Suppose that in a regular polygon with n sides, we choose three vertices such that between v2 and v1 there are i steps in one direction, and between v2 and v3 there are j steps in the other direction. Then, the angle at v2 would be determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. The number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n - (i + j + 1))? Or something like that. Wait, for example, in a square (n=4), if i=1 (from v2 to v1 is one step clockwise), and j=1 (from v2 to v3 is one step counter-clockwise), then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be (n - (i + j + 1))? Let's see: i=1, j=1. Then n - (1+1 + 1) = 4 - 3 = 1. But in that case, the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 step? Which would be 1 * 360 /4 = 90 degrees. Then angle at v2 would be half that, which is 45 degrees. Which matches the example. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo the formula would be that the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. And k equals (n - (i + j + 1))? Or perhaps k = (n - (i + j + 1))? Wait, in the square example, when i=1, j=1, then k is 4 - (1+1 + 1) = 1. Which gives angle 1*180 /4 = 45 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nBut how do i and j relate to the steps? Let me think. i is the number of steps between v2 and v1 in one direction, and j is the steps between v2 and v3 in the other direction. Then, the total steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (i + j). So the arc that does not contain v2 would be (n - (i + j)) steps. Wait, because the total steps around the polygon is n. So the arc that contains v2 is (i + j) steps, so the other arc is (n - (i + j)) steps. But then, the angle at v2 is (arc_length / 2) degrees. The arc_length is (n - (i + j)) * (360/n) degrees. Then the angle at v2 is (arc_length) / 2 = [ (n - (i + j)) * 360 /n ] / 2 = (n - i -j) * 180 /n degrees.\n\nBut how do i and j relate? Because for the angle to be formed, v1 and v3 must be on different sides of v2. So, for example, if you have v1 and v3 on the same side of v2, then the arc that does not contain v2 would be larger. But perhaps the formula still holds.\n\nBut regardless of how i and j are chosen, the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2. Let me denote that number as k. Then, the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nBut how do I find k for all possible triplets? Well, for a regular polygon, the possible values of k can be from 1 to n-2. Because if k is 1, then the angle is 180/n degrees. For example, in a square, that would be 45 degrees. If k is 2, then angle is 2*180/4=90 degrees, which is the interior angle. Wait, but for the square, the interior angle is 90 degrees. So that makes sense. So for the interior angle, the arc that doesn't contain v2 is 2 steps. Which would be the case when v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 on either side. For example, in square, vertices 1, 2, 3. The arc between 1 and 3 that doesn't contain 2 is 2 steps (from 1 to 4 to 3?), which would be 2 steps. So k=2, angle is 2*180/4=90 degrees, which is correct.\n\nSo, the key insight is that for any triplet, the angle at v2 is determined by k, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2. And k can vary between 1 and (n-2). Because for example, if k is n-2, then the arc is (n-2) steps, which would mean that the angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. For example, in a triangle (n=3), k can be 1. The angle is 1*180/3 = 60 degrees, which is correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the value of k (between 1 and n-2) such that the angle (k * 180 /n) is as close as possible to a. Once we find the optimal k, we can then construct a triplet of vertices that corresponds to that k.\n\nSo the first step is to compute for each possible k (from 1 to n-2), the angle theta = k * 180 /n, and find the k that minimizes |theta - a|.\n\nOnce we find the best k, we need to find any triplet of vertices that corresponds to this k. How to construct such triplet?\n\nFor example, given k, we can choose v2 as any vertex, say vertex 2. Then, we need to choose v1 and v3 such that the arc between them (not containing v2) has k steps. How?\n\nWell, for a given k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is k. So, if we fix v2 as vertex 2, then v1 and v3 should be positioned such that between them along the arc not containing v2, there are k steps.\n\nBut how to find such positions? Let's think of the polygon as a circle. For example, if v2 is at position 2, then the arc that does not contain v2 is the arc that goes from v1 to v3 passing through the other side of the circle. So, for example, if k is 1, then v1 and v3 are adjacent on that arc. So, for example, if we choose v2 as 2, then v1 could be 1 and v3 could be 3. Wait, no. Wait, if v1 is 1 and v3 is 3, then the arc between them that does not contain v2 (which is 2) would be the arc from 1 to 3 passing through the other side of the polygon. For n=4, that would be 1→4→3. Which is two steps. So k would be 2. Which would give angle 2*180/4=90 degrees. Which is the interior angle. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to find two vertices that are k steps apart along the arc that does not include v2. How can I arrange that? Let's think of the following approach: for a given k, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is k steps. Therefore, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (n - k) steps. Because the total steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon is n steps (since it's a circle), but the arc that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. So, the distance between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n -k) steps. Which implies that between v1 and v3, there are (n -k) steps when passing through v2.\n\nBut how to find v1 and v3? Well, for example, if we fix v2 as vertex 1, then v1 could be vertex 2, and v3 could be vertex (2 + (n -k)) mod n? Not sure. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake n=4, k=1. The desired angle is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. How to find three vertices where the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step. Let's say v2 is 2. Then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing 2 is 1 step. So, for example, v1 could be 1 and v3 could be 4. The arc between 1 and 4 not containing 2 is 1 step (assuming the polygon is 1-2-3-4-1). Wait, the arc from 1 to 4 not containing 2 would be the path 1 → 4, but that's not a direct edge. However, the steps between 1 and 4 along that arc is 1 step? No, the arc from 1 to 4 that doesn't pass through 2 is the arc going the other way around. For n=4, the arc from 1 to 4 that doesn't pass through 2 is 1 step (since the other direction is from 1 to 4 directly, but in the polygon, that's not a direct edge. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any k, we can choose v2 as vertex 1, and then choose v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + (n -k)) mod n? Or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: For a given k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. So, if we fix v2 as vertex 1, then we can select v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + (n -k - 1)) mod n. Wait, perhaps I need to think of the positions of v1 and v3 such that between them along the arc containing v2, there are (n -k) steps. That would mean that the distance between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n -k) steps. Which implies that they are (n -k) steps apart when moving through v2.\n\nFor example, in the case where n=4, k=1, then (n -k) = 3. So the distance between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 (vertex 1) is 3 steps. Let's choose v2 as vertex 1. Then, if v1 is vertex 2, then moving 3 steps along the arc containing v2 (vertex 1) would reach vertex 2 + 3 steps. Wait, the arc containing v2 is the arc that goes through v2. So, for example, if v1 is vertex 2 and v3 is vertex 2 + (n -k) steps. Let me think of the steps as moving clockwise. Starting from v1 (vertex 2), moving clockwise (n -k) steps would reach v3. For n=4, k=1, (n -k) is 3 steps. So starting from 2, moving 3 steps clockwise: 2 → 3 → 4 → 1. So v3 is vertex 1. But that's v2. Which is not allowed. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the distance between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 as (n -k) steps. So, the distance between them is (n -k) steps. Which implies that the number of steps between v1 and v3 is (n -k) steps when moving through v2. So, if v2 is in between them, then the steps between v1 and v3 would be (steps from v1 to v2) + (steps from v2 to v3) = (i) + (j) = (n -k) steps. And earlier, we had that the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nSo, for example, if I want to choose v1 and v3 such that between them along the arc containing v2, there are (n -k) steps, then I can choose v1 as v2 + 1, and v3 as v2 + (n -k) steps. But this depends on how the vertices are numbered.\n\nLet me take an example. Let's say n=4, k=1. Then (n -k) = 3. So the steps between v1 and v3 along the arc containing v2 is 3 steps. Let's choose v2 as 2. Then, if v1 is 1 (one step before v2), and v3 is 2 + (3 steps) = 2 + 3 steps clockwise. Let's see:\n\nIn a square, vertices are 1, 2, 3, 4. Starting at 2, moving 3 steps clockwise: 2→3→4→1. So v3 is 1. So the triplet would be v1=1, v2=2, v3=1. But that's invalid because v1 and v3 are the same. Oh right, that's not allowed. So perhaps I need to adjust this.\n\nWait, maybe the steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (n -k) steps, but v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2. For example, if v2 is fixed, then v1 is i steps in one direction, and v3 is j steps in the other direction, such that i + j = (n -k). Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is i + j steps, which equals (n -k). So, for example, if I set i=1 and j = (n -k -1), then the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. Then, the arc that does not contain v2 is k steps.\n\nSo, to construct such a triplet, I can choose v2 as any vertex (say, vertex 1), then choose v1 as vertex 2 (i=1 step from v2), and v3 as vertex (v2 + (n -k -1) + 1) mod n. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the positions as follows: for a given k, the minimal steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. To ensure that v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2, we can choose v1 as v2 + 1, and v3 as v2 - (n -k -1) ?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the positions for a given k. Let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as (n -k + 1). Let's test this with the example where n=4, k=1. Then n -k +1 = 4-1+1=4. So v3 is 4. So the triplet is 2,1,4. Which is valid. The angle here is 45 degrees, which is correct. Another example: n=4, k=2. Then n-k+1=4-2+1=3. So v3 is 3. The triplet is 2,1,3. The angle is 2*180/4=90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nYes, that seems to work. So the formula for choosing v1 and v3 when v2 is fixed as 1 is: v1 is 2, v3 is (n -k + 1). But why?\n\nBecause the steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 (vertex 1) is (steps from 2 to 1) + (steps from 1 to v3). Wait, if v3 is (n -k + 1), then for example, in the case where n=4, k=1, v3 is 4. The steps from 2 to 1 is 1 step (counter-clockwise?), and steps from 1 to 4 is 3 steps clockwise. But adding those steps would be 1 + 3 = 4 steps, which is n steps. Which doesn't match (n -k) steps. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up directions here.\n\nAlternatively, the steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. Let me think of the positions for v1 and v3. For example, when v2 is 1, and v1 is 2, then to get the arc containing v2 (which is 1) between v1 and v3, we need to have v3 be located (n -k -1) steps away from v2 in the opposite direction. For example, in n=4, k=1, n-k-1 is 4-1-1=2. So from v2 (1), moving 2 steps counter-clockwise (which would be to vertex 4, then 3?), but that's getting messy.\n\nAlternatively, for any k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc containing v2 is (n -k) steps. So if I choose v1 as v2 + 1 (clockwise), then v3 should be v2 - (n -k) steps (counter-clockwise). But since the numbering is cyclic, this can be done modulo n.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. For example, for any k, the triplet can be constructed as follows: v2 is 1, v1 is 2, and v3 is (2 + (n -k)) mod n. Wait, let's test this for n=4, k=1. Then (2 + (4-1)) mod 4 = (2+3) mod4=5 mod4=1. Which would make v3=1, which is v2. That's invalid.\n\nHmm, not working. Let's think again.\n\nWe need to select v1 and v3 such that the arc between them that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. So, for example, in the case of n=4, k=1, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 4-1=3 steps. So, if v2 is 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that contains 1 is 3 steps. Let's choose v1 as 2 (adjacent to v2), then v3 must be located 3 steps away from v1 along the arc that contains v2. Starting at v1 (2), moving 3 steps along the arc that contains v2 (1). The steps would be 2 → 3 →4 →1. So v3 is 1. Which is v2 again. Not allowed.\n\nSo that approach doesn't work. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, perhaps I need to ensure that the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is exactly (n -k) steps, but also that v1 and v3 are distinct from v2. So, for example, in the case where n=4, k=1, (n -k) is 3 steps. So the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 3 steps. Let me choose v1 as 4 and v3 as 2. The arc from 4 to 2 that contains v2 (1) is 4 → 1 → 2, which is 2 steps. No, that's not 3 steps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should choose v1 and v3 such that they are on opposite sides of v2. For example, if v2 is 1, then v1 is 2 (one step clockwise), and v3 is (n -k) steps counter-clockwise from v2. For n=4, k=1, n-k=3. So v3 is 3 steps counter-clockwise from 1. Counter-clockwise steps from 1 would be 1 →4 →3 →2. So after 3 steps, we reach 2. So v3 is 2, which is same as v1. No good.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps there's another approach. Since the polygon is regular and symmetric, for any k, there exists a triplet of vertices that can be constructed as follows: choose v2 as vertex 1, v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + k) mod n? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe angle is determined by k steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2. So for example, in the case of n=4, k=1, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step. Let's imagine that v2 is vertex 2. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step. So, for example, v1 could be vertex 1 and v3 could be vertex 4. The arc between them not containing 2 is 1 step (from 1 to 4?), but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the angle is (k * (n-2) * 180 ) / (n^2) ? No, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should refer back to the formula. The angle is (k * 180) /n degrees. So for any k between 1 and n-2, the angle can be computed. Once the optimal k is found, the triplet can be constructed by choosing v2 as any vertex, then choosing v1 and v3 such that between them along the arc not containing v2, there are k steps.\n\nHow to find such v1 and v3? Let's pick v2 as vertex 1. Then, to have k steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2, we can choose v1 as vertex 2 and v3 as vertex (2 + k) mod n? No, that might not work. For example, in n=4, k=1, then 2 +1=3. So v3 is 3. The arc between v1 (2) and v3 (3) not containing v2 (1) would be the arc that goes from 2 to 3, which is one step. But that arc contains v2 (1)? No, the arc from 2 to 3 is adjacent, and doesn't contain v2 (1). Wait, if v2 is 1, then the arc between v1=2 and v3=3 that doesn't contain v2 is the direct edge between them. That's one step. So k=1. Then the angle is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. Which is correct. So in this case, the triplet would be 2,1,3. Wait, no. The angle is at v2 (1), with v1=2 and v3=3. So the triplet is 2 1 3. Which is valid. And that's one of the examples given in the note for input 4 67, where the output was 2 1 3. So this seems to work.\n\nWait, in this case, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step. So that's correct. So for this example, the triplet is 2, 1, 3. Which is valid. So the formula for constructing the triplet is: choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 2 + k. But wait, 2 +k for n=4, k=1: 2+1=3. Which is correct. For n=4, k=2, v3 is 2+2=4. Then the arc between v1=2 and v3=4 that does not contain v2=1 is the arc from 2 to 4 passing through 3. Which is two steps. So the angle would be 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct. So the triplet is 2 1 4. Which is another valid option.\n\nSo this seems to work. So the general approach is: for a given k, choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k. But wait, what if 2 +k exceeds n? For example, if n=5, k=3. 2+3=5, which is okay. If k=4, then 2+4=6 mod 5 is 1. Which would be v3=1, but that's v2. Which is invalid. So we need to ensure that 2 +k <=n, or adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, no. Because k ranges from 1 to n-2. So for example, when n=5, k can be up to 3. So 2+3=5 which is valid. For k=3, v3 is 5. The arc between v1=2 and v3=5 not containing v2=1 would be steps from 2 to 5. Let's see: the arc that doesn't contain v2 (1) would be the arc going from 2 →3→4→5, which is 3 steps. Which is k=3. So the angle is 3 * 180 /5 = 108 degrees. Correct.\n\nBut what if k is larger than n-2? Well, since k is limited to 1 ≤k ≤n-2, that's not possible. So for any k in that range, 2 +k is at most 2 + (n-2) =n. Which is valid. So the triplet is 2, 1, 2 +k. Which gives valid vertices.\n\nSo this seems to be a valid way to construct the triplet once we know the optimal k. So the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Compute for each possible k (from 1 to n-2) the angle theta = k * 180 /n.\n\n2. Find the k that minimizes |theta -a|. If multiple k's have the same minimal difference, choose any.\n\n3. Once k is determined, output the triplet 2, 1, 2 +k. Or other triplets that correspond to this k.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows any triplet that achieves the minimal difference. So even if there are multiple possible k's, we need to find the one with minimal difference, and then output any triplet corresponding to it",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the closest possible angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of steps between those vertices along the arc that does not include the vertex where the angle is formed. This angle can be computed using the formula: `angle = k * 180 / n`, where `k` is the number of steps between the two vertices along the arc not containing the vertex of the angle.\n\n2. **Finding Optimal k**: For each possible value of `k` (from 1 to n-2), compute the corresponding angle and determine which value of `k` gives the angle closest to the given angle `a`.\n\n3. **Constructing the Triplet**: Once the optimal `k` is found, construct the triplet of vertices. A simple way to do this is to fix one vertex as the second vertex (v2), and then choose the other two vertices such that they are `k` steps apart along the arc not containing v2.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n\n    # Find the best k\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n\n    for k in range(1, n - 1):\n        theta = k * 180.0 / n\n        diff = abs(theta - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k?

This ensures that the angle formed at vertex `v2` is as close as possible to the target angle `a`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required vertices using geometric properties of regular polygons, ensuring an optimal solution with minimal computational complexity.",
