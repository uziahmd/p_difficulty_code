They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if there's a valid assignment of mushroom counts to each lawn based on the given edges with their GCD and LCM values. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Each edge between two lawns (nodes) has a GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts of those two nodes. So for each edge (u, v), we know that GCD(a_u, a_v) = g and LCM(a_u, a_v) = l. Also, since GCD * LCM = a_u * a_v, we can derive that a_u * a_v = g * l. But also, since GCD is the greatest common divisor, both a_u and a_v must be multiples of g. Let me think: if the GCD is g, then a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime. Then the LCM would be g*x*y. So for the given LCM l, we have g * x * y = l. Which implies that x * y = l/g. Also, since x and y are coprime, this product must be such that x and y are coprime. Therefore, for each edge, l must be divisible by g. If not, it's impossible. So first check: for every edge, l must be divisible by g. Otherwise, answer is NO.\n\nSo the first step is to check if for any edge, the LCM is not divisible by the GCD. If any such case exists, output NO.\n\nThen, the next step is to model the relationships between the nodes. Since each node's value is connected via these constraints, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined based on the edges. However, since the edges connect pairs of nodes, and the constraints are between pairs, this seems like a problem that can be modeled using a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure, but with more constraints. Alternatively, maybe we can model it as a graph where each connected component must satisfy certain conditions, and assign values accordingly.\n\nWait, but how do we assign the actual values? Let's think. For each connected component in the graph, we need to assign values to the nodes such that all the edges' constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think of each edge as defining a relationship between two nodes. For example, for an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we have that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime and x*y = l/g. Let me denote k = l/g. So x * y = k, and gcd(x, y) = 1.\n\nBut since x and y are coprime, each must be a divisor of k, and their product is k. So for example, if k is 6, possible pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). But since the order depends on which node is u and which is v, but the actual values can be assigned accordingly.\n\nBut how do we propagate these constraints across the entire graph?\n\nThis seems like a problem where each node's value is determined relative to others. For example, if we have a chain of nodes connected by edges, each with their own GCD and LCM constraints, we need to ensure that all the constraints are compatible.\n\nThis feels similar to building a system of equations where each equation relates two variables, but with multiplicative factors and coprimality constraints.\n\nAn idea: for each connected component, we can pick a root node and assign it a value, then propagate the constraints through the graph. However, the problem is that the constraints might not allow such a propagation, or may require certain conditions to be met.\n\nAlternatively, think of each node's value as being a multiple of some base value, and the relations between nodes as ratios. But since GCD and LCM are involved, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: For each edge (u, v), we have that a_u and a_v must be multiples of g. Let me consider that each node's value is a multiple of the GCD of its edges. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node has a value that's a multiple of some base, and for each edge, we can assign the ratio between the two nodes. But how?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. Then, as mentioned before, a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime and x * y = l/g. Let me call this value k = l/g. So x and y are coprime factors of k.\n\nSo for this edge, the ratio between a_u and a_v is x/y or y/x. But since x and y are coprime, this ratio is in reduced terms.\n\nBut how can we model this across the entire graph? For example, if u is connected to v and v is connected to w, then the constraints between u and v and between v and w must be compatible.\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to assign variables to each node, such that for each edge, the variables satisfy the above conditions. But how to model this?\n\nAnother thought: since the GCD and LCM are given, perhaps the values of the nodes are determined up to multiplication by some factors, but constrained by the coprimality conditions. However, this might not be straightforward.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph where each node has a value, and for each edge, the pair of values must satisfy the given GCD and LCM. Let me think of building a system where each node's value is a multiple of some base value, and the relations between nodes are determined by the edges.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. For example, if we can assign a value to a node, then for each neighbor, we can compute the possible values based on the edge's constraints.\n\nThis sounds like a BFS or DFS approach where we assign values as we traverse the graph, ensuring that the constraints are met.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check for each edge if LCM is divisible by GCD. If not, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component in the graph, assign values to the nodes. Let's proceed with BFS/DFS.\n\n3. For each connected component, pick a starting node and assign it a value. Then, for each adjacent node, based on the edge's constraints, determine the possible value of that node. However, since the starting node's value is arbitrary (but must satisfy all constraints), perhaps we need to find a way to assign the value correctly.\n\nWait, but the value of the starting node is not arbitrary. Because for each edge, the product of the two nodes' values is equal to GCD * LCM. So for example, if I have a node u with value a, and an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, then a * b = g*l, where b is the value of v. But also, GCD(a, b) = g. So once we fix a, then b is determined as (g*l)/a. However, we must also check that GCD(a, (g*l)/a) equals g. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a and b such that GCD(a, b) = g and LCM(a, b) = l. Then, since a * b = g*l. So if I know a, then b is (g*l)/a. However, this would only be valid if GCD(a, (g*l)/a) = g. But how can I ensure that?\n\nWait, but given that the edge's GCD and LCM are given, and that the initial check (l % g == 0) is passed, then for any a that is a multiple of g, and such that (g*l)/a is also a multiple of g, then the GCD will be g. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nLet me take a concrete example. Suppose the edge has GCD 2 and LCM 12. Then, the product is 24. So possible pairs (a, b) are (2, 12), (4, 6), (6, 4), (12, 2). The GCD of each pair is 2, and LCM is 12. So if I set a to be 2, then b is 12. If I set a to be 4, then b is 6. But if a is 6, then b is 4. So for any a that is a divisor of 24 and a multiple of 2, and (g*l)/a is also a multiple of 2, then the GCD will be 2?\n\nWait, but suppose a is 2, then b is 12. GCD(2, 12) is 2. If a is 4, GCD(4, 6) is 2. If a is 6, same thing. But if a is 8, then (g*l)/a = 24/8=3, which is not a multiple of 2. So in that case, the GCD of 8 and 3 is 1, not 2. So this would violate the GCD constraint.\n\nTherefore, the value of a must be such that when multiplied by b, gives g*l, and that GCD(a, b) = g. How can we ensure that?\n\nWell, since a must be a multiple of g. Let me write a = g * x, and b = g * y. Then, since GCD(a, b) = g * GCD(x, y) = g. Therefore, GCD(x, y) must be 1. Also, LCM(a, b) = g * x * y = l. Therefore, x * y = l / g. So x and y are coprime, and their product is k = l/g.\n\nSo, given that, for the edge between u and v, once we assign a value to u (say, a_u = g * x), then a_v must be g * y where x * y = k and GCD(x, y) = 1. But since x and y are coprime, once x is determined, y is determined as k/x. But since x and y must be coprime, x must be a divisor of k, and y must be k/x, and they must be coprime.\n\nBut how do we choose x and y for the edge? Well, the problem allows any valid assignment. So during the traversal, when we assign a value to a node, we can determine the value of the adjacent node based on the edge's constraints.\n\nBut how do we start? Let's say we have a connected component. Let's pick a starting node and assign it a value. However, the value of the starting node must be such that for each edge connected to it, the adjacent nodes' values can be computed properly.\n\nBut here's the problem: the starting node's value isn't fixed. For example, in a single edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, there are multiple possibilities. For instance, u could be g * x and v could be g * y, with x * y = k and coprime. So x can be any divisor of k, and y = k/x. But how do we choose x? Well, perhaps during the traversal, we can assign the value of the starting node as g * x, and then for each adjacent node, compute their value based on the edge's constraints. But how to ensure that the assignments are consistent across the entire component?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. For example, if we assign a value to a node, then for each neighbor, we can compute their value based on the edge's constraints. However, if during traversal, we reach a node that already has a value assigned, we need to check if the new computed value matches the existing one. If not, then the assignment is invalid.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- For each connected component:\n\n   - Choose a starting node. Assign it a value. But what value?\n\n   - However, the starting node's value is not arbitrary. It must be a multiple of g for each edge connected to it. Wait, but if the node is part of multiple edges, each with their own GCDs. How to ensure that the starting node's value is compatible with all of them?\n\n   This seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to model the relationships between the nodes as a graph where each node's value is a multiple of some base, and the ratios between nodes are determined by the edges.\n\nLet me think again. Let's model the problem with variables. For each node u, let a_u be the number of mushrooms. For each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we have:\n\na_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime and x * y = l/g.\n\nBut x and y are determined once we know either a_u or a_v. For example, if we know a_u, then a_v = (g * l) / a_u. However, since a_u must be a multiple of g, and (g*l) / a_u must also be a multiple of g. Let me check:\n\nIf a_u is a multiple of g, then let's say a_u = g * x. Then a_v = (g*l)/(g*x) ) = l/(x). But since l = g * (x * y), substituting gives a_v = (g * x * y) / x = g * y. Which is correct. So for a_v to be a multiple of g, l must be divisible by x. But since l = g * k, where k = x * y. So l is divisible by x. So yes, a_v will be a multiple of g. Therefore, as long as the initial assignment of a_u is a multiple of g, then a_v will be a multiple of g.\n\nBut how do we choose the initial value for a_u? Well, perhaps the initial value can be set as g multiplied by some factor that is compatible with the rest of the component. But how?\n\nLet me think of the connected component as a graph where each node's value is determined by the product of the GCD and LCM values along the path from the starting node. For example, if we have a path u - v - w, and for each edge, we can express the value of each node in terms of the previous ones.\n\nBut how? Let's take the first example. Suppose we have a connected component with nodes u and v connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l. Let's assign a value to u. Let's say a_u = g * x. Then a_v = (g*l)/a_u = (g*l)/(g*x) ) = l/x. But since l = g * (x * y), then l/x = g * y. So a_v is g * y. Now, if there's another edge from v to w with GCD g' and LCM l', then a_v must be a multiple of g', and a_w is determined as (g'*l') / a_v.\n\nBut how can we choose x such that a_v is compatible with other edges connected to v?\n\nThis suggests that the choice of x for the initial node affects the possibility of the rest of the component being valid. Therefore, perhaps the problem requires that the entire component forms a consistent system of equations, and that there's a way to assign the variables.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: For each connected component, we can model the relationships between nodes as a graph where each edge defines a ratio between the nodes. However, since the ratio is (a_u/a_v) = x/y, which is determined by the edge's parameters, but x and y are coprime. But since x * y = k = l/g, then the ratio between a_u and a_v is x/y, and since x and y are coprime, this ratio is in reduced terms.\n\nBut how can we represent this ratio in terms of the nodes? For example, if we have a_u / a_v = x/y, then a_u = (x/y) * a_v. However, since a_u and a_v are integers, this ratio must be rational.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to another. For example, if we have a tree structure, we can assign values based on the edges. However, cycles in the graph could introduce constraints that must be checked.\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a graph where each node has a value that is a multiple of the GCD of its edges. Then, for each edge, the product of the two nodes' values is equal to GCD * LCM. However, this seems like a system of equations that must be solved.\n\nBut solving such a system for general graphs seems challenging. However, considering that the graph is connected, perhaps we can assign values in a BFS manner, ensuring consistency.\n\nHere's a possible algorithm:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   - Choose a starting node. Assign it a value. What value? Well, since the value must be a multiple of the GCD of all edges connected to it. But how to determine that?\n\nWait, the starting node can have any value that is compatible with all edges connected to it. However, without knowing the other nodes' values, this seems impossible. So perhaps the way to proceed is to assign the starting node a value based on the first edge it's involved in.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the first edge in the component. Suppose the component has a single edge between u and v. Then, for that edge, the possible pairs are (g * x, g * y) where x * y = k and x and y are coprime. So there are multiple possibilities. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose any of them. For example, assign u as g * x and v as g * y.\n\nBut how to choose x and y? Well, perhaps x can be 1, and y = k. Then, the values would be g and g*k. Or vice versa. However, this may not work if there are other edges connected to u or v. But in the case of a single edge, it's possible.\n\nSo during the BFS traversal, when we visit a node for the first time, we can assign it a value based on the edge from the parent node. For example, if we have a parent node with a known value, then for the current node, we can compute its value based on the edge's constraints.\n\nThis suggests that the algorithm can be implemented with BFS or DFS, where each node's value is determined based on the parent's value and the edge's parameters. However, we need to make sure that when we reach a node that's already been visited, the computed value matches the existing one.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nInitialize all nodes' values as None.\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   Pick a starting node (say, u), and assign it a value. But what value?\n\n   Wait, the problem is that the starting node's value can't be determined unless we have some constraints. However, the first edge connected to u will impose some constraints. But if the component is a single node with no edges (m=0), then any value is acceptable. But according to the input description, for m=0, the answer is possible. For example, in the first sample input, when n=1 and m=0, the output is 1.\n\nSo, for a node with no edges, we can assign it any positive integer. However, since the problem says that the numbers on the roads were no less than 1 and no more than 1e6, but in the original map, the numbers on the roads were derived from the mushrooms. However, the problem allows us to assign any valid mushrooms, even if they are larger than the original ones. Wait, but the problem says that the original roads had numbers between 1 and 1e6. However, the current problem allows us to assign any mushrooms, as long as the GCD and LCM on the edges match. So for a node with no edges, the value can be any positive integer. However, in practice, for the code, we can assign it 1, since the problem allows any valid solution.\n\nSo for a component with no edges (each node is isolated), we can assign each node any value. But since the problem requires any valid assignment, we can assign 1 to all of them.\n\nBut back to the general case.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   If the component has no edges (each node is isolated), assign 1 to all.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Pick a starting node (say, u). Assign it a value. How? Well, perhaps we can assign it the GCD of the first edge connected to it multiplied by 1 (so, for example, the GCD of the first edge is g, so assign a_u = g * 1). Then, for the adjacent node, compute the value based on the edge's parameters.\n\nBut wait, the first edge connected to u has GCD g and LCM l. Then, a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x * y = k = l/g and GCD(x, y) = 1. Choosing x = 1 and y = k would satisfy the conditions. So for the starting node u, assign a_u = g * 1, then a_v = g * k. But then, when processing other edges connected to u or v, this might lead to inconsistencies.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me try with an example. Suppose we have a component with two nodes u and v connected by an edge with GCD 2 and LCM 6. So k = 6/2 = 3. So possible pairs are (2, 6) or (6, 2) or (2*3, 2*1) etc. Let's assign u as 2 (g * 1), and v as 6 (g * 3). Now, if there's another edge from u to w with GCD 2 and LCM 12. Then, k is 6. So x * y = 6. So possible pairs (2, 6), (6, 2), (1, 6*2?), no. Wait, x and y must be coprime. So possible pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). So if u is 2 (which is g * x, where x is 1), then for this edge, a_u = 2*1 = 2. Then a_w must be 2 * (6) = 12. But then, the GCD of 2 and 12 is 2, which is correct, and LCM is 12, which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to work. However, if there's a cycle in the graph, the assignments must be consistent. For example, if u is connected to v with GCD 2 and LCM 6, and v is connected to w with GCD 2 and LCM 12, and w is connected back to u with some parameters. Then, during traversal, when we reach u again, the computed value must match the existing one.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nUse BFS or DFS. For each node, when visiting it, assign its value based on the parent's value and the edge's parameters. When visiting a neighbor, if it's unvisited, assign it the value and proceed. If it's already visited, check whether the computed value matches the existing one. If not, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute the value of the neighbor based on the edge's parameters?\n\nLet me formalize:\n\nSuppose during traversal, I have a current node u with value a_u. There's an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. Then, the product a_u * a_v must equal g * l. So, a_v = (g * l) / a_u. However, this requires that a_u divides g*l. Also, since a_v must be a multiple of g, we need to check that (g*l) / a_u is divisible by g. Let's see:\n\n(g*l) / a_u must be divisible by g. That implies that (g*l) / a_u = g * k → (g*l) / a_u = g *k → l / a_u = k → a_u divides l. But since a_u is a multiple of g (because earlier steps ensured that?), this may not hold. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, when we assign a_u, it's based on previous edges. For example, if u was assigned a value based on an edge with GCD g_prev and LCM l_prev, then a_u must be a multiple of g_prev. However, for the current edge between u and v, the GCD is g, and LCM is l. So a_u must be a multiple of g. But if the previous assignment didn't take into account this, then this may not hold. So how can we ensure that a_u is a multiple of g for this edge?\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because during the traversal, the value of a_u is determined by previous edges. However, for the current edge, the GCD is g, which requires that a_u and a_v are multiples of g. So the value of a_u must be a multiple of g. But if during the traversal, a_u was assigned a value that is not a multiple of g, then this would be invalid.\n\nBut how can that happen? Because during the traversal, when we assign a_u's value, it's based on previous edges. For example, if the first edge that was processed for u had a GCD g_prev, and a_u was assigned a value that is a multiple of g_prev. However, if this current edge has a GCD g_current, which may not divide a_u, then this would be a problem.\n\nThis suggests that the algorithm needs to ensure that for every edge, the value of the nodes involved are multiples of the GCD of that edge.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. For each edge, the GCD of the two nodes' values must be equal to the given GCD. Therefore, both nodes must be multiples of the given GCD. So during the traversal, when we compute a_v as (g*l)/a_u, we must ensure that a_v is a multiple of g. But since a_u is a multiple of g (from previous steps?), then (g*l)/a_u must be a multiple of g?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me assume that a_u is a multiple of g. Then, a_u = g * x. Then, a_v = (g*l) / (g*x) ) = l/(x). But for a_v to be a multiple of g, l/x must be divisible by g. But l is given as LCM of the two nodes. Since the LCM of a_u and a_v is l, which is equal to (a_u * a_v) / GCD(a_u, a_v) = (g x * (l/(x))) / g = l. Which holds. However, the requirement that a_v is a multiple of g comes from the fact that the GCD of a_u and a_v is g. Because if a_v is not a multiple of g, then the GCD of a_u and a_v would be less than g. But since we are given that the GCD is g, this implies that both a_u and a_v must be multiples of g. Therefore, during the traversal, when we compute a_v as (g*l)/a_u, we must ensure that a_v is a multiple of g. But how?\n\nLet me see. Given that a_u is a multiple of g (since we have ensured that during previous steps), then a_v = (g*l)/a_u. Let's see:\n\nSince a_u is a multiple of g, let's say a_u = g * x. Then, a_v = (g*l) / (g x) ) = l/(x). For a_v to be a multiple of g, l/x must be divisible by g. Which implies that l must be divisible by x * g. But since l is the LCM of a_u and a_v, and a_u = g x, a_v = (l/x), then the LCM of a_u and a_v is LCM(g x, l/x). But we know that LCM(a_u, a_v) is supposed to be l. So this must hold. However, how can we ensure that l/x is a multiple of g?\n\nWait, this seems to be a problem. Let me take an example. Suppose we have an edge with GCD 2 and LCM 6. Then, k = l/g = 3. So x * y = 3, x and y coprime. Possible (x, y) pairs are (1,3) and (3,1). Then, a_u = 2 * 1 = 2, a_v = 2 * 3 = 6. Then, LCM(2,6) is 6. Correct. Now, if I have another edge between u and w with GCD 2 and LCM 12. Then, k = 12/2 = 6. x * y = 6. Coprime pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). So if u is 2 (which is 2 * 1), then a_w would be (2 * 12)/2 = 12. Which is 2 * 6. So GCD(2, 12) is 2. Correct. Now, a_w is 12, which is a multiple of 2. So that works.\n\nAnother example: Suppose I have an edge between u and v with GCD 2 and LCM 6. Assign u as 2 (as before). Now, if there's another edge between u and w with GCD 3 and LCM 6. Then, k = 6/3 = 2. x * y = 2. Coprime pairs (1,2), (2,1). So a_u must be 3 * x. But earlier, a_u was assigned as 2, which is not a multiple of 3. This would be a problem. Therefore, this scenario would be invalid, because the value of u is not a multiple of the GCD of this new edge. Therefore, the problem would have no solution.\n\nBut how can this scenario happen? Because during the traversal, when we process the edge between u and w, the existing value of u is 2, which is not a multiple of the GCD of this edge (3). Therefore, this would be invalid, and the answer would be NO.\n\nBut how do we detect this during the traversal?\n\nAh, here's the key point: during the traversal, when we process an edge between u and v, we need to ensure that the existing value of u is a multiple of the edge's GCD. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSo, the algorithm should proceed as follows:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   Choose a starting node and assign it a value. How? Well, for the first edge connected to the starting node, the value must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge. So for example, if the starting node is u and the first edge has GCD g, then a_u can be assigned as g * 1. Then, for the adjacent node v, a_v is (g * l) / a_u = (g*l)/g = l. Which is a multiple of g (since l is a multiple of g, as checked earlier). So this ensures that a_v is a multiple of g.\n\nBut for other edges connected to u, the same applies. For example, if there's another edge from u to w with GCD g', then when we process that edge, a_u must be a multiple of g'. But if during the initial assignment, a_u was set to g * 1 (for the first edge), and g' is different from g, then this may not be the case.\n\nWait, this is a problem. How can we ensure that the initial assignment of a_u is compatible with all edges connected to u?\n\nIn this case, the initial assignment may not be compatible with other edges. For example, if u has two edges: one with GCD 2 and another with GCD 3. If we assign a_u = 2 (from the first edge), then for the second edge, a_u must be a multiple of 3. But 2 is not a multiple of 3. Hence, this would be invalid.\n\nBut how can this scenario occur? It implies that the problem is impossible. However, how can we detect this?\n\nThe problem arises when the initial assignment of a_u is not compatible with other edges connected to it. Therefore, during the traversal, when we process an edge between u and another node, we must check that the existing value of u is a multiple of the edge's GCD. If not, the answer is NO.\n\nSo, during the traversal, whenever we process an edge, we need to check that the current node's value is a multiple of the edge's GCD. If not, then it's impossible.\n\nBut how can this be handled in the algorithm?\n\nLet me outline the steps again with this in mind:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   If the component has no edges (isolated nodes), assign 1 to each.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Pick a starting node. Assign it a value. How? Well, for the first edge connected to it, assign it as g * 1, where g is the GCD of that edge. But then, this may not be compatible with other edges connected to the node. However, during the traversal, when we process other edges connected to the node, we will check if the current value is compatible with their GCDs.\n\n      Proceed with BFS/DFS:\n\n         For each node in the queue, iterate over its edges.\n\n         For each edge (u, v) with GCD g and LCM l:\n\n             if v is not visited:\n\n                 check if current a_u is a multiple of g. If not, return NO.\n\n                 compute a_v = (g * l) // a_u\n\n                 check if a_v is a multiple of g. If not, return NO.\n\n                 assign a_v and add to the queue.\n\n             else:\n\n                 check if a_v equals (g * l) // a_u. If not, return NO.\n\nBut wait, how do we check if a_u is a multiple of g? Because for the edge (u, v), the GCD of a_u and a_v must be g. Which requires that both a_u and a_v are multiples of g. So during the traversal, whenever we process an edge, we need to check that the current node's value is a multiple of the edge's GCD. If not, return NO.\n\nSo, in the algorithm:\n\nFor each edge (u, v) in the graph:\n\n   during BFS/DFS traversal, when processing the edge from u to v:\n\n   if u's value is not yet assigned, then it's part of the initial assignment (but this can't happen unless it's the first node in the component).\n\n   else:\n\n      check if a_u is divisible by g. If not, return NO.\n\n      compute expected a_v as (g * l) // a_u.\n\n      check if a_v is divisible by g. If not, return NO.\n\n      if v is not visited:\n\n          assign a_v and proceed.\n\n      else:\n\n          check if a_v matches the expected value.\n\nBut how do we handle the case where the edge is processed in both directions? For example, during BFS, when we process the edge from u to v, we compute a_v. Then, when processing the edge from v to u, we check if a_v is divisible by g, and compute a_u again, which must match the existing value.\n\nSo, the algorithm would catch any inconsistencies.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial assignment of the starting node. For example, when the component is not empty, and we have to assign the starting node's value. How?\n\nLet me take the first edge in the component. Suppose the starting node is u, and the first edge is between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. Then, we can assign a_u = g * x, where x is any divisor of k = l/g, such that x and y = k/x are coprime. However, choosing x = 1 would make a_u = g, and a_v = g * k. But how do we know that this is compatible with other edges connected to u?\n\nBut according to the algorithm, when processing other edges connected to u, we check whether a_u is divisible by their GCDs. So, if there's another edge from u to w with GCD g', then during traversal, when we process that edge, we check if a_u is divisible by g'. If not, the answer is NO. But if it is, then proceed.\n\nBut how to assign a_u initially? Because for the first edge, a_u is assigned as g * 1, which is a multiple of g. However, for other edges connected to u, their GCDs may not divide this value. But that would be caught during processing.\n\nSo the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   if the component has no edges: assign 1 to each node.\n\n   else:\n\n      pick a starting node u.\n\n      assign a_u as g * 1, where g is the GCD of the first edge connected to u. (But how to choose the first edge?)\n\nWait, but how to choose the first edge? For example, the starting node u may have multiple edges. Which one to use for assigning the initial value?\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because the initial assignment of a_u depends on the first edge chosen. However, if the component has multiple edges connected to u, the",
