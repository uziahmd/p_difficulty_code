    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nHmm. So first, let's think about what the LCM of two numbers depends on. The LCM of x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of the two numbers. Because if the GCD is larger, then the LCM would be smaller for the same product.\n\nWait, but the product x*y might also vary. So maybe there's a trade-off here. But perhaps the optimal approach is to find a k such that (a +k) and (b +k) have the largest possible GCD. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote x = a +k, y = b +k. Then, since x and y differ by (b -a). Let's say that d = |a - b|. Wait, because if a and b are different, then x and y differ by (b -a) if a < b, but since k is added to both, their difference remains (b -a) if a < b. So, the difference between x and y is fixed as (b -a) if a < b, or (a -b) if a > b. Let me call this difference D. So D = |a - b|.\n\nSo, the difference between x and y is D. Let me assume that a < b. Then x = a +k, y = b +k = x + D. So, the GCD of x and y is the same as the GCD of x and D. Because GCD(x, x+D) = GCD(x, D). So, for any x, the GCD of x and x + D is GCD(x, D).\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible GCD of x and y is the maximum possible divisor of D. Because since GCD(x, D) must divide D. So, the maximum possible GCD is D itself. But how can that happen? For example, if x is a multiple of D. Let's see.\n\nIf D is zero, meaning a = b. Then x = y, so their LCM is x, which is minimized when x is as small as possible. So k=0 is the answer. That's straightforward.\n\nSo, assuming a != b. Let's suppose that a < b. Then D = b - a. So, the maximum possible GCD of x and y is the maximum divisor of D. Let's think. For example, if we can find x such that x is a multiple of some divisor g of D, then the GCD of x and x + D is g. So, for that case, the LCM of x and x + D is (x * (x + D)) / g. Which equals (x*(x + D))/g. But since x is a multiple of g, let's say x = g * m. Then x + D = g*m + D. But since D is a multiple of g (because g divides D), let's say D = g * t. Then x + D = g*(m + t). So the GCD of x and x + D is g * GCD(m, m + t) = g * GCD(m, t). But since t = D/g, and D is fixed. Wait, but maybe I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, since x and y differ by D, and their GCD is g. Then g must divide D. So the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of D. So, to maximize the GCD, we need to find the largest possible divisor of D. Which is D itself. So, if we can have x and y such that their GCD is D, then that would give the maximum possible GCD, leading to the minimal LCM.\n\nHow can that happen? Well, for GCD(x, y) = D, since y - x = D. So, GCD(x, x + D) = GCD(x, D) = D. Which implies that D divides x. Because GCD(x, D) is D only if D divides x. So x must be a multiple of D. Let's say x = m * D. Then y = x + D = (m + 1)*D. So the GCD of x and y is D. Then the LCM is (x * y)/D = (m * D * (m + 1) * D ) / D = m*(m+1)*D. To minimize this, we want m as small as possible. Since m is a positive integer (since x is a + k >= 0, but m can be zero? Wait, no. Because x = m*D. If m is zero, then x is zero. But since a and b are positive integers, and k is non-negative. So x = a +k. So, for example, if a is positive, then x can be zero only if k = -a. But k must be non-negative. So m can't be zero unless a +k is zero. Which is impossible. Therefore, m must be at least 1?\n\nWait, but if x is a +k, then k can be such that x is zero. But since a is at least 1, then k would have to be -a, which is negative. Which is invalid. Therefore, x must be positive. So m must be at least 1. Therefore, the minimal LCM in this scenario is when m is 1. Then LCM is 1*2 * D = 2D. So, the minimal possible LCM in this case is 2D. But what if there are other divisors of D that could lead to a lower LCM?\n\nFor example, let's take D = 4. Suppose we have a = 6, b = 10 (from the first example). Then D is 4. So the maximum possible GCD is 4. Let's see. If x is 8 (so k = 2). Then y is 12. Their GCD is 4. The LCM is (8*12)/4 = 24. Which is the example given. Now, if we consider another divisor of D, say 2. Then, perhaps we can get a higher GCD. Wait, no. Because the maximum divisor of D is D itself. So, why not try to get the maximum possible GCD?\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where choosing a smaller divisor of D gives a better LCM. For example, if D is 6. Suppose D is 6, and we can choose between GCDs of 6 and 3. Let's say that for GCD 6, the LCM is 2*6 = 12. For GCD 3, maybe the LCM would be something else. Let me think. For example, if x is 3, then y is 9. Their GCD is 3, LCM is 9. Which is better than 12. So in that case, the maximum GCD approach isn't the best. So, what's wrong with my previous reasoning?\n\nAh, right! Because in that case, the maximum possible GCD is 6, but perhaps there's a scenario where the LCM is smaller. So the initial idea that maximizing the GCD leads to minimal LCM is not necessarily correct. Because the LCM depends on both the product of the numbers and the GCD. So, even though a higher GCD reduces the LCM, the product may be larger. So, the trade-off depends on the actual values.\n\nThis complicates things. So, perhaps the optimal approach is to consider all possible divisors of D (the absolute difference between a and b) and find the one that gives the minimal LCM. But how?\n\nLet me think again. Let's suppose that D is the absolute difference between a and b. Let me assume a < b. Then D = b - a. So, the problem reduces to finding a k such that (a +k) and (b +k) have their LCM minimized. Which is equivalent to finding x = a +k, y = x + D, and find x such that LCM(x, x + D) is minimized. Then, the minimal LCM over all x >= a (since k is non-negative, x >= a).\n\nBut how can we find x that minimizes LCM(x, x + D)?\n\nWe can note that LCM(x, x + D) = x*(x + D)/gcd(x, x + D) = x*(x + D)/g, where g = gcd(x, D). Because as before, gcd(x, x + D) = gcd(x, D).\n\nSo, for each possible divisor g of D, we can look for x such that g = gcd(x, D). Then, the LCM is x*(x + D)/g. But since x is congruent to 0 mod g (since g divides x and D), we can write x = g * m. Then, since D = g * t, where t is D/g. So x + D = g*m + g*t = g*(m + t). Therefore, the LCM becomes (g*m * g*(m + t)) / g = g * m * (m + t) = g * m (m + t).\n\nBut t is D/g. So, the LCM is g * m (m + D/g). Which is equal to g * m (m + D/g). To minimize this expression, for each possible divisor g of D, we can find the minimal value of this expression.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of D, the minimal value of the expression occurs when m is as small as possible. But m must satisfy that x = g * m >= a, since x = a +k, and k >=0. Also, since x = a +k, then k = x -a. Which must be >=0. So x >=a.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of D, we can find the minimal m such that g*m >= a. Then compute the corresponding LCM. Then, among all possible divisors, select the one that gives the minimal LCM, and then the minimal k.\n\nBut wait, D can be zero. So first, handle the case where a == b. In that case, the LCM is (a +k) since both numbers are same. So the minimal LCM is when a +k is as small as possible, which is when k=0. So output 0.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nIf a == b: return 0.\n\nElse, compute D = |a -b|. Then, find all divisors of D. For each divisor g of D, compute the minimal possible LCM for that g, then choose the overall minimal LCM, and the corresponding k.\n\nBut how to find the divisors of D?\n\nFirst, generate all divisors of D. Then, for each divisor g, compute the minimal m such that x = g*m >= a (assuming a < b, but we need to adjust based on which is larger). Wait, let's clarify.\n\nAssume that a < b. Then D = b - a. So x = a +k, and y = x + D. So, x must be >= a, since k >=0.\n\nBut for each divisor g of D, we need to find x = g*m, which is >= a. Also, since x = a +k, then k = x -a = g*m -a. But k must be >=0. So, g*m >=a. So m must be >= ceil(a/(g)). However, since x must be >=a, but also, since x = g*m, m can be any integer such that g*m >=a.\n\nBut m must be a positive integer. For example, if g is a divisor of D, then m can be 1, 2, etc.\n\nOnce we find the minimal m for that g, then compute the LCM for that case, and then compare across all divisors.\n\nBut wait, for each divisor g of D, the minimal possible value of the LCM for that g is achieved when m is as small as possible. Because the LCM is g * m (m + t), where t = D/g. Since t is fixed for a given g, the function f(m) = m (m + t) is increasing for m >= 0. So the minimal value of f(m) is when m is as small as possible.\n\nSo for each divisor g, compute the minimal m such that x = g*m >= a, then compute the LCM as g * m (m + t). Then compare across all divisors.\n\nBut what if a is larger than g*m for some m? Let's take an example. Suppose a is 6, D is 4 (as in the first example). The divisors of D=4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each divisor g:\n\nCase 1: g =4. Then t = D/g = 1. We need x =4*m >=6. The minimal m is 2 (since 4*1=4 <6, 4*2=8 >=6). So m=2. Then the LCM is 4 * 2 * (2 +1) = 4 * 2 *3 =24. Which is the example's case.\n\nCase 2: g=2. Then t =4/2=2. x =2*m >=6. Minimal m is 3 (since 2*3=6). Then LCM is 2 *3*(3+2) = 2*3*5=30. Which is higher than 24.\n\nCase 3: g=1. t=4. x=1*m >=6. m=6. LCM is 1 *6*(6+4) = 6*10=60. Which is worse.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 24, achieved with g=4. So the minimal k is x -a = 8-6=2, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: Let's take D=6. Suppose a=3, b=9. Then D=6. Let's consider divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor g=6, t=1. x=6*m >=3. m can be 1 (since 6*1=6 >=3). Then LCM is 6 *1*(1+1) = 6*2=12. So the LCM is 12.\n\nFor g=3, t=2. x=3*m >=3. m=1. LCM is 3*1*(1+2)= 3*3=9. Which is better than 12. So this is better. So why?\n\nAh, because in this case, choosing a smaller divisor gives a better LCM. So our previous approach of checking all divisors of D is correct, and the minimal LCM may come from a smaller divisor.\n\nSo, the algorithm should generate all divisors of D, compute for each the minimal possible LCM, and then pick the minimal among them.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. If a == b, return 0.\n\n2. Else, compute D = abs(a -b).\n\n3. Find all divisors of D.\n\n4. For each divisor g of D:\n\n   a. Compute t = D/g.\n\n   b. Find the minimal m such that g*m >= min(a, b). Wait, no. Because if a < b, then x = a +k. But x must be >= a. However, if a is larger than b, then we need to adjust.\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose a and b are arbitrary. Let me assume that a and b are such that a < b. Then D = b -a. Then x is a +k, and y = x + D. So x must be >= a (since k >=0). So for each divisor g of D, we need to find x = g*m >=a. Then the minimal m is ceil(a /g). But wait, if a is not divisible by g, then m is ceil(a/g). Otherwise, m is a/g.\n\nBut if a is larger than g*m, then m needs to be chosen such that g*m >= a.\n\nBut in the case where a is larger than g, for example, a=7, and g=4. Then m must be at least 2 (since 4*2=8 >=7).\n\nSo for each g, m_min is ceil(a /g). But wait, a is the smaller of the two numbers? No. Let me think again. Suppose a and b are arbitrary. Let me take D = |a -b|. Let me say that x is the smaller of a and b. So, for example, if a is smaller than b, then x = a. But if a is larger than b, then x = b. So, in general, x = min(a, b). So, the minimal value of x is min(a, b). But in this case, the x in the problem is a +k, which is the smaller of the two numbers after adding k. Wait, no. Because when you add k to both a and b, the difference remains the same. So if a < b, then a +k < b +k. So, x = a +k, which is the smaller number. So, for the case of a < b, the minimal x is a +k, and it's >= a. So, for each divisor g, the minimal m is ceil(a/g). But if a is larger than g, then m can be 1 if a <=g*m. Wait, for example, if a is 5 and g is 3. Then m_min is ceil(5/3) = 2, since 3*2=6 >=5.\n\nOnce we find m_min, then x = g*m_min. Then, the LCM is g * m_min * (m_min + t), where t = D/g.\n\nOnce we compute this for all divisors, we can find the minimal LCM. Then, among all possible divisors that achieve the minimal LCM, we need to choose the one with the smallest k. Because if multiple divisors lead to the same minimal LCM, we need to choose the k that is the smallest.\n\nBut how do we handle that?\n\nSo, for each divisor, we compute the candidate LCM and the corresponding k. Then, among all candidates, select the one with the minimal LCM. If there's a tie, choose the one with the smallest k.\n\nBut how do we generate all divisors of D?\n\nWell, first, we need to generate all the divisors of D. Let's think about how to do that efficiently. For D up to 1e9, the number of divisors is manageable. For example, even for numbers like 1e9, which is 2^9 * 5^9, the number of divisors is (9+1)*(9+1) = 100.\n\nSo, the steps for generating the divisors of D are:\n\n- Find all primes factors of D, then generate all combinations.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's easier to generate all divisors via trial division. Let's think.\n\nFunction to generate all divisors of a number D:\n\nInitialize a list of divisors. For i from 1 to sqrt(D), check if D is divisible by i. If yes, then add i and D/i to the list. Then, after that, remove duplicates and sort.\n\nBut in code, for D=0? No, because D is |a -b|, and a and b are at least 1. So D can be zero only when a =b. Which is handled earlier.\n\nSo, once we have all the divisors of D, we can process each of them.\n\nNow, the next step is to process each divisor g, compute the minimal m for that g, compute the corresponding LCM and k, and track the best option.\n\nBut there's a catch: when D is zero, but that's already handled.\n\nBut also, what about when D is zero? Well, the code handles that case separately.\n\nAnother example: the sample input 5 and 10. Then a=5, b=10. D=5. Divisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nFor each divisor:\n\ng=5: t =5/5=1. x must be >=5. So m_min is ceil(5/5) =1. So x=5*1=5. Then the LCM is 5*1*(1+1)= 5*2=10. The corresponding k is x -a =5-5=0. Which is the sample's output.\n\nFor g=1: t=5. x must be >=5. m_min is 5. Then LCM is 1*5*(5+5) =5*10=50. Which is worse. So the minimal is 10, achieved with k=0. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input: 21 and 31. D is 10. Divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.\n\nLet's process each:\n\nFor g=10: t=1. x must be >=21 (since a=21, which is smaller than b=31). m_min = ceil(21/10) =3. x=10*3=30. Then LCM is 10 *3*(3+1) =10*3*4=120. k is 30-21=9. Which matches the sample's output.\n\nFor g=5: t=10/5=2. m_min = ceil(21/5) =5 (since 5*4=20 <21, 5*5=25 >=21). x=25. LCM is 5*5*(5+2) =5*5*7=175. Which is worse than 120.\n\nFor g=2: t=5. m_min = ceil(21/2) =11. x=2*11=22. LCM is 2 * 11 * (11 +5) = 2*11*16 = 352. Worse.\n\nFor g=1: m_min=21. x=21. LCM is 1 *21*(21 +10) = 21*31 = 651. Worse. So the best is 120, achieved with k=9.\n\nSo the sample is handled correctly.\n\nThus, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the steps for code:\n\nFirst, read a and b.\n\nIf a == b: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute D = abs(a -b).\n\nGenerate all divisors of D.\n\nFor each divisor g in the divisors:\n\n   compute t = D // g.\n\n   compute x_min = the minimal x = g * m, where m is the minimal integer such that g*m >= min_val, where min_val is min(a, b).\n\n   Wait, no. Because when a < b, min_val is a, but when a > b, min_val is b. So, the min_val is the smaller of a and b.\n\nWait, but in the case where a is larger than b, then x is b +k. Because after adding k, the numbers are (a +k) and (b +k), but since a was larger than b, then (a +k) is larger than (b +k). So, the smaller of the two numbers is (b +k). But in this case, the difference between the two numbers is still D = a -b. So, the same logic applies. So, regardless of which is larger, the minimal value of the smaller number is min(a, b) +k. But when considering x = the smaller number, which is (min(a, b) +k). So, for the purpose of finding x, which is the smaller number, we need to find x = min(a, b) +k. But in terms of the code, for the case where a is larger than b, the min_val is b. So, for the code, let's define min_val = min(a, b). max_val = max(a, b). Then D = max_val - min_val.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of D, we need to find x = g*m, such that x >= min_val. Because x is the smaller number (after adding k), which must be at least min_val (since k >=0).\n\nSo, for each g, m_min is ceil( min_val / g ). But how to compute that?\n\nIn Python, m_min = (min_val + g -1) // g.\n\nOnce we have m_min, then x = g * m_min. Then, the corresponding k is x - min_val. Because x is min_val +k. So, k = x - min_val.\n\nOnce we compute that k, then the LCM is g * m_min * (m_min + t), where t = D/g.\n\nBut wait, the LCM is (x * (x + D)) / gcd(x, D). But since x is a multiple of g, and D is a multiple of g (since g is a divisor of D), then gcd(x, D) = g * gcd(m_min, t), since x = g*m_min, D = g * t. So, gcd(g*m_min, g*t) = g * gcd(m_min, t). But in our earlier analysis, we found that the LCM is x*(x + D)/g. Which is (g*m_min * (g*m_min + D )) / g. Since D = g*t, this becomes (g*m_min * (g*m_min + g*t )) / g = (g*m_min * g (m_min + t )) / g = g*m_min*(m_min + t). Which is the same as before.\n\nSo, the LCM for that case is g * m_min * (m_min + t).\n\nSo, for each divisor, compute this value, and track the minimal LCM, and the corresponding k.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, select the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple divisors yield the same minimal LCM, select the one with the smallest k.\n\nBut what about other possibilities? Are there any other cases where the minimal LCM can be achieved?\n\nWait, what if there are multiple divisors that can lead to the same minimal LCM? For example, if two different divisors g1 and g2 produce the same LCM, but different k's. Then, we need to choose the smallest k.\n\nSo, the code needs to track all possible candidates and select the best one.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitialize the best_lcm to a very large value, and best_k to a large value.\n\nFor each divisor g in divisors:\n\n   compute t = D // g\n\n   min_val = min(a, b)\n\n   m_min = ceil( min_val / g )\n\n   x = g * m_min\n\n   k_candidate = x - min_val\n\n   lcm_candidate = g * m_min * (m_min + t)\n\n   if lcm_candidate < best_lcm:\n\n       update best_lcm and best_k\n\n   elif lcm_candidate == best_lcm:\n\n       if k_candidate < best_k:\n\n           update best_k\n\nSo, after processing all divisors, best_k is the answer.\n\nBut what about the case when there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM? For example, if two different divisors give the same LCM, but different k's. We need to pick the smallest k.\n\nBut how to generate all divisors?\n\nNow, the code for generating the divisors of D.\n\nLet me think about the code for generating all divisors.\n\nFunction to generate divisors:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut for n=0? Not applicable, since in the code, D is non-zero here.\n\nSo, for example, for D=4, the divisors would be {1,2,4}.\n\nOnce we have the divisors, process each as above.\n\nBut what about the case when D is zero? It's handled separately.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input:\n\nSample 1: 6 10. D=4. Divisors are 1,2,4.\n\nSample 2: 21 31. D=10. Divisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nSample 3: 5 10. D=5. Divisors are 1,5.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=9. D=6. Divisors are 1,2,3,6.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=6: t=1. min_val=3. m_min = ceil(3/6) = 1. x=6*1=6. k_candidate = 6-3=3. LCM is 6 *1*(1+1) = 12.\n\ng=3: t=2. m_min = ceil(3/3) =1. x=3. k_candidate=0. LCM is 3 *1*(1+2) =9. Which is better than 12.\n\nSo the best is 9, with k=0. So the answer is 0. But what is the actual LCM?\n\nOriginal numbers are 3 +0 =3, 9 +0=9. LCM is 9. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code would find that.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, what about the case where the minimal LCM is achieved with a divisor that is not the maximum possible?\n\nYes, as shown in the example.\n\nSo, the code will generate all possible divisors, and for each, compute the candidate LCM and k, and select the best.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nif a == b: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   D = abs(a -b)\n\n   min_val = min(a, b)\n\n   max_val = max(a, b)\n\n   generate all divisors of D.\n\n   best_lcm = infinity\n\n   best_k = infinity\n\n   for each g in divisors:\n\n       t = D // g\n\n       m_min = ceil( min_val / g )\n\n       x = g * m_min\n\n       k_candidate = x - min_val\n\n       lcm_candidate = g * m_min * (m_min + t)\n\n       compare with best_lcm and best_k.\n\n   after processing all divisors, output best_k.\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM? For example, two different divisors leading to same LCM but different k's. The code would choose the smallest k.\n\nNow, code for generating divisors. Let's code that.\n\nBut in Python, for n up to 1e9, the loop for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1) is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut what if D is zero? Well, handled earlier.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n\n    return divisors\n\nBut math.isqrt is available in Python 3.8 and above. Alternatively, can use int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, but that may have some issues with floating points. However, for code submission, perhaps using math.sqrt is acceptable.\n\nBut for code submission, perhaps using math.isqrt is better.\n\nBut in code submission, perhaps using int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1 is okay.\n\nBut in any case, the code for generating the divisors is manageable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead a and b. Let's say input is read as a list, for example, the first example input is ['6 10', '21 31', '5 10'] but in the problem, the input is a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo the code reads a single line, splits into a and b.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        print(0)\n\n        return\n\n    D = abs(a - b)\n\n    min_val = min(a, b)\n\n    max_val = max(a, b)\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(D)) +1):\n\n        if D % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(D // i)\n\n    best_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = float('inf')\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        t = D // g\n\n        # compute m_min such that g*m_min >= min_val\n\n        # m_min = ceil( min_val / g )\n\n        m_min = (min_val + g -1) // g\n\n        x = g * m_min\n\n        k_candidate = x - min_val\n\n        lcm_candidate = g * m_min * (m_min + t)\n\n        # compare with best\n\n        if lcm_candidate < best_lcm:\n\n            best_lcm = lcm_candidate\n\n            best_k = k_candidate\n\n        elif lcm_candidate == best_lcm:\n\n            if k_candidate < best_k:\n\n                best_k = k_candidate\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the minimal LCM is achieved for a divisor that is not in the divisors? No, because the divisors are all possible divisors of D, and the approach considers all of them.\n\nBut let's test the first sample input:\n\nSample input: 6 10.\n\nD=4. divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\nProcessing each:\n\nFor g=1:\n\nt =4//1=4.\n\nm_min = (6 +1 -1 )//1 =6. x=6*1=6. k_candidate=6-6=0. LCM is 1 *6*(6+4) =6*10=60.\n\nFor g=2:\n\nt=4//2=2.\n\nm_min = (6 +2-1)//2 = (7)//2 =3. x=2*3=6. k_candidate=0. LCM is 2 *3*(3+2) = 2*3*5=30.\n\nFor g=4:\n\nt=4//4=1.\n\nm_min = (6 +4-1)//4 = (9)//4=2. x=4*2=8. k_candidate=8-6=2. LCM is 4*2*(2+1) =4*2*3=24. Which is the best.\n\nThus, best_k is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input 5 10. D=5.\n\ndivisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=5:\n\nt=1.\n\nm_min = (5 +5-1)//5 = (9)//5=1. x=5*1=5. k_candidate=0. LCM is 5*1*(1+1)=10.\n\nFor g=1: m_min=5, LCM=5* (5+5) =5*10=50. So best is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=9. D=6. Divisors are 1,2,3,6.\n\nFor g=3:\n\nt=6//3=2. m_min is (3 +3-1)//3 = (5)//3=1. x=3*1=3. k_candidate=0. LCM is 3 *1*(1+2) = 3*3=9.\n\nFor g=6: t=1. m_min = (3 +6-1)/6 = (8)/6 = 1. x=6*1=6. k_candidate=6-3=3. LCM is 6 *1*(1+1) =12. So the best is 0.\n\nSo the code returns 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a=7, b=3. Then D=4. min_val is 3. So same as first example. For g=4, m_min is (3 +4-1)//4 = (6)//4=1. x=4*1=4. k_candidate=4-3=1. LCM is 4 *1*(1 +1) =8. Which is for numbers 4 and 8 (since b +k =3 +1=4, a +k =7+1=8. LCM(4,8) is 8. Which is correct. So code would generate that.\n\nBut what if there's a case where the minimal LCM is achieved with a different divisor?\n\nYes, as discussed earlier.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when D is zero? Well, the code handles it with the first condition.\n\nBut what about when D is zero and a and b are same, but the code returns 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM?\n\nFor example, let's say D=6. Suppose two divisors g1 and g2, which when processed, give same LCM but different k's.\n\nLet's take a=3, b=9. D=6. min_val=3.\n\nSuppose for g=3, we have LCM 9. For another divisor, say, g=2. Let's see:\n\ng=2. t=3.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized.
