            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b can be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, handling the case when b is 'R' which means Roman numerals.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has a and b (or R), second line has the number c in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to decimal (integer).\n3. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be a normal base (like 2, 16) or Roman numerals.\n\nSo the main parts are:\n- Converting the input string c (base a) to a decimal integer.\n- Converting that decimal integer to the target base, which may be Roman.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst part: converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have letters if a is larger than 10. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase). But the problem says that in the input, the c may have letters? Wait, the input says that c is given as a string in base a. So for bases larger than 10, the digits would be 0-9 followed by letters A, B, etc. But how are they represented in the input?\n\nThe problem says that in the input, c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. Also, the note says that for cases with Roman numerals, the number is <= 3000 in decimal, and otherwise, it's up to 1e15.\n\nSo, for converting c from base a to decimal, I need to process each character of the string. For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). So the input string for c could have letters like A, B, etc., depending on the base.\n\nBut how do I parse that? For example, the input might have 'A' in the string. So, during conversion, each character in the string must be converted to its corresponding value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc.\n\nSo, for the first step, the code needs to take the string c, and convert it to a decimal number. Let's write a helper function for that.\n\nBut wait, the input for c is given as a string. So for example, if the input is 'A', then in base 12, that's 10 in decimal. So the code must process each character in the string, convert to its numerical value, and compute the decimal value.\n\nSo, for the first part, the code can process each character in the string, and for each digit, get its value. For example, for a digit '5', it's 5. For 'A', it's 10. So, the helper function would be something like:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the base is 10? Then digits can be 0-9. But for bases higher than 10, letters are used. So this code would work. For example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, then it's 10. But in base 16, 'A' is 10, etc.\n\nBut what about uppercase vs lowercase? The problem says that the input c is given as a string. But the example includes 'A' in one of the inputs. For example, the fifth input in the sample is '12 13\\nA', which is converted to 'A' in base 13. So the input c can have letters, and they are probably uppercase. But the code should handle both cases? Or does the problem specify that the input c is in uppercase?\n\nThe problem says that the input is given as a non-negative integer in base a, which may contain leading zeros. But the problem doesn't specify the case of letters. However, in programming competitions, usually, the input is in uppercase. But perhaps the code should process both upper and lower case letters. However, the problem's sample input includes 'A' in the fifth case. So perhaps the input uses uppercase letters. But the code should handle both cases, maybe by converting to uppercase.\n\nBut the problem statement says that in the input, the c may contain leading zeros. So,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, where the target base can be a standard base or Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer, and then converting that decimal integer to the target base, which could be Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a`. We need to convert this number to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its corresponding value, and accumulating the result.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: After converting the input to a decimal integer, we need to convert this integer to the target base `b`. If `b` is 'R', we use Roman numerals for the conversion. Otherwise, we convert it to the specified base using standard digit representation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.strip().split('\\n')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        a_b_part, c_part = parts[0], parts[1]\n        a_b = a_b_part.split()\n        a = int(a_b[0])\n        b = a_b[1]\n        c = c_part\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n        \n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            target_base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, target_base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into lines. Each line contains the base conversion parameters and the number to convert.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input number from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character of the input string and converting it to its corresponding value.\n3. **Base Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal integer to a specified base. If the base is greater than 10, letters are used for values 10 and above.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal integer to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating through these pairs to construct the Roman numeral string.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including leading zeros and the special case of Roman numerals.",
