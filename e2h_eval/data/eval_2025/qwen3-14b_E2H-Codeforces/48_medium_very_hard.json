He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b can be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, handling the case when b is 'R' which means Roman numerals.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has a and b (or R), second line has the number c in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to decimal (integer).\n3. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be a normal base (like 2, 16) or Roman numerals.\n\nSo the main parts are:\n- Converting the input string c (base a) to a decimal integer.\n- Then converting that decimal integer to the target base, which is either a normal base or Roman numerals.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst part: converting c from base a to decimal. Since c can have leading zeros, but the length is up to 10^3, which is manageable. For example, if a is 10, then c is a normal decimal number. But for other bases, like 2, 16, etc., we need to parse each digit correctly. Also, note that for bases larger than 10, letters A, B, etc., are used. Wait, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15.\" So the input c is a string in base a, which may have letters for digits above 9. For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). So when parsing c, each character must be converted to its corresponding value. But how?\n\nSo for the first step: parse the input string c into a decimal number. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nFor example, if c is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal. So the function to convert the string to decimal would process each character, converting it to its value (digits 0-9, then letters A-Z for 10 and up?), but the problem says that the input c is a valid number in base a. So for the input, each character in c is a valid digit in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9, A-F (uppercase? Or lowercase? Well, the input examples have 'A' in one of the test cases. So probably, the input uses uppercase letters for digits beyond 9. So the code should process uppercase letters.\n\nWait, the input says that the second line is a non-negative integer c in base a. So for example, in the sample input, there's an entry '12 13\\nA', which would be A in base 12, which is 10 in decimal. Then converting to base 13, which would be 'A' again. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo for the first part, the code needs to take the string c and convert it to a decimal integer. Let's think about writing a helper function for that.\n\nThe helper function would take the string, and the base a, and return the integer value. How to process each character?\n\nEach character in the string represents a digit in base a. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So for each character in the string, we need to convert it to its numerical value. So for a character ch, if it's a digit, then int(ch). If it's a letter, then ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10. But wait, the problem says that the input may have letters for digits beyond 9. So for example, in base 12, digits go up to 11, which would be represented as B. So the code needs to handle that.\n\nBut what about case? The problem says that the input is given as a string. Looking at the sample input, for example, the third input is '5 R\\n4' which outputs 'IV'. So the input c is '4' in base 5, which is 4 in decimal. Then converted to Roman numerals. So the input c is in base a, and the digits are in uppercase letters? Or lowercase? The problem says that the input may contain letters, but the sample shows 'A' as part of the input. So perhaps the input uses uppercase letters for digits beyond 9.\n\nSo the code should process each character in the string as follows: for each character, if it is a digit, then its value is int(ch). If it's a letter, then its value is 10 + (ord(ch) - ord('A')).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is given as a non-negative integer in base a. So the input c may have letters in uppercase, like 'A', 'B', etc. So the code must process those.\n\nSo, for example, if the input c is 'A', then in base 12, it's 10 in decimal. So the helper function for converting from base a to decimal would process each character as follows.\n\nOnce that is done, the next step is to convert the decimal integer to base b, which can be a normal base (like 2, 16, etc.) or Roman numerals.\n\nSo for the second part: if b is not 'R', then convert the decimal number to base b, using standard digits. For example, if the decimal number is 10 and base is 16, then output is 'A'. But if the base is 2, then output is '1010'.\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead a and b (if b is 'R', then handle that case). Then read c as a string. Convert c from base a to decimal (as a Python integer). Then convert that decimal to base b, which is either a normal base or Roman numerals.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement these two conversion steps correctly, handling all edge cases.\n\nLet me think about the first conversion: from base a to decimal.\n\nImplementing this function:\n\ndef from_base_a(s, a):\n\n    value = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else 10 + (ord(ch) - ord('A'))\n\n        value = value * a + digit\n\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the input is '0'? Well, according to the problem statement, if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the number can be zero. However, the input says that the number may have leading zeros but is non-negative. So, for example, if the input is '0' in base 10, then the decimal is 0. But when converting to another base, leading zeros are omitted. However, the problem says that for Roman numerals, the input is guaranteed not to be zero. So in the code, when converting to Roman numerals, the decimal value will not be zero.\n\nBut the code needs to handle the case where the decimal value is zero. For example, if the input is '0' in base a, then when converting to base b (not R), the output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the input c is not zero. So the code can assume that when converting to Roman, the decimal number is positive.\n\nSo the first step is to convert the input string to decimal. Let's code that function.\n\nNow, the second part: converting from decimal to base b, which can be a normal base or Roman numerals.\n\nCase 1: b is not 'R'. So we need to convert the decimal number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for digits above 9. Also, leading zeros must be omitted.\n\nFor example, if the decimal number is 10, and base is 16, then output is 'A'. If the decimal number is 0, output is '0'.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion?\n\nThe standard way to convert a decimal number to another base is to repeatedly divide by the base and collect the remainders. However, for 0, we need to return '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the input is not zero. However, for other cases, the input could be zero. For example, if the input is '0' in base a, then the output is '0' in base b (if b is not R).\n\nSo for the code:\n\ndef to_base_b(n, b):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        remainder = n % b\n\n        # convert remainder to character\n\n        if remainder < 10:\n\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n\n        else:\n\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n\n        n = n // b\n\n    # digits are collected in reverse order\n\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros? The problem says to omit leading zeros. However, in this code, when n is zero, it returns '0', which is correct. Otherwise, the code returns the digits in the correct order, without leading zeros. Because for example, if the number is 10 in base 16, the code returns 'A', which is correct.\n\nBut what if the number is zero? The code returns '0', which is correct.\n\nBut for the case where the input is zero, but the code is converting to base b (non-R), then the output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the input is not zero. So in that case, the code doesn't need to handle zero for Roman conversion.\n\nNow, the case where b is 'R', which requires converting the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nImplementing Roman numerals conversion. The problem gives some examples. For example, 4 is IV, 5 is V, 9 is IX, etc.\n\nThe standard approach for converting to Roman numerals is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nThe standard values are:\n\nM 1000\n\nCM 900\n\nD 500\n\nCD 400\n\nC 100\n\nXC 90\n\nL 50\n\nXL 40\n\nX 10\n\nIX 9\n\nV 5\n\nIV 4\n\nI 1\n\nSo the code can create a list of tuples, sorted in descending order of value. Then, for each tuple, while the number is >= value, append the symbol and subtract the value.\n\nSo for example, for 4, the code would check 1000, 900, etc., until it reaches 4, which is IV.\n\nSo the code for converting to Roman numerals:\n\ndef to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n\n    ]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n\n        while n >= value:\n\n            res += symbol\n\n            n -= value\n\n    return res\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the number is guaranteed to be <= 3000 (in decimal) and not zero. So the code can safely process numbers up to 3000.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the input is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 3000. So the code can use this method.\n\nBut what about numbers like 3000? That would be 'MMM' which is allowed.\n\nSo the code for Roman conversion seems correct.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input lines. Wait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is a and b (with b possibly being R). The second line is the string c.\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as per the sample input, which is a list of test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\n\nSo for each test case, the code needs to read two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual problem says that the code should process a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the code should read two lines of input. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the sample output also shows multiple outputs. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich seems to be multiple test cases, each with their own input lines. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. However, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, and the sample output shows multiple outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each with two lines. However, the problem's input format isn't entirely clear.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the input is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, each with two lines. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description seems to indicate that there is only one test case. But the sample shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given as two lines. However, the problem's input format is ambiguous here.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. Each test case is two lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: 10 2\n\nLine 2: 1\n\nOutput is '1'.\n\nBut how to read the input? In Python, the code can read all lines from stdin. However, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output, which shows that the code must process multiple test cases, each with two lines. Therefore, the code must read all input lines, split them into pairs of two lines, and process each pair as a separate test case.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a test case. But in reality, the input is given as multiple lines. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of two lines, and process each group.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs. For example, for each i in 0, 2, 4, etc., take lines[i] and lines[i+1] as the a/b line and the c line.\n\nBut how to read the input? The code can read all input lines as a list. For example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, for each pair of lines (i and i+1), process them as a test case.\n\nBut the problem's input may have multiple test cases, each with two lines. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case, but the sample shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, it's clear that the code should process multiple test cases. So the code should process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as two lines. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, and the actual input is multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines, and process them in pairs. For example:\n\nRead all lines, then for each i from 0 to len(lines) - 1 step 2:\n\nTake line i as the a and b line, line i+1 as the c line.\n\nBut in practice, the code should read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description is unclear. However, given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, so perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Let me check the problem's sample input and output again.\n\nSample input:\n\nThe first line is ['10 2\\n1', ...], which seems to be a list of test cases. But in reality, the input is given as two lines per test case. For example, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: 10 2\n\nLine 2: 1\n\nThen the next test case is:\n\nLine 1: 16 R\n\nLine 2: 5\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to read that? Well, in programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, each given in consecutive lines. For example, the code reads all lines, then processes them in pairs.\n\nThus, the code will read all lines, then for each pair of lines, process them as a test case.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read line1 (a and b)\n\n   Read line2 (c)\n\n   process and output result.\n\nNow, the code must handle that.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nFirst, read all lines. Then, for each pair of lines, process.\n\nNow, for each test case:\n\nParse line1 into a and b. For example, line1 is split into two parts. The first part is a, the second is b (could be R).\n\nThen, line2 is the string c.\n\nThen, convert c from base a to decimal.\n\nThen, convert that decimal to base b (either normal base or Roman).\n\nNow, the code must handle the case where b is 'R'.\n\nSo, putting all this together.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead all lines from input.\n\nFor each pair of lines:\n\n   line1 = a and b.\n\n   line2 = c.\n\nProcess:\n\n   Split line1 into a and b. For example, split by space.\n\n   a = int(first part), b is second part (could be 'R').\n\n   c_str = line2.\n\nConvert c_str from base a to decimal.\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert decimal to roman.\n\nElse, convert decimal to base b, as a string.\n\nNow, the code must handle the conversion from base a to decimal.\n\nBut what about when a is 1? No, the problem says that a is between 2 and 25 inclusive.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, code for converting c_str to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            digit = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            digit = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\n        num = num * base + digit\n\n    return num\n\nWait, but what if the input has lowercase letters? The problem says that the input may contain letters, but the sample shows uppercase. The problem says that the input is a valid number in base a, but it's unclear whether the letters are uppercase or lowercase. However, the sample input uses 'A' as a digit. So perhaps the code should process uppercase letters, but in practice, the input may have lowercase letters. However, the problem says that the input is correct. So perhaps the code can process both cases by converting to uppercase.\n\nBut the code can process the input by converting each character to uppercase, then processing as before.\n\nSo in the code, for each character in c_str:\n\nif it's a digit, then digit is int(ch). Else, uppercase it, then compute 10 + (ord(ch) - ord('A')).\n\nBut the problem says that the input is correct. So for example, in base 12, digits can be 0-9, A, B. So the code can process that.\n\nSo the code for converting to decimal is:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    value = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            digit = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            digit = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\n        value = value * base + digit\n\n    return value\n\nNow, for example, 'A' in base 12 is 10, which is correct.\n\nNow, the code for converting decimal to base b (non-R):\n\ndef to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        remainder = n % base\n\n        if remainder < 10:\n\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n\n        else:\n\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nBut for example, if the number is 10 and base is 16, returns 'A'.\n\nNow, for the case where the decimal is zero, returns '0'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, when converting to Roman numerals, the input is not zero. So for the code, when the target is Roman, the decimal is non-zero.\n\nNow, the code for Roman numerals:\n\ndef to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [(1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n\n                      (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n\n                      (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n\n        while n >= value:\n\n            res += symbol\n\n            n -= value\n\n    return res\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. For each pair of lines:\n\n   process as a test case.\n\nBut how to read the lines? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines via sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nSo:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        line1 = lines[idx]\n\n        line2 = lines[idx + 1]\n\n        idx += 2\n\n        # process line1 and line2\n\n        a_str, b = line1.split()\n\n        a = int(a_str)\n\n        c_str = line2\n\n        # convert c_str from base a to decimal\n\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\n        # process based on b\n\n        if b == 'R':\n\n            roman = to_roman(decimal_value)\n\n            print(roman)\n\n        else:\n\n            base = int(b)\n\n            converted = to_base(decimal_value, base)\n\n            print(converted)\n\nBut need to handle the case where the converted string is empty? No, because decimal_value is non-zero except when c_str is zero. But for example, if the input is '0' in base a, then decimal_value is zero. Then, when converting to base b (non-R), the code returns '0'.\n\nBut in the code, the to_base function returns '0' when n is zero.\n\nBut for the case where the input c_str is '0' and base is 10, then output is '0'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c_str='1'\n\ndecimal_value is 1. Convert to base 2: 1. Output is '1'.\n\nSample Output is '1'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b=R, c_str='5'. decimal_value is 5. Convert to Roman: 'V'.\n\nSample Output is 'V'.\n\nTest case 3:\n\na=5, b=R, c_str='4'. decimal_value is 4. Roman is 'IV'.\n\nSample Output is 'IV'.\n\nTest case 4:\n\na=2, b=2, c_str='1111001'.\n\nConvert to decimal: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converting to base 2: same as input, which is '1111001'.\n\nSample Output is '1111001'.\n\nTest case 5:\n\na=12, b=13, c_str='A'. decimal_value is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. Output is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in the output? The problem says to omit leading zeros. For example, if the decimal is 0, output is '0'. For other cases, the code returns the digits without leading zeros. For example, if converting 10 to base 2, it's 1010, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 2 10, c_str is '10' (which is 2 in decimal). Converted to base 10 is '2'.\n\nAnother case: input is 10 16, c_str is '10' (decimal 10) → converted to base 16 is 'A'.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal is zero? For example, input a=10, b=2, c_str is '0' → output is '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the input is not zero. So the code doesn't have to handle that case.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if the input c_str is '0'? For example, a=10, b=2. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting to base 1? But according to the problem statement, the bases are between 2 and 25. So the code can assume that b is 2-25, or R.\n\nNow, code for the functions.\n\nBut in the code, the function to_decimal may have a problem with leading zeros. But the problem says that the input may have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, '001' in base 10 is 1.\n\nNow, code for to_decimal:\n\nYes, the code handles that correctly.\n\nNow, code for to_base:\n\nIf the decimal is zero, returns '0'. Otherwise, returns the digits.\n\nNow, code for the Roman numerals.\n\nBut what about numbers like 3000? The code would generate 'MMM'.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000. So that's handled.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing all functions.\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin and output to stdout. Now, code:\n\nBut the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        line1 = lines[idx]\n        line2 = lines[idx + 1]\n        idx += 2\n        a_str, b = line1.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        c_str = line2\n        # Convert c_str to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            print(to_roman(decimal_value))\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the input has multiple test cases, and the number of lines is odd? But according to the problem statement, each test case has two lines, so the code assumes that the input is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFor example, the first test case:\n\nInput lines:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nProcessing:\n\na is 10, b is 2. c_str is '1'.\n\ndecimal_value is 1. Convert to base 2: '1'.\n\nOutput is '1'.\n\nAnother test case:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\ndecimal_value is 5. Convert to roman: 'V'.\n\nAnother test case:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → decimal is 4 → 'IV'.\n\nAnother test case:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → decimal is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 +32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Convert to base 2: 121 in binary is 1111001.\n\nWhich is the same as input, so output is '1111001'.\n\nAnother test case:\n\n12 13\n\nA → decimal is 10. Convert to base 13 → 10 is 'A'.\n\nSo output is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the input c_str is '0'?\n\nFor example, input:\n\na=10, b=2, c_str is '0' → decimal is 0 → converted to base 2 is '0'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=10, c_str is '0' → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=16, c_str is '0' → output '0'.\n\nBut for Roman, the code will not process zero.\n\nNow, what about when the input is '0' and b is R? According to the problem statement, such case is not present.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when converting to base 10, and the decimal value is zero. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 10, the decimal value is 10 → output '10'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 1, but according to the problem statement, the base is between 2 and 25, so the code can assume that.\n\nNow, what about when the input c_str is something like 'Z' in base 36? But according to the problem statement, the input is valid. However, the code is written for bases up to 25, so the input c_str can have letters up to 24 (since base a is up to 25, so digits are 0-24. For example, in base 25, the digits can be 0-24. So 'O' would be 14 + 10? Wait, no. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, ..., 'Y' is 34? No. Wait, the code uses ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10. So for example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, ..., 'Z' is 35. But the base a can be up to 25, so the digits in c_str must be less than a. So for example, if a is 25, then the digits can be up to 24. So the code will process 'Y' as 24 (since ord('Y') - ord('A') is 24, plus 10? No, wait:\n\nWait, the code for converting a character to digit is:\n\ndigit = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A')).\n\nSo for 'A', it is 10 + 0 = 10. For 'B' 10 + 1 = 11. For 'Z', 10 + 25 = 35. But if the base is 25, then the digits can be 0-24. So the code will process 'Y' (which is 24) as 10 + 24 - ord('A')? Wait, ord('A') is 65. ord('Y') is 89. So 89 - 65 = 24. So digit is 10 + 24 = 34? That's wrong. Wait, no! Oh wait, no. Wait, the code says:\n\ndigit = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A')).\n\nSo for 'A', the value is 10 + 0 = 10. For 'B', 10 + 1 = 11. For 'Y', 10 + 24 = 34. For 'Z', 10 + 25 = 35. But that's wrong. Because for base 25, the digits can be 0-24. So the code is incorrect here. Oh no! What's wrong here?\n\nAh, I see the mistake. The code for converting a character to digit is wrong. Because for example, 'A' represents 10, 'B' 11, etc. So for a base a, the digits can be from 0 to a-1. So if the base is 16, then the digits can be 0-15, which are 0-9 and A-F. So for example, in base 16, 'A' is 10, 'F' is 15. But in the code, for 'F', ord('F') - ord('A') is 5, so digit is 10 +5 =15. Correct. So that's correct.\n\nBut for a base of 25, the digits can be up to 24. So the code would allow 'O' (which is 14 + 10?), no. Let's see: for example, the digit 'O' is 14 (ord('O') - ord('A')",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, where the target base can be a standard numerical base or Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to decimal (base 10), and then converting the decimal number to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input Number to Decimal**: The input number is given in a specified base. We need to parse this number, considering digits and letters (A-Z for values 10 and above), and convert it to a decimal integer.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base is a standard base (2-25) or Roman numerals:\n   - For standard bases, repeatedly divide the decimal number by the target base and collect remainders, converting them to appropriate characters (digits or letters).\n   - For Roman numerals, use a predefined list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral representation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        line1 = lines[idx]\n        line2 = lines[idx + 1]\n        idx += 2\n        a_str, b = line1.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        c_str = line2\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            print(to_roman(decimal_value))\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as multiple lines, each pair representing a test case with the first line containing the source base and target base (or 'R' for Roman numerals), and the second line containing the number in the source base.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The `to_decimal` function processes each character of the input number, converting letters to their respective numeric values and accumulating the result in decimal.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: The `to_base` function handles conversion to standard bases by repeatedly dividing the decimal number by the target base and collecting remainders. The `to_roman` function converts the decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, ensuring correct formatting according to Roman numeral rules.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion between different bases and Roman numerals, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
