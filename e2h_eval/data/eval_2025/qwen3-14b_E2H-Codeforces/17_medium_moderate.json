He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one possible string s that fits all these assignments.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one valid s that matches the assignments. Also, note that multiple valid assignments might exist, but we can output any correct one.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nThe main idea is to find for each possible candidate string s (which is of length n), check if all the given strings are its prefixes or suffixes. Then, for each such s, we can assign the P/S labels accordingly. However, since n can be up to 100, generating all possible s's might not be feasible directly. But perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find the correct s by considering that the longest prefix and the longest suffix must be of length n-1. For example, the input contains two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the prefix of s (the first n-1 characters), and the other must be the suffix (the last n-1 characters). So, if we can find which of these two is the prefix and which is the suffix, we can then build the entire string s.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think. Suppose we have two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B. Then, the actual string s must be such that A is a prefix of s, and B is a suffix of s. But since A is of length n-1, the only way that can happen is if s is A + (some character), but since the length of s is n, that character would be the last character. But also, B must be a suffix of s, which is of length n-1. So B must be the last n-1 characters of s. Therefore, the first n-1 characters of s is A, and the last n-1 is B. Therefore, the first character of s is A[0], and the last character is B[-1]. Also, the second to nth character of s is the same as the last n-1 characters of s. So, the overlapping part between A and B must match. Let's see:\n\ns = A + [c], where c is some character. But also, B must be the suffix of s, which is s[1:] = B. So, s[1:] is B. Therefore, A[1:] must be equal to B[0:n-2], because s[1:] is the last n-1 characters. Wait, A is of length n-1. So s is A concatenated with a character. Then s[1:] is A[1:] + c. Which has to be equal to B. Therefore, A[1:] + c = B. So B's first n-2 characters are A[1:], and B's last character is c. So c is B's last character. Also, since s is A concatenated with c, then the entire string s would be A + B[-1].\n\nBut since s's length is n, that makes sense. So for the two strings of length n-1, say A and B, if we assume that A is the prefix and B is the suffix, then the full string s would be A + B[-1], and we can check whether B is indeed the suffix of s. Because s[1:] should be equal to B. Let's check that:\n\ns = A + B[-1], so s[1:] is A[1:] + B[-1]. This should be equal to B. Therefore, A[1:] + B[-1] == B. Which implies that A[1:] must be B[0: n-2], and B[-1] is B's last character. Therefore, B must be equal to A[1:] + (B's last character). Which is always true, but how do we find which pair A and B satisfy this?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that for the two candidates of length n-1, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Then, the actual string s can be constructed as follows: the prefix is of length n-1, the suffix is of length n-1. So the first n-1 characters are the prefix, and the last n-1 characters are the suffix. Therefore, the first character of the prefix and the last character of the suffix must be the same as the first character of the string and the last character of the string, respectively. But the overlapping part between the prefix and suffix would be the middle part of the string.\n\nFor example, suppose the prefix is P and the suffix is S. Then, the string s is P concatenated with a character. But that character must be the last character of the suffix S. Also, the suffix S must be equal to s[1:], which is P[1:] + last_char. So S must be equal to P[1:] + last_char. But since S is of length n-1, and P is of length n-1, then P[1:] is length n-2. Adding the last_char (length 1) gives us length n-1. Therefore, S must be equal to P[1:] + last_char. But the last_char is the last character of S. Therefore, S must be equal to P[1:] + S[-1]. Which implies that S[:-1] = P[1:]. So for the two candidates of length n-1, if we take one as the prefix and the other as the suffix, then their overlapping parts must satisfy that S[:-1] equals P[1:].\n\nTherefore, for each pair of the two length n-1 strings, we can check if they satisfy this condition. If they do, then the full string s would be P + S[-1], and we can proceed to check if all other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of this s.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all possible candidates for the full string s. How?\n\n   For each pair of the two length n-1 strings, check if they can be the prefix and suffix. That is, for each pair (A, B), check if B[:-1] == A[1:]. If yes, then the candidate s is A + B[-1]. Similarly, check if A[:-1] == B[1:], in which case the candidate s is B + A[-1].\n\n   Because the two length n-1 strings could be the prefix and suffix in either order. So for the two strings, say, X and Y, we can check both possibilities: X as prefix and Y as suffix, and Y as prefix and X as suffix.\n\n   Once we find such a candidate s, we can then check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. If so, then we can use this s to assign the P/S labels.\n\nOnce we have such a candidate s, we can then process all the input strings and for each, determine whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. However, since the input may contain duplicates (like in the second sample input, where there are two \"aa\" strings), we need to make sure that for each input string, the assignment of P/S is such that the count of P and S is equal (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, total 2n-2).\n\nBut how to assign which input string is a prefix or suffix once we have s?\n\nOnce we have s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then it can be marked as P. Similarly for suffix. However, since there are exactly two strings of each length (from 1 to n-1), each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of s. Therefore, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. So once we have s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut there's a problem here. For example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix of s, then we have to decide whether to assign it as P or S. However, the problem says that the answer is acceptable as long as there exists at least one s that fits the assignments. So for such cases, we can choose either option, but need to ensure that the counts of P and S are equal. However, since the input is guaranteed to be valid, for each s, there must be exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. Therefore, for each input string, it must be a prefix or a suffix of s. So when building the answer, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix of s. If it is, assign P, else assign S. However, this may not work if some input strings are both prefixes and suffixes, but we need to assign them in a way that the total number of P and S is correct.\n\nWait, but for the given input, the problem statement says that the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So for the correct s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of s. So for the correct s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix. So when we have a candidate s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. But for some input strings, they might be both. For example, if the string is \"aaa\", then \"a\" is both a prefix and a suffix. So in that case, we need to assign it as P or S, but ensuring that the total number of P and S is n-1 each. However, since the input has exactly two strings for each length (from 1 to n-1), and for each length, exactly one is a prefix and one is a suffix. So for example, for length 1, there are two strings. One is the prefix (the first character) and the other is the suffix (the last character). However, if the first and last characters are the same, then both strings are the same. But the problem says that the input is given as exactly two strings of each length. So in that case, for example, in the second sample input, the input is for n=3: the two strings of length 1 are \"a\" and \"a\". So the correct s is \"aaa\", and each of those two \"a\" strings is a prefix and a suffix. So when assigning, we need to mark one as P and one as S.\n\nBut how do we handle that? For example, in that case, the code would check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix. For the two \"a\" strings, they are both prefixes and suffixes. So for the assignment, we need to choose one as P and the other as S. However, how can we do that? Because when we process the input strings, we can't just assign them based on whether they are a prefix or suffix, because for some strings, they are both. So perhaps the approach is:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then we can assign it as P, unless there are more P's than allowed. But how to track that?\n\nAlternatively, since the input is guaranteed to be correct, for each input string, exactly one of the following is true: it is a prefix of s, or it is a suffix of s. But in some cases, it can be both. However, for the problem's constraints, the input is such that there exists at least one valid assignment. So when building the answer for a correct s, we can assign each input string as P or S, making sure that the count is correct.\n\nBut how to do that programmatically?\n\nMaybe the following approach:\n\nOnce we have a candidate s, for each input string, check if it's a prefix of s. If it is, then we can assign it as P, else assign as S. However, this may not work if some input strings are both prefixes and suffixes. For example, suppose a string is both a prefix and suffix. Then, in that case, the code may assign it as P, but then the number of P's may exceed n-1. However, since the input is correct, the number of P's must be exactly n-1. So perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then assign as P, else assign as S. Then, check if the number of P's is exactly n-1. If yes, then proceed. If not, then perhaps there are some strings that are both prefix and suffix, and we need to adjust their assignments.\n\nBut how can we handle that?\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. Then, collect all the input strings that are prefixes. Since the correct s must have exactly n-1 prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1), the number of input strings that are prefixes of s must be exactly n-1. However, in cases where some strings are both prefix and suffix, they can be counted in either group. But the problem says that the input is correct, so for the correct s, the input strings must be exactly the prefixes and suffixes. So for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. Therefore, for the correct s, the set of input strings is exactly the union of the prefixes and suffixes of s. Therefore, when we check for each input string, if it is a prefix of s, then it's a prefix, otherwise it's a suffix. However, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then it can be considered as either. But in that case, the code would need to choose whether to count it as a prefix or a suffix. However, since the total number of prefixes is n-1, the code can proceed by checking for each input string whether it is a prefix, and if so, count it as a prefix, else as a suffix. Then, if the total number of P's is exactly n-1, then it's correct. Otherwise, we need to adjust.\n\nBut how can that happen? Let's think. Suppose the correct s is such that some input strings are both prefix and suffix. For example, for s = \"aaa\", the input strings include two \"a\" (for length 1). Each of these is both a prefix and a suffix. So when processing the input strings, for each \"a\", the code will check if it's a prefix. It is, so it's marked as P. But then, since there are two \"a\" strings, the code would count two P's for length 1. However, in reality, only one of them can be a prefix (the other must be a suffix). Therefore, this approach would overcount the number of P's.\n\nSo the problem with this approach is that when a string is both a prefix and a suffix, the code may assign it as P, leading to more P's than allowed. Hence, this approach may not work.\n\nAlternative idea: For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, and there are not enough P's yet, assign as P. Otherwise, assign as S. But how to implement that?\n\nAlternatively, collect all the prefixes of s, and then for each input string, if it's in the prefixes list, assign as P, else S. But how to collect all the prefixes? Well, the prefixes of s are exactly the strings of length 1 to n-1, each being the first k characters of s. Similarly for suffixes. So for the candidate s, the set of prefixes is {s[0...k] for k in 1..n-1}, and the suffixes are {s[n-k ... n-1] for k in 1..n-1}.\n\nBut the input strings may contain duplicates. So for example, if two input strings are the same and are both prefixes of s, then they would both be considered as prefixes.\n\nSo for the candidate s, the correct way is to collect all the prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes set. If yes, then assign P, else S. However, since the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes, each input string must be in exactly one of the sets (prefixes or suffixes). But in cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, like \"a\" in the example, it's present in both sets. However, the input has two copies of it, and one must be assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to determine which one is which?\n\nIn that case, the code needs to assign exactly one of the two copies as P and the other as S. But how to do that?\n\nWell, for the candidate s, the number of prefixes is exactly n-1. So the code can collect all the prefixes of s (each of length 1 to n-1). For example, for s = \"aaa\", the prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\" (but since n=3, the prefixes of length 1 and 2 are \"a\" and \"aa\"). The suffixes of s are \"a\", \"aa\".\n\nSo the input strings would be \"a\", \"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\". For each of these, the code needs to assign P or S. For the two \"a\" strings, one must be P and the other S. Similarly for the two \"aa\" strings.\n\nBut how to decide which is which?\n\nThe problem says that any valid assignment is acceptable. So perhaps for each input string, if it's a prefix of s, and there are multiple instances, we can assign some as P and others as S, ensuring that the total number of P's is n-1.\n\nBut how to do this programmatically?\n\nOne approach is to generate for the candidate s, the list of prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each input string, check if it's in the prefixes. If so, assign P, else S. However, if the input string is in both prefixes and suffixes, then we need to count how many times it appears in the input and assign accordingly. But how to ensure that the total number of P's is exactly n-1.\n\nAlternatively, the code can collect all the prefixes of s, and for each input string, if it is a prefix of s, then we can assign it as P, but only if we haven't already used up all the required P's. But how to track that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the better approach is to generate for the candidate s, the list of all prefixes and suffixes, and then for each input string, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix. However, since the input is guaranteed to be correct, there must be exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. Therefore, for each input string, it must be in exactly one of the two sets (prefixes or suffixes), or in both. But when in both, we have to assign it to either P or S, but ensuring that the total count is correct.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think of the example where s is \"aaa\" and input strings are two \"a\" and two \"aa\". The prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\", and the suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". So the input strings are exactly these four. For the output, we need to assign two P and two S. For the two \"a\" strings, one must be P and one S. Similarly for the two \"aa\" strings.\n\nBut how can the code determine that? Well, for the code, when processing each input string, if it's in the prefixes, we can mark it as P, but only if there are still P's left to assign. Otherwise, mark as S.\n\nBut how to track the number of P's and S's.\n\nPerhaps, the code can do the following:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined, generate all the prefixes of s (each of lengths 1..n-1). Collect them into a set. Similarly generate all suffixes of s. Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes. However, since the input may have duplicates, we need to count how many times each string appears in the input and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nAn alternative approach is to create a list of all the prefixes and suffixes of s. For example, the prefixes are the list [s[0..0], s[0..1], ..., s[0..n-2]] (lengths 1..n-1). Similarly for suffixes [s[1..n-1], s[2..n-1], ..., s[n-1..n-1]] (lengths n-1 down to 1). Then, the input strings must be exactly these 2n-2 strings. So for each input string, it's in either the prefixes or the suffixes list. But since there may be duplicates, for example, in the case of \"aaa\", the prefixes and suffixes lists will have overlapping elements.\n\nSo for the code, once we have the candidate s, we can generate all the prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each input string, check whether it's in the prefixes list. However, since there are duplicates, perhaps we need to track the occurrences.\n\nBut how? For example, if the input has two copies of \"a\", and the prefixes list contains one \"a\" and the suffixes list contains one \"a\", then each of the two input strings must be assigned to one of P or S.\n\nBut how to assign them?\n\nMaybe the code can process the input strings, and for each one, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, assign as P, else as S. However, in cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, this may lead to overcounting. But since the input is correct, the total number of P's must be exactly n-1. Therefore, even if some strings are both, the code's assignment would count them as P, but the number of P's would be exactly n-1. How?\n\nWait, let's take the example where s is \"aaa\" and the input strings are two \"a\" and two \"aa\". The prefixes list is [\"a\", \"aa\"], and the suffixes list is [\"a\", \"aa\"]. So for each input string, the code would check if it is a prefix of s. All four input strings are prefixes. Therefore, the code would assign all four as P, which is wrong. But that's impossible, since there are only two prefixes. Therefore, this approach is flawed.\n\nAh, here's the problem. The code checks if the input string is a prefix of s, but there are multiple input strings that are prefixes of s. However, the actual number of prefixes is n-1. So the code must assign exactly n-1 of the input strings as P, and the rest as S. So the previous approach of checking if it's a prefix of s and marking it as P is incorrect, because that would mark all of them as P, which is more than n-1.\n\nSo what's the correct way?\n\nWe need to assign exactly n-1 input strings as prefixes (each of the required lengths) and the rest as suffixes. So the code must know for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s. But how to do that when there are overlaps.\n\nThe key insight here is that for the candidate s, the prefixes are exactly the strings of length 1..n-1 that are the first k characters of s. Similarly for suffixes. Therefore, for each input string, if it is a prefix of s, then it must be exactly one of those prefixes. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nTherefore, for the code, once we have s, we can generate all the prefixes (as a list) and all the suffixes (as a list). Then, the input strings are exactly the union of these two lists. So for each input string, it's in the prefixes list or the suffixes list. However, since the input may contain duplicates (like in the example), the code needs to determine for each input string whether it is in the prefixes list (and thus should be marked as P) or in the suffixes list (marked as S). However, if it is in both, then we have to decide based on the counts.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, in the case of \"aaa\", the prefixes list is [\"a\", \"aa\"], and the suffixes list is [\"a\", \"aa\"]. So the input strings are exactly these four. Now, the code needs to assign exactly two P's (the prefixes) and two S's (the suffixes). But each of the input strings is in both lists. So how to assign them?\n\nThe answer is that the input strings must be matched with the prefixes and suffixes lists. For example, the first \"a\" in the input is part of the prefixes list, and the second \"a\" is part of the suffixes list. Similarly for the \"aa\" strings.\n\nBut how can the code know which input string corresponds to which?\n\nThe problem allows any valid assignment. So perhaps the code can generate for the candidate s, the list of all prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes list. However, since there are multiple instances, the code can count how many times each string appears in the prefixes list and suffixes list, and assign accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, the code can generate for the candidate s, the list of prefixes (with multiplicity) and the list of suffixes (with multiplicity). Then, for each input string, compare against these lists.\n\nBut how to generate the lists with multiplicity?\n\nFor example, in the case of s = \"aaa\", the prefixes list is [\"a\", \"aa\"], and the suffixes list is [\"a\", \"aa\"]. So the combined list of prefixes and suffixes is [\"a\", \"aa\", \"a\", \"aa\"].\n\nBut the input strings are exactly that. So for each input string, it's in the prefixes list or the suffixes list. However, the code needs to assign each input string to either P or S, ensuring that the total number of P's is n-1 (i.e., 2 in this case).\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor the candidate s:\n\n- Generate the list of all prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1). Let's call this prefix_list. For example, for s of length 3, prefix_list is [s[0], s[0:2]].\n\n- Generate the list of all suffixes (each of length 1 to n-1). Let's call this suffix_list. For example, for s of length 3, suffix_list is [s[2], s[1:3]].\n\nNow, the input strings are exactly the combination of prefix_list and suffix_list. So the code can create a multiset (like a Counter) for the prefixes and a multiset for the suffixes. Then, for each input string, the code can check if it is present in the prefix multiset. If so, assign as P, else as S. However, this approach requires that the code tracks the counts of each string in the prefix and suffix lists.\n\nBut how to do this in Python?\n\nAn alternative approach is to create for the candidate s, a list of all the prefixes (with their multiplicities) and a list of all the suffixes (with their multiplicities). Then, for each input string, we can check whether it is present in the prefixes list. But since the input strings are exactly the combination of the prefixes and suffixes, each input string must appear in either the prefixes list or the suffixes list (or both). However, when it appears in both, we need to decide which to assign.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, in the case of \"a\" appearing in both lists, the code needs to assign one occurrence as P and another as S.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined, generate prefix_list and suffix_list. Then, for each input string, we can check if it is in prefix_list. But to account for duplicates, we can track how many times each string has been used as a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how to do this? For example, create a Counter for the prefix_list and a Counter for the suffix_list. Then, for each input string in the input list, we can check if it's in the prefix Counter. If it is, and the count is positive, then assign as P and decrement the count. Else, assign as S and decrement the count in the suffix Counter.\n\nThis way, for each input string, we assign it as P if possible, considering the available counts in the prefix and suffix lists.\n\nLet me think with the example of s = \"aaa\", prefix_list is [\"a\", \"aa\"], suffix_list is [\"a\", \"aa\"]. The prefix Counter would have {\"a\": 1, \"aa\": 1}, and the suffix Counter would have the same.\n\nNow, for the input strings, say, the first input is \"a\". We check if it's in prefix Counter. Yes, count is 1. Assign as P, decrement prefix Counter to {\"a\":0, \"aa\":1}. Next input is \"a\" again. Now, prefix Counter has \"a\": 0, so check suffix Counter. It has \"a\":1. Assign as S, decrement suffix Counter to {\"a\":0, \"aa\":1}. Then, the next input is \"aa\". Check prefix Counter: \"aa\" has 1. Assign as P, decrement to 0. The last input is \"aa\", check prefix Counter (0) and assign as S. So the result would be P S P S. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the input strings are in the order [\"a\", \"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\"], then the output would be P S P S. Alternatively, if the order was different, the code would assign accordingly.\n\nThis seems to handle the case where strings are in both prefix and suffix lists. So the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nSo the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Find the candidate s. This is done by checking all pairs of the two strings of length n-1. For each pair (A, B), check if B[:-1] == A[1:], then s_candidate = A + B[-1]. Also check if A[:-1] == B[1:], then s_candidate = B + A[-1]. For each such candidate s_candidate, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n   Once a valid s_candidate is found, proceed to generate the answer.\n\n2. Once s_candidate is found, generate prefix_list and suffix_list for s_candidate.\n\n3. Create a Counter for the prefixes and a Counter for the suffixes.\n\n4. For each input string in the original input order, check if the string is present in the prefix Counter. If yes, assign 'P', decrement the count in the prefix Counter. Else, assign 'S', decrement the count in the suffix Counter.\n\n   This ensures that we assign exactly the required number of P's and S's.\n\nNow, the challenge is step 1: finding the candidate s_candidate.\n\nHow to find s_candidate?\n\nThe input has exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. For the length n-1, there are two strings. Let's call them len_n_minus_1_strings.\n\nFor each pair of these two strings, say A and B, we can check if they can be the prefix and suffix of the candidate s. For example, if A is the prefix of length n-1 and B is the suffix of length n-1, then the full string s_candidate must be A + B[-1], and B must be s_candidate[1:]. Which implies that B must be equal to A[1:] + B[-1]. Which means that B[:-1] must be equal to A[1:].\n\nSimilarly, if B is the prefix and A is the suffix, then s_candidate is B + A[-1], and A must be s_candidate[1:], which implies that A[:-1] must be equal to B[1:].\n\nSo for each pair (A, B) in the len_n_minus_1_strings, we can check these two possibilities.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate s_candidate, we need to verify that all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\nOnce such a candidate is found, proceed to generate the answer.\n\nBut how to find the candidate s_candidate? There may be multiple possibilities. For example, in the third sample input, n=2, the input strings are \"a\" and \"c\". The two possible candidates are \"ac\" (with prefix \"a\" and suffix \"c\") and \"ca\" (with prefix \"c\" and suffix \"a\"). Both are valid. The code can choose either and proceed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Get all the strings of length n-1.\n\n- For each pair (A, B) in these two strings:\n\n   a. Check if B[:-1] == A[1:]. If yes, then candidate_s = A + B[-1].\n\n   b. Check if A[:-1] == B[1:]. If yes, then candidate_s = B + A[-1].\n\n   For each candidate_s generated in this way, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of candidate_s.\n\n   Once a valid candidate_s is found, proceed to generate the answer.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of candidate_s?\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of candidate_s or a suffix of candidate_s.\n\nIf all input strings satisfy this, then candidate_s is valid.\n\nOnce a valid candidate_s is found, proceed to generate the answer.\n\nBut there might be multiple candidates. For example, in the third sample input, there are two candidates. The code can choose any of them.\n\nNow, the code must process the input and find the first valid candidate_s.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings into a list.\n\nCollect all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\nFor each pair of these two strings (there are two possibilities: (A, B) and (B, A)), check the two possibilities:\n\nCheck if B[:-1] == A[1:], then candidate_s = A + B[-1].\n\nCheck if A[:-1] == B[1:], then candidate_s = B + A[-1].\n\nFor each generated candidate_s, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nOnce a valid candidate_s is found, proceed to generate the answer.\n\nBut wait, there may be more than one candidate_s. For example, in the first sample input, the correct s is \"ababa\", and the two strings of length 4 are \"abab\" and \"baba\". Let's see:\n\nFor A = \"abab\" (length 4, n=5, n-1=4), B = \"baba\".\n\nCheck if B[:-1] (i.e., \"bab\") equals A[1:] (i.e., \"bab\")? Yes. So candidate_s is A + B[-1] = \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\". Then, check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of this s.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, proceed.\n\nSo the code can generate all possible candidate_s from the two strings of length n-1, and for each, check if all input strings are valid.\n\nOnce a valid candidate is found, proceed to generate the answer.\n\nNow, the code must implement this.\n\nBut what if there are multiple candidates? For example, in the third sample input, n=2. The two strings are \"a\" and \"c\". The two possible candidates are \"ac\" and \"ca\". Both are valid. The code can choose either.\n\nOnce the candidate is found, generate the answer as per the steps discussed earlier.\n\nNow, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list of 2n-2 strings.\n\nCollect the two strings of length n-1.\n\nGenerate possible candidates from these two strings.\n\nFor each candidate:\n\n   Check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\n   If yes, proceed.\n\nOnce a candidate is found, generate the answer.\n\nNow, how to check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of the candidate s_candidate?\n\nFor each string in the input list:\n\n   if it is a prefix of s_candidate or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nIn Python, for a string s_candidate, a string t is a prefix if s_candidate.startswith(t). Similarly, it is a suffix if s_candidate.endswith(t).\n\nSo for each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. If all are, then proceed.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, proceed to generate the answer.\n\nNow, the code can proceed to generate the answer as follows:\n\nGenerate prefix_list = [s_candidate[:i] for i in range(1, n)].\n\nGenerate suffix_list = [s_candidate[i:] for i in range(1, n)].\n\nThen, create a Counter for prefix_list and a Counter for suffix_list.\n\nThen, for each input string in the original input order, check if it is in the prefix Counter. If yes, assign 'P' and decrement the count. Else, assign 'S' and decrement the suffix Counter.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python? Using collections.Counter.\n\nBut since the same string may appear multiple times in the prefix_list or suffix_list, the Counter will track their frequencies.\n\nFor example, in the case where s_candidate is \"aaa\", the prefix_list is [\"a\", \"aa\"], and the suffix_list is [\"a\", \"aa\"]. The Counter for prefix_list would be {'a':1, 'aa':1}, and similarly for the suffix list.\n\nNow, for each input string, we check if the current count in the prefix",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is not specified. Our task is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate String**: The candidate string `s` can be derived from the two longest improper prefixes and suffixes (of length `n-1`). By checking possible combinations of these two strings, we can generate potential candidates for `s`.\n2. **Validate Candidate String**: For each candidate string, verify if all given input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of the candidate.\n3. **Generate Result**: Once a valid candidate string is found, determine the correct assignment of 'P' and 'S' by comparing each input string against the prefixes and suffixes of the candidate string, ensuring the correct count of 'P' and 'S'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates_len_n_minus_1 = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates_len_n_minus_1.append(s)\n    \n    # Generate possible candidate s\n    possible_s = set()\n    for a in candidates_len_n_minus_1:\n        for b in candidates_len_n_minus_1:\n            if a != b:\n                # Check if a is prefix and b is suffix\n                if b[:-1] == a[1:]:\n                    candidate = a + b[-1]\n                    possible_s.add(candidate)\n                # Check if b is prefix and a is suffix\n                if a[:-1] == b[1:]:\n                    candidate = b + a[-1]\n                    possible_s.add(candidate)\n    \n    # Now check each candidate to see if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes\n    for candidate in possible_s:\n        valid = True\n        for s in strings:\n            if not candidate.startswith(s) and not candidate.endswith(s):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            # Found the candidate, now generate the answer\n            prefix_list = [candidate[:i] for i in range(1, n)]\n            suffix_list = [candidate[i:] for i in range(1, n)]\n            prefix_counter = Counter(prefix_list)\n            suffix_counter = Counter(suffix_list)\n            \n            result = []\n            for s_input in strings:\n                if prefix_counter[s_input] > 0:\n                    result.append('P')\n                    prefix_counter[s_input] -= 1\n                else:\n                    result.append('S')\n                    suffix_counter[s_input] -= 1\n            print(''.join(result))\n            return\n    \n    # If no candidate found (though problem says it's guaranteed)\n    # This part should not be reached as per problem statement\n    print('')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Longest Prefixes/Suffixes**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified and used to generate potential candidate strings for `s`.\n3. **Validating Candidates**: Each candidate string is validated by checking if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n4. **Generating Result**: For a valid candidate string, the prefixes and suffixes are counted using `Counter`.
