The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to match the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the problem reduces to counting how many even and odd chests there are, and then matching them with the available even and odd keys. But wait, the keys can be used once, and chests can be opened once. So the maximum possible is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, yes! Because each even chest needs an odd key. So if there are E_chests even chests and O_keys odd keys, the number of possible matches here is min(E_chests, O_keys). Similarly, for the odd chests (O_chests) and even keys (E_keys), it's min(O_chests, E_keys). Adding those two gives the total maximum possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nYes! That makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parities. \n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests=2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see. 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7).\n\nThen min(3, 1) is 1 (for even chests matched with odd keys). Then min(2, 3) is 2 (odd chests matched with even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output of 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example: input is 5 1. Chests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So min(5, 1) is 1. And min(0, 0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is zero. So min(1, 0) is 0. And odd_chests is zero, even_keys is 4. min(0, 4) is 0. Total 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid. \n\nNow, the steps to code this:\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list of a_i, count even and odd. Then read list of b_j, count even and odd. Then compute the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's straightforward. Let's code this.\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd? For each number in a list, check if it's even or odd. For example, for a_i, even_chest is a_i % 2 == 0. Similarly for keys.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the a list, then the b list.\n\ncount_even_chest = number of elements in a where x % 2 == 0.\n\ncount_odd_chest = n - count_even_chest.\n\nSimilarly for keys:\n\ncount_even_key = number of elements in b where x % 2 == 0.\n\ncount_odd_key = m - count_even_key.\n\nThen answer is min(count_even_chest, count_odd_key) + min(count_odd_chest, count_even_key).\n\nYes. That's the formula.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. The input is given as per the examples. Wait, the sample input shows three test cases. But the actual input is given as per the problem's input format. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then the second line has n integers, third line m integers. So for each test case, it's three lines. But in the sample input, there are three test cases given as separate lines. Wait, no. Looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three inputs. For example, the first input is '5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', which is the first test case. Then the second is '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', etc. So the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the input format. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nThe input is given as follows:\n\nFirst line contains n and m.\n\nSecond line has n integers.\n\nThird line has m integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows three separate test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, but looking at the sample input, the user provided three different test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as per one test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the first test case, then the second line is the second test case, etc. But that's not standard. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m ... \n\nSo each test case is given as three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases, each as three lines. But in the sample input, the input is given as a list of three entries, perhaps as separate test cases. However, the actual code should process a single test case. Wait, but the sample input shows that the code is given three test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per one test case. So perhaps the user made a mistake here. Wait, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nWhich is three test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement's input format says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as a separate input. But in reality, the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the input format. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But that's probably because the user is providing multiple test cases for the example. However, the actual code is supposed to read from stdin, which would be a single test case. Wait, but the problem's sample input shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Or perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read from standard input, which would be a single test case. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then the second line has n integers, third line m integers. So the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But that's probably because the user is showing multiple examples. However, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which would be a single test case. \n\nBut the user's sample input is given as a list of three test cases, but the code is supposed to process them as separate test cases. However, the problem statement says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the code should read input from standard input. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, process each test case. But how are the test cases given? For example, the sample input is given as three separate test cases, each with three lines. So the code needs to process each of them. However, in programming competition problems, typically, the code is supposed to process a single test case. But perhaps the sample input is given as three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output. The sample input is given as three separate test cases, and the output is three separate outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input format says that the first line contains n and m. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given in three lines. \n\nBut how to read that? For example, in Python, reading from stdin, the code can read all lines at once, split into groups of three lines. But how to handle that. \n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of three test cases. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\nThird test case is:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nSo the code must read each test case as three lines. But in practice, how does the code know how many test cases there are? Because the problem's input isn't specified as multiple test cases. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the original problem statement's input format doesn't mention that. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Let me check again.\n\nThe original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m ... \n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three outputs. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how to know how many test cases there are? For example, in programming contests, sometimes the code is supposed to process multiple test cases until EOF. But in this case, the problem's input may be multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input format does not mention that. \n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Let's check the sample input again. For example, the first line of the sample input is '5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', which is three lines. Then the next is another three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. \n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into groups of three lines. However, in practice, for programming competition problems, sometimes the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous. \n\nBut looking at the original problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input format says that the first line contains n and m. So perhaps the sample input is a list of multiple test cases, and the code is supposed to process them all. \n\nBut how to read that? Well, in programming competitions, sometimes the code reads until EOF. So for example, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them in groups of three. \n\nBut how to do that in Python? Let's think. For example, the code can read all lines at once, then process each group of three lines. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the sample input is presented in a way that each test case is given as a separate input. However, the original problem's input format is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads a single test case, and the sample input is written as three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. \n\nBut the sample output shows three outputs. So this suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. \n\nBut the problem's original input format says that the first line contains n and m. Which implies that the code should read a single test case. \n\nThis is conflicting. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. \n\nBut how to know? Well, looking back at the problem's note, the sample input is given as three separate test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. \n\nIn that case, the code should read all input lines, split into groups of three lines. \n\nBut how to do that in Python? Well, perhaps the code can read all lines from stdin, split into groups of three lines. For example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, process the lines in groups of three. For example, for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\nBut that would require that the number of lines is divisible by 3. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as three test cases, but in reality, the code should process a single test case. \n\nBut the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, but the problem says that the code should read input from standard input, which for the competition problem would be a single test case. \n\nThis is very confusing. However, looking back at the problem's sample input and output, the code is expected to output three answers for the three test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. \n\nBut how? For example, the code could read all lines, then process each test case as follows: for each test case, read three lines. \n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\" — which is three lines. Wait, no. The first line is \"5 4\", then the second line is the list of a_i, third line is the list of b_j. So each test case is three lines. \n\nTherefore, the code should read the input as multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m. Which suggests that the code should read one test case. \n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. This is a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input and output show that the code should process multiple test cases. \n\nThis is a problem. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. \n\nIn that case, the code would read n and m from the first line, then the a list from the second line, and the b list from the third line. \n\nBut the sample input shows that there are three test cases, and the sample output has three answers. \n\nBut how can that be? \n\nPerhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the actual code should process multiple test cases. \n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is given as per the input format, which is for a single test case, but the sample shows multiple, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the code is supposed to process a single test case. \n\nWell, given that the problem's sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the problem's input format is for one test case, perhaps the code should process a single test case. \n\nBut the sample input and output are given as lists. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, and the sample input is given as a list of test cases. \n\nBut how to read that in Python? \n\nLet me think. For example, the code could read all the input as a list of lines, then process each test case as follows. Each test case is three lines. So the first line is n and m, the second line is the a list, third line is the b list. \n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the code would process three test cases. \n\nBut how to read that in Python. \n\nWell, in the code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        # Read n and m\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, m = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        b = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        # process this test case\n        even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n        even_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n        res = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n        print(res)\n\nBut this code will process all test cases as groups of three lines. \n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: 5 4\n\nLine 2: 9 14 6 2 11\n\nLine 3: 8 4 7 20\n\nThen the next test case is:\n\nLine 4: 5 1\n\nLine 5: 2 4 6 8 10\n\nLine 6: 5\n\nThen the next test case is:\n\nLine 7: 1 4\n\nLine 8: 10\n\nLine 9: 20 30 40 50\n\nSo the code would read them correctly. \n\nBut how to handle cases where the input has leading/trailing spaces or empty lines? Well, the code skips empty lines. \n\nBut the problem says that the input is given according to the input format, which for each test case is three lines. \n\nSo the code above would work. \n\nBut the original problem's input may have only one test case. However, the sample input has three. \n\nBut given that the sample output is three answers, the code must process multiple test cases. \n\nThus, the code should process all test cases as groups of three lines. \n\nTherefore, the code is as above. \n\nTesting this code against the sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_chest is 3 (14,6,2). odd_chest is 2. \n\nkeys: [8,4,7,20]. even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7). \n\nres = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3 → correct.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=5, m=1. a is [2,4,6,8,10]. even_chest=5. odd_chest=0. keys: [5] → even_key=0, odd_key=1. res is min(5,1) + min(0,0) → 1 + 0 = 1 → correct.\n\nThird test case: n=1, m=4. a is [10] → even_chest=1, odd_chest=0. keys: [20,30,40,50] → even_key=4, odd_key=0. res is min(1,0) + min(0,4) → 0 + 0 = 0 → correct.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where there are zero even chests. For example, n=1, m=1. a=[1], b=[2]. Then even_chest=0, odd_chest=1. even_key=1, odd_key=0. res is min(0,0) + min(1,1) → 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. a=[1], b=[1]. sum is 2, even. So no match. res is 0. \n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: even_chest is 2, odd_key is 3. So min(2,3)=2. \n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code should be written as such. Now, implementing this in Python. Also, note that in Python, for reading input, sometimes the code can read via input() function, but for multiple test cases, it's better to read all lines at once.\n\nBut in some cases, the code may have multiple test cases. So the code above should handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nThe code needs to read from stdin, and process each test case. The code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout. \n\nThus, the code would look like this:\n\nRead all lines, process in groups of three.\n\nBut the code may also have to handle cases where the lines are split across multiple reads, but in practice, using sys.stdin.read().splitlines() is safe.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input_lines):\n        # Read n and m\n        if idx >= len(input_lines):\n            break\n        line = input_lines[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, m = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        # Read a list\n        a = list(map(int, input_lines[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        # Read b list\n        b = list(map(int, input_lines[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        # Compute counts\n        even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n        even_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n        res = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the input has empty lines? For example, if there are empty lines between test cases. The code skips them. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is given properly. So the code should work.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nThe input is three test cases. The code processes them and outputs 3, 1, 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThus, this code should be correct.\n",

Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains the number of chests and keys, the second line contains the chest numbers, and the third line contains the key numbers.\n- **Counting Even and Odd Values**: For each test case, we count how many chests and keys are even or odd.\n- **Calculating Maximum Openable Chests**: Using the counts of even and odd chests and keys, we determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal pairings using simple counting and comparison operations, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n + m) per test case, which is efficient given the problem constraints.",
