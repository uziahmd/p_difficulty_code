His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the results of two tours, but they are not linked to names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of first and second tour scores for the participants, and find the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have.\n\nThe key here is that Vasya's total is at least x. But since the teacher knows that he got at least x points, but doesn't know exactly which pair of a_i and b_j he has. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points in total. However, the actual scores for the first and second tours are given as lists. But the problem says that each participant is present in both tours. So, the actual data is that there are n participants, each with a first tour score (a_i) and a second tour score (b_j). But the problem is that the a and b lists are not paired. For example, the first participant's a_1 is their first tour score, but their second tour score could be any of the b's. But the problem says that the teacher has the results of both tours, but they are not linked. So, the actual pairing of a_i and b_j for each participant is unknown. However, we know that there exists some pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. Because it's guaranteed.\n\nOur task is to find the best and worst possible rank Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings of the a and b lists. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the teacher needs to find two numbers: the best and worst place Vasya could have. The total results' table is sorted by the sum of points. If multiple people have same sum, the jury can assign places as they choose. So, for the best possible rank, we want to arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged to give him the best rank. For the worst possible rank, arrange the pairings so that Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x) and others are arranged to make his rank as bad as possible.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think. For the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to select a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible, and then arrange the other pairs so that as many as possible participants have a sum less than or equal to Vasya's sum. Wait, no. Because the best possible rank is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged to have lower sums. But since the jury can assign ranks when there are ties, the best possible rank is 1 if there's a way to have Vasya's sum be the maximum possible. So for the best possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (which would be the maximum a_i + b_j, but subject to being at least x?), then count how many people can have a sum greater than or equal to that. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So, in the best case, we can choose a pair for Vasya that gives him the maximum possible sum (so that he is as high as possible), and then the best possible rank is determined by how many people can have a sum higher than that. But since the jury can arrange the order for ties, if Vasya's sum is the maximum, then he can be first. If there are others with the same sum, he can be placed first.\n\nWait, but how do we model the best possible scenario for Vasya's rank? The best possible scenario is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and as few people as possible have a sum higher than that. So, to find the best possible rank, we need to maximize Vasya's sum, and then count the number of people who can have a sum strictly greater than that. Then the best possible rank is that count + 1. But wait, if there are people with the same sum as Vasya, the jury can assign him a better rank. So for the best possible rank, we can assume that all those people with the same sum as Vasya are placed after him. Therefore, the best possible rank is the number of people with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1.\n\nBut how do we find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, given that he has at least x points?\n\nWait, the problem states that the teacher knows that Vasy",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves considering all possible pairings of scores from the two tours and determining the optimal scenarios for both best and worst ranks.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Best Possible Rank**:\n   - To find the best possible rank, we need to maximize Vasya's total score. This is done by pairing the highest scores from the first tour with the highest scores from the second tour.\n   - Once we have the maximum possible score for Vasya, we count how many participants can have a higher total score than this maximum. The best possible rank is then determined by this count plus one.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**:\n   - To find the worst possible rank, we need to minimize Vasya's total score while ensuring it meets the minimum threshold `x`. This is done by pairing the lowest scores from the first tour with the lowest scores from the second tour.\n   - Once we have the minimum possible score for Vasya (that is at least `x`), we count how many participants can have a higher or equal total score than this minimum. The worst possible rank is then determined by this count plus one.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    n, x = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort a and b for best and worst scenarios\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Best scenario: maximize Vasya's total\n    # Pair largest a with largest b\n    max_vasya = 0\n    i = n - 1\n    j = n - 1\n    # Find the maximum possible sum that is >= x\n    # We can take the top a and top b\n    # However, we need to ensure that there exists at least one pair >= x\n    # Since it's guaranteed, we can proceed\n    max_total = a_sorted[-1] + b_sorted[-1]\n    # Now count how many pairs have sum > max_total\n    # But since we are choosing the best case, we can assume that Vasya has max_total\n    # So count the number of pairs that can have sum > max_total\n    # For that, we can use a sorted list of a and sorted list of b\n    # For each a_i, find how many b_j > (max_total - a_i)\n    # But since max_total is a_sorted[-1] + b_sorted[-1], any other pair will be <= max_total\n    # So no one can have a sum > max_total\n    # Thus, best rank is 1\n    best_rank = 1\n    \n    # Worst scenario: minimize Vasya's total but >= x\n    # Pair smallest a with smallest b\n    # But need to find the minimal possible sum >= x\n    # We need to find the minimal sum s such that s >= x\n    # To find the minimal s, we can find the minimal possible sum that is >= x\n    # How?
