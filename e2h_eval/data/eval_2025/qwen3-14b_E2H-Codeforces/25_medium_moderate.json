При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part has at least one character but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where one message completely covers the other) isn't considered an error. Similarly, just concatenating two messages without overlapping isn't considered an error.\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if there exists a string s such that t is formed by overlapping two copies of s with some positive overlap less than len(s). If possible, output YES and any possible s. Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible lengths of s. Since t is formed by two copies of s merged with some overlap. Let's denote the length of s as L. Then, the length of t would be 2L - k, where k is the length of the overlapping part. Since k is between 1 and L-1 (inclusive), then the length of t must satisfy:\n\nFor some k in [1, L-1], 2L -k = len(t).\n\nBut since L is the length of s, which is the original message, we can express L in terms of len(t) and k.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible k, we can find possible L. Let me think.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation: len(t) = 2L -k. So, L = (len(t) + k)/2. But since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting L gives us constraints on k.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to iterate over possible values of k and see if they can lead to valid L.\n\nAlternatively, since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting L from the equation:\n\nk must be between 1 and ( (len(t) +k)/2 ) -1 ?\n\nHmm, maybe that's getting complicated. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose that the original string s has length L. When two copies of s are merged with an overlap of k characters, the resulting string t has length 2L -k. Therefore, len(t) = 2L -k → k = 2L - len(t). But since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1\n\nLet me solve these inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L - len(t) ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ len(t) +1 → L ≥ (len(t)+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1 → 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1 → L ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nSo combining both, L must be in the range [(len(t)+1)/2, len(t)-1].\n\nBut since L must be an integer, because it's the length of the original string s. So for each possible L in that range, we can check if there exists a k (which is 2L - len(t)) that satisfies 1 ≤k ≤ L-1. Wait, since k is determined once L is chosen.\n\nSo for each possible L in the range [(len(t)+1)/2, len(t)-1], we can compute k = 2L - len(t). Then check if k is between 1 and L-1. But since L was chosen based on the inequalities, this should hold.\n\nWait, let me see. For example, for L in [(len(t)+1)/2, len(t)-1], then:\n\nk = 2L - len(t).\n\nLet me take the lower bound of L: L_min = ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ). For example, if len(t) is even, say 4, then (4+1)/2 = 2.5 → L_min is 3. Then k would be 2*3 -4 = 2. For L=3, k=2. Which is between 1 and 2 (since L-1 is 2). So yes.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound of L: len(t)-1. Then k = 2*(len(t)-1) - len(t) = len(t) - 2. Now, since L is len(t)-1, L-1 = len(t)-2. So k is equal to len(t)-2, which is exactly L-1. So the upper bound of k is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, for each possible L in the range from ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ) to len(t)-1, inclusive, we can compute k = 2L - len(t), and check if the overlapping condition holds.\n\nOnce we have L and k, we need to check if the first s (of length L) and the second s (also of length L) can overlap with k characters. That is, the last k characters of the first s must equal the first k characters of the second s.\n\nBut since the merged string t is the combination of the first s and the second s with the overlapping part merged. So the merged string would be s[0...L-k-1] + s[k...L-1] + s[L-k ... L-1] ? No, wait. Wait, when you have two copies of s, overlapping by k characters. The first s is of length L. The second s is also of length L. The overlapping part is k characters. So the merged string would be of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k. Which is the len(t).\n\nSo, the merged string t must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:]. Because the first s is written, and the second s starts from position k. So the merged string is s + s[k:] ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Let's imagine two strings s and s, overlapping by k characters. So the first s ends at position L-1, and the second s starts at position L -k. So the merged string would be s[0...L -k -1] + s[L -k ... L-1] (from first s) and then s[L -k ... L-1] (from second s)? No, that's not right. Wait, when you have two copies of s, overlapping by k characters. So the first s is placed, and the second s is shifted so that the first k characters of the second s overlap with the last k of the first s. So the merged string is the first s, but then the second s starts from position (L -k) of the first s. So the merged string is s[0 ... L -k -1] (the part of the first s that is not overlapped) followed by the entire second s. But since the first s's last k characters are the same as the second s's first k characters, they are merged. So the merged string is s[0 ... L -k -1] + s[L -k ... ] (the rest of the second s). But since the second s is of length L, the merged string is length (L -k) + L = 2L -k, which matches.\n\nSo the merged string t must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:], but the first part is s[0 ... L -k -1] (length L -k) and then the rest is s[k ... L-1] (length L -k) plus the rest of the second s? No, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, the merged string is s + s[k:]. Because the first s is written, and then the second s starts from position k. So the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k. So for example, if s is 'abcde' (L=5) and k=2, then the merged string would be 'abcde' + 'cde' (s[k:] is 'cde') → 'abcdedec'? Wait, no. Wait, the first s is abcde, and the second s is abcde. They are overlapped by k=2. So the first s ends with 'de', the second s starts with 'ab'. Wait, no, the overlapping is when the end of the first s and the start of the second s match. So the overlapping part is k characters. So the last k characters of the first s must match the first k characters of the second s. So for example, if s is 'ababa', and k=3, then the last 3 characters of the first s is 'aba', and the first 3 of the second s is 'aba', so overlapping them would result in a merged string of 'ababa' + 'ba' (since the first s's first 2 characters, then the second s's remaining 2 characters after the overlapping part). Wait, no. The merged string would be the first s (length 5) and the second s (length 5) overlapping by 3 characters. So the total length is 5 + 5 -3 = 7. So the merged string is the first s, but the last 3 characters are overlapped with the first 3 of the second s. So the merged string is the first s's first (5-3) = 2 characters, followed by the entire second s. So the merged string is s[:L -k] + s. Which would be 'ab' + 'ababa' → 'abababa' (length 2+5=7). So yes, the merged string is s[:L -k] + s. But since the overlapping part is k, the first s's last k characters are the same as the second s's first k characters. So the merged string is s[:L -k] + s.\n\nBut how do we check this?\n\nGiven t, for a candidate L and k, we need to check whether t equals s[:L -k] + s. But since s is unknown, how can we find it?\n\nAlternatively, since s is the original message, and the merged string t is s[:L -k] + s. So the entire t must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:], but that's not helpful. Wait, the merged string is s[:L -k] + s. So the length of t is (L -k) + L = 2L -k. Which is correct.\n\nBut how can we get s from t?\n\nWell, the first part of t is s[:L -k], and then the rest of t is s. So the entire t is s[:L -k] + s. Therefore, the length of t is (L -k) + L = 2L -k. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut since we know the length of t, and L, and k, then we can split t into two parts: the first part (length L -k) and the rest (length L). But the rest is s. So the s would be the last L characters of t.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because the merged string is s[:L -k] + s. So the entire string t is of length (L -k) + L = 2L -k. So the last L characters of t must be s. Because the merged string is s[:L -k] + s. Therefore, s is the last L characters of t. So, for a candidate L, we can take s_candidate = t[-L:]. Then, check if the first part of t (before the last L characters) is equal to s_candidate[:L -k], and also check if the overlapping part is correct.\n\nBut what is k? For a given L, k is 2L - len(t). Because len(t) = 2L -k → k = 2L - len(t).\n\nSo, for each possible L in the valid range, compute k = 2L - len(t). Then check if the following conditions are met:\n\n1. k must be between 1 and L-1. Which is already ensured by the way we choose L.\n\nThen, check if the first part of t (up to len(t) - L) is equal to s_candidate's first (L -k) characters. Because s_candidate is the last L characters of t. And the first part of t is the part before the last L characters, which is of length (len(t) - L) = (2L -k) - L = L -k. So that's exactly the length of s_candidate[:L -k]. So the check is whether the first part of t (the part before the last L characters) is equal to the first (L -k) characters of s_candidate.\n\nBut since s_candidate is the last L characters of t, then the first (L -k) characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0 : L -k].\n\nBut also, the overlapping part must be that the last k characters of s_candidate (the s) must equal the first k characters of s_candidate. Because during the merging, the first s's last k characters are the same as the second s's first k characters. But since the second s is s_candidate, the first k characters of s_candidate must equal the last k characters of s_candidate. Because the first s is s_candidate, and the second s is s_candidate. So the overlapping part is that the last k characters of the first s (which is s_candidate) equals the first k of the second s (which is s_candidate). Therefore, the first k characters of s_candidate must equal the last k characters of s_candidate.\n\nWait, but the first s is s_candidate, and the second s is also s_candidate. So when they are merged with overlapping k characters, the last k of the first s must match the first k of the second s. Since both are s_candidate, that means the first k of s_candidate must equal the last k of s_candidate.\n\nSo, for the candidate s_candidate (the last L characters of t), we need to check two things:\n\na) The first part of t (the part before the last L characters) equals s_candidate[0 : L -k].\n\nb) The first k characters of s_candidate equals the last k characters of s_candidate.\n\nIf both are true, then this is a valid scenario.\n\nSo putting it all together, the algorithm steps are:\n\nFor the given string t:\n\n1. Iterate through all possible values of L in the range [(len(t)+1)//2, len(t)-1]. Because L must be an integer. For example, if len(t) is 5, then (5+1)/2 is 3, so L starts from 3 up to 4 (since len(t)-1 is 4). For each L in that range:\n\n   a. Compute k = 2L - len(t). This must be between 1 and L-1. But since L is chosen according to the earlier constraints, this should be guaranteed.\n\n   b. Check if the first part of t (before the last L characters) is equal to s_candidate[0 : L -k], where s_candidate is t[-L:].\n\n   c. Check if the first k characters of s_candidate equal the last k characters of s_candidate.\n\n   d. If both conditions are met, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\n2. If none of the L values in that range work, output NO.\n\nBut wait, why do we need to check both conditions? Because:\n\nCondition a ensures that the first part of t is the part that comes before the overlapping. Condition b ensures that the overlapping part is correct (so that the two s's can be merged properly).\n\nLet me take an example from the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'\n\nSample Output: YES and 'abrakadabra'.\n\nThe length of t is len('abrakadabrabrakadabra') → let's count. Let's see: 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. Then the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters? Or wait, the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters?\n\nWait, the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters) followed by 'abrakadabra' again. But with overlapping. Let's see the output is 'abrakadabra', which is length 11. Let's compute len(t) = 21. Then for L=11, len(t) is 21. Then k = 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. So k=1. Which is between 1 and 10 (L-1=10). So that's valid.\n\nNow, s_candidate is t[-11:] → which is 'abrakadabra' (the second occurrence). Then, check:\n\nThe first part of t is t[0: len(t)-L] → len(t) is 21, len(t)-L is 21-11=10. So first part is t[0:10] which is 'abrakadabr' (assuming the original string is 'abrakadabraabrakadabra'?), but maybe I'm getting the exact letters wrong. Anyway, the first part of t (before the last 11 characters) is of length 10. The s_candidate is 11 characters long. Then L -k is 11 -1 = 10. So the first 10 characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0:10], which is 'abrakadabr' (same as the first part of t). Then check that the first k=1 character of s_candidate (which is 'a') equals the last k=1 character of s_candidate (which is 'a'). So that's true. Hence, this is a valid case.\n\nAnother sample input is 'acacacaca' which outputs 'acaca'. Let's see. The length of t is 9. So possible L ranges from (9+1)/2 = 5 to 8. So L can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nLet's try L=5. Then k=2*5 -9=10-9=1. So k=1. Check s_candidate = t[-5:] → 'acaca' (since t is 'acacacaca' → last 5 chars are 'cacaca'? Wait, let me check the actual string.\n\nOriginal input is 'acacacaca' (length 9). Let's index from 0 to 8. The last 5 characters are positions 4 to 8: 'acaca' (positions 4 is 'a', 5 is 'c', 6 is 'a', 7 is 'c', 8 is 'a'). So s_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nCheck first part of t: len(t)-L is 9-5=4. So first part is t[0:4] → 'acac'.\n\nThen, L -k =5-1=4. So check if s_candidate[0:4] is 'acac' → yes. Then check first k=1 characters of s_candidate is 'a' and last k=1 is 'a' → yes. So this is valid. So output is YES and 'acaca'.\n\nAnother sample is 'abcabc' which outputs 'NO'. Let's see. len(t)=6. Possible L ranges from (6+1)/2=3.5 → ceil to 4? Wait, (len(t)+1)/2 is (6+1)/2=3.5. So L must be >= 3.5, so possible L starts at 4, up to len(t)-1=5. So L can be 4 or 5.\n\nFor L=4: k=2*4 -6 = 8-6=2. Check if k is between 1 and 3 (L-1=3). Yes. Then s_candidate is t[-4:] → 'bcabc'? Wait, t is 'abcabc' (length 6). Last 4 characters are positions 2-5: 'cabc'.\n\nCheck first part of t is t[0:6-4=2] → first 2 characters: 'ab'.\n\nThen L -k =4-2=2. So check if s_candidate[0:2] is 'ab'? s_candidate is 'cabc' → first 2 is 'ca', which does not match 'ab'. So invalid.\n\nNext, L=5. k=2*5 -6 =10-6=4. Check if k is between 1 and 4 (since L-1=4). Yes. Then s_candidate is t[-5:] → 'bcabc' (positions 1-5: 'bcabc').\n\nCheck first part of t is len(t)-L=6-5=1. So first part is t[0:1] → 'a'.\n\nThen L -k is 5-4=1. So check if s_candidate[0:1] is 'a'? s_candidate is 'bcabc', first character is 'b' which is not equal to 'a'. So invalid. Thus, no possible L, output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string t.\n\nThen, for each possible L in the range from (len(t)+1)//2 to len(t)-1, inclusive.\n\nWait, (len(t)+1)//2 is the ceiling of (len(t)+1)/2? Let me think. For example, len(t) is 9. (9+1)/2 is 5. So (9+1)//2 is 5. For len(t)=6, (6+1)/2 is 3.5, so integer division would be 3. But we need L to be >= (len(t)+1)/2. So for len(t)=6, (len(t)+1)/2 is 3.5 → L must be >= 4 (since L must be integer). So the starting value of L is (len(t)+1 +1)//2? Or perhaps math.ceil((len(t)+1)/2).\n\nBut in Python, to compute the lower bound for L, which is ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ). How to compute that?\n\nWell, (len(t)+1) divided by 2, rounded up. For example, (len(t)+1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor len(t) even:\n\nsay len(t) = 6 → (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4. (6+1 +1) // 2 → 8//2=4.\n\nFor len(t) odd, say len(t)=5 → (5+1)/2 = 3 → ceil is 3. (5+1 +1)//2 is 7//2=3.5 → 3 in integer division? Wait, no. Wait in Python 3, 7//2 is 3.\n\nWait, but (len(t)+1) is 6, then (len(t)+1 +1) is 7, divided by 2 is 3.5, integer division is 3. But the correct value is 3.5's ceil is 4?\n\nNo, for len(t) =5, (len(t)+1)/2 is (5+1)/2 = 3. So ceil(3) is 3. So the lower bound is 3. So for len(t) =5, L starts at 3.\n\nBut (len(t)+1)//2 is (5+1)//2 = 3. So the lower bound is (len(t)+1)//2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the inequalities:\n\nWe have L must be ≥ (len(t)+1)/2. Since L must be an integer, the minimum L is ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ). However, (len(t)+1)/2 may not be integer.\n\nBut in Python, (len(t)+1) // 2 is equivalent to floor( (len(t)+1)/2 ). Wait, for example, len(t) is 5: (5+1)/2 = 3. So (5+1)//2 is 3. For len(t) is 6: (6+1)/2 is 3.5 → floor is 3. But the required L is ≥ 3.5 → so L starts at 4.\n\nSo to compute the correct lower bound, perhaps the lower bound is (len(t)+1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for len(t) even:\n\nlen(t) =6 → (len(t)+1)/2 is 3.5 → ceil is 4. (len(t)+1 +1) is 8 → 8//2 is 4. Correct.\n\nFor len(t) =5 → (5+1)/2 is 3 → ceil is 3. (5+1 +1) is 7 → 7//2 is 3.5 → 3 in integer division. Which is correct.\n\nWait, no. Wait, (len(t)+1 +1)//2 is (len(t)+2)//2. For len(t) =5, that's (5+2)/2 = 3.5 → integer division is 3. Which is correct. So for len(t) even or odd, the lower bound is ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ), which can be calculated as (len(t)+1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for len(t) =6:\n\n(6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4. (6+1 +1) is 8 → 8//2 is 4. Correct.\n\nFor len(t) =5: (5+1)/2 = 3 → ceil is 3. (5+1 +1) is 7 → 7//2 is 3. Correct.\n\nYes, so the lower bound for L is (len(t)+1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait no, (len(t)+1 +1) // 2 is (len(t)+2)//2. Which is equal to floor( (len(t)+2)/2 ). Which is same as ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ). Because:\n\nceil(a) = floor(a) if a is integer. Else, ceil(a) = floor(a) +1.\n\nFor example, (len(t)+1)/2 is 3.5 → ceil is 4. (len(t)+2)/2 is (len(t)+1)/2 + 0.5 → 3.5 + 0.5 = 4.0 → floor is 4. So yes, (len(t)+2)//2 is the same as ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ).\n\nThus, the lower bound for L is (len(t)+2)//2. And upper bound is len(t)-1.\n\nSo for each L in range from lower_L to upper_L inclusive, we check.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor L in range(lower_L, upper_L + 1):\n\nBut let's compute lower_L and upper_L.\n\nlower_L = (len(t) + 2) // 2\n\nupper_L = len(t) -1\n\nBut we need to make sure that lower_L <= upper_L. For example, if len(t) is 1, then upper_L is 0, which is less than lower_L. But since the input t is non-empty, but for len(t) =1, upper_L is 0, so no possible L. So in that case, output is NO.\n\nSo in code:\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # process\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nSo for each L in the range from lower_L to upper_L:\n\nCompute k = 2*L -n\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and L-1. Well, since L is chosen based on the previous constraints, but perhaps due to integer division, maybe there's a case where it's not. So maybe better to check.\n\nBut according to our earlier reasoning, for L in that range, k will be between 1 and L-1.\n\nBut let's think for len(t) = 6, lower_L is (6+2)//2 = 4, upper_L is 5.\n\nFor L=4, k= 8-6=2. Which is between 1 and 3 (L-1=3). Yes.\n\nFor L=5, k= 10-6=4. Which is between 1 and 4 (L-1=4). So yes.\n\nSo for all L in the range, k is between 1 and L-1.\n\nSo no need to check again.\n\nOnce L is chosen, then:\n\ns_candidate = t[-L:]\n\nprefix = t[0 : n - L]\n\nWe need to check if prefix equals s_candidate[0 : L -k].\n\nAlso, check if the first k characters of s_candidate equals the last k characters of s_candidate.\n\nIf both conditions are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor L in range(lower_L, upper_L + 1):\n\n    k = 2 * L - n\n\n    # compute prefix length: n - L = len(t) - L = (2L -k) - L = L -k\n\n    # because len(t) = 2L -k → n = 2L -k → n - L = L -k\n\n    prefix = t[0 : n - L]\n\n    s_candidate = t[-L:]\n\n    # check if prefix == s_candidate[0 : L -k]\n\n    # also check if s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]\n\n    if prefix == s_candidate[: L -k] and s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        print(s_candidate)\n\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all L, if none found, print \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, for the case when len(t) is 2L -k, and L is chosen such that k is 2L -n. So for example, when n is 2L -k, and k is 2L -n. So that's correct.\n\nBut how to compute L -k? Since k is 2L -n, then L -k = L - (2L -n) = n - L.\n\nWhich is the same as the length of the prefix. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test for the sample input 'acacacaca' (length 9). For L=5, n-L is 4. prefix is first 4 characters: 'acac'.\n\ns_candidate is t[-5:] → 'acaca'.\n\nL -k is 5 - (2*5 -9) = 5 - (10-9) = 5-1=4. So s_candidate[:4] is 'acac' which equals prefix. Then check if first k=1 characters of s_candidate equals last k=1. s_candidate[:1] is 'a', last 1 is 'a' → yes. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' which outputs 'ababab'.\n\nLet me see. The input is 'abababab' (length 8). Let's compute possible L.\n\nlower_L = (8 + 2) // 2 = 10//2=5. upper_L is 8-1=7.\n\nSo L ranges from 5 to 7.\n\nCheck for L=5:\n\nk = 2*5 -8 = 10-8=2. Check if first k=2 chars of s_candidate equals last k=2.\n\ns_candidate is t[-5:] → 'babab' (assuming t is 'abababab').\n\nWait, t is 'abababab' (positions 0-7):\n\nfor L=5, t[-5:] is positions 3-7: 'ababab'? Wait, no. Let me count:\n\nt is 8 letters. t[-5:] is the last 5 letters. The indices are 3,4,5,6,7 → letters are 'ababab'? Wait, original string is 'abababab':\n\nIndices 0:a, 1:b, 2:a, 3:b, 4:a, 5:b, 6:a, 7:b.\n\nSo t[-5:] is from index 3 to 7: 'babab'.\n\nSo s_candidate is 'babab'.\n\nprefix is t[0 : n-L] → n is 8, L is 5 → 8-5=3. So first 3 letters: 'aba'.\n\nCheck if prefix (aba) equals s_candidate[: L -k] → L-k is 5-2=3. So s_candidate[:3] is 'bab' → 'bab' vs 'aba' → no. So not valid.\n\nNext, L=6.\n\nk=2*6 -8=12-8=4. Check if k is between 1 and 5 (L-1=5). Yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[-6:] → positions 2-7: 'ababab'.\n\nprefix is t[0:8-6=2] → first 2 letters 'ab'.\n\nL -k is 6-4=2. So check if s_candidate[:2] is 'ab'? s_candidate is 'ababab', first 2 letters 'ab' → yes.\n\nThen check if first 4 letters of s_candidate equals last 4 letters.\n\ns_candidate[:4] is 'abab', last 4 letters are 'baba'? Wait, s_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). Last 4 letters are positions 2-5: 'abab'? Wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' → indexes 0:a, 1:b, 2:a, 3:b, 4:a, 5:b.\n\nlast 4 letters are indexes 2-5: a, b, a, b → 'abab'.\n\nfirst 4 letters: indexes 0-3: a, b, a, b → 'abab'. So yes, they are equal. Thus, this is a valid case. So output is YES and s_candidate 'ababab'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output for the fourth input.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if len(t) is 2? For example, t is 'aa'.\n\nlower_L is (2+2)//2 = 2. upper_L is 1. So lower_L (2) > upper_L (1) → no possible L. So output is NO. Which is correct, because the only possible way is two 'a's merged with k=1 (since len(t) is 2, 2L -k = 2 → for L=1, k=2*1 -2=0 → invalid. So no solution.\n\nAnother case: t is 'aaaaa' (length 5). Let's see.\n\nlower_L = (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5 is 3.5, but integer division in Python for (5+2) is 7//2=3. So lower_L is 3. upper_L is 4.\n\nCheck L=3:\n\nk=2*3 -5=6-5=1.\n\ns_candidate is t[-3:] → 'aaa'.\n\nprefix is t[0:5-3=2] → first 2 letters 'aa'.\n\nCheck if prefix equals s_candidate[:3-1=2] → 'aa' equals 'aa' → yes.\n\nCheck if first 1 char of s_candidate equals last 1. 'a' equals 'a' → yes. So valid. So output is YES and 'aaa'.\n\nWhich would be correct. Because two 'aaa's merged with overlap of 1. The merged string would be 'aaa' + 'aa' → 'aaaaa'.\n\nAnother case: t is 'abab' (length 4). Possible L is (4+2)//2=3. upper_L=3. So L=3.\n\nk=2*3-4=2.\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and 2 (L-1=2). Yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[-3:] → 'bab'.\n\nprefix is t[0:4-3=1] → first 1 character 'a'.\n\nCheck if prefix equals s_candidate[:3-2=1] → s_candidate[:1] is 'b' → 'a' vs 'b' → no. So invalid.\n\nSo no solution. Output NO.\n\nAnother case: t is 'abcabc' (sample input). As discussed earlier, output is NO.\n\nNow, code.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nRead t.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2 → output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nlower_L = (n + 2) // 2\n\nupper_L = n -1\n\nfor L in range(lower_L, upper_L + 1):\n\n   k = 2*L - n\n\n   prefix_length = n - L\n\n   prefix = t[0:prefix_length]\n\n   s_candidate = t[-L:]\n\n   # check if prefix equals s_candidate[: L -k]\n\n   # L -k = L - (2L -n) = n - L → which is prefix_length.\n\n   # So s_candidate[:prefix_length] ?\n\n   # Because L -k = n - L → yes.\n\n   # So the first condition is prefix == s_candidate[:prefix_length]\n\n   # Also check if s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]\n\n   if prefix == s_candidate[:prefix_length] and s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]:\n\n       print(\"YES\")\n\n       print(s_candidate)\n\n       exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nWait, that's a simplification. Because L -k = n - L. So the code can be written as:\n\nprefix_length = n - L\n\nprefix = t[0:prefix_length]\n\ns_candidate_part = s_candidate[:prefix_length]\n\nif prefix == s",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are merged such that they overlap by at least one character but less than the length of the message.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Overlap Constraints**: For a string `t` to be formed by merging two identical messages `s`, the length of `t` must be such that there exists an overlap `k` (where `1 ≤ k < len(s)`). This leads us to derive possible lengths for `s` based on the length of `t`.\n\n2. **Determine Valid Lengths for `s`**: For each possible length `L` of `s`, we check if the string `t` can be split into parts that match the overlapping criteria. The valid range for `L` is derived from the constraints on the overlap.\n\n3. **Check Overlap Validity**: For each candidate length `L`, compute the potential overlap `k` and verify if the prefix of `t` matches the corresponding part of the candidate message `s` and if the overlap itself is valid.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    lower_L = (n + 2) // 2\n    upper_L = n - 1\n    found = False\n    for L in range(lower_L, upper_L + 1):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        prefix_length = n - L\n        prefix = t[:prefix_length]\n        s_candidate = t[-L:]\n        # Check if prefix matches the beginning part of s_candidate\n        if prefix == s_candidate[:prefix_length]:\n            # Check if the first k chars of s_candidate match the last k chars\n            if s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                found = True\n                break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input string `t` and determine its length `n`.\n\n2. **Edge Case Check**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, immediately output \"NO\" as it's impossible to form an error with such a short string.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**: Calculate the valid range for the length `L` of the potential message `s`. This range is derived from the constraints that ensure a valid overlap.\n\n4. **Overlap Validation**: For each candidate length `L`, compute the overlap `k` and check:\n   - If the prefix of `t` (before the last `L` characters) matches the corresponding part of the candidate message `s`.\n   - If the first `k` characters of the candidate message `s` match its last `k` characters, ensuring a valid overlap.\n\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid configuration is found, print \"YES\" followed by the candidate message `s`. If no valid configuration is found after checking all possibilities, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all potential valid configurations for the message `s` and ensures correctness by validating both the prefix and overlap constraints.",
