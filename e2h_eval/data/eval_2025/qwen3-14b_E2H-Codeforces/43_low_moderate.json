He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nSo, the process is: A starts with some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both). So the final string must have a certain structure.\n\nFirst, I need to check the order of characters. Because the string is built by first adding a's, then b's, then c's. So the string must consist of a block of a's, followed by a block of b's, followed by a block of c's. If there's any other order, like a c before a b, that's invalid.\n\nSo the first thing I should check is that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. For example, if the string is 'aabbc', that's okay. But something like 'abac' would not be allowed because the c comes before the b's are done.\n\nSo step one: check that the string is composed of a's first, then b's, then c's. How can I do that? Well, I can check that all the a's are before any b's, and all the b's are before any c's. Also, there must be at least one a, one b, and one c. Wait, no. Wait, according to the problem statement, after A gives the string to B, B appends some number of 'b's, ensuring that there's at least one a and one b. Then C appends some c's. But the problem says that the final string must have at least one a and one b. But since C adds c's, but the original string after B's step has at least one a and one b. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and possibly zero or more c's. However, the problem says that C appends some number of c's. So the number of c's can't be zero. Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. So \"some number\" implies that it's at least one? Or can it be zero?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" The word \"some\" here might mean that it's possible that he appends zero? Or does it mean that he appends at least one?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement. The note says that the number of 'c's equals the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. So for example, if the original string after B's step has 2 a's and 3 b's, then C appends 2 or 3 c's. So the number of c's is at least 1, since the original string has at least one a and one b. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal string after A and B: at least one a and one b. Then C appends some number of c's. The number of c's is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. So suppose the original string (after A and B) has 1 a and 1 b. Then C can append 1 c (equal to a's count) or 1 c (equal to b's count). So the final string will have 1 a, 1 b, and 1 c. So the final string must have at least one c. Therefore, the input string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nSo first, check that the string contains at least one a, one b, and one c. If not, output NO.\n\nBut wait, what if the input string is like 'aab'? Then there are a's and b's but no c's. Then it's invalid. Because C added some c's. So the final string must have c's. So the input string must have at least one c. So that's a necessary condition.\n\nSo first, check that the string contains a, b, and c. If not, return NO.\n\nThen, check the order. The string must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, the string 'aabbcc' is okay. But 'abac' is not. So how can I check this?\n\nI can check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the letters. Like, each character is not less than the previous. But since the letters are a, b, c, which are ordered as",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by appending 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's in a specific manner. The string must adhere to the order of characters and specific count conditions for 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Presence of Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must be composed of a block of 'a's, followed by a block of 'b's, and then a block of 'c's. This ensures the correct sequence of appending characters.\n3. **Check Count Conditions**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check if all required characters are present\n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Check the order: all a's first, then b's, then c's\n    # Iterate through the string and ensure that the order is maintained\n    # We can check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the characters\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Count the number of a's, b's, c's\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    print(is_valid_string(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Presence Check**: The function first checks if the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, it returns \"NO\".\n2. **Order Check**: The function then checks that the string is in non-decreasing order of characters. This ensures that all 'a's come before 'b's, which in turn come before 'c's.\n3. **Count Check**: Finally, the function checks if the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. If either condition is met, it returns \"YES\"; otherwise, it returns \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the constraints and ensures the string adheres to the specified formation rules.",
