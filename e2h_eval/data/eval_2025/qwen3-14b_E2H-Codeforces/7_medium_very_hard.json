The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way. Let me understand the construction rules again.\n\nSo, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the previous step) must be connected to k new vertices. And this process is done at least once. So the structure is like a tree where each node branches out into k children, but with some constraints on how many layers there are.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's model the snowflake's construction step by step. \n\nInitially, there's 1 node. Let's call this level 0. Then, in the first expansion, we add k nodes connected to the root. Now, the total number of nodes is 1 + k. But according to the rules, this step (adding k nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. Wait, the problem says that after the initial step (adding k nodes to the root), each vertex that is connected to only one other (which are the ones added in the first step) must be connected to k new vertices. So this step is done once. So for example, the minimal snowflake for k=4 would have:\n\nLevel 0: 1 node (root)\nLevel 1: 4 nodes connected to root.\nLevel 2: Each of those 4 nodes gets 4 new nodes. So 4*4 = 16 added here. Total nodes: 1 +4 + 16 = 21?\n\nWait, but the example input says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Let me check. Wait the sample input includes 13 as a yes. Let me think. How can that be possible?\n\nWait maybe the process isn't required to do the expansion steps multiple times. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe rules are:\n\n- Initially, one vertex.\n- Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). \n- Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the ones added in the previous step) is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh! So the second step (the expansion) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do that once. Let's see:\n\nFor example, if we have the initial step (level 0 and level 1). Then, the expansion step is done once. So each of the level 1 nodes gets k new nodes. So the total nodes is 1 + k + k * k. So 1 + k + k².\n\nBut wait, for k=2, that would be 1+2+4=7 nodes. But what if the expansion step is done more than once? Like, suppose after adding the level 2 nodes, we again expand each of those nodes (but they are leaves now). So then the next level would be adding k nodes per each level 2 node, which is k^3 nodes. So the total would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. But the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So the expansion step is done once or more.\n\nWait, the problem says that the second step (each leaf is connected to k new vertices) must be done at least once. So the snowflake must have at least two layers beyond the root. For example, the initial step (adding k nodes) is the first step, then the expansion step (adding k nodes to each of the leaves from the first step) is done once. So the snowflake has two layers: the initial step (level 1) and the expansion step (level 2). So the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2. However, if the expansion step is done more than once, then the total would be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait no, maybe not. Because each expansion step is applied to all the leaves of the previous step. Let me think again.\n\nLet me model the snowflake's structure. The construction is:\n\nStart with one node (level 0).\n\nThen, step 1: add k nodes connected to the root. Now, these nodes are leaves. So step 2: each of these leaves must be connected to k new nodes. So each of the k nodes from step 1 adds k nodes. Now, the total nodes is 1 +k +k*k. But this is after one expansion step. If we do another expansion step, then each of the leaves (from the previous expansion step) must be connected to k new nodes. So each of the k² nodes from the previous step adds k nodes. So the total becomes 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on. \n\nSo the snowflake can be built with any number of expansion steps, as long as there's at least one expansion step. So the total number of nodes is:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1. Because the expansion step is done m times. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once: adding k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k². If the expansion step is done twice, then after the first expansion, we have 1 +k +k². Then, the second expansion step would take each of the k² leaves and add k nodes each, so adding k^3. So the total is 1 +k +k² +k³. So the general formula for the total number of nodes is:\n\nn = 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, because the initial step is adding k, then each expansion step adds k^2, k^3, etc. So the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding k, then the first expansion step adds k^2 (since there are k nodes each adding k), then the next expansion adds k^3, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} }, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, maybe I need to model it differently.\n\nLet me think of the expansion steps. The initial step is level 1: adding k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds a new level. So the number of expansion steps is m ≥ 1. Then, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1}? No, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial step (before any expansion) is 1 node. Then, we add k nodes. Then, for each expansion step, the number of new nodes is k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. The leaves after the initial step are k nodes. After the first expansion step, each of those k leaves adds k nodes, so k*k = k^2 new nodes. Then, the leaves are those k^2 nodes. After the second expansion step, each of them adds k nodes, leading to k^3 new nodes, etc. So the total number of nodes after m expansion steps is:\n\nTotal = 1 (initial) + k (after initial step) + k^2 (after 1 expansion step) + k^3 (after 2 expansion steps) + ... + k^{m+1}? Wait no. Let me count:\n\nInitial: 1 node.\n\nAfter initial step (adding k nodes): total is 1 + k.\n\nAfter first expansion step (adding k^2 nodes): total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nAfter second expansion step: adding k^3 nodes → total 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo, if there are m expansion steps, the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No, no. Wait, m expansion steps would mean that after the initial step, we do m expansions. So the number of terms is 1 (initial) + k (initial step) + k^2 (first expansion) + ... +k^{m} (m-th expansion). So the sum is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. But since the initial step is adding k, and the expansion steps are m times. Wait, the initial step is part of the construction. The expansion steps are done at least once. So m ≥ 1. So the total number of nodes is S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m}, where m ≥1. Because the initial step is adding k nodes (so the first term after 1 is k), and then m expansion steps. Wait, but for m expansion steps, the exponents would be up to m+1? Or not?\n\nLet me take m=1. Then, the total is 1 +k +k^2. Which is 1 +k +k^2 = sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So if m is the number of expansion steps, then the sum is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i? No. For m expansion steps, the initial step is adding k (i=1), and then m expansion steps adding k^2 (i=2), k^3 (i=3) etc. So the sum is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i? No. Wait, for m expansion steps, the number of terms is 1 + (m+1) terms? Let me see:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n- Initial: 1 node.\n\n- Add k nodes (step 1). Now, 1 +k.\n\n- Expansion step 1: add k^2 nodes. Now, 1 +k +k^2.\n\n- Expansion step 2: add k^3 nodes. Now, 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\n...\n\nSo after m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nNo. Wait, the first expansion step adds k^2 (so exponent is 2). The second adds k^3 (exponent 3). So after m expansion steps, the exponents go up to m+1. So the total is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i - 1? No. Because the sum from i=0 to m+1 is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}. But our total is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nWait for m=1 expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum from i=0 to 2 of k^i. So m expansion steps correspond to sum from i=0 to (m+1) of k^i? So the sum is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). But that's only when k !=1. However, since k>1, that's okay.\n\nBut the problem says that the expansion steps are done at least once. So m ≥1. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i, where m ≥1. Wait no, for m expansion steps, the exponents go up to m+1? For example, m=1: 1 +k +k^2 = sum from 0 to 2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So the sum is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. The sum from i=0 to t of k^i is (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m expansion steps, the exponents go up to m+1, so t = m+1. Then the sum is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). But that seems complicated. However, for the problem, we need to find if there exists a k>1 and m≥1 such that n equals this sum.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For example, if m is the number of expansion steps, then the total nodes are 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nYes. Because the initial step is adding k (so 1 +k), then m expansion steps add k^2, k^3, ..., k^{m+1}.\n\nSo the total is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i. Which is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut that seems like a big formula. However, the problem is to check whether n can be written as this sum for some k>1 and m≥1. \n\nBut also, there's another possibility. What if the expansion steps are done for different numbers of layers. For example, maybe the snowflake can be constructed with varying numbers of layers. So for example, for the case where m=1 (one expansion step), the total is 1 +k +k². For m=2, it's 1 +k +k² +k³. So for any n, we need to check if there exists some k>1 and m≥1 such that n equals the sum from i=0 to (m+1) of k^i. \n\nBut how can we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nAlternatively, the sum can be rewritten as S = (k^{m+2} - 1)/(k-1). But for m ≥1, this implies that m+2 ≥3. So S is a geometric series of length m+2 terms. \n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at it. Let me think about the possible values of n. For a given n, we need to check whether there exists integers k>1 and m≥1 such that:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} \n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nn = (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) \n\nBut solving this equation for given n is challenging. However, for each n, we can try to find if there exists a k>1 and m≥1 such that this holds.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For a given n, check if there exists some k>1 and integer s ≥ 2 (since m+2 ≥ 2+1=3?), wait m ≥1, so m+2 ≥3. So s = m+2 ≥3. Then, the sum is (k^s -1)/(k-1) = n. So the problem reduces to checking if there exists integers s ≥3 and k ≥2 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nWait, but s is m+2. Since m ≥1, then s ≥3. So the problem becomes: does n equal (k^s -1)/(k-1) for some integers s ≥3 and k ≥2?\n\nBut wait, the original problem says that the expansion steps must be done at least once. Which corresponds to m ≥1. So s = m+2 ≥ 3. So yes.\n\nBut then, for example, the sample input has n=13. Let's check:\n\nFor s=3, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. So for k=2, that's 4+2+1=7. For k=3, 9+3+1=13. So yes, so n=13 can be achieved with k=3, s=3. Hence, output is YES.\n\nAnother example: n=6. Let's see. For s=3, trying k=2: 7. Not 6. For s=2? But s must be ≥3. So no. So for n=6, there's no solution. Hence output is NO, which matches the sample input.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^s -1)/(k-1) for some integers s ≥3 and k ≥2.\n\nBut how to check this for large n?\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for given n, whether there exists integers k ≥2 and s ≥3 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nLet me note that (k^s -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1}.\n\nSo for each possible s, we can try to find if there's a k such that this sum equals n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and s can be up to log_2(n) (since for k=2, the minimal value for s is 3, which gives 1+2+4=7. For larger s, the sum increases. So for a given n, the maximum possible s is log_2(n). For example, if n is 1e18, then log_2(1e18) is around 60. So for each n, we can iterate s from 3 up to log_2(n) + something, and for each s, check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to check for each s?\n\nFor a given s, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} = n.\n\nLet me denote this sum as f(k, s) = (k^s -1)/(k-1).\n\nWe can think of this as a function of k, and for each s, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there's an integer k ≥2 such that f(k, s) = n.\n\nBut for each s, the minimal possible value of f(k, s) is when k=2. So for s, the minimal value is 2^s -1 (since (2^s -1)/(2-1) = 2^s -1). Wait no, for s=3, the sum is 1+2+4=7=2^3 -1. For s=2, it's 1+2=3=2^2 -1. But s must be ≥3. So for each s ≥3, the minimal value of f(k,s) is 2^s -1. So if n is less than that, then this s cannot be used.\n\nSo for a given n, the possible s can be up to log_2(n) + 1. For example, for n=1e18, log2(n) is about 60, so s can be up to 60.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n is 1: then output NO (since the minimal possible is 1 +k + ... for s≥3, which for k=2, s=3 gives 7, which is larger than 1).\n\n- Else, for each possible s from 3 up to log_2(n) + 1:\n\n   - Compute the minimal possible value for this s (which is 2^s -1). If this is larger than n, break (since higher s would give even larger minima).\n\n   - For this s, perform a binary search on k ≥2 to see if there exists a k such that f(k, s) = n.\n\nIf for any s and k, this is true, output YES. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nBut how to compute f(k, s) efficiently, and how to perform the binary search?\n\nLet's think about the binary search for a given s. For a fixed s, we can binary search k in [2, ... upper_bound], where upper_bound can be determined. For example, for s, the function f(k, s) increases with k. So for a given s, the function is strictly increasing in k. Therefore, for each s, we can binary search k to see if there's a value such that f(k, s) = n.\n\nBut how to compute f(k, s) without overflow? Since n can be up to 1e18, and s can be up to 60, even for k=2 and s=60, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is manageable with Python's arbitrary precision integers.\n\nSo for each s, the steps are:\n\nCompute low = 2, high = some upper bound. What's the upper bound for k?\n\nWell, for a given s, the sum f(k, s) is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} ≤ k^{s} (since each term is smaller than the next, except for the last term). So for f(k, s) =n, we have k^{s} > n. So k must be < n^(1/s). So the upper bound for k can be set as n^(1/(s-1)) ? Or perhaps n^(1/s) + 1. Because for example, when s is 3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. For this to be equal to n, k^2 < n, so k < sqrt(n). So for binary search, the upper bound can be set as n^(1/(s-1)) ?\n\nBut for the binary search, perhaps we can set high to be something like n, but that could be too slow. However, considering that s can be up to 60, and for each s, the binary search would take O(log n) steps, which for t=1e4 test cases, and per test case O(60 * log n) steps, it's manageable.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and s?\n\nWell, we can compute the sum iteratively. For example, for s steps:\n\nsum = 1\n\ncurrent_term = 1\n\nfor i in 1 to s-1:\n\n   current_term *=k \n\n   sum += current_term \n\nBut if during this process the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's too big.\n\nAlternatively, compute the sum as (k^s -1) // (k-1). But for large exponents, this can be done with exponentiation, but we have to be careful with possible overflows. However, Python handles big integers, so no problem.\n\nBut for binary search, we need to compute f(k, s) and compare to n. However, for large s and k, this could be time-consuming. But given that s is up to 60, and per test case, it's manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the binary search for a given s. For example, for s=3, we want to find k such that 1 +k +k^2 =n. For this, we can compute the value for a given k and compare to n.\n\nBut for binary search, we can find the minimal and maximal possible k for each s.\n\nSo for each s, we can perform a binary search between low=2 and high= some upper limit. Let's think about how to find the upper limit for k. For example, for s, the minimal value is when k=2, which is 2^s -1. The maximum possible k for which the sum is <=n is such that k^{s-1} <=n. Because the sum is at least k^{s-1} (since 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} ≥k^{s-1}).\n\nSo for example, k^{s-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(s-1)}.\n\nSo for binary search, the upper bound for k can be set as n^(1/(s-1)) + 1. But how to compute this in Python?\n\nIn Python, we can compute it as something like high = int(n ** (1/(s-1))) + 2. But since for exponents, floating point inaccuracies can occur, perhaps it's better to use binary search with high starting at 2 and doubling until the sum exceeds n.\n\nAlternatively, for each s, we can start with low=2, high=2, and double high until the sum for k=high is greater than n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis approach avoids dealing with floating points and ensures that the upper bound is correct.\n\nSo, the steps for each s:\n\nInitialize low =2, high=2.\n\nWhile compute_sum(high, s) < n:\n\n   high *=2 \n\nOnce we have a high where compute_sum(high, s) >=n, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut how to compute compute_sum(k, s)?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, compute_sum can be done by iterating through the terms and adding them up, breaking early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nBut for the purposes of binary search, we need to know whether the sum is less than, equal to, or greater than n. So during the computation, we can check if the sum exceeds n, and return early.\n\nLet me write a helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k \n\n    return total \n\nWait, but for s steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} ?\n\nYes. For example, for s=3, the loop runs 3 times: initial current is 1 (added to total). Then multiply by k, add to total. Then multiply by k again, add to total. So total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo the helper function returns the sum, or infinity if during the process the sum exceeds n.\n\nBut in code, for a given k and s, we can compute the sum. So during binary search, for a given mid, compute the sum and compare to n.\n\nOnce we have that, the binary search can proceed.\n\nNow, for each test case n, we need to check all possible s from 3 up to max_s, where max_s is the maximum possible s for which 2^s -1 <=n.\n\nFor example, for n=1e18, the maximum possible s is log2(n)+1. Let's compute log2(1e18) is approx 60. So s can be up to 60.\n\nBut for each s, we can check if 2^s -1 <=n. If not, then break, since higher s will have even larger minimal values.\n\nSo for each test case:\n\nif n ==1: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for s in 3 to max_s:\n\n      if 2^s -1 >n: break.\n\n      perform binary search on k for this s.\n\n      if found, return YES.\n\n   after all s, if none found, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute max_s?\n\nmax_s can be up to log2(n) +1. But since n can be up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So for each test case, the loop for s runs up to 60 times. Which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nBut there's another case. What about when s=2? Wait, no. Because in our problem, s must be ≥3. Because the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the original sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} where s-1 is m+1. Wait, earlier analysis said that s is m+2. So for m ≥1, s ≥3. So the code checks s from 3 upwards.\n\nBut there's another possibility. What if the snowflake is constructed with multiple expansion steps, but not all the way to the maximum level? For example, for n=1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m} where m is something else. Wait no, the earlier analysis shows that the sum is (k^{s} -1)/(k-1) where s is m+2. So the code covers all possibilities.\n\nBut what about the case where the snowflake is constructed with different layers. For example, the initial step (adding k nodes) and then one expansion step (adding k^2 nodes) and then stopping. That gives sum 1 +k +k^2. Which is s=3 (since s is m+2, m=1: 1+2=3). So yes, covered.\n\nAnother example: the sample input for n=15. Let's see. For s=3, 1 +k +k^2 =15. Solve for k: k^2 +k +1 =15 →k^2 +k -14=0 →k=(-1 ± sqrt(1+56))/2 →sqrt(57)≈7.5 →k≈ ( -1 +7.5)/2 ≈ 3.25. So no integer k. For s=4: (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =15. Let's try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15. Yes! So for s=4, k=2, the sum is 15. So the answer is YES. Which matches the sample input (the 6th test case is 15, output is YES).\n\nSo the code should find that.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, handle the cases where n is 1, 2, 3, etc. For example, n=1: output NO. For n=2: the minimal possible is 7 (for s=3, k=2). So output NO.\n\nNow, for each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n < 7: output NO (since the minimal possible is 7 for s=3, k=2).\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for all possible s from 3 up to max_s.\n\nBut how to compute max_s?\n\nWe can compute max_s as the maximum s where 2^s -1 ≤n. For example, for n=7, 2^3 -1 =7 →s=3. For n=8, 2^3-1=7 ≤8. So s can be 3, and then check for higher s? Well, for s=4, 2^4-1=15>8. So for n=8, the max_s is 3.\n\nBut how to compute this? Well, for each s starting from 3, compute 2^s -1. If it is larger than n, break.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nfor s in range(3, 61):\n\n   min_val = 2^s -1 \n\n   if min_val >n:\n\n       break \n\n   else:\n\n       perform binary search for this s.\n\nBut what's the upper limit for s? For n up to 1e18, 2^60 is about 1e18. So for s up to 60, 2^60-1 is 1.15e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for s up to 60, we can check.\n\nThus, in code, the loop for s can run from 3 to 60, and for each s, check if 2^s -1 ≤n. If not, break.\n\nNow, for each s, perform the binary search for k.\n\nNow, implementing the binary search for k.\n\nImplementing the helper function to compute the sum for a given k and s, and compare with n.\n\nBut in code, for each s and k, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return 1  # indicates overflow\n\n        current *=k \n\n    return total \n\nWait, but the function returns 1 if the sum exceeds n, else returns the actual sum. But in code, during the binary search, we can compare the computed sum with n.\n\nBut in code, for binary search:\n\nlow = 2 \n\nhigh = 2 \n\nwhile compute_sum(high, s, n) < n:\n\n    high *=2 \n\nOnce we have high where compute_sum(high, s, n) >=n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut during the binary search, for mid = (low + high) // 2, compute the sum. If it's equal to n, return True. If it's less than n, move low up. Else, move high down.\n\nBut how to handle the compute_sum function returning overflow?\n\nIn code, during the compute_sum function, if the sum exceeds n, return something larger than n, so that during binary search, we can adjust accordingly.\n\nBut in code, perhaps the helper function returns the actual sum if it's <=n, else returns a value larger than n. For example:\n\ndef get_sum(k, s, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n + 1  # a value larger than n\n\n        current *= k \n\n    return total \n\nSo during binary search, for a given mid, we compute the value. If it's equal to n, return True. If it's larger than n, we need to search lower. Else, search higher.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn = ... \n\nif n < 7:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False \n\n    for s in 3 to 60:\n\n        min_val = 2^s -1 \n\n        if min_val >n:\n\n            break \n\n        # Now perform binary search for k for this s \n\n        low = 2 \n\n        high = 2 \n\n        while get_sum(high, s, n) < n:\n\n            high *=2 \n\n        # Now binary search between low and high \n\n        while low <= high:\n\n            mid = (low + high) //2 \n\n            val = get_sum(mid, s, n)\n\n            if val ==n:\n\n                found = True \n\n                break \n\n            elif val <n:\n\n                low = mid +1 \n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1 \n\n        if found:\n\n            break \n\n    if found:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut there's a problem here. For example, when s=3 and k=3, the sum is 1 +3 +9=13. For n=13, this would be found. But what about other possibilities?\n\nAnother thing to consider: for some n, there might be multiple s and k that satisfy the condition. But once any is found, we can return YES.\n\nBut what about the case where n is of the form 1 +k. For example, n=3. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is 1 +k +k^2, which for k=2 is 7. So n=3 is invalid. Hence, the code correctly returns NO for n=3.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nTest case 1: n=1 → output NO.\n\nTest case 2: n=2 → output NO.\n\nTest case 3: n=3 → output NO.\n\nTest case 4: n=6 → output NO.\n\nTest case 5: n=13 → YES (as discussed).\n\nTest case 6: n=15 → YES (s=4, k=2).\n\nTest case 7: n=255 → let's see. For example, 2^8 -1 = 255. So for s=8, 2^8 -1 =255. So (k^s -1)/(k-1) = 255. For k=2, s=8, sum is 2^8 -1 =255. So YES.\n\nAnother example, n=10101. Let's see. For s=3, trying to find k where 1 +k +k^2 =10101. Solving k^2 +k +1 =10101 →k^2 +k -10100 =0 → discriminant is 1 +4*10100 = 40401 → sqrt(40401) is 201. So k = (-1 +201)/2 = 200/2=100. So k=100. So yes, for s=3, k=100. So output is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's see why. For this n, we need to check if there exists s and k such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =1e18. Let's think. For example, for s=3, we have 1 +k +k² =1e18. Solving for k, approximately k² ~ 1e18 →k ~ 1e9. Let's check k=1e9: 1e9^2 + 1e9 +1 = 1e18 + 1e9 +1, which is larger than 1e18. So maybe k=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed based on specific rules. The key insight is that such a graph can be represented as a geometric series sum of the form $ \\frac{k^s - 1}{k - 1} $ for integers $ k > 1 $ and $ s \\geq 3 $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph is constructed by starting with one vertex and iteratively adding vertices in layers. The total number of vertices after `s` layers can be represented as a geometric series sum.\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each test case, we check if the given number of vertices `n` can be expressed as a geometric series sum $ \\frac{k^s - 1}{k - 1} $ for some integers $ k > 1 $ and $ s \\geq 3 $.\n3. **Binary Search for Valid `k`**: For each possible value of `s` (starting from 3 up to a reasonable upper bound), we perform a binary search on possible values of `k` to check if the series sum equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_sum(k, s, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(s):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return n + 1\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef can_form_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_s = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for s in range(3, max_s + 1):\n        # Calculate minimal value for this s\n        min_val = (2 ** s) - 1\n        if min_val > n:\n            break\n        # Binary search for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        while True:\n            val = get_sum(high, s, n)\n            if val < n:\n                high *= 2\n            else:\n                break\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        found = False\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            val = get_sum(mid, s, n)\n            if val == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif val < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if can_form_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each test case, we check if the number of vertices `n` can be represented as a geometric series sum. This involves iterating over possible values of `s` (from 3 to 60) and using binary search to find valid `k` values.\n3. **Binary Search**: For each `s`, we use binary search to efficiently determine if there exists a `k` such that the geometric series sum equals `n`. This ensures the solution is efficient even for very large values of `n`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the snowflake graph using mathematical properties and binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large inputs.",
