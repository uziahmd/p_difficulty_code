The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nFrom the problem description, the snowflake is built as follows:\n\n1. Start with one vertex.\n2. Connect it to k new vertices (k > 1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices.\n3. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (i.e., the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. \n\nWait, so the process is iterative. Let me think about the structure. Each time we add layers. Let's model the growth of the snowflake.\n\nLet me think of it as layers. The initial vertex is layer 0. Then, layer 1 consists of the k children of the root. Then, each node in layer 1 is connected to k new nodes (layer 2), and so on. But the process must have at least one such expansion beyond the initial step. Wait, the second step says that each vertex connected to only one other (so the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. This step is done at least once. So the initial step is creating the first layer (the root connected to k nodes). Then, we have to do the expansion step at least once. That would mean that each leaf (the first layer's nodes) must get k children. So the snowflake must have at least two layers: the root, then layer 1 (k nodes), then layer 2 (each of those k nodes has k children, so total k*k nodes).\n\nBut maybe the process can be done multiple times. For example, after adding layer 2, you could again expand each leaf (those in layer 2) by adding k children each. So the total number of nodes depends on the number of layers and the value of k.\n\nSo the snowflake's structure is a tree where each node (except those in the last layer) has exactly k children. But the construction requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. So the minimum depth is 2 layers (root, then layer 1, then layer 2). Wait, no. Let me re-express the construction steps:\n\nThe initial step is creating the root and connecting it to k nodes. Then, each leaf (which are those k nodes) must be connected to k new nodes. So that's the first expansion. So after that, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k*k. But the expansion step is done at least once. So the snowflake can't be just the root plus k nodes (because that would be only one expansion step? Or maybe the initial step is considered as the first expansion. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, so the initial step is the first part (adding k children to the root). Then, the second step (expanding the leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do that expansion once. So the minimal number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. For example, when k=2, the minimal is 1+2+4=7 nodes.\n\nBut wait, what if the expansion step is done multiple times? For example, after expanding once, we can do another expansion. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3, etc. But the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So the snowflake can have any number of layers as long as the expansion steps are done at least once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )) where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nLet me model the process. Let's say that the snowflake is built with m layers. The root is layer 0. Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. The initial step (connecting the root to k nodes) creates layer 1. Then, the first expansion step adds layer 2 (each node in layer 1 gets k children). Then, the next expansion step would add layer 3 (each node in layer 2 gets k children), etc. The expansion steps must be done at least once. So the number of layers is at least 2 (layers 0, 1, 2). Therefore, the total number of nodes is:\n\nTotal = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps plus 1? Or perhaps m is the number of layers minus 1?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me think:\n\nEach expansion step adds a new layer. The first expansion step (after the initial step) adds layer 2. Suppose there are t expansion steps. Then, the number of layers is 1 (initial) + t steps. Wait, the initial step is creating the first layer (layer 1). Then each expansion step adds a new layer. So if there are t expansion steps, then the number of layers is 1 + t. For example, t=1 (one expansion step) gives layers 1 and 2. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{t} k^i } ?\n\nWait, the initial step is 1 node. Then adding k nodes (layer 1). Then adding k^2 nodes (layer 2). Then adding k^3 nodes (layer 3), etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d, where d is the number of layers minus 1. But the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal d is 2 (since the initial step is creating layer 1, and then one expansion step creates layer 2). So the total is 1 + k + k^2. \n\nBut the problem allows for any number of expansion steps. So the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d, where d >= 2. Wait, no. Because the expansion steps are done at least once. So the initial step is creating layer 1. Then, the expansion steps are done once (layer 2) or more (layers up to 3, etc). So the total number of nodes is S = sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d >= 2. Because for d=0, sum is 1 (only root). For d=1, sum is 1 +k (but that's the initial step, but the expansion steps must be done once. So that's invalid. So the allowed values of d are >= 2. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step is the creation of the root and the first layer (k nodes). Then, the expansion step is done once: each leaf (the first layer) is connected to k new nodes. So that adds k * k = k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. Now, if we do another expansion step, then each leaf (the k^2 nodes in layer 2) are connected to k new nodes. Adding k^3 nodes. So total becomes 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. And so on.\n\nSo for the snowflake to be valid, the total number of nodes must be S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >= 2 (since the expansion step is done at least once). Wait, m here is the maximum exponent. Let me see:\n\nIf m=1, then S = 1 +k. But that would correspond to the initial step only. However, the expansion step must be done at least once. So that's invalid. So the valid S is when m >= 2. So S is sum from i=0 to m of k^i, with m >= 2. Alternatively, m is the number of layers minus 1, and the number of expansion steps is m-1. Because the initial step is adding layer 1, and each expansion step adds a layer.\n\nBut regardless, the formula for S is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m >= 1. Because for m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But that's invalid. Wait, no. Let me compute:\n\nsum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So for d=1, sum is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which is the case of initial step (d=1) and no expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the expansion steps are the steps after the initial one. So for the snowflake to be valid, the sum must be sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d >= 2. Because when d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2, which corresponds to initial step (d=1) and one expansion step (adding layer 2). So yes.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and m >= 2. Or wait, for m being the maximum exponent. Let me rephrase:\n\nn must be equal to (k^{d} -1)/(k-1), where d is the number of terms in the sum. Since the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} = (k^d -1)/(k-1). So for the snowflake, the sum must have d >= 3 terms. Because:\n\nOriginal steps: initial step creates 1 +k (d=2 terms?), but then expansion step must be done once. So the sum must have d >= 3 terms. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step is the root and k children. That's 1 +k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once. That adds k^2 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So d is 3 terms. So the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So for the snowflake to be valid, n must be equal to (k^d -1)/(k-1) where d >= 3 and k >=2. Wait, because d is the number of terms. For example, d=3 terms implies sum is 1 +k +k^2. And that's allowed. So the problem is to check if there exists integers k >=2 and d >=3 such that n = (k^d -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut wait, what if there's more than one expansion steps? Like, for example, d=4 terms: 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. Which would be (k^4 -1)/(k-1). So that's allowed as well.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in the form (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some integers k >=2 and d >=3.\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nSo the approach is: for each test case n, check if there exists k >=2 and d >=3 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, note that (k^d -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nSo for each possible d >=3, we can check if there's a k such that this sum equals n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check for all possible d and k.\n\nLet's think about the possible values of d. For a given n, what's the maximum possible d?\n\nFor example, for d=3, the minimal value of the sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. For larger d, the minimal sum increases. For example, d=3, k=2 gives 7, d=4, k=2 gives 15, etc. So for a given n, the possible d's are limited. For example, for d=3, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k +k^2 <=n. Similarly for higher d.\n\nBut since d can be up to log_2(n), since for k=2, the sum is 2^d -1 (since (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1). So for example, if n is 1e18, then d can be up to around 60, since 2^60 is about 1e18.\n\nSo for each possible d from 3 up to log_2(n)+1, we can check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n is 1: no (since the minimal is 7 for d=3, k=2)\n- Check for each possible d >=3 up to log_2(n) + 1:\n\n   For each d:\n\n   - Solve the equation (k^d -1)/(k-1) = n for k >=2.\n\n   How to solve this equation for k?\n\n   Let me rearrange the equation:\n\n   k^{d} - 1 = n (k-1)\n\n   => k^d - n k + (n -1) = 0\n\n   But solving this equation for k is challenging. However, since k must be an integer >=2, we can perform a binary search for k in the range [2, ... upper_bound].\n\n   What is the upper bound for k for a given d?\n\n   For a fixed d, the sum S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} = n. Since each term is positive and increasing with k, the minimal value of S for a given d is when k=2. So if for k=2, S is already larger than n, then no solution for this d. Otherwise, the upper bound for k can be found.\n\n   Alternatively, for a given d, the sum S is strictly increasing with k. So for a given d, we can binary search k in [2, ... upper] where upper can be determined.\n\n   For example, for a given d, the sum S is at least 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{d-1} = 2^d -1. If n < 2^d -1, then no solution for this d. Otherwise, the maximum possible k is such that S for k is <=n.\n\n   However, for larger d, the minimal sum (for k=2) is 2^d -1. So for example, if n is less than 2^d -1, then no solution for that d. So for each d, we can check if n >= 2^d -1. If not, skip this d.\n\n   So the steps for each d:\n\n   - Compute the minimal sum for k=2, which is 2^d -1. If this is larger than n, then no solution for this d.\n\n   - Else, perform a binary search for k in [2, ... upper], where upper can be found. For example, since for k >=2, the sum S is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} = (k^d -1)/(k-1). For k >=2, this is at least k^{d-1} (since 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} >=k^{d-1} for d >=2). So for n >=k^{d-1}, k can be up to n^(1/(d-1)).\n\n   So for binary search, the upper bound for k can be set to n^(1/(d-1)) + 1. But since n can be up to 1e18, even for d=3, the upper bound for k is sqrt(n) (since for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =n, so k^2 ~n, so k ~sqrt(n)).\n\n   So for each d, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper limit, and check if (k^d -1)/(k-1) equals n.\n\nBut how to compute (k^d -1)/(k-1) without overflow? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily big, so that's not a problem. But for large exponents, calculating k^d could be expensive. However, since d is up to about 60, and for each d, binary search is O(log n), it's manageable.\n\nBut let's think about how to compute the sum for a given k and d. For example, for k and d, compute 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} = (k^d -1)/(k-1). But if we compute this directly, for large k and d, it could take time. However, for the purposes of checking equality with n, we can compute this sum incrementally, and stop early if it exceeds n. For example, for a given k and d, compute the sum step by step, adding each term. If during the addition the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's too big.\n\nThis is important because for large d and k, the sum might be huge and exceed n. But since we are trying to find if the sum equals n, we can compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow.\n\nSo here's the plan for each d:\n\nFor each possible d starting from 3 up to max_d (like 60):\n\n   Compute the minimal sum for k=2. If it's larger than n, skip this d.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Binary search for k in [2, ... upper], where upper can be something like n^(1/(d-1)) + 1.\n\n      For each candidate k during the binary search, compute the sum s = 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\n      If s ==n, return YES.\n\n      Else if s <n, search higher.\n\n      Else search lower.\n\nBut how to find upper for binary search?\n\nWell, for the sum 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} =n. Since each term is positive, the sum is at least k^{d-1} (since the first term is 1, but for k >=2 and d >=3, the last term is k^{d-1} which is larger than 1 + ... + others. So for k^{d-1} <=n. Hence, k <= n^{1/(d-1)}. So the upper bound for k can be set as n^(1/(d-1)) + 1. However, calculating this in Python can be done via taking the integer part of n ** (1/(d-1)) and adding 2.\n\nBut for binary search, perhaps we can start with low=2 and high= some value, and during the binary search, if the sum is less than n, we can increase the high. However, that may complicate things. Alternatively, for a given d, we can compute the upper bound for k as follows:\n\nThe maximum possible k is when the sum is exactly n. Since the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} >=k^{d-1}, so k <= n^{1/(d-1)}. So the upper bound can be set as floor(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2. For example, in code, for a given d, upper = int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2.\n\nBut in Python, for exponents, we can use pow(n, 1/(d-1)), but since this is a floating point, we need to be careful. Also, for very large exponents, this might not be precise. However, given that for the binary search, even if the upper bound is a bit larger than necessary, the binary search will still work.\n\nNow, the problem is to iterate over all possible d values. What is the maximum possible d? For d=3, the minimal sum is 2^3 -1 =7. For d=60, the minimal sum is 2^60 -1 ~1e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible d is 60. So for each test case, we can loop d from 3 up to 60, and for each d, check if there exists a k.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n is 1: output NO\n\n   else:\n\n      check for d from 3 up to 60:\n\n         compute min_sum for k=2, which is 2^d -1. if min_sum >n: continue\n\n         else:\n\n            compute upper_k = floor(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2\n\n            perform binary search in [2, upper_k] for k such that the sum equals n.\n\n            if found, return YES.\n\n      also, check for d=2? No, because d must be >=3. Wait, no. Because for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. But earlier analysis said that d is the number of terms, which must be >=3. So the loop for d starts at 3.\n\nBut wait, what about d=2? For example, if n is 3. Then for d=2, the sum would be 1 +k. But d must be >=3. So no. So the code must check for d >=3.\n\nBut what if the snowflake can be formed with d=2? No, because according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. Which requires that there are at least two layers (the initial and one expansion). So the sum must have at least three terms (d=3).\n\nSo the code proceeds as described.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute the sum for a given k and d. Let's implement a function that computes the sum 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} and returns it. However, for large exponents, this can be done with a loop, and if at any point the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return a value larger than n.\n\nBut for example, for d=60 and k=2, the sum is 2^60-1, which is about 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, this is manageable.\n\nSo here's a helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for d terms, the exponents are 0 to d-1. So for d steps. For example, d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So yes, the loop runs d times.\n\nBut in code, for a given k and d, we can compute the sum as follows. However, for large k and d, this could be slow. But since d is up to 60, and for each binary search step, this is acceptable.\n\nSo during the binary search for a given d, for each candidate k, we compute the sum. If it's equal to n, return True. Else, adjust the binary search accordingly.\n\nBut for the binary search, how do we know whether the sum is less than or greater than n?\n\nFor example, suppose for a certain k, the computed sum is s. If s <n, then we need to try higher k. If s>n, try lower k.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the sum is exactly n.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, for each test case n:\n\nWe loop d from 3 to 60 (since for d=60, the minimal sum is 2^60 -1 which is 1,152,921,504,606,846,975 which is about 1e18, so for n up to 1e18, d can be up to 60).\n\nFor each d:\n\n   min_sum = 2^d -1. If n < min_sum, skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      low = 2\n\n      high = upper bound (as discussed)\n\n      while low <= high:\n\n          mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n          s = compute_sum(mid, d)\n\n          if s ==n:\n\n              return YES\n\n          elif s <n:\n\n              low = mid +1\n\n          else:\n\n              high = mid -1\n\nBut how to compute upper bound? Well, for the upper bound, we can calculate it as the integer part of n^(1/(d-1)) plus 2. For example, in Python:\n\nupper = int(n ** (1.0/(d-1))) + 2\n\nBut for exponents, this can be tricky. For example, when n is 7 and d=3, d-1 is 2. So n ** (1/2) is sqrt(7) ~2.64, so upper would be 2 + 2 =4. Which is okay, since k=2 gives sum 7.\n\nAnother example: n=7, d=3. The upper is 2+2=4. Binary search between 2 and 4. mid=3, compute_sum(3,3) is 1+3+9=13>7. So high=2. Then mid=2, compute_sum(2,3)=7, which matches. So correct.\n\nBut what if the actual k is larger than the upper bound? For example, if the upper bound is calculated as floor(n^(1/(d-1))) + 2, but the actual k is higher. How can that happen?\n\nWell, the sum for k is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} >=k^{d-1}. So if k^{d-1} <=n, then k <=n^{1/(d-1)}. So the upper bound is safe. So the upper bound is correct. Thus, using this upper bound ensures that we don't miss any possible k.\n\nBut in code, how to handle the calculation of the upper bound? For example, when n is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1}, and k is larger than n^(1/(d-1))? Well, no, because k^{d-1} <= sum =n. Hence, k <=n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nThus, the upper bound is safe.\n\nSo now, the code can proceed.\n\nBut what about when d is 3 and n is 1 +k +k^2. For example, n=15. Then possible k=3, since 1+3+9=13, no. 1+4+16=21. So no. Wait, 15 can be achieved with k=2 and d=4. Because 1+2+4+8=15. Which is (2^4-1)/(2-1) =15. So for d=4, the code would find that. So for n=15, the code would check for d=3 (min sum 7, upper bound is sqrt(15) ~3.87, so upper=3+2=5. Then binary search for k between 2 and 5. For k=2, sum is 7. For k=3, sum is 1+3+9=13. For k=4, sum is 1+4+16=21>15. So no solution for d=3. Then for d=4, min sum is 2^4-1=15. So n=15 is equal to that. So the code would check for d=4 and k=2, which would return sum=15. So yes.\n\nSo the code would correctly return YES for n=15.\n\nAnother example is n=6. For d=3, min sum is 7>6, so skipped. For d=2, not considered. So no solution. Hence output is NO. Which matches the sample input where n=6 outputs NO.\n\nNow, considering the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1 → NO\n\n2 → NO\n\n3 → NO\n\n6 → NO\n\n13 → YES? Let's see. For n=13.\n\nCheck d=3: min sum is 7. Upper bound is sqrt(13) ~3.6, so upper is 3+2=5.\n\nCheck for k=3: sum is 1+3+9=13 → yes. So for d=3, k=3. So output is YES. So sample input for n=13 is YES. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would find that.\n\nNow, the sample input for n=13 is YES, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is n=255. The output is YES. Let's see:\n\nFor example, 255 = (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So d=8, k=2. So the code would find that.\n\nSimilarly, n=10101. Let's see: 10101. Let's see if it can be expressed as (k^d -1)/(k-1). For example, 10101 = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nSuppose d=3: then 1 +k +k² = 10101 → k² +k +1 = 10101 →k² +k -10100 =0. The roots are [-1 ± sqrt(1 +4*10100)] /2 → sqrt(40401) is 201. So ( -1 +201)/2 = 200/2=100. So k=100. So yes. So for d=3, k=100. So the code would find that. Hence output YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's see why. For example, for d=3, we have 1 +k +k² =1e18. Solving for k: k² ≈ 1e18 →k≈1e9. Let's compute k=1e9: 1e9^2 +1e9 +1 = 1e18 +1e9 +1. Which is larger than 1e18. So perhaps k= 999999999. Let's compute k² +k +1. But even if there is no solution for d=3, maybe for other d's. For example, for d=2, but no. For d=3, no. For d=4, (k^4 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k² +k³ =1e18. Let's see if there is a k. For example, k=1000. Then sum is 1 +1000 + 1e6 + 1e9 = 1,001,001,001. Which is way smaller than 1e18. For k=10000, sum is 1 +10^4 + 1e8 + 1e12 = 1,000,100,010,001. Still way smaller. For k= 1e5, sum is 1 + 1e5 + 1e10 + 1e15 = 1e15 + ... which is 1e15 + ... which is 1e15 + ... which is less than 1e18. So for higher k, maybe. Let's think about k^3 ≈ 1e18 →k≈1e6. For d=4, the sum is 1 +k +k² +k³. For k=1e6, sum is ~1e18. Let's compute:\n\nk= 1e6 →k^3 = 1e18. Sum is 1 + 1e6 + 1e12 + 1e18 ≈ 1e18. So the sum is 1e18 + ... which is larger than 1e18. So perhaps there's no k for d=4. So for d=4, the code would not find a solution. Similarly for other d's. Hence the output is NO.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO for that case.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nCase n=7: which is 1+2+4. So for d=3, k=2. So YES.\n\nCase n=15: 1+2+4+8 =15 (d=4, k=2). So YES.\n\nCase n=3: no.\n\nCase n=2: no.\n\nCase n=1: no.\n\nAnother case: n= 1 +k. For example, k=2, n=3. But since d must be >=3, this is invalid.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code structure in Python:\n\nRead t.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   read n.\n\n   if n is 1: print 'NO' and continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      flag = False\n\n      for d in 3 to 60:\n\n         # compute minimal sum for k=2: 2^d -1\n\n         # since for d=3, 2^3-1=7, etc.\n\n         # but how to compute 2^d?\n\n         # for d up to 60, 2^d is manageable.\n\n         # but for d=60, 2^60 is 1e18, which is acceptable.\n\n         # compute min_sum = 2^d -1\n\n         # but if d is large, say 60, 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976. For n up to 1e18, this is larger than n for d=60. So for example, for n=1e18, 2^60 is about 1.15e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for d=60, min_sum is 2^60-1 which is larger than 1e18. So the code would skip.\n\n         # So for each d, compute min_sum as 2^d -1. If min_sum >n, skip.\n\n         # But how to compute 2^d?\n\n         # In Python, 2 **d.\n\n         # However, for d up to 60, 2**d is manageable.\n\n         # So:\n\n         min_sum = (2 **d ) -1\n\n         if min_sum >n:\n\n             continue\n\n         else:\n\n             # compute upper_k as int(n ** (1/(d-1))) +2\n\n             # but in Python, for exponents, we can use pow(n, 1/(d-1)), but for integer exponents?\n\n             # However, for exponents, we need to be careful with floating points. For example, for n=7, d=3, d-1=2, n**(1/2) is sqrt(7) ~2.645, so int(2.645) is 2, adding 2 gives 4.\n\n             # So:\n\n             # compute upper_k = int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2\n\n             # but in Python, for large exponents, this may not be precise. So perhaps use binary search for upper_k?\n\n             # Alternatively, for the upper bound, we can use a binary search approach. But for code simplicity, perhaps proceed with the formula.\n\n             # However, in Python, for exponents, when dealing with very large numbers, the floating point precision may not be sufficient. So perhaps using math.isqrt for square roots, but for higher exponents, perhaps not. Alternatively, use binary search to find the upper_k.\n\n             # But for code simplicity, let's proceed with the formula.\n\n             # However, in Python, the exponentiation can be done as:\n\n             exponent = 1.0/(d-1)\n\n             upper_k = int(n ** exponent) + 2\n\n             # Now, perform binary search between low=2 and high=upper_k.\n\n             low = 2\n\n             high = upper_k\n\n             while low <= high:\n\n                 mid = (low + high) //2\n\n                 # compute the sum for mid and d.\n\n                 # compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n                 # but how to compute it without overflow?\n\n                 # implement compute_sum as follows:\n\n                 # sum_terms = 0\n\n                 # current_term = 1\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific way with layers of vertices, and we need to check if there exists a valid configuration for any $ k > 1 $ and at least two expansion steps.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph is constructed such that each vertex (except those in the last layer) has exactly $ k $ children. The total number of vertices forms a geometric series: $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^{d-1} $, where $ d \\geq 3 $ (since at least two expansion steps are required).\n\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible depth $ d $ (starting from 3 up to a reasonable maximum, say 60), we check if there exists an integer $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Valid $ k $**: For each $ d $, we use binary search to find a valid $ k $ that satisfies the geometric series sum equation. This involves checking if the sum of the series for a given $ k $ and $ d $ equals $ n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(d):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return float('inf')\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_d = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for d in range(3, max_d + 1):\n        min_sum = (2 ** d) - 1\n        if min_sum > n:\n            continue\n        # Compute upper bound for k\n        exponent = 1.0 / (d - 1)\n        upper_k = int(n ** exponent) + 2\n        low = 2\n        high = upper_k\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Valid $ n $**: The function `is_possible` checks if a valid snowflake can be formed for a given $ n $.\n3. **Geometric Series Calculation**: For each depth $ d $ from 3 to 60, we calculate the minimum sum using $ k = 2 $. If this minimum sum exceeds $ n $, we skip further checks for that $ d $.\n4. **Binary Search for $ k $**: For each valid $ d $, we perform a binary search on $ k $ to see if the geometric series sum matches $ n $.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down potential values of $ k $ and $ d $ using mathematical properties and binary search, ensuring that we handle very large values of $ n $ up to $ 10^{18} $ efficiently.",
