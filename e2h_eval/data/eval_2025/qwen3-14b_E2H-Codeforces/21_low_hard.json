The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Neko wants to open as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the problem reduces to counting how many even and odd chests there are, and then matching them with the available even and odd keys. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let's split the chests into two groups: even_chest and odd_chest. Similarly, split the keys into even_key and odd_key. \n\nFor example, an even chest (a_i even) can be opened by an odd key (b_j odd). Because even + odd = odd. Similarly, an odd chest (a_i odd) can be opened by an even key (b_j even). \n\nSo the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nOh right! Because each even chest needs an odd key. But each key can be used once. So if there are 3 even chests and 5 odd keys, then we can open 3 chests here. Similarly for the other way around. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chest, odd_keys) + min(odd_chest, even_keys).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parity.\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chest count is 3 (14,6,2), odd_chest is 2 (9, 11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys is 1 (7), even_keys is 3 (others). \n\nSo min(3, 1) is 1 (for even chests and odd keys). Then min(2, 3) is 2 (odd chests and even keys). Total 1+2=3, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: second input is 5 1. Chests are all even (2,4,6,8,10). Keys is 5 (odd). So even_chest is 5, odd_keys is 1. So min(5,1) is 1. The other part is min(0, 0) since there are no odd chests. So total 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_chest is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. The other part: odd_chest is 0, even_keys is 4. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid. \n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i. Count how many are even and odd.\n\nRead the list of b_j. Count how many are even and odd.\n\nCompute the sum of min(even_chest, odd_keys) + min(odd_chest, even_keys).\n\nThat's the answer.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read the a list. Then count even_a and odd_a.\n\nThen read the b list. Count even_b and odd_b.\n\nResult is min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd? For each number in a, check if it's even or odd. Same for b.\n\nIn Python, for a list, we can do something like:\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a_list if x % 2 == 0)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut since the numbers can be up to 1e9, but mod 2 is easy.\n\nSo code steps",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys, where a chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This requires matching even and odd numbers from the chests and keys appropriately.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is odd. This happens when one number is even and the other is odd.\n2. **Categorize Numbers**: Separate the chests and keys into even and odd counts.\n3. **Optimal Matching**: \n   - Even chests can be opened by odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be opened by even keys.\n4. **Calculate Maximum Openings**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of two minimum values:\n   - Minimum of even chests and odd keys.\n   - Minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_a = n - even_a\n    \n    even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_b = m - even_b\n    \n    result = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We count how many even and odd numbers are present in both the chests and keys lists.\n3. **Matching Strategy**: By using the counts of even and odd numbers from both lists, we determine the maximum possible matches where each chest can be opened by a key based on the parity condition.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is computed by summing the minimum values of the possible valid pairs (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys).\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the available keys, adhering to the problem constraints and optimizing for both time and space complexity.",
