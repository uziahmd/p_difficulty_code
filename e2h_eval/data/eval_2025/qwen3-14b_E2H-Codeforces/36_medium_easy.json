The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to calculate the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for this to be possible. \n\nThe key here is to model the valid configurations of towers. Because when you choose the signal powers, each town must be covered exactly once. Let's think about how the towers can be arranged.\n\nLet me think of the example given. For n=2, the only valid case is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then each can have power 1. That way, town 1 covers itself (since |c-i| < p, which is 1. So town 1 is covered by its own tower, town 2 is covered by its own. Town 0 is not covered by anyone because the tower in 1 has p=1, so it reaches up to 1-1=0? Wait wait, the condition is |c - i| < p. So for a tower at i with power p, it covers all cities c where the distance from i is less than p. So for p=1, the range is i-1 < c < i+1. Since c is integer, that would be c = i-0. So for i=1 and p=1, the range is cities where |c -1| < 1. Which is only c=1. Because 0 is at distance 1, which is not less than 1. So the tower in 1 with p=1 covers only town 1. Similarly for tower in 2 with p=1, covers only town 2. So that works. Then towns 0 and 3 (n+1=3) are not covered. So that's why the example for n=2 gives 1/4 probability.\n\nSo the valid tower configurations must allow for some way to assign signal powers such that each town is covered exactly once. How can we model these configurations?\n\nLet me think of the problem as needing to partition the towns 1..n into intervals, each covered by a tower in the middle. Because for a tower to cover a range, say from a to b, it needs to be placed at some position i, and have a power p such that the coverage includes exactly those towns. But since each town must be covered exactly once, the coverage ranges must be non-overlapping and covering all towns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the towers must form a certain pattern. For example, each tower must be responsible for a contiguous segment of towns, and the tower's position is in the middle of that segment. Because if a tower is at position i, then the maximum coverage it can have is such that it covers from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1? Wait, no. Let me think again. The coverage is all cities c where |c - i| < p. So for p=2, the cities covered are i-1, i, i+1. So the length of the interval is 2p-1? Or maybe not. For p=2, the distance is less than 2. So c can be i-1, i, or i+1 (since |c-i| is 0,1, or 1. So yes. So the coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)]? Because for example, p=2, the max distance is less than 2, so the cities are from i-1 to i+1, which is 3 cities. So the length is 2p-1.\n\nBut for the problem, each town must be covered exactly once. So the way to arrange this is that the coverage regions are non-overlapping and cover all towns. Also, the towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered. So for the coverage regions, they cannot include town 0 or town n+1. So for a tower at position i, the maximum p it can have is such that the coverage doesn't reach beyond the allowed regions.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the problem as the towers must be arranged such that there's a way to partition the towns 1..n into segments, each of which is covered by exactly one tower. For each segment, the tower must be located in the middle. For example, a segment of length k must have a tower in the middle. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the valid configurations are those where the towers are placed in such a way that between any two adjacent towers, there's a certain relation. For example, if there are two towers at positions i and j (i < j), then the area between them must be covered exactly once. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Let's consider that the entire sequence of towns 1..n must be covered by some tower. Suppose there's a tower at position k. Then, the coverage of this tower must include some left part and right part. But for the coverage to not interfere with other towers, perhaps the tower's coverage must extend exactly to the left and right ends of the segments it's responsible for.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to the following: the set of towers must form a valid arrangement where each tower is responsible for a segment of towns, and each such segment is covered exactly by that tower. For that, the tower must be placed in the middle of the segment, and the segment must be of length 2p-1, where p is the power. But since the power can be any integer, perhaps the segment can be any length, as long as the tower is placed in the middle.\n\nBut how to model this. For example, if there's a tower at position i, then it can be responsible for a segment that starts at i - (p-1) and ends at i + (p-1). But since the towns are 1..n, we need to ensure that the segment does not include town 0 or n+1. So for the tower at i, the maximum possible p is such that i - (p-1) >= 1 and i + (p-1) <= n. But that's not necessarily required. Because the tower could have a smaller p, which allows for shorter coverage. However, the problem requires that all towns are covered exactly once. Therefore, the entire coverage must be partitioned into segments, each covered by exactly one tower.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of tiling the line with certain tiles, where each tile is a segment that must be covered by a tower in the middle.\n\nLet me think of possible valid tower arrangements. For example, if there is a single tower in the middle of the entire sequence. For n=5, the tower must be at position 3, and have p=3. Then, the coverage is from 0 to 6, but since the towns are 1-5, that's okay. Wait, but town 0 is not supposed to be covered. Oh, right! So the tower's coverage must not include town 0 or n+1. Therefore, the maximum p for a tower at position i is such that the coverage does not reach town 0 or n+1. So for a tower at i, the maximum p is min(i, n+1 - i). Because, for example, if the tower is at position i, then the maximum p that doesn't reach town 0 is p <= i (since |0 - i| = i, which must be >= p. So p must be <= i. Similarly, for town n+1, the distance is (n+1 - i), so p must be <= n+1 - i. So the maximum p for a tower at i is min(i, n+1 - i). But in our problem, the tower's p can be anything as long as the coverage doesn't reach 0 or n+1. But for the purpose of covering the towns, the tower's coverage must be chosen so that it covers exactly the towns assigned to it.\n\nBut how do we model the valid tower configurations? It seems that the tower configuration must be such that there exists a way to partition the towns into intervals, each of which is covered by exactly one tower. And each such interval must have a tower in the middle. So for each interval [a, b], there is a tower at position m (the middle of the interval). But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the towers must form a structure where between any two adjacent towers, there is a certain relation. For example, if there are two towers at positions i and j (i < j), then the region between i and j must be covered by exactly one of the towers. But how?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming. Let dp[i] be the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. Then, for each i, we can consider adding a new tower in such a way that it forms a valid segment.\n\nWait, but the problem is not about counting the number of configurations, but about the probability. However, since each tower is built with probability 1/2, the total number of possible configurations is 2^n. The answer is (number of valid configurations) / 2^n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of valid tower configurations, then dividing by 2^n, and outputting that fraction modulo 998244353.\n\nSo the key is to compute the number of valid tower configurations.\n\nNow, how to find that number.\n\nLet me think of the valid configurations. For each valid configuration, the towers must be arranged in such a way that they can be partitioned into segments where each segment is covered by exactly one tower in the middle.\n\nFor example, for a segment of length l, the tower must be placed in the middle. For even lengths, perhaps there's no exact middle. Wait, but for a segment of length l, the tower must be placed such that it can cover the entire segment. For example, if the segment is from a to b (inclusive), then the tower must be placed at position m such that m is the midpoint. But how?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose we have a segment of length 1 (only town 1). Then the tower must be placed at 1. The power can be 1 (covers only town 1). That's valid.\n\nIf the segment is of length 2 (towns 1 and 2). Then there must be a tower at 1 and 2? No, that's not possible. Because if both are present, then their coverage can be set to 1, which covers only themselves. But if only one of them is present, then the tower must have p=2. For example, if the tower is at 1, then p=2 would cover towns 0 (which is invalid) and 1 and 2. But town 0 is not allowed. So that's invalid. Similarly for a tower at 2 with p=2: it covers towns 1, 2, 3. Town 3 is n+1 if n=2. Which is invalid. So the only way to cover towns 1 and 2 is to have both towers present. Then each can have p=1.\n\nAnother example: segment of length 3 (towns 1, 2, 3). The tower must be at position 2. Then p can be 2, which covers towns 1, 2, 3. That's valid. So in this case, the tower is present at 2, and no others in the segment.\n\nSo for a segment of length l, the tower must be placed in the middle. For even l, perhaps the segment can't be covered by a single tower? Or maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, let's think about a segment of length 2. Suppose the tower is at position 1. To cover towns 1 and 2, the power must be at least 2. But that would cover town 0 (distance 1 from 1) which is not allowed. So no. If the tower is at position 2, same problem. So the only way to cover towns 1 and 2 is to have both towers present. Then each can have power 1.\n\nSo this suggests that the valid tower configurations are those that can be partitioned into segments where each segment is either:\n\n- A single town (so the tower is present there), or\n\n- A segment of length 2k+1 (odd length) with a tower in the middle (so the tower is present there), and no towers in the segment except that middle one.\n\nWait, but for the segment of length 2k+1, the tower must be present in the middle, and the rest of the towns in the segment must not have towers. Because otherwise, if there are towers in the segment, how would the coverage work?\n\nAlternatively, the configuration must be such that for each tower, there is a segment of towns that it is responsible for, and that segment is covered exactly by that tower. So for a tower at position i, the segment it covers is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). But since p can be chosen, the tower can be responsible for any segment that includes i and is symmetric around i, and doesn't include town 0 or n+1.\n\nBut how to model this. It seems that the valid configurations are those where the towers are placed in such a way that no two towers are adjacent. Wait, no. For example, in the case of n=2, the valid configuration has two adjacent towers. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as a recurrence relation. Let f(n) be the number of valid configurations for n towns. How can we find f(n)?\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nFor n=1, the valid configurations are those where there's a tower in 1. Because then we can set p=1. So the number of valid configurations is 1. So the probability is 1/2.\n\nFor n=2, the valid configurations are only when both 1 and 2 are present. So 1 configuration. Probability 1/4.\n\nFor n=3, what's the valid configurations?\n\nCase 1: Tower only at 2. Then p=2, which covers towns 1,2,3. That's valid. So this is one configuration.\n\nCase 2: Towers at 1, 2, 3. Then each can have p=1. Valid.\n\nCase 3: Towers at 1 and 3. Can we assign p? Let's see. Tower at 1 with p=2 would cover towns 0 (invalid) and 1, 2. Tower at 3 with p=2 would cover towns 2, 3, 4 (invalid). So this configuration is invalid. Because town 2 is covered by both towers? Wait, no. Because if we set p=1 for both, then tower 1 covers 1, tower 3 covers 3. Town 2 is not covered. So that's invalid. So the configuration with towers at 1 and 3 is invalid. \n\nWhat about towers at 1 and 2? Then, tower 1 can have p=1 (covers 1), tower 2 can have p=2 (covers 1,2,3). But town 1 is covered by both. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly for towers at 2 and 3. So the only valid configurations are the ones where there's a tower at 2 alone, or towers at all three positions. So total of 2 valid configurations. Thus, the probability is 2/8 = 1/4. Wait, but according to the note for n=3, the answer is 1/4. Which matches. So for n=3, the answer is 2/8=1/4. Which implies that f(3) = 2.\n\nSo how can we find a recurrence for f(n)?\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nn=1: f(1)=1\n\nn=2: f(2)=1\n\nn=3: f(3)=2\n\nLet me think of n=4. What is f(4)?\n\nPossible valid configurations:\n\nCase 1: Tower at 2 and 4. But how to cover the towns. Let's see:\n\nTower at 2: can have p=2 (covers 1-3). Tower at 4: p=2 (covers 3-5). But town 3 is covered by both. Invalid.\n\nCase 2: Tower at 2 and 3. Then, maybe set p=1 for both. Then town 2 and 3 are covered, but towns 1 and 4 are not. Not valid.\n\nCase 3: Tower at 3 only. Then p=3 would cover towns 1-5 (but n=4, so 1-4). So towns 1-4 are covered. But then, town 0 is not covered (distance from 3 is 3, which is equal to p=3. So |c - i| < p. So for p=3, the coverage is towns where distance is less than 3. So for i=3, towns 0 is at distance 3, which is not less than p. So it's not covered. Town 4 is at distance 1 < 3. So yes. So this is valid. So the configuration where only tower at 3 is present is valid. So that's one configuration.\n\nCase 4: Tower at 2 and 4. Not sure. Let me think of another possibility.\n\nCase 5: Towers at 1, 3, 4. Maybe not. Let me think of other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, think of the valid configurations as those that can be partitioned into segments, each covered by exactly one tower. For example:\n\nFor n=4, the valid configurations could be:\n\n- Only tower at 2 and 4? No. Let me think of another way.\n\nAnother approach: For each valid configuration, there must be a way to split the towns into segments where each segment is covered by a single tower. So for the entire sequence of towns 1..n, there must be a tower in the middle of the entire sequence. For example, if the entire sequence is covered by a tower at position m, then m can be any position such that the tower can cover the entire sequence. For that, the tower's p must be at least (n)/2 + 1? Or something like that.\n\nWait, the tower at position m must be able to cover all towns from 1 to n. For that, the distance from m to 1 must be less than p, and the distance from m to n must be less than p. So p must be larger than max(m - 1, n - m). So the minimal p is max(m - 1, n - m) + 1. But in this case, the tower's coverage will include all towns from 1 to n. However, this would require that the tower is placed at m, and that there are no other towers in the configuration. Because if there are other towers, their coverage would interfere.\n\nSo for the entire sequence to be covered by a single tower, the tower must be placed at position m, and no other towers. So for example, for n=3, m=2. For n=4, m can be 2 or 3? Let's see:\n\nFor n=4, tower at position 2. To cover towns 1-4, the p must be such that |c - 2| < p for all c in 1-4. The maximum distance is 2 (for town 4). So p must be > 2. So p >=3. Then the coverage would be towns where |c - 2| <3 → c can be -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But towns 0 and 5 are outside. So towns 1-4 are covered. So that's valid. So the tower at 2 with p=3 is acceptable. So the configuration with only tower at 2 is valid. Similarly for tower at 3.\n\nSo for n=4, the configurations that have only a tower at 2 or 3 are valid. Also, there may be other configurations where the towns are partitioned into multiple segments.\n\nFor example, for n=4, suppose there are towers at positions 2 and 4. Then, the tower at 2 can cover towns 1-3 (with p=2), and the tower at 4 can cover town 4 (with p=1). That's valid. So the configuration where towers are at 2 and 4 is valid. Similarly, towers at 1 and 3. Let's see:\n\nTower at 1 with p=1 (covers 1), tower at 3 with p=2 (covers 2,3,4). That's valid. So this configuration is also valid.\n\nSo for n=4, the valid configurations include:\n\n- Only tower at 2 (valid).\n\n- Only tower at 3 (valid).\n\n- Towers at 2 and 4 (valid).\n\n- Towers at 1 and 3 (valid).\n\n- Towers at 1, 2, 3, 4? Let's see. Each can have p=1. Then towns 1-4 are covered. So valid.\n\n- Towers at 1 and 2. Then, tower 1 can have p=1 (covers 1), tower 2 can have p=2 (covers 1, 2, 3). But town 1 is covered twice. Invalid.\n\n- Towers at 2 and 3. Tower 2 can have p=1 (covers 2), tower 3 can have p=1 (covers 3). Then towns 1 and 4 are not covered. Invalid.\n\n- Towers at 3 and 4. Similar to earlier case. Tower 3 can cover 3 and 4 (p=2?), but then town 4 is covered by tower 3 (distance 1 < 2) and tower 4 (distance 0 < p=1). So if both are present, then town 4 is covered by both. Invalid.\n\nSo the valid configurations are:\n\nOnly tower at 2 → 1 configuration.\n\nOnly tower at 3 → 1.\n\nTowers at 2 and 4 → 1.\n\nTowers at 1 and 3 → 1.\n\nTowers at 1, 2, 3, 4 → 1.\n\nAre there any others?\n\nWhat about towers at 1 and 4? Let's see. Tower 1 can have p=1 (covers 1), tower 4 can have p=1 (covers 4). Towns 2 and 3 are not covered. Invalid.\n\nWhat about towers at 1 and 2 and 4? Let's see. Tower 1 (p=1), tower 2 (p=1), tower 4 (p=1). Towns 1 and 2 are covered by their respective towers, town 4 is covered. Town 3 is not. Invalid.\n\nWhat about towers at 2 and 3 and 4? Tower 2 (p=1), tower 3 (p=1), tower 4 (p=1). Towns 2,3,4 covered, but town 1 not. Invalid.\n\nWhat about towers at 1 and 3 and 4? Tower 1 (p=1) covers 1. Tower 3 (p=2) covers 1,2,3,4? Wait, for p=2, the coverage is towns where |c-3| < 2 → 1, 2, 3, 4? No: |c-3| < 2 → c can be 1, 2, 3, 4? No. For example, |1-3|=2 which is not less than 2. So the coverage is towns 2, 3, and 4? Because for c=2, distance 1 < 2. c=3, 0 < 2. c=4, 1 < 2. So tower 3 with p=2 covers towns 2,3,4. Then tower 4 with p=1 covers 4. So town 4 is covered by both. Invalid.\n\nSo the valid configurations are the five I mentioned. So for n=4, f(4) = 5?\n\nWait, but how many configurations are there? Let me count:\n\nEach of the valid configurations is:\n\n1. {2}\n\n2. {3}\n\n3. {2,4}\n\n4. {1,3}\n\n5. {1,2,3,4}\n\nAre there any more?\n\nWhat about {1, 2, 3}? Let's see. Tower 1 (p=1), tower 2 (p=2), tower 3 (p=1). Then:\n\nTower 2 with p=2 covers 1,2,3. So town 1 is covered by both tower 1 and 2. Invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: {1, 3, 4}? As discussed earlier, invalid.\n\nHow about {2, 3}? No, because towns 1 and 4 are not covered.\n\nWhat about {1, 2, 4}? Tower 1 (p=1), tower 2 (p=1), tower 4 (p=1). Town 3 is not covered. Invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: {2, 3, 4}? Tower 2 (p=1), tower 3 (p=2) covers 2,3,4. Tower 4 (p=1) covers 4. So town 4 is covered twice. Invalid.\n\nSo yes, f(4) = 5. Then, for n=4, the probability is 5/(2^4) = 5/16.\n\nNow, trying to find a pattern in the numbers:\n\nn=1: 1 → 1\n\nn=2: 1 → 1\n\nn=3: 2 → 2\n\nn=4: 5 → 5\n\nLet me check for n=5. Let's see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the sequence 1, 1, 2, 5... it looks familiar. Like the Fibonacci sequence, but not exactly. Let's see:\n\nFor n=1: 1\n\nn=2: 1\n\nn=3: 2 = 1+1?\n\nn=4: 5 = 2 + 3?\n\nWait, perhaps it's following the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). Let's check:\n\nn=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 → correct.\n\nn=4: f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 → but earlier calculation says 5. So that's not matching. Hmm. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) = f(n-1) + 2*f(n-2) ?\n\nFor n=3: 1 + 2*1 = 3 → no. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers 1,1,2,5... for n=1 to 4. Let me think of the values for n=5. Suppose I can find f(5) and see the pattern.\n\nBut this might take time. Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think of the recurrence relation. For the first town (town 1), there are two possibilities:\n\nEither there is a tower at town 1, or not.\n\nBut how does that affect the rest of the configuration.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the valid configurations can be represented as sequences where each tower is part of a certain structure. For example, the first tower must be placed in such a way that it covers some segment, and the rest of the configuration is handled recursively.\n\nLet me think of the DP approach. Let dp[n] be the number of valid configurations for n towns.\n\nTo build dp[n], consider the following possibilities:\n\nCase 1: There is a tower at position n. Then, this tower must cover town n. How? Well, it can be part of a segment that ends at n. For example, the tower at position n could be the one responsible for covering the last few towns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the last tower. Suppose the last tower is at position k. Then, the segment that this tower is responsible for must end at n. For example, if the tower is at k, then the segment it covers must end at n. So the segment would be from (k - (p-1)) to n. Since the tower is at k, the maximum possible p is such that k - (p-1) >= 1 and k + (p-1) <= n. But since the segment ends at n, then k + (p-1) = n. So p-1 = n - k → p = n -k + 1. Also, since the segment starts at k - (p-1) = k - (n -k) = 2k -n. This start must be ≥ 1. So 2k -n ≥ 1 → k ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSo for the tower at position k to be responsible for covering up to n, it must be that k is ≥ ceil( (n+1)/2 ), and the segment starts at 2k -n. So the segment [2k -n, n] is covered by this tower. And within this segment, there must be no other towers except possibly the ones in the previous segments.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think recursively. Suppose that the tower at position k is responsible for the segment [a, n], then the segment [a, n] must have no towers except for the one at k. And the segment [1, a-1] must be a valid configuration.\n\nSo for this case, the number of ways is dp[a-1], multiplied by the possibility that the tower at k is present, and no towers are present in the segment [a, n] except for k.\n\nBut how to find a? Well, since the segment [a, n] is covered by the tower at k, and the start of the segment is a = 2k -n. Also, since the tower is at k, and the segment [a, n] is covered by it, then there must be no towers in [a, n] except for k. So the tower at k must be present, and all other positions in [a, n] must not have towers.\n\nSo the number of ways for this scenario is the sum over all possible k (where k is in [ceil((n+1)/2), n]) of dp[a-1], where a = 2k -n. But since a must be ≥1, and also, the segment [a, n] must be covered by the tower at k. Also, since the tower is present at k, and the rest of the positions in [a, n] are not present.\n\nSo for each possible k, the contribution to dp[n] is dp[a-1], where a = 2k -n. But how to find the range of k?\n\nAlternatively, for the segment [a, n], the tower must be at position k = (a + n)/2. Because the segment is symmetric around k. For example, if the segment is [a, n], then the length is n -a + 1. For this to be covered by a tower at k, the length must be 2m + 1, where m is the radius. So the length is 2m + 1 = n -a + 1. And since k is the middle, k = a + m = a + ( (n -a +1 -1)/2 ) = a + (n -a)/2 = (a + n)/2. So for k to be integer, a + n must be even. Or maybe not? Because m can be any integer, but the length must be odd. Wait, for the tower to cover the entire segment [a, n], the length must be odd. Otherwise, there's no way to have a symmetric coverage. For example, length 2: can't be covered by a single tower. Unless the tower is placed in between. But that's not possible since the towns are integers.\n\nSo the length of the segment must be odd. So n -a + 1 must be odd. Which implies that a and n have different parity. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, the segment [a, n] must be of length 2m+1, and the tower is at position a + m. So a + m = k. Also, since the segment ends at n, then a + m + m = n → a + 2m = n → a = n - 2m. Also, since the tower is at k = a + m = n - 2m + m = n - m. So k = n - m. Also, since the segment starts at a = n - 2m, and must be ≥1. So n - 2m ≥ 1 → m ≤ (n-1)/2.\n\nBut m can be any integer ≥0. So for each possible m, we can have a segment [a, n] = [n - 2m, n], covered by the tower at k = n - m. And for this to be valid, the segment must be of length 2m + 1. And the tower must be present at k, and no towers in the segment except for that.\n\nSo for each m ≥ 0, such that a = n - 2m ≥ 1, the contribution to dp[n] is dp[a-1] * 1 (since the segment [a, n] has no towers except for k, which is present).\n\nBut since the tower at k is present, and the rest of the segment is not, the number of ways for this scenario is dp[a-1] multiplied by 1 (the presence of the tower at k, and absence of others in the segment).\n\nBut how does this fit into the DP recurrence? Let's see.\n\nSo dp[n] is the sum over all possible m of dp[a-1], where a = n - 2m, and a ≥ 1. Also, for each such m, we have a term.\n\nAdditionally, there's another case where the last segment is not covered by a single tower, but the configuration is built by combining smaller configurations. Wait, no. Because the entire configuration must be partitioned into segments, each covered by a single tower. So the recurrence must account for all possible ways to split the sequence into segments.\n\nBut the way I thought earlier considers the case where the last segment is covered by a single tower. Then, the rest of the sequence (before that segment) is handled by dp[a-1].\n\nBut what about cases where the last segment is not a single tower, but part of a larger configuration? For example, if there are multiple towers in the last part.\n\nWait, but the entire configuration must be partitioned into segments. So the last segment must be covered by exactly one tower. So the recurrence is correct.\n\nThus, the DP recurrence is:\n\ndp[n] = sum_{m} dp[a-1], where a = n - 2m, and a ≥ 1. Also, since m can be 0, 1, ..., floor((n-1)/2).\n\nBut wait, for m=0, a = n - 0 = n. Then the segment is [n, n], which is length 1. So the tower must be at position n. And the contribution is dp[n-1] (since a-1 = n-1).\n\nFor m=1, a = n - 2*1 = n-2. Then the segment is [n-2, n], which is length 3. The tower is at n-1. The contribution is dp[n-3].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[n] = sum_{k=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} dp[n - 2k - 1} ?\n\nWait, let's re-express. For each m, a = n - 2m. Then a-1 = n - 2m -1. So the sum is over m such that a ≥ 1 → n - 2m ≥ 1 → m ≤ (n-1)/2. So m ranges from 0 to floor((n-1)/2).\n\nThus, dp[n] = sum_{m=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} dp[ n - 2m - 1 ] ?\n\nWait, no. Because the term is dp[a-1] where a = n - 2m. So a-1 = n - 2m -1.\n\nBut for m=0: a = n → a-1 = n-1. So dp[n-1].\n\nFor m=1: a = n-2 → a-1 = n-3 → dp[n-3].\n\nFor m=2: a = n-4 → a-1 = n-5 → dp[n-5].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[n] = sum_{k=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} dp[n - 2k - 1} ?\n\nWait, but when you vary m, the term is dp[ n - 2m - 1 ] ?\n\nYes. So for each m, the term is dp[ (n - 2m) - 1 ] = dp[ n - 2m -1 ].\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[n] = sum_{m=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} dp[ n - 2m - 1 ]\n\nBut wait, when m=0, the term is dp[n-1]. When m=1, it's dp[n-3], and so on. So this is the same as summing over all possible ways to split the first part of the sequence into a valid configuration, and then having a segment ending at n.\n\nBut what about the case where there are multiple segments in the configuration? For example, for n=2,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Insight**: The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Let `dp[n]` represent the number of valid configurations for `n` towns. The key insight is that each valid configuration can be partitioned into segments where each segment is covered by exactly one tower located at the middle of the segment.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation for `dp[n]` is derived based on the possible ways to split the sequence of towns into valid segments. Specifically, `dp[n]` can be computed as the sum of valid configurations for smaller segments ending at each possible position.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    max_n = n\n    dp = [0] * (max_n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: 0 towns, 1 way (empty configuration)\n    \n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        total = 0\n        m_max = (i - 1) // 2\n        for m in range(0, m_max + 1):\n            a_minus_1 = i - 2 * m - 1\n            if a_minus_1 >= 0:\n                total += dp[a_minus_1]\n        dp[i] = total % MOD\n    \n    # The total number of valid configurations is dp[n]\n    # The probability is dp[n] / (2^n)\n    # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n    power = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_power = pow(power, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    result = (dp[n] * inv_power) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: We initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` holds the number of valid configurations for `i` towns.\n2. **Base Case**: `dp[0]` is initialized to 1, representing the empty configuration for zero towns.\n3. **Filling DP Array**: For each `i` from 1 to `n`, we compute `dp[i]` by considering all possible ways to split the sequence of towns ending at `i` into valid segments. This is done by iterating over possible segment lengths and summing up valid configurations from smaller subproblems.\n4. **Modular Inverse**: To compute the probability, we use modular inverse to divide by `2^n` under modulo 998244353, which is efficiently done using Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, adhering to the constraints and ensuring correctness.",
