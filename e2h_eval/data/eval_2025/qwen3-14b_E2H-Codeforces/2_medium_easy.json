Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all other cells (not on the diagonals) are the same and not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, collect all the characters from the diagonals. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are same and different.\n\nBut wait, for the diagonals, there's overlapping in the middle cell when n is odd. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when collecting the diagonal characters, we need to make sure that we don't have duplicates. But since the problem says that all cells on the diagonals must be same, even if they are overlapping, it's okay. So for example, if the center cell is part of both diagonals, but it's same as others, then it's okay.\n\nSo first, collect all the cells on the two diagonals. Let's think of each cell (i,j) where i == j or i + j == n - 1. For each cell in the grid, check if it's on either diagonal.\n\nSo for each cell in the grid, if it's on a diagonal, check if it's equal to the first diagonal character. Otherwise, check if it's equal to the non-diagonal character.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal characters? Well, perhaps first check that all diagonal cells are same. Let's take the first diagonal cell (0,0) as the reference. Then check all other diagonal cells (both diagonals) are same as this.\n\nWait, but what if the first diagonal cell is part of the first diagonal. For example, in a 5x5 grid, the first diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). The other diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). So the cell (2,2) is part of both. So if all the cells on both diagonals are same, then all of them must be same as (0,0) and (0,4) as well. So maybe the first step is to check that all the cells on the diagonals are same as the first diagonal cell (0,0). But also, the other diagonal's first cell (0, n-1) must be same as (0,0). Because if the first cell of the first diagonal is 'x', and the first cell of the second diagonal is 'y', then they are different, which would violate the condition.\n\nSo, for all cells in both diagonals, they must be the same. So the first thing is to check that all those cells are same. Let's collect all the characters in the diagonals and check that they are all same. Then, collect all the non-diagonal characters and check that they are same and different.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on either of the two diagonals.\n- Collect all the diagonal characters into a set. If the size of the set is more than 1, then return NO.\n- Then collect all the non-diagonal characters into another set. If the size is more than 1, return NO.\n- Then check that the two sets are different. If they are same, return NO. Else, return YES.\n\nWait, but the non-diagonal characters must all be same and different from the diagonal's character. So the set for non-diagonal should have exactly one element, and that element must not be equal to the diagonal's element.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCheck that all diagonal cells are same (d_char).\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal cells are same (o_char).\n\nCheck that d_char != o_char.\n\nIf all three conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j), check if it's on a diagonal.\n\nFor example, for i in 0..n-1, j in 0..n-1:\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's a diagonal cell.\n\nElse: non-diagonal.\n\nSo, collect all diagonal characters and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut for the diagonal characters, we can check that all are same. Similarly for non-diagonal.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think: for the diagonal characters, collect all the characters from the two diagonals. Then check that all are same.\n\nSimilarly for non-diagonal.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal characters? Well, n is at least 3. For example, n=3. The diagonals have 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 cells (since the center is counted twice). So the non-diagonal cells are 9 -5 =4 cells. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So in general, for n >=3, the non-diagonal cells are present.\n\nBut for example, in n=1, but the problem says n is odd and >=3. So no problem.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars: return YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4. So no, for any n >=3, the non-diagonal cells are present.\n\nBut let me check for n=3. The total cells is 9. The diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells. So 9-5=4 non-diagonal. So yes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid as list of strings.\n\nThen collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\nCheck the conditions.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for the grid, each row is a string. So for grid[i][j], that's the j-th character of the i-th row.\n\nSo, code steps.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (x), i=0, j=4 (x). Then i=1, j=1 (x), j=3 (x). i=2, j=2 (x). i=3, j=1 (x), j=3 (x). i=4, j=0 (x), j=4 (x).\n\nWait, for each cell (i,j) where i ==j or i +j =4 (since n=5, n-1=4).\n\nLooking at row 2, column 2: it's x. But in row 2, the cell (2,0) is s. So for the diagonals, the cell (2,2) is part of both diagonals.\n\nBut looking at the first sample input, the diagonals have some letters. For example, the cell (2,0) is s, but that's not part of the diagonals. Wait, for i=2, j=0: i +j = 2+0=2, which is not equal to 4. So it's not part of the diagonals. So the diagonals for this grid are:\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (x) and j=4 (x). For i=1, j=1 (x) and j=3 (x). For i=2, j=2 (x). For i=3, j=1 (x) and j=3 (x). For i=4, j=0 (x) and j=4 (x).\n\nSo all the diagonal cells are x. So diagonal_chars is {'x'}, but what about the non-diagonal cells?\n\nLooking at row 0, columns 1,2,3: o, o, o. Row 1: columns 0, 2, 4: o, o, o. Row 2: columns 0,1,3,4: s, o, o, o. Wait, row 2 is 'soxoo'. So the cells are:\n\ni=2, j=0: s (non-diagonal?), because i=2, j=0: 2+0=2 !=4, and i !=j. So yes, non-diagonal. So in this case, the non-diagonal characters include 's', which is different from 'o's. So the non-diagonal set has 's' and 'o's. So the non-diagonal set will have multiple elements, so the code would return NO. Which matches the first sample output of NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w; (1,1) w; (2,0) w, (2,2) w. So all diagonals are 'w'.\n\nThe non-diagonal cells are:\n\nRow 0: j=1 (s)\n\nRow 1: j=0 (s), j=2 (s)\n\nRow 2: j=1 (s)\n\nSo all non-diagonal are 's'. So diagonal is 'w', non-diagonal is 's'. So the answer is YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input is 3:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So the diagonal cells are x, x, x, x, e. So the diagonal set is {x, e}, which has size 2. So the code returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut in Python, for each i and j, loop through all cells.\n\nSo:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, the non-diagonal is not empty. For example, n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells, total 9, so 4 non-diagonal.\n\nBut for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut in code, for n=3, the code works.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is odd and >=3. So no problem.\n\nSo this code would work.\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, the non-diagonal is 4 cells. So no.\n\nBut let me think for n=3, the code works.\n\nBut let me think about the case where all non-diagonal cells are same, but the diagonal has more than one character.\n\nBut in that case, the code would check len(diagonal_chars) ==1 and so on.\n\nBut what if the diagonal has more than one character?\n\nSo the code would return NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let me test some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=3, all diagonals are same, non-diagonals same and different.\n\nLike:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nSo the diagonals are a, a, a, a, a. So diagonal_chars is {'a'}, non-diagonal is {'b'}, so YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are a and b. So diagonal_chars has size 2, returns NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are all a, non-diagonal are a. Then the code returns NO, since the two sets are same.\n\nSo the code checks that.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as per the first sample input. For example, in the first sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. But in the problem statement, the input is given as first line n, then n lines each with n letters.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings. But in the actual code, the input is read from stdin.\n\nBut the user's code needs to read from standard input.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the first case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nBut in the code, the code reads n, then reads n lines.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut then, for the sample input, the code would read correctly.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings. But in the actual problem, the input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck the diagonals and non-diagonals.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = set()\n\nnon_diagonal = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal) == 1 and len(non_diagonal) == 1 and diagonal != non_diagonal:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, comparing sets. For example, diagonal is a set with one element, and non_diagonal is a set with one element. So if they are different, then it's okay.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the diagonal is {'a'}, non_diagonal is {'a'}? Then the condition is false.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: the first case, the diagonal is {'x'}, non_diagonal includes 's' and 'o's. So non_diagonal has multiple elements. So returns NO.\n\nSample input 2: the code returns YES.\n\nSample input 3: the diagonal has 'x' and 'e' (since in the third case, the last cell (2,2) is 'e'), so the diagonal set has two elements. So returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\ndiagonal is a, a, a, a, a. So diagonal is {'a'}, non_diagonal is {'b'}, so YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) a; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So all diagonals are a. Non-diagonal cells: (0,1) b, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) b. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 and j=2 (a and a). For i=1, j=1 (a). For i=2, j=0 and j=2 (a and a). So the diagonals are all a.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are:\n\ni=0, j=1: b.\n\ni=1, j=0: b.\n\ni=1, j=2: a (since i=1, j=2: i +j = 3, which for n=3 is 3-1=2? Wait n is 3. So i +j == 2?\n\nYes. For n=3, n-1 is 2. So for i=1, j=2: 1+2=3, which is not equal to 2. So no. So (i=1, j=2) is not on the diagonal. So for the grid:\n\nRow 0: a b a\n\nRow 1: b a a\n\nRow 2: a b a\n\nThen the non-diagonal cells are:\n\ni=0, j=1: b.\n\ni=1, j=0: b.\n\ni=1, j=2: a.\n\ni=2, j=1: b.\n\nSo non_diagonal set is {b, a}.\n\nSo len(non_diagonal) is 2. So code returns NO.\n\nSo the code would return NO, which is correct, because the non-diagonal cells have different letters.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen diagonals are all a. non-diagonal cells are all a. So the code returns NO, because the two sets are same.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbab\n\naba\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) b; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal set is {a, b} (since (1,1) is b). So len(diagonal) is 2. So returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, this code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria.
