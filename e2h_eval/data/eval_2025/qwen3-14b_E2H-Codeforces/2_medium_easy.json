Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right. The other diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the elements not on these diagonals must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check all elements on both diagonals. They should all be the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check all elements not on the diagonals. They should all be the same, and different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check for the diagonals?\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid, it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, check if it's on either of these diagonals.\n\nSo, first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the diagonals have different characters. For example, if one diagonal has 'x' and the other has 'y', then it's invalid. So the first step is to check that all elements on both diagonals are the same.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on either diagonal.\n- Collect all the characters from the diagonals. If any of them is different from the first diagonal's character (say, the first element of the main diagonal), then it's invalid.\n- Then collect all the non-diagonal characters. Check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nWait, but what if the diagonals have different characters? Like, suppose the main diagonal has 'x' and the other diagonal has 'y'? Then the first check would fail, because the diagonals are not all same.\n\nSo first, check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Then check the rest.\n\nSo let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, get the grid. For example, for n=5, read n lines each of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j):\n\nIf i == j or i + j == n - 1 → part of the diagonals.\n\nElse → part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal character as the reference. For example, check that all diagonal elements are equal to grid[0][0]. But wait, maybe the first diagonal element is part of the main diagonal, but the other diagonal's elements may differ. Wait, no. Because the first element (0,0) is on both diagonals (since i + j = 0 + 0 = 0, and n-1 is 4 for n=5. So for (0,0), i + j = 0, which is not equal to n-1. Wait, no. For n=5, n-1 is 4. So (0,0) is on the main diagonal (i=j) and (0,4) is on the other diagonal. So the first cell (0,0) is only on the main diagonal. The cell (0,4) is on the other diagonal.\n\nSo, for the diagonals, the main diagonal is i == j. The other diagonal is i + j = n - 1.\n\nSo, for all cells in the grid, check if they are on either of these two diagonals.\n\nSo, for all cells on the diagonals, collect their characters. Let's say that the first character (grid[0][0]) is the reference. Then all other diagonal characters must be equal to this.\n\nBut what if the first cell is not part of the other diagonal? Well, for n >= 3, the two diagonals intersect at the center cell. For example, in n=3, the center cell (1,1) is on both diagonals. So for n odd, the two diagonals cross at the center.\n\nSo, for the first cell (0,0), which is on the main diagonal. The other diagonal's first cell is (0, n-1). So, for the diagonals, all their cells must be same. So, the first cell of the main diagonal (grid[0][0]) and the first cell of the other diagonal (grid[0][n-1]) must be same? Or perhaps not. Because for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the other diagonal is all 'x' as well. Then that's okay. But if the main diagonal is 'x' and the other is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the first step is to check that all cells on both diagonals are same. So, for each cell in the grid, if it is on either of the diagonals, check that it is equal to the first diagonal's character (e.g., grid[0][0]).\n\nWait, but what if the first cell is not on the other diagonal? For example, in n=5, the first cell (0,0) is on the main diagonal. The other diagonal's first cell is (0,4). So, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the other diagonal is all 'x' as well, then that's okay. But if the other diagonal has some other character, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nCheck that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's collect all the diagonal cells. For each cell in the grid, if it's on either diagonal, check that it's equal to the first diagonal cell (grid[0][0]).\n\nWait, but what if the first diagonal cell is not part of the other diagonal? For example, in n=3, the first cell (0,0) is part of the main diagonal. The other diagonal starts at (0,2), then (1,1), then (2,0). So, the first cell (0,0) is not on the other diagonal. So, for the other diagonal, the first cell is (0,2). So, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the other diagonal is all 'x', then that's okay. But if the other diagonal has a different character, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the way to check is:\n\nCollect all the diagonal cells (both diagonals) and check that they are all the same. How?\n\nWe can iterate through all cells. For each cell, if it is on either diagonal, check if it's equal to the first diagonal cell (grid[0][0]). But wait, what if the first diagonal cell is not on the other diagonal? For example, in n=3, the first cell (0,0) is on the main diagonal. The other diagonal's first cell is (0,2). So, when checking the other diagonal's cells, we need to make sure that they are equal to the first diagonal's cell. So, the first diagonal's cell is grid[0][0], and the other diagonal's cells must also be equal to that.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Let d_char be the character of the main diagonal's first cell (grid[0][0]).\n\n- For every cell in the grid, if it is on either of the two diagonals, check that it is equal to d_char.\n\nIf any of those checks fail, return \"NO\".\n\nOnce that is done, check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nFor the non-diagonal cells, collect all of them and check that they are all the same and different from d_char.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if it is not on either diagonal, check that it's equal to some other_char, which is different from d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, since n is odd and at least 3, for example, n=3. The diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the center. So total number of diagonal cells is 2n -1. For n=3, 2*3-1=5. The total cells are 9. So non-diagonal cells are 4. For n=5, 2*5-1=9, total cells 25, non-diagonal is 16.\n\nSo, for the non-diagonal cells, collect all of them and check that they are all same and different from d_char.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think: first, collect all the non-diagonal cells. Let's take the first non-diagonal cell (for example, grid[0][1], assuming n is at least 3). Then check that all non-diagonal cells are equal to that first non-diagonal cell, and that this first non-diagonal cell is different from d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nCheck for diagonals:\n\nCheck that all diagonal cells are same as d_char.\n\nCheck for non-diagonal cells:\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal cells are same as some other_char, and that other_char != d_char.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3, so for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string of length n. Let's store as a grid, a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck if the diagonals are all same.\n\nThen check if the non-diagonal cells are all same and different.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nFirst, get the d_char as grid[0][0].\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n   if grid[i][j] != d_char → return NO.\n\nThen, collect all the non-diagonal cells. Let's check if there are any. For example, if n=3, there are 9 - 5 = 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nIf there are no non-diagonal cells (but n is at least 3, which is not possible?), but for n=3, there are 4 cells. So proceed.\n\nNow, for the non-diagonal cells, check that they are all same and different from d_char.\n\nHow to check this?\n\nTake the first non-diagonal cell (for example, the first cell that is not on either diagonal). Let's find that.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell? For example, for n=3, the first row is [0][0], [0][1], [0][2]. The first cell (0,0) is on the main diagonal. (0,1) is not on any diagonal. So that's the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   for j in range(n):\n\n      if (i == j) or (i + j == n - 1):\n\n          continue\n\n      else:\n\n          first_non_diagonal_char = grid[i][j]\n\n          break\n\nBut once we find the first non-diagonal cell, we can check that all other non-diagonal cells are equal to this first_non_diagonal_char, and that first_non_diagonal_char != d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut in code, we need to check that the non-diagonal cells are all same. So, for example, if there are no non-diagonal cells, then it's impossible, but since n is at least 3, that's not possible.\n\nWait for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 4. So, the code can proceed.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nOnce the diagonals are checked, proceed to check non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, first, find the first non-diagonal cell. Let's loop through the grid until we find one. Once found, then check all other non-diagonal cells against this.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo, code:\n\nfound = False\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\n    if found:\n\n        break\n\nif not found:\n\n    # all cells are on diagonals? Which is possible only if n=1. But since n is at least 3, this can't happen. So, perhaps we can ignore this case.\n\nBut for n=3, the code will find non-diagonal cells.\n\nOnce we have non_diag_char, we need to check that all non-diagonal cells are equal to it, and that it's different from d_char.\n\nSo:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit\n\nAlso, check that non_diag_char != d_char.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid as list of strings.\n\nCheck for diagonals:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit\n\nThen check non-diagonal cells:\n\nfind the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nif there are none (but n >=3, so not possible) → but code can proceed.\n\nOnce found, check all non-diagonal cells are same as non_diag_char and that non_diag_char != d_char.\n\nBut how to handle the case where there are no non-diagonal cells? For example, if n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no need to handle.\n\nBut for code, perhaps in the case where n=1, but the input is invalid. However, the problem says n is at least 3 and odd.\n\nSo, code:\n\nOnce the diagonals are checked, then:\n\nnon_diag_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            break\n\n    if non_diag_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\nif non_diag_char is None:\n\n    # no non-diagonal cells. But for n >=3, this is impossible. So perhaps output 'NO' ?\n\nBut for example, if n=3, the code will find non_diag_char.\n\nOnce non_diag_char is found, check that all non-diagonal cells are equal to it, and that it's different from d_char.\n\nSo:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit\n\nif non_diag_char == d_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Then the code would not check for non_diag_char. But for n >=3, that's impossible.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nBut in Python, how to exit early? For example, using return in a function, but since it's a script, perhaps using sys.exit or breaking with flags.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, check for the diagonals.\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nThen check for non-diagonal.\n\nNow, find non_diag_char.\n\nnon_diag_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            break\n\n    if non_diag_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\nif non_diag_char is None:\n\n    # impossible, but for code safety, perhaps print NO?\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # check all non-diagonal cells are equal to non_diag_char\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n                continue\n\n            else:\n\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n                    exit()\n\n    # check if non_diag_char is different from d_char\n\n    if non_diag_char == d_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nBut in Python, how to exit early? Using sys.exit, but need to import sys. Alternatively, using flags.\n\nBut in code, perhaps using a function.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nBut in code, for example, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\n# Check diagonals\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\n# Now check non-diagonal cells\n\nnon_diag_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            continue\n\n        non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n\n        break\n\n    if non_diag_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\nif non_diag_char is None:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # check all non-diagonal cells are same as non_diag_char\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n                continue\n\n            if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\n    if non_diag_char == d_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but in Python, exit() is not a built-in function. So perhaps using sys.exit().\n\nBut in code, the code above would have to import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nAlternatively, using a flag.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nBut in the code, after checking the diagonals, for each cell, if any of the diagonal cells is not equal to d_char, print NO and exit.\n\nBut in Python, to exit early, perhaps using sys.exit().\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut wait, the first line is n, then next n lines are the grid. So, for example, the first input is the integer n, then n lines follow.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read correctly.\n\nNow, in the code, after checking the diagonals, the code proceeds to check non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut what if the grid is empty? Well, the problem says n is at least 3.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, during the first check for diagonals, for each cell (i,j) in the grid, if it is on the diagonals, check if it's equal to d_char. If not, print NO and exit.\n\nBut how to exit? In Python, perhaps:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nBut in Python, exit() is not available. So, need to use sys.exit().\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\n...\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                sys.exit()\n\nThen, after that, proceed to check non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut then, for the non-diagonal cells, in the same way, during checking, if any cell is not equal to non_diag_char, print NO and exit.\n\nSo, code:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            continue\n\n        if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            sys.exit()\n\nBut how to handle the case where non_diag_char is not found? For example, when n=1. But the problem says n is at least 3, so this can't happen.\n\nBut in code, for example, when n=3, the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1), which exists.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput is 5, then:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nFor each cell on diagonals.\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) is x, (1,1) is x, (2,2) is x, (3,3) is x, (4,4) is x.\n\nOther diagonal: (0,4) is x, (1,3) is x, (2,2) is x, (3,1) is x, (4,0) is x.\n\nSo all diagonals are x. So first check passes.\n\nThen check non-diagonal cells. The first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is o. Then check all non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut in row 2, cell (2,0) is s. Which is not on the diagonals. Because for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2+0=2. For n=5, n-1=4. So 2 !=4. And i !=j (2 !=0). So it's non-diagonal. So the cell (2,0) is s. But non_diag_char is o. So this would trigger the check and print NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the first example outputs NO.\n\nSecond sample input is 3:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w.\n\nOther diagonal: (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w. All are w. So diagonals are okay.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: for example, (0,1) is s. Check all non-diagonal cells. Let's see:\n\nCells not on diagonals are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nThese are all s. So non_diag_char is s. Check that it is different from d_char (w). So output YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e. So the third cell (2,2) is e which is not same as x. So during the first check, the code will detect this and print NO.\n\nSo the sample outputs are correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all non-diagonal cells are same, but same as diagonal. For example:\n\nn=3:\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nIn this case, diagonals are x. Non-diagonal cells are x. So non_diag_char is x, which equals d_char. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are x, non-diagonal are y. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have different letters. For example, n=3:\n\nxox\n\noxo\n\nxox\n\nHere, main diagonal is x, x, x. Other diagonal is x, o, x. So the cell (1,1) is o? Wait no, for n=3, the other diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So in this example, the other diagonal is x, o, x. So the code will check for (i,j) on diagonals. For (1,1), which is on both diagonals. So during the first check, the code checks if all diagonal cells are same as d_char (x). But (1,1) is o, which is different. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are all x, non-diagonal are all x. Then code returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nNeed to import sys.\n\nHandle reading input.\n\nBut in the code, when reading input, perhaps the first line is read with int(input()), then the next n lines.\n\nBut in Python, when using input(), sometimes there can be issues with leading/trailing spaces. But the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n small letters, so the input is correct.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\n# Check diagonals\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                sys.exit()\n\n# Check non-diagonal cells\n\nnon_diag_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            continue\n\n        non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n\n        break\n\n    if non_diag_char is not None:\n\n        break\n\nif non_diag_char is None:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\n# Check all non-diagonal cells are same as non_diag_char\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            continue\n\n        if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            sys.exit()\n\nif non_diag_char == d_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, in the code, when checking for non-diagonal cells, the first non-diagonal cell is taken. What if there are multiple non-diagonal cells, but the first one is not the same as others?\n\nFor example, in the first example, the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is o. But in row 2, cell (2,0) is s. So during the check, the code would find that cell and print NO.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, the code loops through all i and j, and for each cell, if it's not on the diagonals, check if it's equal to non_diag_char.\n\nBut how does the code find the first non-diagonal cell?\n\nIn the code, for i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n       if not on diagonals:\n\n           non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n\n           break\n\n   if found, break.\n\nSo, for the first i and j that is not on diagonals, it takes that as non_diag_char.\n\nBut for example, in the first example, the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is o. Then the code checks all non-diagonal cells. When it reaches (2,0) which is s, which is not equal to o, so code prints NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input, which is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: 'wsw'\n\nRow 1: 'sws'\n\nRow 2: 'wsw'\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ni==j: (0,0) w, (1,1) w, (2,2) w.\n\ni + j == 2 (n-1=2 for n=3):\n\n(0,2) w, (1,1) w, (2,0) w.\n\nAll are w. So pass.\n\nThen, non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). All are s.\n\nSo non_diag_char is s. Check that all non-diagonal cells are s, and s != w. So output YES.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: input is 3, and grid is:\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nThen, diagonals are x. non-diagonal cells are x. So non_diag_char is x, same as d_char. So output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nBut what about when the non-diagonal cells are empty? For example, n=1. But the problem says n is at least 3. So code is safe.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: a (0,0), a (1,1), a (2,2). Other diagonal: a (0,2), a (1,1), a (2,0). So all diagonals are a. Then non-diagonal cells:\n\ncells (0,1) is b, (1,0) is b, (1,2) is a, (2,1) is b.\n\nSo during the check for non-diagonal cells, the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is b. Then check all others. (1,0) is b, (1,2) is a. So during the check, when i=1, j=2, which is not on diagonals. grid[1][2] is a, which is not equal to b. So code prints NO.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific criteria. The grid forms an 'X' if both diagonals contain the same character and all other cells contain a different uniform character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that all cells on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same character.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Ensure all cells not on the diagonals are the same character and different from the character on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\n# Check diagonals\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                sys.exit()\n\nnon_diag_char = None\n# Find the first non-diagonal character\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n        break\n    if non_diag_char is not None:\n        break\n\nif non_diag_char is None:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    sys.exit()\n\n# Check all non-diagonal characters\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            sys.exit()\n\nif non_diag_char == d_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using standard input functions. The first line gives the size of the grid `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals, it must match the character at the top-left corner of the grid (`d_char`). If any mismatch is found, the program immediately prints \"NO\" and exits.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: We find the first character that is not on either diagonal. This character (`non_diag_char`) is then checked against all other non-diagonal characters. If any mismatch is found, the program prints \"NO\" and exits.\n4. **Final Check**: After ensuring all non-diagonal characters are consistent, we check if they are different from the diagonal characters. If they are, we print \"YES\"; otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions with a time complexity of O(n²), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
