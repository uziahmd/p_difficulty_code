You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number a with digits from a sequence s to make the maximum possible number. The constraints are that each element in s can be used at most once, and I can choose to use any subset of them. The goal is to maximize the number after replacements.\n\nHmm, the approach here should be to replace the digits in a with the largest possible digits from s, but in the optimal positions. Let me think about how to do that.\n\nFirst, the key idea is to replace the leftmost possible digits with the largest possible digits from s. Because the leftmost digits have higher weight. For example, if I can replace a digit in the hundreds place with a 9, that's better than replacing a digit in the ones place.\n\nBut wait, the digits in s can be used in any order. So maybe I should sort the s digits in descending order. Then, for each position in a, starting from the left, if the current digit can be replaced with a larger digit from s, I do that. But I need to use the largest possible digits first.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. Sort the s digits in descending order. So that we can take the largest available digits first.\n2. Iterate through each digit of a from left to right.\n3. For each digit in a, check if there's a digit in the sorted s that is larger than the current digit. If so, replace it with the largest possible available digit from s, and remove that digit from s (so it's not reused).\n4. Continue until all digits in s are used or all digits in a are processed.\n\nWait, but the digits in s can be used once each. So, for example, if s is [9,8,7], then we can use each once. So the sorted s is [9,8,7]. Then for each position in a, we check if the current digit can be replaced with the largest possible available digit.\n\nSo, for example, let's take the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\na is '1024', s is '010' → sorted s is ['1', '0', '0']? Wait, no. Wait the s is given as a string, like '010' which is digits 0,1,0. When sorted in descending order, it would be 1,0,0. So the sorted list is ['1','0','0'].\n\nNow, process a's digits from left to right.\n\nOriginal a: 1 0 2 4.\n\nCheck first digit (1). The largest available in s is 1. Since it's equal, we don't replace. Then move to next digit.\n\nSecond digit is 0. The largest available is 1. So replace it with 1. Now s has [0,0] left. So now the number becomes 1124. Then the remaining digits in s are 0 and 0, but the next digits in a are 2 and 4. Since 0 is smaller than 2 and 4, no replacement. So the final number is 1124. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is '987' and s is '1234567'. So sorted s is 7,6,5,4,3,2,1. Now, the original a is 9 8 7. Let's see:\n\nFirst digit is 9. The largest in s is 7, which is less than 9. So no replacement. Next digit is 8. Largest in s is 7, which is less than 8. No replacement. Next digit is 7. The largest in s is 7. So replace it with 7? Well, but since it's equal, maybe we can replace it. But since the original digit is same as the replacement, perhaps it's better not to replace. Because if we replace, we can use that s digit. But since the digits are same, it's better to not replace. Because maybe later digits could be replaced with higher digits. Wait, but in this case, the s digits are 7,6,5... So the first digit is 9, which is higher than 7, so no replacement. Then 8 is higher than 6. Then 7 is same as 7. So if we replace the 7 with 7, but that doesn't help. However, perhaps the problem allows us to use any subset of s. So in this case, the best is to not use any of the s digits. So the output is 987. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the s digits in descending order.\n\nThen, for each digit in a, from left to right:\n\nIf the current digit is less than the next available",
