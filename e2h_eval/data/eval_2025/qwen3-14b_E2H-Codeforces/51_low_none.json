Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is to take the first two strings (guest and host), concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in the concatenated string matches exactly with the count in the third string (the pile).\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to use the Counter class from collections. For example, for the guest and host names, combine them into one string, create a Counter for that. Then create a Counter for the pile. Then compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each character. So if the counts are the same, then it's possible to rearrange the letters.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input.\n2. Combine the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Create a Counter for this combined string.\n4. Create a Counter for the third line (the pile).\n5. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length of guest and host is different from the pile's length? For example, if guest + host is length 5 and pile is length 6. Then obviously, the answer is NO. But checking the Counter would automatically take care of that, since if the counts are different, the Counter would differ.\n\nBut maybe checking the lengths first could be an early exit. Like, if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile), then immediately return NO. Otherwise proceed to check the counts.\n\nBut in Python, the Counter comparison would handle that automatically. For example, if the pile has more letters, then the Counter would have more counts for some characters. So comparing the Counters would catch that.\n\nBut perhaps checking the lengths first is more efficient. Because if the lengths are different, there's no need to process further.\n\nSo, let's think about that. Let me code:\n\nRead the three lines: guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile): output NO.\n\nelse: check if the Counter(combined) equals Counter(pile). If yes, output YES else NO.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because even if the lengths are the same, but the counts of characters differ, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead the three lines.\n\nCheck if the combined length of guest and host equals the length of the pile. If not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if the combined string and the pile have the same character counts.\n\nBut how to implement that in Python?\n\nUsing collections.Counter.\n\nSo code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nThen:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where the combined string has a certain count, but the pile has the same counts? For example, if the combined is \"AAB\" and pile is \"ABA\", then Counter would be same. So this approach works.\n\nBut in the sample input given, let's check.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count letters. Let's see:\n\nBut the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check the length.\n\nBut perhaps the code would handle that.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case outputs YES. So the code would compare the Counter of combined and pile, which would be same.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's see the length. Let's count:\n\nPAPAINOEL is 9 letters. JOULUPUKKI is 10 letters. Combined is 19 letters. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters here. Let me see:\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's count letters. Let me see:\n\nBut perhaps the code would find that the counts are different. For example, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the characters in the pile exactly match the characters in the combined names of the guest and host, considering both the count and the total length of the characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths**: If the combined length of the guest and host names does not match the length of the pile, immediately return \"NO\".\n4. **Character Count Comparison**: Use a character counter to compare the frequency of each character in the combined names with the frequency in the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, and each line is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to facilitate character count comparison.\n- **Length Check**: A quick check ensures that the lengths of the combined string and the pile are equal. If not, it's impossible for the pile to be rearranged to form the combined names, so we immediately return \"NO\".\n- **Counter Comparison**: Using `collections.Counter`, we compare the frequency of each character in the combined string with that in the pile. If the counters match, the characters can be rearranged to form the combined names, hence \"YES\" is printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the length and character distribution, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
