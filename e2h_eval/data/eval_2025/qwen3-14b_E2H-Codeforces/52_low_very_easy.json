Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take 'b' of them to make a new one. And this new one can be used again, and so on. The goal is to find the total hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned candles are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 burned ones are converted into 2/2=1 new. He uses that, adding 1 hour. Now, that one is burned, but he can't make any more since 1 < 2. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Oh right, that's how it works.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStart with 'a' candles. Each time you burn a candle, you add 1 hour. Then, after burning, you have some number of burned candles. Then, whenever you have enough (>=b), you can make new ones. But each time you make a new candle, you subtract 'b' burned ones and add 1 new candle. But this new candle will be burned again, adding to the hours, and then become another burned one.\n\nSo maybe the way to model this is:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburned_candles = 0\n\nBut wait, perhaps not. Because each time you use a candle, it's burned and becomes part of the burned pile.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\nEach time you light a candle, it's burned for an hour, then added to the burned pile. Then, whenever you have enough burned candles, you can make new ones.\n\nBut how to model the process of converting burned candles into new ones. Let me think of it as:\n\nWe have a variable 'total_hours' which counts the hours. Initially, we have 'a' candles. So total_hours starts at a. But then, after burning all those, we have 'a' burned candles.\n\nThen, we can make new candles by taking 'b' burned ones. For each new candle made, we subtract 'b' from the burned count and add 1 to the current candles. Then, those new candles are burned again, adding to the total_hours, and so on.\n\nWait, but maybe the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburned = 0\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think that each time you burn a candle, you add to the total hours, and then add to the burned pile. Then, whenever you can make new candles from the burned pile, you do so, which adds new candles to the current stock. But how to loop through this?\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nThe total hours is initially 'a', and then we can collect the burned candles. Then, each time we can make new candles, we add the number of new ones to the total hours, and then collect the burned ones again.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of the example:\n\nOriginal a=4, b=2.\n\nTotal hours starts as 4. Then, we have 4 burned candles. We can make 4//2=2 new candles. So, we add 2 to total hours (now 6). Then, those 2 are burned, adding 2 to the burned pile. Now, 2//2=1, so add 1 to total (7). Then, that 1 is burned, but can't be converted. So total is 7.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburned = a\n\nthen while burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles \n\nSo this seems like the correct approach. Because each time, you take the burned candles, make as many new ones as possible, add them to the total hours, and then the remaining burned candles are the remainder (burned % b) plus the new ones that were just made (since after burning them, they become part of the burned pile again).\n\nYes! So this seems like the right way to model it.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours = 4\n\nburned =4\n\nloop:\n\nburned >=2:",
    "response": "```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_hours = a\nburned = a\nwhile burned >= b:\n    new_candles = burned // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles\nprint(total_hours)\n```",
