Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is illuminated. The street is a straight line from 0 to l. Each lantern can light up points within distance d. So I need to find the smallest d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. First, the lanterns are placed at various positions. The key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would require the largest d to cover it.\n\nWait, but also, we need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine d. Similarly for the end of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. But since the lantern's light covers up to d, then the leftmost part (from 0 to a1 - d) must be covered. Wait no, the lantern's light covers from a_i -d to a_i +d. So for the start of the street, if the first lantern is at a1, then the left end (0) must be within a1's coverage. So 0 must be >= a1 -d. Which implies that d >= a1 - 0. Similarly for the end. So the initial and final parts are important.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in ascending order.\n2. Check the distance from the first lantern to 0. That's a possible candidate for d.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to l. Another candidate.\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns would determine the required d. Because for a gap between two lanterns, say between a and b (sorted), the worst case is the middle point between them. The distance from a to the middle is (b - a)/2. So the required d for that gap is (b - a)/2. Because the lanterns' coverage must reach from a to b. So the maximum of these (b -a)/2 values would be the required d.\n\nSo the overall minimum d is the maximum between the first part (distance from 0 to first lantern), the last part (distance from last lantern to l), and the maximum (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Then the maximum between the first and last parts. For example, if n=1 and l=5, and the lantern is at position 0. Then the distance from 0 to l is 5, so d needs to be 5. Because the lantern can cover from 0 to 5 (since d=5). So yes, that's covered by checking the first and last parts.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance: first lantern's position minus 0. So that's a[0] - 0. But wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then that distance is zero. So the initial candidate is a[0] - 0. But wait, no. Wait, the initial part is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. Because the lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the distance between 0 and the first lantern is a[0]. So the d must be at least a[0], because the lantern's coverage has to reach from a[0] -d to a[0] +d. So for 0 to be covered, a[0] -d <= 0 => d >= a[0]. Wait no, wait. If the lantern is at a[0], then the leftmost point it can cover is a[0] -d. For that to reach 0, a[0] -d <= 0 → d ≥ a[0]. So yes, the initial distance is a[0], but that's the value of d needed. Similarly, for the end, the last lantern is at a[-1], and the distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. So d must be at least that.\n\nThen, between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap is between two consecutive lanterns. For example, if two lanterns are at positions x and y (x < y), then the maximum distance between them is y -x. The middle point is (x + y)/2. The distance from x to that point is (y -x)/2. So the required d for that gap is (y -x)/2. Because the lanterns",
