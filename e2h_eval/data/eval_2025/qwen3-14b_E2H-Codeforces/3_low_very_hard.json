Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required radius based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the radius needs to cover that gap. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have two adjacent lanterns. Let's say they are at positions x and y, where x < y. The area between them that isn't covered by either lantern would be the middle part. Wait, no. Each lantern covers up to d distance. So for the two lanterns, the coverage would be from x-d to x+d and y-d to y+d. But since they are adjacent, the distance between them is y - x. To ensure that there's no gap between their coverage, the distance between them must be such that the coverage of the first reaches up to the coverage of the second. So the maximum distance between two consecutive lanterns is (y - x). The required d for this pair would be (y - x)/2. Because if the distance between them is s, then each needs to cover half of that distance. For example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then each needs to cover 2 units so that their coverage areas meet in the middle. \n\nBut wait, that's only if the lanterns are placed in a way that their coverage overlaps. However, if the lanterns are placed with a larger gap, then the required d would be (gap)/2. But what about the ends of the street? For example, if the first lantern is not at position 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would require a d that covers that. Similarly for the end of the street. \n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in ascending order.\n2. Check the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The required d here is (a[0] - 0), but since the lantern's coverage can reach back d units, so if the first lantern is at position a[0], then the leftmost point covered is a[0] - d. To cover 0, we need a[0] - d <= 0 → d >= a[0]. Wait no. Wait, the lantern's coverage is from a_i -d to a_i +d. So for the first lantern, the left end of the street (0) must be within the coverage of the first lantern. So 0 must be >= a[0] -d. Which implies that d >= a[0] - 0. Wait, no. Let me rephrase: the lantern at a[0] can cover from a[0] -d to a[0]+d. But the street starts at 0. So the leftmost part of the street that is not covered by the first lantern is 0 to a[0]-d. To make sure that this is covered, we need that a[0] -d <= 0. Which implies that d >= a[0] - 0. Wait, solving a[0] -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a[0]. Wait that can't be right. Wait, suppose the first lantern is at position 5. Then to cover 0, the lantern's coverage must reach 0. So 5 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ 5. So the radius must be at least 5. But that would mean that the first lantern's coverage extends from 0 to 5 +d. But that seems like a lot. But if the first lantern is at 5, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 5. So the radius has to be at least 5 to cover 0. \n\nSimilarly, for the last lantern. Suppose the last lantern is at position a[-1], and the street ends at l. Then the distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. So the radius must be at least that. \n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions.\n- Compute the maximum of:\n   a) the first lantern's position (since 0 to a[0] needs coverage)\n   b) the distance between consecutive lanterns divided by 2 (because the gap between them needs to be covered by each lantern's coverage overlapping)\n   c) the distance from the last lantern to l.\n\nWait, but for the first lantern, the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. So the required d for that part is a[0], because the lantern's coverage has to reach back to 0",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the minimum radius `d` required for lanterns to fully illuminate a street, we need to consider three key factors:\n\n1. **Coverage at the start of the street**: The distance from the beginning of the street (position 0) to the first lantern.\n2. **Coverage between consecutive lanterns**: The largest gap between two adjacent lanterns determines the radius needed to cover the space in between.\n3. **Coverage at the end of the street**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`).\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Sort the positions of the lanterns** to facilitate checking gaps between them.\n2. **Calculate the initial and final coverage gaps**:\n   - The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern.\n   - The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n3. **Find the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns**, then divide that by 2 (since each lantern can cover half of the gap on either side).\n4. **Take the maximum value** among the initial gap, the final gap, and the maximum middle gap.
