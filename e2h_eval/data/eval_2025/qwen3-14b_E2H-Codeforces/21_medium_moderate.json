The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Neko wants to open as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to maximize the number of chests opened. Let me think about the parity here. Because the sum is odd, that means one of them is even and the other is odd. So for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, it needs a key with even b_j.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many even and odd chests there are, and then matching them with the available keys of opposite parity.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nLet's count the number of even and odd chests. Let's say even_chest = number of a_i even, odd_chest = number of a_i odd.\n\nSimilarly, count the number of even and odd keys. Let even_key = number of b_j even, odd_key = number of b_j odd.\n\nNow, for each even chest, we need an odd key. For each odd chest, we need an even key.\n\nBut the problem is that the number of available keys of the required parity might be less than the number of chests needing them. So the maximum possible for each case is the minimum between the count of chests and the count of keys of the required parity.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nFor example, even_chest needs odd keys. So the number of such chests that can be opened is min(even_chest, odd_key). Similarly, the odd_chest can be opened with even keys, so min(odd_chest, even_key). Then the total is the sum of these two.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me check with the examples.\n\nTake the first example input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's see their parities:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So odd_chest is 2 (9 and 11), even_chest is 3 (14,6,2).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parities. 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7).\n\nSo for even_chest (3) needing odd keys (1). So min(3,1) is 1. For odd_chest (2) needing even keys (3). min(2,3) is 2. Total is 1+2=3. Which matches the sample output. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: second input is 5 1. Chests are 2,4,6,8,10 (all even). Keys is 5 (odd). So even_chest is 5, odd_key is 1. So min(5,1) is 1. The other part is odd_chest (0) and even_key (0). So total is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chest needs odd keys, but there are zero. So min(1,0) is 0. The other part is odd_chest (0) needing even keys. So total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Count the number of even and odd chests.\n\n- Count the number of even and odd keys.\n\n- The answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nBut wait, why can't there be some overlapping? Like, maybe some keys can be used for different chests. But since each key can be used once, and each chest once, the maximum is indeed the sum of those two minima.\n\nYes, because for each even chest, you need an odd key. The number of available odd keys is odd_key. So the maximum number of even chests that can be opened is the minimum between even_chest and odd_key. Similarly for the other case.\n\nSo the solution is to compute those four counts and then compute the sum.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nRead the list of b_j.\n\nCount even_chest and odd_chest.\n\nCount even_key and odd_key.\n\nCompute the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nReturn that.\n\nBut wait, let me think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if there are more keys than needed? Like, if even_chest is 3 and odd_key is 5. Then min(3,5) is 3. So all 3 even chests can be opened. The rest of the keys (odd_key - 3) are not used. But that's okay.\n\nAnother case: if even_chest is 0, then that part contributes 0. Same for others.\n\nSo yes, this approach should work.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, we can process the lists as follows.\n\nFor the a list:\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_chest = n - even_chest.\n\nSimilarly for the b list:\n\neven_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_key = m - even_key.\n\nThen answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na: [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_chest: 3 (14,6,2)\n\nodd_chest: 2 (9,11)\n\nb: [8,4,7,20]\n\neven_key: 3 (8,4,20)\n\nodd_key: 1 (7)\n\nso min(3,1) is 1, min(2,3) is 2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na: [2,4,6,8,10] → even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\n\nb: [5] → even_key=0, odd_key=1.\n\nso min(5,1) is 1. min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Correct.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na: [10] → even_chest=1, odd_chest=0.\n\nb: [20,30,40,50] → even_key=4, odd_key=0.\n\nso min(1,0) is 0. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if there are multiple possibilities.\n\nLike, even_chest is 2, odd_key is 3. So min(2,3) is 2. Then odd_chest is 3, even_key is 2. So min(3,2) is 2. Total 4. Which would be the maximum possible.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead input from stdin.\n\nBut the input is given as multiple lines. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', which represents the first test case. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains n and m.\n\nThe second line has n integers.\n\nThe third line has m integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the user provided three examples. But the actual input for the problem is a single test case. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is given as per the first line, etc. But looking at the sample input, the first line is:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nBut that's probably the way the user presented the examples. However, in the actual problem, the input is a single test case. So the code should read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem would be a single test case.\n\nWait, the original problem's input is:\n\nThe first line contains n and m.\n\nSecond line has n numbers.\n\nThird line has m numbers.\n\nSo the code should read three lines: first line is n and m, second line is a list of n numbers, third line is a list of m numbers.\n\nBut in the sample input given by the user, there are three test cases. But that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple examples. But the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem would be three lines. So, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nRead the second line as a list of integers.\n\nRead the third line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute the answer as per the above logic.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n, m from input.\n\nThen read a list of n integers.\n\nThen read a list of m integers.\n\nThen compute even_chest, odd_chest, even_key, odd_key.\n\nThen compute the answer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\nb = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, that's it. That should handle all cases.\n\nLet me check the sample input.\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na is [9,14,6,2,11]. even_chest is 3.\n\nodd_chest is 2.\n\nb is [8,4,7,20]. even_key is 3, odd_key is 1.\n\nans is min(3,1) + min(2,3) → 1 + 2 = 3. Correct.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na is [2,4,6,8,10]. even_chest is 5. odd_chest 0.\n\nb is [5]. even_key is 0, odd_key is 1.\n\nans is min(5,1) + min(0,0) → 1 + 0 = 1. Correct.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na is [10]. even_chest=1, odd_chest=0.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50]. even_key=4, odd_key=0.\n\nans is min(1,0) + min(0,4) → 0 + 0 = 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when there are more keys than needed.\n\nLike, n=2, m=3.\n\na = [1,3]. So even_chest is 0, odd_chest is 2.\n\nb = [2,4,6]. even_key is 3, odd_key is 0.\n\nSo ans is min(0,0) + min(2,3) → 0 + 2 = 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, m=3.\n\na = [1,2,3]. even_chest is 1 (2), odd_chest is 2 (1,3).\n\nb = [1,2,3]. even_key is 1 (2), odd_key is 2 (1,3).\n\nSo min(1, 2) → 1. min(2,1) → 1. Total 2.\n\nWhich is correct: 1 even chest can be matched with 1 odd key (say, 2 and 1). Then 2 odd chests can be matched with 1 even key (say, 3 and 2). But since there's only 1 even key, only one of the odd chests can be opened. So total 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nYes, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that for reading input, sometimes there may be leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nSo the code should be as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys, where each key can only be used once and each chest can only be opened once. The condition for opening a chest is that the sum of the chest's number and the key's number must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Parity Requirement**: A sum of two numbers is odd if one number is even and the other is odd. Therefore, an even-numbered chest requires an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest requires an even-numbered key.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We count the number of even and odd chests and keys separately.\n3. **Matching Chests and Keys**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. For each category, the number of matches is limited by the smaller count of available chests and keys of the required parities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We count how many chests and keys are even or odd.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Matches**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by taking the minimum of the count of even chests and odd keys, plus the minimum of the count of odd chests and even keys. This ensures that we use the available keys and chests optimally based on their parity.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution in linear time relative to the number of chests and keys, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the given constraints.",
