Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need to find the minimal number of such cards required.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. The goal is to have the total sum be zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to: what's the minimum number of cards needed to sum up to T, where each card's value is between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers in that range, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think about this. For example, if T is 0, then no cards are needed. But if T is non-zero, we need to find the minimal number of cards that can add up to T.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the maximum possible contribution per card. Each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, for the target T, the minimal number of cards would be determined by how much we can cover with each card.\n\nLet me consider the absolute value of T. Let's say |T| is the total amount we need to cover. Each card can contribute up to x towards that. So the minimal number of cards would be ceiling(|T| / x), but wait, maybe there's a catch here.\n\nWait, for example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to 2. So 5 / 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2+2+1=5. But wait, but each card can be any value between -x and x. So for example, if T is 5, then the maximum possible per card is 2. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(5 / 2) = 3. Similarly, if T is 4, then 2 cards (2+2).\n\nBut what if T is something like 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, so ceil is 2. Which would be 2 + 1 (but 1 is allowed as a card value). So yes, two cards.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards needed is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, maybe there's a case where even after that, you can't reach exactly T? Or is it always possible?\n\nWait, for example, T is 3, x is 2. The minimal number is 2. Because 2 + 1 = 3. But if x is 2, then 1 is allowed. So yes. So in general, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, perhaps not. Let's think of another example. Suppose T is 1, x is 2. Then we can use one card of 1, so the minimal is 1. Which is 1 / 2 = 0.5, ceil is 1. So that works. Another example: T is 4, x is 2. Then 4/2 is 2, which is exactly 2 cards. So yes.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 5 and x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666..., so ceil is 2. Let's see: 3 + 2 = 5. So two cards. Yes. So that works.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nCalculate the sum S of the found cards. Then T = -S. If T is zero, answer is 0. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x ). Wait, but why can't there be cases where you need more cards? For example, suppose T is 2 and x is 1. Then |T| / x is 2, so 2 cards. Which would be 1 + 1. Correct. So yes.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 1 and x is 1. Then you need 1 card. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nBut let's check the examples given.\n\nFirst example input: 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. The sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. Divided by x=2 gives 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: input is 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. T is 4. |T| is 4. x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what about when T is zero? For example, if the sum of found cards is zero, then answer is zero. So that's handled.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards.\n\n2. Compute T = -sum.\n\n3. If T is zero, return 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x )\n\nBut wait, how to compute ceil( |T| / x ) in Python?\n\nIn Python, we can compute it as (abs(T) + x - 1) // x.\n\nBecause for example, 5 / 2 is 2.5, so (5 + 2 -1 ) // 2 = 6//2=3. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So that's the formula.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_s = sum of the list.\n\nt = -sum_s\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    compute (abs(t) + x -1 ) // x\n\nBut wait, let's test some cases.\n\nAnother example: sum is 3, x is 2. So t is -3. abs(t) is 3. (3 + 2-1 )//2 = 4//2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: sum is 0. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 5. Then t is -5. abs(t) is 5. (5 +5-1)/5 = 9//5=1. Which is correct (one card of 5).\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 3. Then t is -5. abs(t) is 5. (5 +3-1)/3 =7//3=2. Which is correct (3+2=5, two cards).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this formula seems to work.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, let's check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2, numbers are -1, 1, 2. sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. t is -2. So abs(t) is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=2, x=3, numbers are -2, -2. sum is -4. t is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if sum is 0, output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 1, x is 1. So t is -1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 4, x=3. t is -4. (4+3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Which is 3 + 1 (but 1 is allowed). So two cards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read list of integers.\n\nsum_s = sum of list.\n\nt = -sum_s.\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(t) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nBut wait, what if x is zero? No, the input constraints say x is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nBut let's check the problem statement again. The problem says that the numbers on the cards can be from -x to x. So the maximum absolute value is x. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let's code that.\n\nNow, the code needs to read from stdin. Let's see.\n\nThe input is given as two lines. First line has n and x. Second line has n integers.\n\nSo in Python, we can read it as:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_s = sum(arr)\n\nt = -sum_s\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(t) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nWait, but in the first example, the input is '3 2\\n-1 1 2', which would be parsed as n=3, x=2. The sum is -1 +1 +2 = 2. So t is -2. So abs(t) is 2. (2 + 2 -1 ) // 2 = 3//2 = 1. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: input is '2 3\\n-2 -2' → sum is -4. t is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 → 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat if sum is zero? For example, input is '1 5\\n0' → sum is 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: input is '1 1\\n1' → sum is 1. t is -1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: input is '1 1\\n-1' → sum is -1. t is 1. (1 +1-1)//1 =1 → correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x=2. So t is -3. (3 +2-1)/2 =4/2=2. Which is correct (2+1=3).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo that's the solution.\n",

Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the total to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the maximum possible contribution per card. This formula is based on the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value on a card (x), which can be efficiently computed using integer arithmetic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_s = sum(arr)\nt = -sum_s\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print((abs(t) + x - 1) // x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines.
