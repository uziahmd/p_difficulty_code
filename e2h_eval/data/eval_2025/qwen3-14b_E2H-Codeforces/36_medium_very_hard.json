The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nSo, there are n+2 towns on a coordinate line, numbered 0 to n+1. Each town from 1 to n has a radio tower built with probability 1/2, independently. Then, we need to assign signal powers to each tower such that:\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n- Each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal from exactly one tower.\n\nThe task is to compute the probability that such an assignment exists, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So the problem reduces to finding the number of valid tower configurations (i.e., subsets of towns 1..n where towers are built) that allow for such a signal setup, multiplied by (1/2)^n (since each tower is built with 1/2 chance), then output that probability as a fraction modulo 998244353.\n\nSo the key is to find the number of valid subsets S of {1..n} such that there's a way to assign signal powers to each tower in S satisfying the constraints.\n\nLet me think about what conditions the subset S must satisfy.\n\nFirst, for the signal setup to be possible, each town in 1..n must be covered exactly once. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered.\n\nLet me think about the coverage. For a tower at position i with power p, it covers cities from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. Wait, because |c - i| < p implies that c is between i - p + 1 and i + p - 1 (since if p is integer, then for example, when p=1, the range is i-0 to i+0, which is just i. So for p=2, the range is i-1 to i+1.)\n\nBut the problem says that each city from 1 to n must be covered exactly once. So the way the towers are placed must form a partition of the cities 1..n into intervals, each of which is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nWait, but how can that happen? For example, if a tower is placed at position i, then its coverage area must be such that it covers some interval of cities, and these intervals don't overlap, and together cover all cities from 1 to n.\n\nBut also, the coverage of each tower must not reach 0 or n+1. So for a tower at position i, the maximum possible power is such that i - p >= 1 (so that town 0 isn't covered) and i + p <= n+1 (so that town n+1 isn't covered). Wait, no: the coverage is |c - i| < p. So for town 0 to not be covered by a tower at i, we need that |0 - i| >= p. Similarly for town n+1.\n\nSo for town 0 to not be covered by tower i: i >= p. But since p is at least 1, the minimal p for tower i is 1, so i must be >= 1. Which it is. Wait, but if p is larger than i, then |0 - i| = i < p would imply that town 0 is covered. So for the tower at position i, the maximum allowed p is such that i >= p (so that town 0 isn't covered), and similarly, (n+1 - i) >= p (so that town n+1 isn't covered). So the maximum p for a tower at i is min(i, n+1 - i). However, when setting the p, you can choose any integer from 1 to that maximum.\n\nBut how does this relate to the problem? Well, the problem requires that after choosing the subset S (the towers built), there exists a way to assign p_i's such that the coverage conditions are met.\n\nLet me think of the structure of the subset S. For the coverage to be possible, each tower must cover a certain range of cities, and these ranges must be non-overlapping and cover all 1..n.\n\nThis seems similar to tiling the interval [1..n] with intervals, each of which is centered at some tower position, and the intervals do not overlap except possibly at endpoints (but since each city must be covered exactly once, overlapping is not allowed).\n\nWait, but the coverage of a tower with power p is from i-p+1 to i+p-1. For example, if a tower is at position i with p=1, it covers only i. If p=2, it covers i-1, i, i+1. So for the coverage to not overlap, the ranges must be adjacent or non-overlapping.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach: For the coverage to be possible, the set S must form a partition of the cities into intervals where each interval is covered by exactly one tower, and the tower is placed in the middle of the interval. Wait, maybe not exactly the middle, but the tower's position must be such that the interval is covered by that tower.\n\nFor example, suppose a tower is placed at position i. Then, the interval it can cover is [a, b], where a = i - p + 1 and b = i + p - 1. The length of the interval is 2p -1. But since the tower is at position i, which is in the middle of this interval.\n\nBut for the coverage to be exactly the interval [a, b], and no overlapping with others, perhaps the arrangement must be such that each tower is responsible for a segment of cities, and the segments are adjacent.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of domino tiling or some kind of dynamic programming problem.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each tower must cover exactly some interval [a, b], and that the union of all such intervals is [1, n], and they are pairwise disjoint.\n\nBut how can we model the valid subsets S?\n\nAnother thought: For each tower, the coverage must be such that the tower is the only one covering any city in its interval. Therefore, the arrangement must be such that between any two towers, their coverage areas don't overlap, and the entire [1..n] is covered.\n\nLet me think of the possible valid configurations. For example, in the first sample input where n=2, the valid configuration is when both towers 1 and 2 are built. Then, each can have power 1. That way, 1 covers only 1, and 2 covers only 2. Town 0 is not covered (since for tower 1, p=1, so |0 - 1| =1 is not less than p=1. Similarly for tower 2. So that works.\n\nAnother valid configuration would be if only tower 2 is built. Then, it can have power 2, which covers 1, 2, and 3. Wait, but town 3 is n+1 when n=2. Wait n=2, so n+1 is 3. So the tower at position 2 with p=2 would cover towns 0 (since |0-2|=2 which is not less than p=2, so no. Wait, the condition is |c - i| < p. For p=2, the coverage is c where |c - i| < 2. So for i=2, c can be 0, 1, 2, 3? No. Because |0-2| = 2 is not less than 2. So the coverage is c where c is in (i - p, i + p). Wait, the absolute difference is less than p. So for p=2, the coverage is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1? Or from i-p+1 to i+p-1?\n\nWait, |c - i| < p means that c is in (i - p, i + p). Since c must be integer, the range is i-p+1 to i + p -1. Because for example, if p=2, then the values of c where |c - i| < 2 are i-1, i, i+1. So the range is from i-1 to i+1, which is (i-p+1) to (i + p -1) when p=2. Yes.\n\nSo for a tower at i with power p, the coverage is [i - p + 1, i + p - 1].\n\nNow, for town 0 to not be covered by any tower, we must have that for every tower i, i - p + 1 > 0. Which implies that i - p + 1 â‰¥ 1 â†’ i - p â‰¥ 0 â†’ p â‰¤ i. Similarly, for town n+1 to not be covered, we must have i + p -1 < n+1 â†’ i + p â‰¤ n + 1 â†’ p â‰¤ n + 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, for each tower i, the maximum possible p is min(i, n + 1 - i).\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the valid subsets S. For the coverage to be possible, the towers must be arranged such that each tower's coverage is a segment that doesn't overlap with others, and covers exactly the cities from 1 to n.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of arranging intervals where each interval is centered at some tower and they are non-overlapping and cover the entire [1..n].\n\nAnother observation: For the coverage to be possible, each tower must be responsible for a certain interval of cities. Let's imagine that the cities are partitioned into intervals [a_1, b_1], [a_2, b_2], ..., [a_k, b_k], such that each interval is covered by exactly one tower located at the center of the interval. But how can we define the center?\n\nFor example, if an interval [a, b] is covered by a tower at position i, then i must be such that the tower's coverage includes the entire [a, b]. So the tower's power must be at least (b - a + 1 + 1)/2, perhaps? Or maybe the tower's position is the midpoint of the interval.\n\nWait, for the tower to cover the entire interval [a, b], the power p must be such that i - p + 1 â‰¤ a and i + p -1 â‰¥ b. Solving for p:\n\ni - p + 1 â‰¤ a â†’ p â‰¥ i - a + 1\n\ni + p -1 â‰¥ b â†’ p â‰¥ b - i + 1\n\nSo p must be at least max( i -a +1, b -i +1 )\n\nBut since the tower's coverage is [i - p +1, i + p -1], which must include [a, b], the minimal p required is the ceiling of (b - a + 1)/2. Wait, for example, if the interval has length m, then the minimal p needed is ceil(m / 2). Because for example, if the interval is length 3 (positions 1,2,3), then placing the tower at 2 with p=2 covers all three positions. If the interval is length 2 (positions 1,2), then placing the tower at 1 with p=1 (covers only 1) is not enough. Wait, but that's not covering the entire interval. So for the interval [a, b], the tower must be placed at a position i such that i is in the middle of the interval, and p is chosen to cover the entire interval.\n\nAlternatively, the tower must be placed at position i, and the interval [a, b] must be such that a = i - p +1 and b = i + p -1. So the length of the interval is 2p -1. Thus, the length must be odd, and i is the middle of the interval. For example, for a length of 3, p=2, and the tower is in the middle. For a length of 5, p=3, etc.\n\nBut if the interval is of even length, say 2, then it's impossible to have a tower that covers exactly that interval. Because for p=1, the tower covers a single city. For p=2, the tower covers 3 cities. So in that case, you can't have a tower that covers exactly two cities. Therefore, the intervals must be of odd lengths. But that's conflicting with the sample input where n=2, and the towers are built in 1 and 2. Each tower has p=1, covering exactly one city. So the total length is 2, which is even, but split into two intervals of length 1 each. So that's allowed.\n\nAh, right. So the intervals can be of any length as long as they are covered by a tower. However, the tower's coverage can be larger than the interval, but in our problem, the tower's coverage must exactly cover the interval. Because other parts of the coverage would be overlapping with other towers' coverage.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that each city is covered exactly once. So the tower's coverage must cover exactly the cities in its assigned interval, and no more. But how can that be achieved? Because if a tower's coverage is larger than the interval, then it might cover cities that are in other intervals. Hence, the way to ensure that is that the tower's coverage is exactly the interval assigned to it. Which requires that the tower's coverage ends exactly at the end of the interval and starts exactly at the start.\n\nSo for a tower at position i, the coverage must be exactly [a, b], which requires that:\n\na = i - p + 1\n\nb = i + p - 1\n\nSo the length of the interval is b - a + 1 = 2p - 1.\n\nWhich implies that the interval must have an odd length, and the tower is placed exactly in the middle.\n\nSo this suggests that the valid configurations are those where the cities are partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a tower. And each such interval is covered by the tower in the middle with p equal to (length + 1)/2.\n\nSo for example, if there is an interval [a, b] of length l = 2k + 1, then the tower must be placed at a + k, and the power is k + 1. This ensures that the tower's coverage is exactly [a, b].\n\nBut how does this relate to the positions of the towers? Each tower must be the center of its interval, and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover [1, n].\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S of {1..n} such that the elements of S are exactly the centers of such intervals, which partition [1..n] into intervals of odd lengths.\n\nThis seems similar to a tiling problem. For example, each position can be either part of a tile (interval) of length 1 (so the tower is there), or part of a longer tile. But the tiles must be of odd lengths.\n\nSo the problem becomes similar to counting the number of ways to tile a 1xn board with tiles of odd lengths, where each tile's center is marked as a tower.\n\nWait, but the tiling must consist of tiles of odd lengths. So for each tile of length l (odd), we have exactly one tower in the middle. And the rest of the positions in the tile are not towers (since they are covered by this tower, but they are not towers themselves).\n\nWait, but the towers are only built in the positions that are centers of the tiles. So the subset S consists exactly of the centers of the tiles. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to partition the interval [1..n] into tiles of odd lengths, and each such partition corresponds to exactly one subset S (the centers of the tiles).\n\nBut how many such partitions are there?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let dp[i] be the number of ways to partition the first i cities.\n\nFor the base case, dp[0] = 1 (empty partition). For i >=1, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=0}^{i-1} dp[k] * (if (i -k) is odd, then 1 else 0)\n\nWait, no. Because for each position i, we can consider that the last tile ends at i. The length of this tile must be odd. So for example, if the last tile has length l (odd), then it starts at position i - l + 1. So for each possible odd l, we can add dp[i - l] to dp[i].\n\nSo the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{l is odd, l <= i} dp[i - l]\n\nBut since l must be odd and positive, and the sum is over all possible l's.\n\nAlternatively, since l can be 1, 3, 5, ..., up to i (if i is odd).\n\nBut for example, for i=1, the sum is dp[0] = 1 â†’ dp[1] = 1.\n\nFor i=2, possible l's are 1 (since 2-1=1, which is allowed). So dp[2] = dp[1] = 1.\n\nFor i=3: l can be 1 or 3. So dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[0} = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nFor i=4: l can be 1 or 3. So dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[1} = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nWait, but for l=3, the tile starts at 4-3 +1 = 2? No, for a tile of length l ending at i, it starts at i - l + 1. So for i=4 and l=3, the tile starts at 4-3+1 = 2, and covers positions 2,3,4. So that's a valid tile of length 3. Then the previous part is up to position 1 (i - l = 4-3=1). So dp[1] is added.\n\nYes. So the recurrence is correct.\n\nBut then, what is the value of dp[n]?\n\nLet me check with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2. The answer is 1/4. The number of valid subsets is 1 (only {1,2}?), but according to dp[2] = 1. So the number of valid subsets is 1. Then the probability is 1/(2^2) = 1/4. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is n=3. The answer is 1/4. According to the note, the valid cases are:\n\nCase 1: towers at 1, 2, 3. Probability 1/8. Assign p=1 to each.\n\nCase 2: tower at 2. Probability 1/8. Assign p=2. So total 2 cases. So the number of valid subsets is 2. Then the probability is 2/(2^3) = 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut according to dp[3] = 2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother sample: for n=5, the answer is 5/32. Let's see what dp[5] is.\n\nLet's compute dp for n=5:\n\ndp[0] = 1.\n\ndp[1] = dp[0] = 1.\n\ndp[2] = dp[1] = 1.\n\ndp[3] = dp[2] + dp[0} = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ndp[4] = dp[3] + dp[1} = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\ndp[5] = dp[4] + dp[2} + dp[0}? Wait, wait, for i=5, the possible l's are 1, 3, 5.\n\nBecause l must be odd and â‰¤5.\n\nSo for l=1: dp[5-1] = dp[4] = 3.\n\nFor l=3: dp[5-3] = dp[2] = 1.\n\nFor l=5: dp[5-5] = dp[0} = 1.\n\nTotal dp[5] = 3+1+1=5. Which matches the sample's 5/32 (since 5 / 2^5 = 5/32).\n\nYes! So the number of valid subsets is exactly dp[n], where dp[i] follows the recurrence dp[i] = sum_{k} dp[i - l], where l is odd and l â‰¤i.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing dp[n], then the answer is dp[n]/(2^n), which is the probability.\n\nSo the main task is to compute dp[n], then compute (dp[n] * inv(2^n)) mod 998244353.\n\nNow, how to compute dp[n] efficiently for n up to 2e5?\n\nLet me think about the recurrence again.\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=0}^{i-1} dp[k], where i -k is odd.\n\nBut that's equivalent to:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} dp[j], where j = i - l, and l is odd. Which is same as j = i - (2m + 1) for m â‰¥0, such that j â‰¥0.\n\nSo for each i, dp[i] = sum_{j} dp[j], where j is i - (odd number) and j â‰¥0.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] - ... ?\n\nWait, let's think of the recurrence in terms of previous dp values.\n\nLet me think of the recurrence for dp[i]. For each i, the sum is over all odd numbers l (like 1,3,...). So for each l, we add dp[i - l].\n\nBut for i, the sum can be rewritten as:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-5] + ... \n\nBut this seems like a linear recurrence. However, for large n (up to 2e5), we need an O(n) solution.\n\nAnother observation: Let's look for a pattern in dp[i].\n\nFor example:\n\ndp[0] = 1.\n\ndp[1] = 1.\n\ndp[2] = 1.\n\ndp[3] = 2.\n\ndp[4] = 3.\n\ndp[5] = 5.\n\ndp[6] = 8.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\ndp[6] = sum of dp[6-1] + dp[6-3] + dp[6-5] = dp[5] + dp[3] + dp[1} = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\ndp[7] = dp[6] + dp[4] + dp[2} + dp[0} = 8 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 13.\n\nSo the sequence seems to be Fibonacci numbers. Let's see:\n\ndp[0] = 1.\n\ndp[1] = 1.\n\ndp[2] = 1.\n\ndp[3] = 2.\n\ndp[4] = 3.\n\ndp[5] = 5.\n\ndp[6] = 8.\n\ndp[7] = 13.\n\nYes! This looks like the Fibonacci sequence shifted. For example, dp[i] = Fib(i) ?\n\nWait, Fib(0) is 0, Fib(1) is 1, Fib(2) is 1, Fib(3) is 2, Fib(4) is 3, Fib(5) is 5, etc. So dp[i] equals Fib(i) for i â‰¥ 0, except dp[0] is 1 instead of 0. So dp[i] is Fib(i+1) ?\n\nLet me check:\n\nFor i=0: Fib(1) = 1. Yes.\n\ni=1: Fib(2) = 1. Yes.\n\ni=2: Fib(3) = 2? No, dp[2] is 1. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, maybe another pattern. Let me think about the recurrence.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence for dp[i].\n\nLet me think about dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] ?\n\nWait, for i=3: dp[3] = 2. If dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1} = 1 + 1 = 2. Yes.\n\ni=4: dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2} = 2 + 1 = 3. Yes.\n\ni=5: dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3} = 3 + 2 = 5. Yes.\n\ni=6: dp[6] = dp[5] + dp[4} = 5 + 3 = 8. Yes.\n\ni=7: dp[7] = dp[6] + dp[5} = 8 +5 = 13. Yes.\n\nSo the recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} ?\n\nBut how is that possible? Earlier, the recurrence was dp[i] = sum over all odd l's of dp[i-l]. How does that reduce to dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} ?\n\nLet me think for general i:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{l is odd} dp[i - l} \n\nBut l can be 1, 3, 5, etc. So for i â‰¥1, the sum is dp[i-1] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-5] + ... \n\nBut if we also consider that dp[i-1] = sum_{l is odd} dp[i-1 - l} \n\nBut I'm not sure. However, based on the computed examples, it seems that dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2}.\n\nLet me see for i=2:\n\ndp[2] = sum of l=1: dp[1} = 1. Which is 1. But according to the new recurrence, dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0} = 1 + 1 = 2. Which contradicts. Wait, but earlier calculation shows that dp[2] is 1. So this suggests that the new recurrence is not correct. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait earlier for i=2, the possible l is 1. So dp[2] = dp[2 -1} = dp[1} = 1. But according to the previous calculations, dp[2] = 1, but according to the recurrence dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2}, it would be 1 + 1 = 2. Which is wrong. So why did the previous examples for i=3,4,5, etc., fit into the dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2}?\n\nWait, let's re-calculate dp[3] using the original recurrence and the new recurrence.\n\nOriginal recurrence for dp[3] is sum of l=1 and l=3.\n\nFor l=1: dp[3-1} = dp[2} = 1.\n\nFor l=3: dp[3-3} = dp[0} = 1. So total 1 +1 = 2.\n\nIf the new recurrence is dp[3} = dp[2} + dp[1} = 1 +1= 2. Which matches.\n\nFor dp[4}: original recurrence is sum l=1,3.\n\nl=1: dp[3} =2.\n\nl=3: dp[4-3}= dp[1} =1. Sum is 3. Which is same as dp[3} + dp[2} = 2 +1 =3.\n\nYes.\n\nFor dp[2}, according to original recurrence, it's 1. According to the new recurrence, dp[2} = dp[1} + dp[0} = 1+1=2. Which is wrong. So why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nAh, because the new recurrence is dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nBut for i=2, according to the original recurrence, dp[2} is 1. But according to the new recurrence, it would be 1 + 1 = 2. Which is wrong.\n\nBut for iâ‰¥3, the new recurrence seems to hold. What's the reason?\n\nLet me think again. Let me find a general formula for dp[i}.\n\nLet me consider that dp[i} = sum_{k} dp[i - l} where l is odd.\n\nBut also, note that:\n\nsum_{l odd} dp[i - l} = sum_{m} dp[m} where m = i - l, and l is odd.\n\nWhich is equivalent to sum_{m} dp[m} where i - m is odd â†’ m and i have different parity.\n\nSo dp[i} = sum_{m < i, m and i have different parity} dp[m} \n\nBut what is the sum of dp[m} for all m < i with m and i have different parity?\n\nLet me denote S[i} = sum_{m=0}^{i-1} dp[m}.\n\nThen, dp[i} = S[i} - sum_{m < i, m and i have same parity} dp[m} \n\nBut how can I express this?\n\nAlternatively, since for each i, the sum of dp[m} for m with parity different from i is equal to S[i} - sum_{m with same parity as i} dp[m}.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, let me think about the relation between dp[i} and dp[i-1}.\n\nSuppose that for i â‰¥1, dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nBut for i=2, that gives 1+1=2, which is wrong. But for i=3, it's 1+2=3? No, dp[3} is 2. Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait for i=3, according to the original recurrence, it's 2. According to the new recurrence dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} â†’ dp[3} = dp[2} + dp[1} = 1 +1= 2. Which is correct.\n\nFor i=2, the new recurrence would give dp[2} = dp[1} + dp[0} = 1+1=2. Which is incorrect. But according to the original recurrence, it's 1. So why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nLet me think about the original recurrence again. For i=2, the possible l's are 1 (since 2-1=1, which is allowed). So dp[2} = dp[1} = 1.\n\nBut according to the new recurrence, dp[2} = dp[1} + dp[0} = 1 + 1 = 2. Which is wrong.\n\nSo why is the new recurrence working for i â‰¥3 but not for i=2?\n\nLet me think about the general case. Suppose that for i â‰¥ 2, dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nBut for i=2, that would require dp[2} = dp[1} + dp[0} = 1 + 1 = 2. But according to the original recurrence, it's 1.\n\nSo this suggests that the recurrence is not correct for i=2. However, for iâ‰¥3, it holds.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my thinking. Let me re-examine the original recurrence for dp[i}.\n\nThe original recurrence is dp[i} = sum_{l is odd} dp[i - l} \n\nFor i=2:\n\npossible l's are 1 (since 1 is odd and 1 â‰¤ 2). So dp[2} = dp[2-1} = dp[1} = 1.\n\nFor i=3:\n\nl can be 1, 3. So dp[3} = dp[2} + dp[0} = 1 +1 = 2.\n\nFor i=4:\n\nl can be 1,3. So dp[4} = dp[3} + dp[1} = 2 +1 =3.\n\nFor i=5:\n\nl can be 1,3,5. dp[5} = dp[4} + dp[2} + dp[0} = 3 +1 +1 =5.\n\nNow, let's see what dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} would give:\n\nFor i=2, dp[2} = dp[1} + dp[0} = 1 +1 = 2 (wrong).\n\nFor i=3: dp[3} = dp[2} + dp[1} = 1 +1 = 2 (correct).\n\nFor i=4: dp[4} = dp[3} + dp[2} = 2 +1 =3 (correct).\n\nFor i=5: dp[5} = dp[4} + dp[3} =3 +2=5 (correct).\n\nFor i=6: dp[6} = dp[5} + dp[4} =5 +3=8 (correct).\n\nSo for iâ‰¥3, the recurrence dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} holds. But for i=2, it doesn't. So what's the general pattern here?\n\nLet me think: For i â‰¥ 1, dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} - something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence is dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} for i â‰¥ 2, but with initial conditions adjusted.\n\nWait, for i=2, according to the original recurrence, dp[2} = 1. But according to the recurrence dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2}, it would be 1+1=2. So if we adjust the initial conditions, perhaps?\n\nLet me think of the initial conditions. For dp[0} = 1, dp[1} = 1. For i=2, according to the original recurrence, it's 1. But according to the recurrence dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2}, it would be 1 + 1 = 2. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nBut for i â‰¥3, the recurrence holds. So perhaps the correct recurrence is:\n\ndp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} for i â‰¥ 3, with dp[0} = 1, dp[1} = 1, dp[2} = 1.\n\nYes. Let's see:\n\ndp[3} = dp[2} + dp[1} = 1 + 1 = 2 â†’ correct.\n\ndp[4} = dp[3} + dp[2} = 2 +1 =3 â†’ correct.\n\ndp[5} = 3 +2=5 â†’ correct.\n\nYes, this seems to work.\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[0} = 1\n\ndp[1} = 1\n\ndp[2} = 1\n\nfor i â‰¥ 3:\n\ndp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2}\n\nSo this is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence. Let me see what the sequence looks like:\n\ndp[0} = 1\n\ndp[1} = 1\n\ndp[2} = 1\n\ndp[3} = 2\n\ndp[4} = 3\n\ndp[5} = 5\n\ndp[6} = 8\n\ndp[7} = 13\n\ndp[8} = 21\n\nWhich is the Fibonacci numbers shifted. For example, dp[i} = Fib(i-1}, where Fib(0} = 0, Fib(1} =1, Fib(2} =1, Fib(3} =2, etc.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFib(0} = 0\n\nFib(1} = 1\n\nFib(2} = 1\n\nFib(3} = 2\n\nFib(4} = 3\n\nFib(5} =5\n\nFib(6} =8\n\nSo dp[i} = Fib(i-1} for i â‰¥1?\n\nFor i=1: Fib(0} =0 â†’ no. But dp[1} is 1.\n\nHmm. Not sure. Let me think again.\n\nBut regardless, the recurrence for dp[i} can be computed efficiently with O(n) time and space.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute dp[0..n} using the recurrence:\n\ndp[0} = 1\n\ndp[1} = 1\n\ndp[2} = 1\n\nfor i â‰¥3:\n\ndp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2}\n\nOnce we compute dp[n}, the answer is (dp[n} * inv(2^n)) mod MOD.\n\nBut how to compute inv(2^n} mod MOD?\n\nSince MOD is a prime (998244353), we can compute inv(2^n} as pow(2, n * (MOD-2), MOD), but wait:\n\nActually, inv(2^n) is equal to pow(2, n)^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nBut since 2^n can be large, but we can compute it as pow(2, n, MOD), then take its inverse.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute dp[n} as per the recurrence.\n\nCompute numerator = dp[n} mod MOD.\n\nCompute denominator = pow(2, n, MOD).\n\nCompute the result as numerator * pow(denominator, MOD-2, MOD) mod MOD.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, for n up to 2e5, it's manageable.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: n=2 â†’ dp[2} =1. denominator is 4. 1/",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns from 1 to n with a 50% chance each, there exists a way to set their signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations of towers that allow the required signal setup. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid ways to cover the first `i` towns.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation for `dp[i]` is derived based on the observation that each valid configuration can be formed by extending valid configurations of smaller lengths. Specifically:\n   - `dp[0] = 1` (base case for zero towns)\n   - `dp[1] = 1`\n   - `dp[2] = 1`\n   - For `i >= 3`, `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo `998244353`, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n4. **Modular Inverse**: The probability calculation involves dividing by `2^n`, which is handled using modular inverse computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Compute dp array\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    if n >= 1:\n        dp[1] = 1\n    if n >= 2:\n        dp[2] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD\n    \n    # Compute denominator: 2^n mod MOD\n    denominator = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    \n    # Compute numerator: dp[n]\n    numerator = dp[n]\n    \n    # Compute modular inverse of denominator\n    inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    # Result is numerator * inv_denominator mod MOD\n    result = (numerator * inv_denominator) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized to store the number of valid configurations for each length from 0 to n.\n2. **Base Cases**: The base cases for `dp[0]`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]` are set based on initial observations.\n3. **Filling DP Array**: Using the recurrence relation, we fill the `dp` array up to `n`.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The denominator `2^n` is computed using modular exponentiation. The modular inverse of this value is then computed using Fermat's Little Theorem, which allows us to perform division under modulo constraints.\n5. **Final Result Calculation**: The final result is obtained by multiplying the number of valid configurations (`dp[n]`) with the modular inverse of `2^n`, ensuring the result is within the required modulo constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, ensuring it handles large values of n up to 200,000 efficiently.",
