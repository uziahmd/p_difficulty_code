Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm, how do I check all possible substrings and see which ones appear more than once?\n\nThe brute force way would be to check all possible substrings of the string, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length among those that have at least two occurrences. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, this might be feasible.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the string.\n2. For each substring, note all the starting indices where it occurs.\n3. For each substring, if there are at least two occurrences, record its length.\n4. Find the maximum such length.\n\nBut generating all substrings could be O(n^2) in number, which for n=100 is 100*100=10,000 possibilities. For each substring, checking all possible positions might be O(n) again. So overall O(n^3) time. For n=100, that's 1,000,000 operations. Which should be manageable.\n\nSo let's proceed with this approach.\n\nBut how to generate all substrings and track their occurrences?\n\nAn alternative approach is to iterate over all possible lengths, starting from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1, and for each length, check if there's a substring of that length that appears at least twice. Once found, return that length as the maximum.\n\nThis way, we can stop early once we find the maximum possible length.\n\nSo for example, for the string of length 5, check for substrings of length 4, then 3, etc. For each length, check all possible substrings of that length and see if any occurs more than once.\n\nThis approach might be more efficient since once we find the maximum possible length, we can return immediately.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor length in range (len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   For each starting index i from 0 to len(s) - length:\n\n       substring = s[i:i+length]\n\n       check if this substring appears again in the string (at least once more)\n\n       if yes, return length as the answer.\n\nOnce we find the first such length, return it.\n\nIf none found, return 0.\n\nBut how to check if a substring appears again? For each substring of length l, we can check if it exists in the string again, but not overlapping? Wait no, the problem allows overlapping. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs at positions 0-2 and 2-4. So when checking for a substring of length 3, the code must check if there are at least two occurrences, even overlapping.\n\nSo for a given substring of length l, how can I check if it appears at least two times?\n\nOne way is to collect all the substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nSo for each possible length l, starting from the largest possible, we can collect all substrings of that length, and check if any of them appears at least two times. If yes, return l as the answer.\n\nSo for example, for the string 'ababa', when l=3, the substrings are:\n\ni=0: aba\n\ni=1: bab\n\ni=2: aba\n\ni=3: aba? Wait, no. The string is length 5. For l=3, the possible substrings are:\n\nindices 0-2 (aba), 1-3 (bab), 2-4 (aba). So the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So 'aba' appears twice. Hence, the answer is 3.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nLoop l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   create a set or a dictionary to track the substrings of length l.\n\n   for each i in 0 to len(s) - l:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n       if substr is already in the set, then return l as the answer.\n\n       else add it to the set.\n\n   after checking all substrings of length l, if any duplicates found, return l.\n\nWait, but if we check for duplicates as we go, then once we find a duplicate, we can return l immediately. Because we are checking from largest l downwards, so the first l where a duplicate is found is the",
