Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. The goal is to minimize the absolute difference between the angle formed and a. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to calculate the possible angles in a regular polygon. Let me think about the properties of regular polygons.\n\nIn a regular n-gon, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's the measure of each interior angle when you split the polygon into triangles. However, the problem here is about angles formed by three vertices, not the interior angles of the polygon itself.\n\nLet me think about the angle formed by three vertices. Suppose we have a regular polygon, and we pick three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that v2 is the vertex of the angle. The angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2 along the perimeter.\n\nFor example, in a regular polygon, if you fix v2, then the number of edges between v1 and v2 (let's say k steps) and between v3 and v2 (m steps) would determine the angle. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle depends on the number of sides between the points.\n\nWait, maybe there's a formula for the angle formed at v2. Let me recall some geometry.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angle (the angle subtended at the center by one side) is 360/n degrees. For any two vertices, the angle between them from the center is k*(360/n), where k is the number of steps between them along the perimeter.\n\nBut how does that relate to the angle formed at v2?\n\nLet me consider a regular polygon. Suppose we have three points: v2, v1, and v3. The angle at v2 is determined by the arcs between v1 and v3. Let me think of the polygon inscribed in a circle. Then, the angle at v2 would be related to the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nWait, in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that subtended at the circumference. So, if the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is k steps, then the central angle is k*(360/n) degrees. The inscribed angle would be half of that. But wait, the angle at v2 would depend on which arc we're considering.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Let's say v2 is fixed. Then, the positions of v1 and v3 are determined by their positions around the polygon. Suppose there are k vertices between v1 and v2 in one direction, and m vertices between v3 and v2 in the other direction. Wait, but since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 depends on the number of sides between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, here's an approach. For a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex v2 by two other vertices v1 and v3 depends on the number of edges between them. Let's suppose that between v1 and v2 there are k edges in one direction, and between v3 and v2 there are m edges in the other direction. But since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the number of steps between v1 and v3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. Let me try with examples.\n\nTake a square (n=4). Let's look at the angle formed by vertices 1,2,3. The angle at 2 is 90 degrees. Now, if we take vertices 1,2,4, the angle at 2 is 45 degrees. Because the arc between 1 and 4 (passing through 3) is 3 steps (since n=4, the arc from 1 to 4 is 3 steps, but the other way is 1 step). Wait, but the angle at v2 would be determined by the arc opposite to it.\n\nWait, here's a formula I found once. For a regular polygon, if you choose three vertices such that there are k steps between v1 and v2 and m steps between v3 and v2, but perhaps the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose in a regular polygon, the angle formed at vertex v2 by vertices v1 and v3. Let's imagine that between v1 and v3, there are m vertices. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) has length m+1 edges. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not include v2. Let's say that the number of edges between v1 and v3 along that arc is k. Then, the central angle is (k * 360)/n degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of that? Or something else?\n\nAlternatively, considering the regular polygon as inscribed in a circle. The angle at v2 is an inscribed angle. The arc that is opposite to the angle (i.e., the arc that does not contain v2) is determined by the positions of v1 and v3. The measure of that arc is equal to the central angle. Then, the inscribed angle at v2 would be half of that arc's measure.\n\nSo, for example, in the square (n=4), if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 (like 1,2,3), then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 2 edges (from 1 to 3 via the other side of the square). The central angle is 2*(360/4) = 180 degrees. The inscribed angle is half that, 90 degrees. Which matches the interior angle of the square. But if we take v1 as 1, v2 as 2, and v3 as 4, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is 1 edge (from 1 to 4 via 3?), no, wait. Let me see: the square has vertices 1,2,3,4 in clockwise order. If v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 is the arc from 1 to 4 going through 3. That's two edges (from 1 to 3 to 4?), no, between 1 and 4, there are two edges if you go through 3 (but 1 to 3 is two edges? No, 1 to 2 is one edge, 2 to 3 another, etc. So between 1 and 4, the arc that doesn't pass through 2 is 1 -> 4 directly? No, because in a square, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't pass through 2 would be the arc going through 3, which is two edges (1-3 is not adjacent, but 1-4 is adjacent? Wait, in a square, each vertex is connected to two others. So 1 is connected to 2 and 4. So, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't pass through 2 is just the direct edge between them. Wait, but that's one edge. So the central angle would be 360/4 * 1 = 90 degrees. Then the inscribed angle at v2 would be half of that, 45 degrees. Which matches the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSo the formula seems to be: the angle at v2 is equal to (k * 180) / n degrees, where k is the number of edges in the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, in the first case, the arc had 2 edges (for the square case with 1,2,3), which gives 2 * 180 / 4 = 90 degrees. For the second case, the arc had 1 edge (from 1 to 4), so 1 * 180 /4 = 45 degrees. That seems to fit.\n\nSo the general formula is: angle = (k * 180) / n, where k is the number of edges in the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. But how to find k?\n\nAlternatively, for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3. Let me think: if there are m vertices between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2, then the number of edges in that arc is m + 1. So, k = m + 1.\n\nBut how to find m?\n\nLet me think of the positions of the vertices. Suppose the polygon is labeled 1 to n in clockwise order. Let's fix v2 as some vertex. Then, for any v1 and v3, the arc between them that does not contain v2 must be determined.\n\nBut perhaps the key idea is that for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the direction that skips v2. Let me think of it as follows:\n\nIf we have a regular polygon, and we pick three vertices v1, v2, v3. The angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Let's denote that number as k. Then the angle is (k * 180) / n degrees. Wait, but for the square example, when v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc from 1 to 3 through 4, which is two edges (1-4 and 4-3). So k is 2. Then the angle is (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct. When v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc from 1 to 4 (directly connected, one edge). So k is 1, and the angle is (1*180)/4 = 45 degrees. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to be that the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Now, the question is, how to find all possible values of k, and for each possible k, what's the corresponding angle.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, for any possible k, there are multiple ways to choose the three points. However, the problem requires us to find the angle closest to a given a.\n\nNow, for a given n, what are the possible values of k?\n\nSince the polygon has n vertices, the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) must be at least 1 edge (since v1 and v3 are distinct from v2 and from each other). Also, the maximum possible k is n-2. Because if you have v1 and v3 such that the arc between them not containing v2 is n-2 edges, then the other arc (which contains v2) has 2 edges (since total edges around the polygon is n).\n\nWait, for example, in a pentagon (n=5). If the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is 3 edges, then the other arc (containing v2) is 2 edges. So k can range from 1 to n-2.\n\nSo for each possible k in 1 <= k <= n-2, the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. But how do we find which k gives the angle closest to a?\n\nWait, but for each possible k, the angle is (k * 180)/n. But for each k, there are multiple possible triples (v1, v2, v3) that produce that angle. Our task is to find the k that makes this angle closest to a, then output any such triple.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFind the integer k (between 1 and n-2) such that the value of (k * 180)/n is as close as possible to a. Once we find the optimal k, we can construct any triple that corresponds to that k.\n\nBut how to compute k?\n\nLet me think: For a given a, we want to find the k that minimizes |(k * 180)/n - a|. Let me rearrange this equation.\n\nLet me denote target_angle = a.\n\nWe can compute the ideal k as (target_angle * n)/180. But since k must be an integer between 1 and n-2, we need to find the closest integer to this value.\n\nBut wait, since k must be an integer, we can compute the real value of k as (a * n) / 180, then round it to the nearest integer. However, we have to make sure that the rounded k is within the allowed range (1 <= k <= n-2).\n\nBut also, note that for some a, there may be two possible k's (floor and ceiling) that are equally close. In that case, we can choose either.\n\nOnce we find the optimal k, we can generate a triple (v1, v2, v3) that corresponds to that k.\n\nNow, how to generate the triple?\n\nLet me think. For example, let's say we have chosen k. We need to select three vertices such that between v1 and v3 (along the arc not containing v2) there are exactly k edges. How can I choose such vertices?\n\nLet me pick v2 as vertex 1. Then, v1 can be vertex 2, and v3 can be vertex (2 + k) mod n? Wait, no. Let's think of the polygon as numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\nIf I fix v2 as vertex 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must have k edges. So, the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) must be k edges. Therefore, if v2 is vertex 1, then v1 and v3 must be such that moving clockwise from v1 to v3 passes through k edges, and this path does not include v2.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to pick v2 as vertex 1. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) must be of length k edges. So, for example, if k is 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 is one edge. So, v1 and v3 are adjacent. But since the arc does not contain v2 (vertex 1), then v1 and v3 must be on the other side of the polygon. Let's think of the polygon as arranged in a circle.\n\nIf v2 is vertex 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the longer arc. Wait, no. For example, if k is 1, the arc between v1 and v3 has one edge. So, they are adjacent. But how to arrange that the arc does not contain v2 (vertex 1). Let's imagine that v1 is vertex 2 and v3 is vertex 3. Then, the arc between 2 and 3 (which is one edge) does not contain vertex 1. So that's valid. Then the angle at v2 (vertex 1) would be (1 * 180)/n degrees. But in that case, the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 edge, and the angle is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I set v2 as vertex 1, then v1 can be vertex 2 and v3 can be vertex (2 + k) mod n? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nIf I fix v2 as vertex 1, then to get an arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) with k edges, I need to have v1 and v3 positioned such that when you move clockwise from v1 to v3, you pass through k edges, and this path does not include v2 (vertex 1). So, for example, if I take v1 as vertex 2 and v3 as vertex (2 + k). But since the polygon is circular, the positions wrap around.\n\nWait, but if v2 is vertex 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the arc that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2. So, for example, if v1 is vertex 2, then the arc that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) would be the arc going clockwise from 2 to some vertex that is not passing through 1. So for k edges, the v3 would be vertex 2 + k. But since the polygon is numbered 1 to n, if 2 + k exceeds n, we wrap around.\n\nWait, but if v2 is 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the arc that is on the other side of the polygon. So, for example, if k is 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 edge, and the positions could be v1 = 2, v3 = 3. Then, the arc from 2 to 3 is one edge, and the arc that includes v2 (vertex 1) would be the rest of the polygon. So this is valid.\n\nAnother example: for k = n-2. Then the arc between v1 and v3 has n-2 edges. That would mean that the arc that includes v2 has 2 edges. So, if v2 is 1, then v1 and v3 are such that their arc not containing v2 is n-2 edges. So, for example, v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex n. The arc from 2 to n clockwise is (n-2) edges (since from 2 to 3, ..., up to n: that's n-2 steps). So the angle would be (n-2)*180/n degrees. Which for a triangle (n=3) would be (1 * 180)/3 = 60 degrees, which is correct.\n\nSo, for any k, choosing v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k (if 2 + k <=n, otherwise wrap around) would give the correct angle. However, we need to ensure that the arc between v1 and v3 does not contain v2. For example, when k is 1, v3 is 3, which is adjacent to v1 (2), and the arc between them does not contain v2 (1). But if k is larger, say, for n=5, k=3, then v1=2, v3=2+3=5. The arc from 2 to 5 is 3 edges (2-3, 3-4, 4-5). The arc that contains v2 (1) would be from 5 to 2 passing through 1, which is 2 edges (5-1, 1-2). So yes, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is of length k=3 edges.\n\nTherefore, the approach to generate the triple is: choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k. However, if 2 + k exceeds n, then we need to wrap around. Wait, but for k up to n-2, 2 + k can be up to 2 + n-2 = n. So for example, if k = n-2, then 2 + k = n. So v3 is n. Which is valid.\n\nSo, in general, for a given k, the triple (v1, v2, v3) can be (2, 1, 2 + k). But since the problem allows any valid triple, this is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 4, k=1. Then 2 + 1 = 3. So the triple is (2,1,3). Which is the same as the example in the note for the second input (4 67). The sample output was \"2 1 3\", which gives an angle of 45 degrees. Which is indeed (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: for the third input (4 68), the optimal k is 2 (since 2*180/4=90, which is closer to 68 than 45). So the triple would be (2, 1, 2+2=4). So the triple is 2 1 4. Which is one of the sample outputs.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute for each possible k (1 <= k <= n-2) the angle (k * 180)/n.\n\n2. Find the k that makes this angle as close as possible to a.\n\n3. Once the optimal k is found, output the triple (2, 1, 2 + k) (but need to check if 2 + k exceeds n? Well, since k can be up to n-2, 2 + k is up to n, so no problem.)\n\nBut wait, when k is such that 2 + k is n, then the triple is (2, 1, n). Which is valid.\n\nBut what if the optimal k is not unique? For example, if two different k's give the same minimal difference. Then, any of them is acceptable. So we can choose the smallest or largest k, but the code needs to handle that.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, compute the target angle a. We need to find the best k.\n\nCompute the ideal k as (a * n)/180. Since k must be integer, we can check floor and ceiling of that value, and see which gives a better approximation.\n\nBut since k must be between 1 and n-2, we need to clamp the computed k to that range.\n\nSo for example, if the ideal k is 0.5, then the candidates are 0 and 1. But since k must be >=1, we take 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the ideal k is larger than n-2, then we take n-2.\n\nSo the steps for finding k:\n\nCompute ideal_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n\nThen, possible candidates are floor(ideal_k), ceil(ideal_k), and possibly also the ones adjacent to those if they are out of bounds.\n\nBut since the minimal difference can be achieved by multiple k's, we need to check the closest integers.\n\nBut how to find the best k?\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute the candidate k as the closest integer to ideal_k, then check if it's within the allowed range. If not, take the closest allowed value.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute the possible k values around ideal_k, and for each, compute the absolute difference, then choose the best one.\n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps:\n\nCompute ideal_k = a * n / 180.0\n\nThen, the optimal k is the integer closest to ideal_k. However, since k must be in [1, n-2], we need to clamp it.\n\nBut for example, if ideal_k is 0.3, then the closest integer is 0, which is invalid. So we take 1.\n\nIf ideal_k is 3.6, then the closest integer is 4. But if n-2 is 3, then 4 is invalid. So we take 3.\n\nSo the code can generate candidates for k as floor(ideal_k), ceil(ideal_k), and then check which of these are in the allowed range. Then compare their absolute differences to a, and choose the best one.\n\nAlternatively, since the function f(k) = |(k * 180 / n) - a| is convex, the minimum is achieved at the closest integer to ideal_k. So perhaps checking the floor and ceiling of ideal_k is sufficient.\n\nBut to avoid missing cases, perhaps the code should check all possible k's in the vicinity of ideal_k, and select the best one.\n\nBut for code, perhaps the following steps:\n\nCompute ideal_k = a * n / 180.0\n\nThen, possible candidates are the integer part of ideal_k (floor), and floor + 1. Also, check if they are in the allowed range.\n\nBut also, if ideal_k is exactly between two integers, then both are possible.\n\nSo the code can generate a list of possible k candidates (floor(ideal_k), ceil(ideal_k)), then check which of these are in the allowed range, and then compute the minimal difference.\n\nOnce the best k is found, generate the triple (2, 1, 2 + k).\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple k's with the same minimal difference? For example, if two k's are equally close to the target a. In that case, the problem says any of them is acceptable. So the code can choose the first one found, or any.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute ideal_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n\nGenerate candidates for k: floor(ideal_k), ceil(ideal_k), and also possibly check if ideal_k is integer.\n\nThen, collect all possible k candidates (could be 1 or 2 values), then for each candidate, check if it is in [1, n-2]. If not, adjust to the nearest valid value.\n\nOnce the candidates are generated, compute for each the absolute difference, and select the one with the minimal difference. If there's a tie, any is acceptable.\n\nOnce the best k is found, output the triple (2, 1, 2 + k). However, the problem allows any triple, so this is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what if the best k is zero? Well, since k ranges from 1 to n-2, the code will have adjusted it to 1.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 15.\n\nn=3, a=15.\n\nideal_k = 15 * 3 / 180 = 0.25. So floor is 0, ceil is 1. But since k must be >=1 and <=1 (n-2 = 1). So the only possible k is 1. The angle is (1 * 180)/3 = 60 degrees. Which is the only possible angle. So output any triple, like 1 2 3. But according to our method, the triple is (2, 1, 2 + 1 = 3). So the triple is 2 1 3. But the sample output is 1 2 3. But the problem says any correct triple is acceptable. So the code's output is acceptable.\n\nBut why does the sample output have 1 2 3? Because the angle is formed with v2 as 2. So in that case, the triple is (1, 2, 3). The angle at 2 is 60 degrees. Which is same as the code's triple (2, 1, 3) which has angle at 1. Wait, no. Wait, in our approach, the code generates (v1, v2, v3) as (2, 1, 3). The angle is at v2 (vertex 1). So the angle is (k * 180)/n. For k=1, that's 60 degrees. Which is correct. But the sample output is 1 2 3, which is a triple where the angle is at vertex 2. For that case, what is k?\n\nIn that case, the arc between v1 (1) and v3 (3) that does not contain v2 (2) is the arc from 1 to 3 through vertex 3 (assuming n=3). Wait, in a triangle, any three vertices are connected. The arc between 1 and 3 that does not contain 2 is... well, since the polygon is a triangle, there's only one arc between 1 and 3. But since v2 is 2, the arc that does not contain v2 would be the arc from 1 to 3 passing through the other side. But in a triangle, that's the same as the arc passing through 2. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, for n=3, the arc between 1 and 3 that does not contain v2 (vertex 2) would be impossible. Because in a triangle, any two vertices are connected by two arcs, each of length 1 (since there are two edges between them). Wait, no. For n=3, between any two vertices, there is one edge. But the arc that does not contain v2 (vertex 2) would be the arc from 1 to 3 that does not pass through 2. But in a triangle, that's not possible. Because the only way to get from 1 to 3 is via 2. So perhaps my earlier formula is incorrect for k=1 in this case?\n\nWait, this suggests that there's a mistake in my previous reasoning. Because for the triangle case, the angle formed by vertices 1,2,3 is 60 degrees. According to the formula, what's k here?\n\nIf v2 is 2, then the arc between v1 (1) and v3 (3) that does not contain v2 (2) would have to be... but there is no such arc. Because in a triangle, any arc between 1 and 3 must pass through 2. So the formula I used earlier is not applicable here. Which suggests that my previous analysis is wrong.\n\nThis indicates a problem. What's wrong here?\n\nLet me re-examine the formula. The formula said that the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of edges in the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. But in the case of the triangle, when choosing v1=1, v2=2, v3=3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is nonexistent. But according to the formula, k would be 1 (since the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 1 edge, so the arc that does not contain v2 would be (n - 1) - 1 = 1 edge? No, perhaps my earlier formula is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect, and I need to re-examine the formula for the angle.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's find the formula for the angle at v2 in terms of the number of vertices between v1 and v3.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the angle at vertex v2 formed by vertices v1 and v3 can be calculated as follows. Let’s assume that between v1 and v2 there are m steps clockwise, and between v3 and v2 there are l steps clockwise. However, since the polygon is regular, the actual positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 determine the angle.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for any three vertices in a regular polygon, the angle at v2 depends on how many vertices are between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon.\n\nLet me think of the regular polygon as inscribed in a circle. The angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. The angle between these two chords depends on the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nLet’s denote that arc as having length k steps (edges). Then, the central angle corresponding to this arc is (k * 360)/n degrees. The inscribed angle at v2 would be half of that, so (k * 180)/n degrees. This is the same as before.\n\nBut in the case of the triangle, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be the arc that goes around the other side of the circle. However, in a triangle, this arc would consist of n - 2 edges. Because between v1 and v3, the arc that does not contain v2 is the arc that goes through the other vertices. For a triangle, n=3, so the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 has 3 - 2 = 1 edge. Wait, but that's impossible. Because in a triangle, the only way to connect v1 and v3 is through v2. So how can there be an arc that does not contain v2?\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. For the case where v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the arc that goes the other way around the circle. However, in a triangle, this arc would consist of (n - 2) edges. For n=3, that's 1 edge. Which is the same as the arc that contains v2. Wait, that can't be. There must be something wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not (k * 180)/n, but something else. Let me think again.\n\nIn the case of the triangle, the angle at v2 (vertex 2) formed by v1=1 and v3=3 is 60 degrees. According to the formula, what would be k? It should be the number of edges in the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. But since the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc that goes the other way around the circle. But in a triangle, that arc is of length 1 edge (since n=3, the arc from v1 to v3 not passing through v2 is the same as the arc from v1 to v3 passing through v2? No, that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be that the angle is ( (n - k - 2) * 180 ) / n, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 that contains v2. Or perhaps I have the formula inverted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the angle is ( (k - 2) * 180 ) / n, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me think of another example. Take a square (n=4). If we have v1=1, v2=2, v3=3. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc from 1 to 3 passing through 4. This arc has 2 edges (1-4 and 4-3). So k=2. The angle is (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees, which is correct.\n\nIf I take v1=1, v2=2, v3=4. The arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is the arc from 1 to 4 directly (1 edge). So k=1. Angle is 45 degrees. Correct.\n\nNow, for the triangle case, if v1=1, v2=2, v3=3. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc that goes from 1 to 3 through the other side of the circle. But in a triangle, this arc would have to be of length 1 edge (since n=3). But that's the same as the arc that contains v2. This seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is that the angle at v2 is ( (k) * 180 ) / n, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 in the arc that contains v2. No, that doesn't make sense for the square example. For v1=1, v2=2, v3=3, the arc containing v2 has 1 edge (from 1 to 3 through 2), and the angle is 90 degrees. According to the formula (k * 180)/n, with k=1, (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees, which is wrong. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, this indicates that my earlier understanding was incorrect. I need to re-examine the formula.\n\nLet me refer back to the inscribed angle theorem. The inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\nIn the case of the triangle, the angle at v2 (vertex 2) between v1=1 and v3=3 is the internal angle of the triangle. For a regular triangle, each internal angle is 60 degrees. The central angle subtended by the arc between v1 and v3 is 120 degrees (since the arc between 1 and 3 is two edges, each 120 degrees). Wait, no. For n=3, each central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/3 = 120 degrees. The arc between v1 and v3 (which are two steps apart) is 2 * 120 = 240 degrees. But the inscribed angle would be half of that, 120 degrees. But",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The approach involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently determining the closest possible angle using mathematical calculations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of edges between these vertices along the arc that does not include the vertex where the angle is formed. This angle can be calculated using the formula derived from the inscribed angle theorem.\n2. **Ideal k Calculation**: For a given target angle `a`, we calculate the ideal number of edges `k` that would form an angle closest to `a`. This is done by solving for `k` in the equation derived from the angle formula.\n3. **Range Adjustment**: Since `k` must be within valid bounds (1 to n-2), we adjust the calculated `k` to ensure it lies within this range.\n4. **Constructing the Result**: Once the optimal `k` is determined, we construct the vertices that form the closest angle using a straightforward method based on the calculated `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Calculate the ideal k\n    ideal_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n    \n    # Generate candidate k values\n    candidates = set()\n    for k in [int(ideal_k), int(ideal_k) + 1, int(ideal_k) - 1]:\n        if 1 <= k <= n - 2:\n            candidates.add(k)\n    \n    # Also check boundaries in case ideal_k is out of range\n    if ideal_k < 1:\n        candidates.add(1)\n    elif ideal_k > n - 2:\n        candidates.add(n - 2)\n    \n    # Find the best k\n    best_k = None\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for k in candidates:\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and k < best_k):\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # If no candidates found (shouldn't happen as n >= 3)\n    if best_k is None:\n        best_k = 1\n    \n    # Output the triple: v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_k\n    v1 = 2\n    v2 = 1\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Ideal k Calculation**: We compute the ideal number of edges `k` that would form the closest angle to `a` using the formula derived from the inscribed angle theorem.\n3. **Candidate k Values**: We generate potential values for `k` around the ideal value, ensuring they are within the valid range [1, n-2].\n4. **Selecting the Best k**: Among the candidate values, we determine which one gives the angle closest to `a`.\n5. **Constructing the Result**: Using the optimal `k`, we construct the vertices such that the angle at vertex 1 is formed by vertices 2 and (2 + k), ensuring the result adheres to the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values for `k` and ensures the closest possible angle to the target is found, providing an optimal solution within the constraints.",
