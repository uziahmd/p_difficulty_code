    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, right. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is calculated as 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's border would be 2*(3+3-2) = 8 cells, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1 and output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), I need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the previous. Wait, the first ring is the edge. The second is two cells in, which would mean that the dimensions for the second ring's rectangle would be (original width - 4*(2-1)) = w -4*1, same for height. Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so 2*2=4 from each dimension. So for each ring i, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\nBut for each of these rings, the perimeter is 2*(width + height - 2). So for each i from 1 to k, compute that and sum all.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the dimensions are valid. For example, if the original w and h are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1) from each, the resulting dimensions must be at least 1x1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ). Wait, the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Wait, the original problem says that the input has k as up to floor( (min(n, m) + 1)/4 ), but n and m here are probably w and h. So that ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions for the i-th ring are valid. Because for the k-th ring, the dimensions would be w - 4*(k-1) and h - 4*(k-1). Since k is chosen such that this is possible.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each of the k rings, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum them all.\n\nSo let's think about how to code this.\n\nThe input is three integers: w, h, k.\n\nWe can loop from i=1 to i=k, and for each i, compute the current width and current height.\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nThen, the perimeter for that ring is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). Sum all these.\n\nWait, but let's check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w = 3 - 0 =3, current_h=3-0=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input:7 9 1. So current_w=7, current_h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example input:7 9 2. So for i=1: 7,9 → perimeter 2*(7+9-2)=28. For i=2: current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total sum is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. For example, the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see: for the k-th ring, the min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) must be >= 1. Because for example, if min(w, h) is m, then k is floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's take m=3. Then (3+1)/4=1, floor is 1. So k=1. For i=1, 4*(i-1) is 0. So m - 0 =3 >=1. For m=4, (4+1)/4 is 1.25 → floor 1. So k=1. For i=1, 4*(0) is 0, so 4-0=4. For k=2, the minimum m must be such that m -4*(2-1) >=1 → m -4 >=1 → m >=5. So for example, if m=5, then (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor 1. So k can't be 2. So the input constraints ensure that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 1. So we don't have to handle invalid cases.\n\nTherefore, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. For example, input could be read via input().split().\n\nBut the input is given as a single line with three integers. So:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen initialize total to 0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to k inclusive.\n\nFor each i, compute current_w and current_h.\n\nAdd 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) to total.\n\nFinally, print total.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSecond input:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird input:7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 =40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: current_w=5, current_h=5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2)= 16.\n\ni=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. Perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, but 1x1 rectangle's perimeter is zero? Because the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2) → 2*(1+1-2) = 0. Which makes sense. Because the ring is the border of a 1x1 rectangle, which is just the single cell, but since the ring is the border, but there's no cells around. So adding zero. But in that case, the code would add zero. So for example, if someone has a 5x5 plate and k=2, then the total would be 16 + 0 =16?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input constraints for k are such that it's allowed. Let's see for w=5, h=5. min(w,h) is 5. So floor( (5+1)/4 ) = 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the input would not allow that. So in the code, the input will have k such that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are >=1. So for example, when k=1, the code works. But if someone passes k=2, but the code would process it. But according to the input constraints, the given k is valid.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nAnother example: let's say w=7, h=7, k=2. Then for i=1: 7,7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 24. i=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Total 24+8=32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo the Python code is straightforward.\n",
