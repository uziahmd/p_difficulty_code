    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle. For the i-th ring, it's the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that work? Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next one is 2 cells inward on each side. So for example, the first ring is the outermost border. Then the next ring would be 2 cells in, so the dimensions would be (original width - 4) and (original height -4), because each side loses 2 cells. But wait, the formula given in the problem says for the i-th ring, it's (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w×h. Then for i=2, it's w-4 and h-4. Then for i=3, w-8 and h-8, etc. But each ring is the border of that rectangle. So the number of cells in each ring is the perimeter of that rectangle, but adjusted for the fact that when you take the border, it's 2*(width + height - 2), because each side contributes. Wait, let's think: for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the border is 2*m + 2*(n-2). Because the top and bottom rows have n cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (m-2) each. So total is 2*n + 2*(m-2) = 2*(n + m - 2). Alternatively, perimeter formula is 2*(width + height) - 4, since each side is counted once. Wait, maybe another way: for a rectangle with width w and height h, the number of cells in the border is 2*w + 2*h - 4. Because the four corners are counted twice if you just do 2w + 2h. So subtracting 4. So yes, that formula.\n\nSo for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i × h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w_i × h_i), and the ring is the border of that rectangle. So the number of cells for that ring is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Or 2*(w_i + h_i) - 4. Which is the same as 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Either way.\n\nSo the total number of cells is the sum over each ring from 1 to k of 2*(w_i + h_i - 2), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1).\n\nBut wait, there's a catch here. For each ring, the rectangle must be at least 3x3? Because the problem says that the input k is such that it's allowed. For example, the constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. Let's say min(w, h) is m. Then the maximum possible k is floor( (m + 1)/4 ). Let's see, for example, if m is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. For m=7, (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So for k rings, each ring requires that the rectangle for that ring is at least 3x3? Because otherwise, you can't have a ring. Wait, for example, if the rectangle is 3x3, then the ring is the border, which is 8 cells. Then for the next ring, the rectangle would be 3-4= -1? Which is invalid. So the k is constrained so that for each i up to k, the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring are at least 3x3? Or perhaps the formula ensures that. Because for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for the i-th ring, the minimum of these two values must be at least 3. Because the problem says that k is given such that it's allowed. So the input is guaranteed to be valid.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i × h_i) as 2*(w_i + h_i - 2), and sum all those.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, w_i=3, h_i=3. The perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. So the first ring is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. First ring is 7x9: 28. Second ring: i=2, so w_i =7 -4*(1) =3, h_i=9-4*(1)=5. So the rectangle is 3x5. The perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is to loop for each i from 1 to k, compute the current width and height, then compute the perimeter for that ring, add it to the total.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe input is three integers: w, h, k. So read them from stdin.\n\nThen, for each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nsum all perimeters.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, for each ring, the perimeter is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). Let me check with the first example. 3 and 3. 3+3-2=4. Multiply by 2 is 8. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nfor i in 1 to k:\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nreturn total.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So for the given input, the code will not have to handle that. So no need to check.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is 7 9 2, then for i=2, current_w is 7 -4*(1) =3, current_h is 9-4*(1)=5. Which is valid.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 2*6= 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. Perimeter 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nAnother example: if w=5, h=5, k=1. The perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then compute the sum.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead the input line, split into w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in Python, the input is read as a single line. For example, the input could be given as '3 3 1' etc.\n\nSo code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as above.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into three integers. Then loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter and sum.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, check for possible edge cases.\n\nFor example, when k is 0? But according to the input constraints, k is at least 1. Because the input says 1 ≤ k ≤ ... So no need to handle k=0.\n\nAnother case: when the w and h are 3, and k=1. Which is handled.\n\nAnother case: when k is maximum allowed. For example, if min(w, h) is 7. Then maximum k is floor( (7 +1)/4 ) = 2. So for example, if w=7, h=7, k=2. Which would give 24 + 8 = 32 as before.\n\nSo code should handle that.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
