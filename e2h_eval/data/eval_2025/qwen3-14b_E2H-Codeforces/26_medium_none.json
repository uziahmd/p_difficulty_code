    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Hmm. Oh right, the triangle inequality says that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe there's a way to simplify that.\n\nWait, the problem states that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z? Wait, no. Let me think. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y starts from B (since B ≤ y) and up to C, and z starts from C up to D. But how are x, y, z ordered? Well, since x ≤ B ≤ y, so x ≤ y. And y ≤ C ≤ z, so y ≤ z. Therefore, x ≤ y ≤ z. Oh right! So for any valid x, y, z, they are ordered such that x ≤ y ≤ z. Therefore, the triangle inequality requires that x + y > z. Because in a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side. So for x ≤ y ≤ z, we need x + y > z. That's the key condition here.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\n\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\n\nand x ≤ y ≤ z (which is already enforced by the ranges), and x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, since x ≤ y ≤ z, then z is the largest. So the triangle inequality is x + y > z. So that's the condition we need to check.\n\nSo the approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z in their ranges, but that's going to be O(B * C * D), which is way too slow given that D can be up to 5e5. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. How can we compute this efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that for each possible x and y, we can determine the valid z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. But since z has to be at least C and also at most D, and also z must be >= y (since y ≤ C ≤ z). Wait, because y is between B and C, and z is between C and D. So z is >= C, and y is <= C. So z >= y. Therefore, the ordering x ≤ y ≤ z is already satisfied.\n\nSo for each x and y, the z must be in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nBut wait, since z must be >= C and also <= x + y - 1. However, if x + y - 1 < C, then there are no such z. So for each x and y, the count of valid z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. So the total number of x and y pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). For large values, say 5e5, this would be (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a way to calculate the sum over all x and y of the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y.\n\nSo the idea is to find for each possible x and y, the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how do we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible ranges of x and y. Let me first consider that for x in [A, B], y in [B, C].\n\nLet me denote S = x + y. Then for each x and y, the upper bound for z is min(D, S - 1). But since z must be at least C, the count is max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1) if S - 1 >= C. Which can be rewritten as:\n\nif S - 1 >= C → S >= C + 1 → then the number of z is min(D, S-1) - C + 1 = min(D - C + 1, S - 1 - C + 1) = min(D - C + 1, S - C).\n\nWait, min(D, S-1) - C + 1 = (min(D, S-1) - C) + 1. So if S-1 >= C, then it's (min(D, S-1) - C + 1). Which is equal to:\n\nif S -1 >= C:\n\nif D >= S -1: then (S -1 - C + 1) = S - C.\n\nelse: D - C + 1.\n\nSo for each x and y, the count is max(0, min(S - C, D - C + 1)), where S is x + y, but only when S > C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C] of max(0, min(x + y - C, D - C + 1)) if x + y > C. Else zero.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let me define K = D - C + 1. Then for each x and y, if x + y - C > 0, then the contribution is min(x + y - C, K). Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the sum becomes sum_{x, y} [ max(0, min(x + y - C, K)) ] where x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C, and x + y > C.\n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nLet me think about x and y. Let me define for each x, the possible y's. Let me think of x as fixed. Then y ranges from B to C. For each x, what is the range of y where x + y > C?\n\nx + y > C → y > C - x. Since y is >= B, and C - x can be anything.\n\nBut since y is in [B, C], then for each x, the minimal y that satisfies y > C - x is max(B, floor(C - x) + 1). Wait, since y must be an integer. Let me think: for y to satisfy y > (C - x), since x and y are integers, then y ≥ C - x + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the valid y's are those in [y_low, C], where y_low is max(B, C - x + 1). But y also must be ≤ C. So if C - x + 1 > C → which implies that x < 1. But since x ≥ A ≥ 1, this can't happen. So for each x, the valid y's are those in [y_low, C], where y_low = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nBut wait, for example, if C - x + 1 is less than B, then y starts from B. Otherwise, y starts from C - x + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the y's that contribute to the sum are in the interval [y_low, C]. Let me call this interval [y_start, y_end], where y_end = C.\n\nNow, for each x and y in this interval, the value of x + y - C is (x + y) - C. Let me denote S = x + y. Then the term is min(S - C, K), where K is D - C + 1.\n\nBut since S = x + y, and y ranges from y_start to C, then S ranges from (x + y_start) to (x + C). Let me think about this.\n\nLet me think of for a fixed x, the sum over y in [y_start, C] of min(x + y - C, K).\n\nWhich is equivalent to sum_{s} min(s, K), where s = x + y - C, and y ranges from y_start to C. But x is fixed, so s = (x - C) + y. Since y ranges from y_start to C, then s ranges from (x - C) + y_start to (x - C) + C = x.\n\nSo for each x, the sum is sum_{s = (x - C + y_start)}^{x} min(s, K).\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the value of (x - C + y_start) and x.\n\nLet me compute for each x, the lower and upper bounds of s:\n\nlower_s = (x - C) + y_start.\n\nupper_s = x.\n\nSo the sum over s from lower_s to upper_s of min(s, K).\n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nWell, for each x, we can find the range of s values. Let me think:\n\nCase 1: upper_s <= K → then all terms are s, so sum from lower_s to upper_s.\n\nCase 2: lower_s >= K → all terms are K, so count of terms multiplied by K.\n\nCase 3: lower_s < K and upper_s > K → sum from lower_s to K is sum of s, plus (upper_s - K) * K.\n\nSo for each x, we need to calculate this.\n\nBut how to find lower_s and upper_s?\n\nLet me re-express lower_s. Since y_start is max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nSo for a given x, y_start = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nBut since x ranges from A to B, and B ≤ C, perhaps there's a way to find for which x's the y_start is B or C - x + 1.\n\nBut regardless, for each x, once we compute y_start, then lower_s is x + y_start - C.\n\nWait, because s = x + y - C. So when y is y_start, s is x + y_start - C.\n\nSo lower_s = x + y_start - C.\n\nAnd upper_s = x + C - C = x.\n\nSo upper_s is x.\n\nSo for each x, the sum is sum_{s = lower_s}^{x} min(s, K).\n\nLet me think of K as fixed (D - C + 1).\n\nSo the problem now is, for each x, compute this sum, and then add all these sums over all x in [A, B].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. Precompute K = D - C + 1. If D < C, then K is 0. But since C ≤ D, K is at least 1.\n\nWait, no: C ≤ D. So D - C + 1 ≥ 1. For example, when C = D, D - C + 1 = 1.\n\nSo K is positive.\n\nNow, for each x in [A, B], compute the sum as follows:\n\nCompute y_start = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nIf y_start > C → then no y's contribute. But since y ranges up to C, if y_start > C, then there are no valid y's. So in that case, the contribution is zero.\n\nBut when is y_start > C? Let's see:\n\ny_start is max(B, C - x + 1). For it to be greater than C, both B and C - x + 1 must be > C. But B ≤ C. So B can't be > C. So C - x + 1 > C → -x + 1 > 0 → x < 1. But x ≥ A ≥ 1. So this can't happen. Therefore, for all x, y_start ≤ C.\n\nThus, for each x, there are some y's contributing.\n\nSo for each x, the sum is sum_{s = lower_s}^x min(s, K).\n\nBut how to compute this sum quickly.\n\nLet me think of lower_s and upper_s (which is x). So the sum is over s from lower_s to x of min(s, K).\n\nLet me find the value of s where s crosses K.\n\nLet me denote threshold = K.\n\nSo if lower_s > threshold → then all terms are threshold. The count is (x - lower_s + 1) * threshold.\n\nIf upper_s < threshold → sum is sum from lower_s to x of s → which is (x*(x+1)/2) - ((lower_s - 1)*lower_s)/2.\n\nElse, split into two parts: sum from lower_s to threshold, and sum from threshold+1 to x.\n\nBut threshold is K. So:\n\nsum = sum_{s = lower_s}^{min(x, K)} s + max(0, x - K) * K.\n\nWait, no. If upper_s (which is x) is larger than K, then the first part is sum from lower_s to K, and the second part is (x - K) * K.\n\nBut if lower_s <= K and upper_s >= K.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nif lower_s > K: sum = (x - lower_s + 1) * K.\n\nelif upper_s <= K: sum = sum_{s=lower_s}^x s.\n\nelse: sum = sum_{s=lower_s}^K s + (x - K) * K.\n\nSo how do I compute these sums quickly?\n\nThe sum from a to b of integers is (b*(b+1)/2) - (a-1)*a/2.\n\nSo, for each x, compute lower_s, then compute the sum as per the above conditions.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute lower_s for each x.\n\nlower_s = x + y_start - C.\n\nBut y_start is max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nSo, let's compute y_start for a given x.\n\nLet me think of two cases for y_start:\n\nCase 1: C - x + 1 ≤ B → then y_start = B.\n\nCase 2: C - x + 1 > B → then y_start = C - x + 1.\n\nSo when does C - x + 1 ≤ B?\n\nRearranged:\n\nC - x + 1 ≤ B → x ≥ C - B + 1.\n\nSo for x ≥ (C - B + 1), then y_start = B.\n\nOtherwise, y_start = C - x + 1.\n\nSo for x in [A, B], we can split into two ranges:\n\n- x < (C - B + 1): then y_start = C - x + 1.\n\n- x >= (C - B + 1): then y_start = B.\n\nBut note that (C - B + 1) could be less than A. For example, if C = B, then (C - B + 1) = 1. So if A is 1, then x >= 1.\n\nSo for each x, we can compute whether it's in the first or second case.\n\nSo, for x in [A, B], we can split the calculation into two parts.\n\nLet me think of the entire problem as:\n\nTotal = sum_{x=A}^B [ sum_{y} ... ]\n\nWhich can be split into two parts:\n\nx in [A, x0) → y_start = C - x + 1.\n\nx in [x0, B] → y_start = B.\n\nWhere x0 is max(A, C - B + 1).\n\nWait, x0 is the value where x >= (C - B + 1). So x0 is C - B + 1. But since x must be >= A, the actual x0 for splitting is max(A, C - B + 1). Wait, no. The condition is x >= (C - B + 1) → so x0 is (C - B + 1). But if (C - B + 1) is less than A, then all x in [A, B] are in the second case.\n\nSo for example, if C - B + 1 is 3, and A is 4, then all x in [A, B] are >= 3, so they are in the second case.\n\nTherefore, the split is between x < (C - B + 1) and x >= (C - B + 1). But since x ranges from A to B, the split may not exist, or may have some parts.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, compute x0 = C - B + 1.\n\nThen, for x in [A, B], we can split into two ranges:\n\nRange 1: x < x0 → y_start = C - x + 1.\n\nRange 2: x >= x0 → y_start = B.\n\nBut note that x0 could be less than A, which would make Range 1 empty.\n\nSo, for each of these ranges, we can compute the sum.\n\nLet me first handle Range 2: x >= x0, y_start = B.\n\nFor these x, y ranges from B to C. So for each x in this range, the lower_s is x + B - C.\n\nBecause lower_s = x + y_start - C = x + B - C.\n\nAnd upper_s is x.\n\nSo for each x in this range, we need to compute the sum from lower_s to x of min(s, K).\n\nSimilarly, for Range 1, where x < x0, y_start is C - x + 1. Then lower_s is x + (C - x + 1) - C = x + C - x + 1 - C = 1. So lower_s is 1. And upper_s is x. So for each x in this range, the sum is sum from s=1 to x of min(s, K).\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because when y_start is C - x + 1, then lower_s is x + y_start - C = x + (C - x + 1) - C = 1. So for all x in Range 1, the lower_s is 1, and upper_s is x. So the sum for each x in Range 1 is sum_{s=1}^x min(s, K).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose x is in Range 1. For example, x=2, B=2, C=3. Then y_start = C -x +1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. Which is B. Wait, but earlier logic said that for x < x0, which is C - B + 1, then y_start is C -x +1. So in this case, C - B +1 is 3 - 2 +1 = 2. So x < x0 is x < 2. So x=1. Then y_start = C -x +1 = 3 -1 +1 = 3. Which is larger than B=2. So in that case, y_start is max(B, ...) = 3. But since B is 2 and C is 3, then y ranges from 3 to C=3. So y=3. Then lower_s is x + y_start - C = 1 + 3 - 3 = 1. Upper_s is x = 1. So sum from s=1 to 1 of min(s, K). Which is min(1, K). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for Range 1, the lower_s is 1, upper_s is x. So the sum is sum_{s=1}^x min(s, K).\n\nSo for each x in Range 1, this sum can be computed as follows:\n\nif x <= K: sum from 1 to x → x*(x+1)/2.\n\nelse: sum from 1 to K → K*(K+1)/2 + (x - K)*K.\n\nSo for Range 1, the sum for each x is this value.\n\nBut how many x's are in Range 1? Well, x ranges from A to min(B, x0 - 1). Because x < x0.\n\nSo the first step is to compute x0 = C - B + 1. Then, for x in [A, B], split into two parts:\n\nPart 1: x < x0 → compute sum as sum_{s=1}^x min(s, K).\n\nPart 2: x >= x0 → compute sum for lower_s = x + B - C, upper_s = x.\n\nSo, for Part 1, we can precompute for each x in [A, x1], where x1 is min(B, x0 - 1), the sum.\n\nBut how to compute this sum for all x in Part 1 efficiently?\n\nWell, since K is fixed, for each x in Part 1, the sum is:\n\nif x <= K → x*(x+1)//2\n\nelse → K*(K+1)//2 + (x - K) * K.\n\nSo, for Part 1, we can compute the number of x's that are <= K and those that are > K.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let me find the lower and upper bounds of x in Part 1. Let me call the x range for Part 1 as X1_low = A, X1_high = min(B, x0 - 1).\n\nIf X1_low > X1_high, then Part 1 is empty.\n\nSo for Part 1:\n\ncount_x1 = X1_high - X1_low + 1.\n\nWithin this range, the x's can be split into those where x <= K and x > K.\n\nLet me find the threshold_x = min(K, X1_high).\n\nSo for x in [X1_low, threshold_x], sum is x*(x+1)//2.\n\nFor x in [threshold_x + 1, X1_high], sum is K*(K+1)//2 + (x - K)*K.\n\nSo the total sum for Part 1 is:\n\nsum_part1 = sum_{x = X1_low}^{threshold_x} x(x+1)/2 + sum_{x = threshold_x + 1}^{X1_high} [K*(K+1)/2 + K*(x - K)].\n\nBut how to compute these sums quickly?\n\nThe first sum is the sum of triangular numbers from X1_low to threshold_x. The second sum can be broken down into two parts: the constant term and the linear term.\n\nBut calculating this for large ranges could be done using formulas.\n\nSimilarly for Part 2, which is more complex.\n\nNow, moving on to Part 2: x ranges from x2_low to x2_high, where x2_low = max(A, x0), and x2_high = B. Again, if x2_low > x2_high, Part 2 is empty.\n\nFor each x in this range, the lower_s is x + B - C. Let me denote that as L = x + B - C. Upper_s is x.\n\nSo for each x, the sum is sum_{s = L}^x min(s, K).\n\nWhich depends on L and x. So for each x, we need to compute this sum.\n\nBut how to compute this for all x in Part 2 efficiently.\n\nLet me think of for each x, L = x + B - C. Let me compute that.\n\nBut since x ranges from x2_low to x2_high, and B and C are fixed, L can be written as x + (B - C). Let me denote delta = B - C. So L = x + delta.\n\nBut since B ≤ C, delta is <= 0. So L = x + delta = x - (C - B).\n\nSo for example, if B = C, delta is 0. So L = x.\n\nBut for each x in Part 2, L = x + B - C.\n\nSo for each x, L can be calculated.\n\nBut then, for each x in Part 2, we have to compute the sum from s=L to x of min(s, K).\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps we can find for each x, the value of L and then compute the sum using the same approach as before.\n\nBut for a large number of x's, this would be O(N), which could be acceptable if N is up to 5e5.\n\nBut given that B can be up to 5e5, and for each x in Part 2, we have to process it, this could be O(5e5) steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo perhaps, for Part 2, we can loop through each x in x2_low to x2_high, compute L = x + B - C, then compute the sum for that x, and accumulate it.\n\nBut how to compute this sum for each x?\n\nLet me write a helper function that, given L and U (where U = x), computes sum_{s = L}^U min(s, K).\n\nAs discussed earlier, this can be done with:\n\nif U < L: return 0 (but since L is x + B - C and U is x, and B <= C, delta is B - C <= 0. So L = x + delta = x - (C - B). Since C - B >= 0, L could be less than x. For example, if B = C, then delta is 0, L = x. So L <= U (since U is x). So L is always <= U.\n\nSo for each x, L <= U.\n\nSo the helper function is:\n\ndef compute_sum(L, U, K):\n\n    if U < L:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if L > K:\n\n        return (U - L + 1) * K\n\n    elif U <= K:\n\n        return (U * (U + 1) // 2) - ((L - 1) * L // 2)\n\n    else:\n\n        # sum from L to K, plus (U - K) * K\n\n        sum_part1 = (K * (K + 1) // 2) - ((L - 1) * L // 2)\n\n        sum_part2 = (U - K) * K\n\n        return sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nSo for each x in Part 2, we can compute L = x + B - C, U = x, then call this function and accumulate the result.\n\nSo putting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute K = D - C + 1. If K is zero (but since C <= D, K is at least 1).\n\n2. Compute x0 = C - B + 1.\n\n3. Split the x's into Part 1 and Part 2.\n\n   Part 1: x ranges from A to min(B, x0 - 1). Let's call this X1_low = A, X1_high = min(B, x0 - 1).\n\n   Part 2: x ranges from max(A, x0) to B. Let's call this X2_low = max(A, x0), X2_high = B.\n\n4. For Part 1:\n\n   If X1_low > X1_high: nothing to add.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Compute threshold_x = min(K, X1_high).\n\n      sum_part1_a = sum_{x = X1_low}^{threshold_x} x*(x+1)//2.\n\n      sum_part1_b = sum_{x = threshold_x + 1}^{X1_high} [K*(K+1)//2 + K*(x - K)].\n\n      total_part1 = sum_part1_a + sum_part1_b.\n\n5. For Part 2:\n\n   For each x in X2_low to X2_high:\n\n      L = x + B - C\n\n      U = x\n\n      compute the sum for this x using the helper function.\n\n      add to total_part2.\n\n6. The total answer is total_part1 + total_part2.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute sum_part1_a and sum_part1_b efficiently.\n\nLet me think about sum_part1_a: sum_{x = a}^b x(x+1)/2.\n\nThis is equivalent to sum_{x=a}^b (x² + x)/2 = [sum x² + sum x ] / 2.\n\nThe sum of squares from a to b is (b(b+1)(2b+1)/6) - ((a-1)a(2a-1)/6).\n\nSimilarly, the sum of x from a to b is (b(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)a/2).\n\nSo, for sum_part1_a, we can compute this using these formulas.\n\nSimilarly, sum_part1_b is sum_{x = t+1}^h [ K*(K+1)/2 + K*(x - K) ].\n\nBreaking this down, each term is K*(K+1)/2 + K*x - K² = K*(K+1)/2 - K² + Kx = K*( (K+1)/2 - K ) + Kx = K*( (K+1 - 2K)/2 ) + Kx = K*( (1 - K)/2 ) + Kx.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to split the sum into two parts:\n\nsum_part1_b = (number_of_terms) * (K*(K+1)/2) + K * sum_{x = t+1}^h (x - K).\n\nBut the number_of_terms is h - (t+1) + 1 = h - t.\n\nSo:\n\nsum_part1_b = (h - t) * (K*(K+1)//2) + K * sum_{x = t+1}^h (x - K).\n\nThe sum (x - K) from x = t+1 to h is sum x from t+1 to h minus sum K from t+1 to h.\n\nWhich is [sum x] - K * (h - t).\n\nSo:\n\nsum_part1_b = (h - t) * (K*(K+1)//2) + K * [ (sum_x - K * (h - t)) ] \n\n= (h - t) * (K*(K+1)//2) + K*sum_x - K^2 * (h - t)\n\n= K*sum_x + (h - t) * [ (K*(K+1)/2) - K^2 ] \n\n= K*sum_x + (h - t) * K [ (K+1)/2 - K ]\n\n= K*sum_x + (h - t) * K [ ( - K + 1 ) / 2 ]\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute sum_{x} (x - K) as sum_x - K * (number_of_terms).\n\nSo for sum_part1_b:\n\nLet me compute sum_x = sum from x = t+1 to h of x.\n\nnumber_of_terms = h - t.\n\nsum_part1_b = (number_of_terms) * (K*(K+1)//2) + K * (sum_x - K * number_of_terms )\n\n= (number_of_terms) * (K*(K+1)//2) + K * sum_x - K^2 * number_of_terms.\n\nBut this can be simplified.\n\nBut regardless, for code purposes, we can compute sum_x using the formula for sum of consecutive integers.\n\nSo, in code, for sum_part1_a and sum_part1_b, we can use these formulas.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nBut first, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nK = D - C + 1 = 4 -3 +1 = 2.\n\nx0 = C - B + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.\n\nPart 1: x < x0 → x < 2. So x ranges from A=1 to min(B=2, x0-1=1) → X1_low=1, X1_high=1.\n\nSo Part 1 has x=1.\n\nFor x=1, which is in Part 1, the sum is sum_{s=1}^1 min(s, 2) → 1.\n\nSo sum_part1_a is for x from 1 to threshold_x. threshold_x is min(K=2, X1_high=1) → 1. So sum_part1_a is sum from 1 to 1 → 1*2/2 = 1. sum_part1_b is zero since threshold_x+1 is 2 which is > X1_high=1. So total_part1 = 1.\n\nPart 2: x ranges from max(A=1, x0=2) → 2 to B=2. So x=2.\n\nFor x=2, compute L = x + B - C = 2 + 2 -3 = 1. U = x = 2. So sum from s=1 to 2 of min(s, 2).\n\nWhich is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nSo total_part2 is 3. Total answer is 1 + 3 = 4 → which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: input '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nK = 5 - 2 +1 = 4.\n\nx0 = C - B + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.\n\nPart 1: x < x0 → x < 1. But A is 1. So X1_low = 1, X1_high = min(2, 0) → 0. So Part 1 is empty.\n\nPart 2: x ranges from max(1, 1) → 1 to 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\nL = 1 + 2 -2 = 1. U=1. sum from 1 to 1 of min(s,4) → 1.\n\nFor x=2:\n\nL = 2 + 2 -2 = 2. U=2. sum from 2 to 2 → 2. So total_part2 is 1+2=3 → which matches sample output 3.\n\nAnother sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nA=B=C=D=500000.\n\nK = D - C + 1 = 1.\n\nx0 = C - B + 1 = 500000 -500000 +1 = 1.\n\nPart 1: x < 1 → since A=500000, X1_low=500000 > x0-1=0. So Part 1 is empty.\n\nPart 2: x ranges from max(500000, 1) = 500000 to 500000.\n\nFor x=500000:\n\nL = x + B - C = 500000 + 500000 -500000 = 500000.\n\nU = x = 500000.\n\nsum from s=500000 to 500000 of min(s, 1). Since 500000 > 1, the sum is 1. So total_part2 is 1 → correct.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement all these steps.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nx0 = C - B + 1.\n\nCompute Part 1:\n\nX1_low = A\n\nX1_high = min(B, x0 - 1)\n\nif X1_low <= X1_high:\n\n   compute threshold_x = min(K, X1_high)\n\n   compute sum_part1_a as sum from X1_low to threshold_x of x(x+1)//2.\n\n   compute sum_part1_b as sum from threshold_x + 1 to X1_high of [ K*(K+1)//2 + K*(x - K) ].\n\nElse:\n\n   sum_part1 = 0.\n\nFor sum_part1_a, compute using formula for sum of x(x+1)/2 from a to b.\n\nSimilarly for sum_part1_b.\n\nThen, compute Part 2:\n\nX2_low = max(A, x0)\n\nX2_high = B\n\nif X2_low > X2_high:\n\n   sum_part2 = 0\n\nelse:\n\n   for x in X2_low ...

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key insight is that for a triangle with sides $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the triangle inequality requires $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the ranges for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can leverage the fact that $x \\leq y \\leq z$, so we only need to check $x + y > z$.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Directly iterating over all possible values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ would be too slow. Instead, we use mathematical insights to break down the problem into manageable parts.\n3. **Range Splitting**: Split the range of $x$ values into two parts based on a threshold derived from the given constraints.
