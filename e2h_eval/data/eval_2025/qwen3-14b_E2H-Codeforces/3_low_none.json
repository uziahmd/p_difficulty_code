Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is a straight line from 0 to l. Each lantern at position ai can light up points within distance d. So, the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on the street [0, l] is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, the key idea is to find the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns, but also considering the ends of the street. Because the lanterns might not cover the very start or end of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is important. Similarly for the last lantern and the end at l.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in order.\n2. Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. That's one candidate for max gap.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to l. Another candidate.\n4. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum of these gaps divided by two would be the required d for that gap. Because if two lanterns are s units apart, the minimal d needed to cover the gap between them is s/2. Because the light from each lantern would cover half of the gap. For example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then each needs to cover 2 units. So the maximum of all these gaps divided by two would be the answer.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nLet me think. Suppose there are two lanterns at positions x and y (x < y). The maximum distance between them is y - x. The middle point between them is at (x + y)/2. The distance from x to that point is (y - x)/2. So, if the lanterns have radius d, then to cover the entire area between them, d must be at least (y - x)/2. Otherwise, there's a gap in the middle.\n\nSo, the maximum of all those (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2 is a candidate for d. Also, the first and last parts.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial gap between 0 and the first lantern. That's a candidate.\n- Compute the gap between last lantern and l. Another candidate.\n- For each consecutive pair in the sorted array, compute the gap between them. Divide by 2, and compare with the current maximum.\n- The overall maximum among all these candidates is the minimal required d.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting the lantern positions: 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCheck the initial gap: 0 to first lantern is 0, since the first lantern is at 0. So that's 0. The last lantern is at 15, which is the end of the street. So the gap there is 0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n5-3 = 2 → 1.0\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5. So that's correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 5\n2 5\n\nSorted positions: 2,5.\n\nInitial gap is 2 - 0 = 2. So candidate is 2. The last gap is 5 -5 = 0. Then between 2 and 5: 3 units. Divided by 2 is 1.5. The maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.0.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the lantern positions.\n\nCompute the maximum between:\n\n- the first lantern's position (since 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0)\n- the last lantern's position (l - a[-1])\n- and the maximum (a[i] - a[i-1])/2 for all i from 1 to n-1.\n\nWait, no. Wait:\n\nWait the first lantern's position is a[0], so the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. But if",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and considering the edges of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Edge Cases**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the maximum radius.\n3. **Calculate Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them and determine the radius needed to cover this gap, which is half the gap size.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required minimum radius is the maximum value among the edge distances and the gaps between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first part\n    first_gap = a[0] - 0\n    max_d = first_gap\n    \n    # Check the last part\n    last_gap = l - a[-1]\n    if last_gap > max_d:\n        max_d = last_gap\n    \n    # Check the gaps between lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Edge Cases**: The initial and final gaps from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns are critical because these areas might not be covered by any lantern otherwise.\n- **Consecutive Gaps**: By dividing each gap between consecutive lanterns by two, we ensure that the radius is sufficient to cover the entire segment between two lanterns, as the worst-case scenario is a point exactly halfway between two lanterns.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), making it suitable for the given constraints.",
