He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b can be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, handling the case when b is 'R' which means Roman numerals.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has a and b (or R), second line has c as a string in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n3. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be a normal base (like 2, 16) or Roman numerals (if b is R).\n\nSo the main steps are converting from base a to decimal, then converting from decimal to base b (with Roman handling).\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. Since c can be up to 10^3 characters long, but a can be up to 25. For example, if a is 2 and c is 111...111 (1000 digits), then converting that to decimal would be a very large number. However, the note says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is <= 3000 in decimal. Otherwise, it's up to 1e15. So for the cases where we need to convert to Roman, the decimal value is manageable. But for other cases, we need to handle very large numbers. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not a problem.\n\nBut how to convert the string c (in base a) to decimal?\n\nFor example, if c is \"A\" in base 12, then it's 10 in decimal. So the digits can include letters? Wait, the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. But how are digits represented? For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F? Or does the problem use letters for digits above 9?\n\nWait, looking at the note: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" So yes, for bases higher than 10, the digits are 0-9 followed by letters A, B, etc. So the input c may have letters in it if the base a is higher than 10.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 12, then the digits can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). So the input string c can contain letters. However, the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. So, when converting from base a to decimal, I need to process each character of the string c as a digit in base a, possibly with letters.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the string c into a decimal integer. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nFor example, for the input \"A\" in base 12: the value is 10 in decimal. For \"10\" in base 16, it's 16 in decimal. For \"1111001\" in base 2, it's 121 in decimal.\n\nSo the function to convert the string c (base a) to decimal would be:\n\nInitialize a variable value = 0.\n\nFor each character in the string:\n\n   value = value * a + digit_value\n\nWhere digit_value is the value of the character. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc.\n\nBut how to handle letters in the input string? For example, the input c may have letters in it. So I need to convert each character to its corresponding value.\n\nSo for each character in the string, we can check if it's a digit or a letter. For example, '0'-'9' are 0-9, 'A'-'Z' are 10-35 (but since a is up to 25, the maximum digit is 24, so letters up to Y? Well, the problem says that the input is valid, so the digits in c are valid for base a.\n\nSo, for example, for a given character, say 'A', its value is 10. So for the conversion, we can process each character as follows:\n\ndigit_value = int(c_char) if it's a digit, else ord(c_char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nBut wait, the input may have lowercase letters? Probably not. The problem says that the input is given as a string, but in the examples, like the third input is '5 R\\n4', which is base 5, and the input is 4. So perhaps the input c is in uppercase letters? Or maybe the problem allows lowercase letters? The problem says that the input may contain leading zeros but the length is up to 10^3. However, the problem says that for the case when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But the input c is given in base a, and the problem says that the input is correct. So for the conversion from base a to decimal, we can assume that all characters in the input are valid digits for base a.\n\nSo, for the code, the function to convert the string c to decimal is:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    value = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        value = value * base + digit\n\n    return value\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? The problem says that c may have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, '001' in base 2 is 1 in decimal. The code will handle that correctly.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then we need to convert it to base b. But b can be a number (2-25) or 'R' for Roman numerals.\n\nSo, the second part is converting the decimal value to base b, which can be either a normal base or Roman numerals.\n\nLet's split this into two cases:\n\nCase 1: b is not 'R'. So convert decimal to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z as needed.\n\nCase 2: b is 'R'. Convert decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nSo first, let's handle case 1: converting decimal to base b.\n\nFor example, if the decimal value is 10 and base is 16, the output is 'A'.\n\nThe code for this is similar to the reverse of the first step.\n\nBut how to handle zero? The problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the input is not zero. However, for other cases, the input can be zero. Wait, the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer. So for example, if c is '0' in base a, then converting to decimal is 0. Then, when converting to base b, the output should be '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the input is not zero. So in that case, we don't have to handle zero for Roman numerals.\n\nSo, for case 1, when converting decimal to base b:\n\nWe need to handle zero. For example, if the value is zero, output is '0'.\n\nElse, we need to generate the digits in base b, then convert them to the appropriate characters (digits and letters).\n\nSo, for example, the code could be:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        remainder = n % base\n\n        digits.append(remainder)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    # digits are reversed, since we get least significant digit first\n\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    # Now convert each digit to its representation\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for d in digits:\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            res += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    return res\n\nWait, but what if the original number is zero? The code returns '0'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, when the input is converted to decimal, it's possible to have zero. For example, if the input is '0' in base a, then output is '0' in base b (unless b is R, but in that case, the input is guaranteed not to be zero).\n\nBut in the problem statement, the note says that when Roman numerals are included, the number is not zero. So in that case, when converting to Roman, the input is non-zero.\n\nSo, the code for case 1 seems okay.\n\nNow, for case 2: converting decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nThe problem says that Roman numerals are based on certain symbols. So, we need to generate the Roman numeral for the given number.\n\nThe standard approach for converting to Roman numerals is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For example, 1000 is 'M', 900 is 'CM', 500 is 'D', etc.\n\nSo the list would be:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the symbol.\n\nSo the code for converting decimal to Roman would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n\n    return res\n\nBut this works for numbers up to 3999. The problem note says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is <= 3000. So this code is acceptable.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nRead the input. The first line is a and b. But b can be 'R'.\n\nSo the first line can be split into two parts. For example, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich would be a=10, b=2.\n\nAnother sample input is '16 R\\n5', which is a=16, b='R'.\n\nSo the code needs to read the first line as a and b, where b can be a number (string) or 'R'.\n\nSo in Python, the first line can be split into two parts. For example:\n\nline1 = input().split()\n\na = int(line1[0])\n\nb = line1[1]\n\nThen, the second line is the string c.\n\nOnce we have a, b, and c, we proceed to convert c to decimal, then convert to base b.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the input lines. But since the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (or R). The next line contains c.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows multiple test cases, but in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nOutput:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWait, but this seems like multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual input is one test case per run. Wait, the problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple lines, but perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. For example, the sample input is given as multiple lines, but perhaps in the actual code, the code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement's sample input, the input is given as a list of test cases, but perhaps that's just a way to show multiple examples. However, the actual code is supposed to read one test case. Because the problem says that the input is given as per the input description.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the code must read two lines: the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the sample input is probably formatted as multiple test cases for the purpose of showing the examples. But the actual code must process one test case per run.\n\nWait, but the sample input is given as a list of input lines, but the code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of input lines, but the output is a list of outputs. So perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is presented as multiple test cases in the same input. For example, the sample input is:\n\nIn the first line, there are multiple test cases, each with their own lines. But that's not possible. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the input is two lines. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. For example, the first sample input line is '10 2\\n1', which is two lines (the first line is '10 2', the second line is '1'). Then the next test case is '16 R\\n5', etc. So the sample input is multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. But the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, the next line contains c. Which suggests that the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the sample shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code must read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases. But how?\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of input lines. For example, the first input is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich represents 5 test cases. Each test case is two lines. So the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. Which implies that the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects the code to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut why does the problem's input description not mention that? Maybe the problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases, but the problem statement's input description is for a single test case. But the sample shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to determine that? Well, the sample input shows that each test case is two lines. So the code should read lines in pairs: first line is a and b, second line is c. So the code should process multiple test cases until there's no more input.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, it's not clear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has five test cases, and the output has five entries.\n\nTherefore, the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to read them in Python?\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via sys.stdin. So perhaps the code should read all lines, split them into pairs of two lines, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle the input correctly?\n\nFor example, the input may be given as:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\n...\n\nEach test case is two lines. So the code can read all lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to read them?\n\nIn Python, the standard way is to read all lines, then iterate through them two at a time.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition problems, sometimes the input is read via input() or sys.stdin. So perhaps the code should read until EOF, processing two lines per test case.\n\nBut for example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2', the second line is '1'; then the third line is '16 R', the fourth line is '5', etc.\n\nSo the code can read lines as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen process lines in pairs: for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n   process lines[i] and lines[i+1]\n\nBut how to handle cases where the number of lines is odd? According to the problem statement, each test case has two lines, so the input will have even number of lines.\n\nSo, the code would process lines in pairs.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a pair of lines. So the code must process each pair as a separate test case.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, split into pairs, for each pair:\n\n   process the first line as a and b, second line as c.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, when you read from stdin, you can read all lines, then process them.\n\nBut for the purpose of the problem, the code must read from stdin, and output the correct answers for each test case.\n\nNow, considering that, the code would look like:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n        line1 = lines[i].strip()\n\n        line2 = lines[i+1].strip()\n\n        a_str, b = line1.split()\n\n        a = int(a_str)\n\n        c = line2\n\n        # process this test case\n\n        # convert c from base a to decimal\n\n        # then convert to base b (or Roman)\n\n        # print the result\n\nBut then, how to handle the case where the input is given with multiple test cases. For example, the sample input.\n\nSo, the code would need to process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nNow, the code for converting c to decimal.\n\nBut for the code, the function to convert c to decimal is:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    value = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            digit = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        value = value * base + digit\n\n    return value\n\nBut what if the input c is '0'? For example, if c is '0' in base a, then the decimal is 0. Which is handled correctly.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then we need to convert to base b.\n\nBut for the case where b is 'R', we need to convert to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, the code for each test case:\n\ndecimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n\nif b == 'R':\n\n    roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n\n    print(roman)\n\nelse:\n\n    converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, int(b))\n\n    print(converted)\n\nBut then, the functions decimal_to_base and decimal_to_roman need to be written.\n\nNow, the decimal_to_base function.\n\nBut what about leading zeros? The problem says to omit leading zeros. For example, if the converted number is zero, output '0'. Otherwise, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nBut the function decimal_to_base returns the correct digits. For example, if the number is zero, returns '0'. Otherwise, the digits are generated without leading zeros.\n\nSo the code for decimal_to_base is as discussed earlier.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c=1.\n\nConvert c (which is 1 in base 10) to decimal: 1. Convert to base 2: 1. Output is '1'.\n\nSample Output is '1'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b=R, c=5. The decimal value is 5. Convert to Roman: V. Output 'V'.\n\nThird test case: a=5, b=R, c=4. decimal value is 4. Roman is IV.\n\nFourth test case: a=2, b=2, c=1111001. Convert to decimal: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Convert to base 2: 1111001. Output is same as input. So output is '1111001'.\n\nFifth test case: a=12, b=13, c=A. The decimal value is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. Output is 'A'.\n\nSo the code would handle these correctly.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: c is zero. But only when b is not R. For example, a=10, b=2, c=0. The decimal is 0. Output is '0'.\n\nEdge case 2: when converting to base b which is higher than 10. For example, decimal 10 in base 16 is 'A'.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base 1? Wait, but the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the input for a and b is 2<=a, b <=25. Except for b which can be R. So the code doesn't have to handle base 1.\n\nSo the code can safely assume that when converting to base b (not R), the base is between 2 and 25.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting a number to a base that requires letters. For example, decimal 10 in base 11 is 'A'.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nImplementing the to_decimal function.\n\nBut what about when the input c is empty? The problem says that c is a non-negative integer, and its length doesn't exceed 10^3. But the input is guaranteed to be valid. So no empty string.\n\nNow, code for to_decimal.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code for the functions.\n\nBut in code, the functions can be inside the main function, or written as helper functions.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the functions:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    value = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            digit = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        value = value * base + digit\n\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        remainder = n % base\n\n        digits.append(remainder)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for d in digits:\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            res += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n\n        while n >= value:\n\n            res += symbol\n\n            n -= value\n\n    return res\n\nNow, in the code:\n\nRead each test case.\n\nBut for the code, the code must read from stdin, process each pair of lines, and output the answer.\n\nBut what about leading zeros in the output? For example, when converting to base b, the code returns the correct digits without leading zeros. For example, decimal_to_base(0) returns '0'. For other cases, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nBut the problem says to omit leading zeros. For example, if the converted number is 0, output '0'. For other numbers, leading zeros are not present.\n\nThe function decimal_to_base returns the correct result. For example, if the number is 10 in base 16, returns 'A'.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut how to handle the case when the input is '0' in base a, and converting to base b. For example, the code returns '0'.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        line1 = lines[i].strip()\n        line2 = lines[i+1].strip()\n        # parse line1 into a and b\n        a_str, b = line1.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        c = line2\n        # convert c to decimal\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c, a)\n        # process based on b\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros in the output? For example, when converting to base 2, the code returns the correct digits without leading zeros. For example, if the decimal value is 0, returns '0'. Otherwise, the code generates digits in the correct order.\n\nBut what about when the input is zero and the output is zero? For example, in the case where a is 10, c is '0', and b is 2, then the output is '0'.\n\nYes, the code handles that.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nTest case 1: a=10, b=2, c=1 → decimal is 1 → converted to base 2 is '1'.\n\nSample Output is '1'.\n\nTest case 2: a=16, b=R, c=5 → decimal is 5 → Roman is 'V'.\n\nTest case 3: a=5, b=R, c=4 → decimal is 4 → Roman is 'IV'.\n\nTest case 4: a=2, b=2, c=1111001 → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nTest case 5: a=12, b=13, c=A → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: when the input is '0' in base 10 and b is 10. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother test case: converting 0 to base 16 → '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting 10 to base 16 → 'A'.\n\nAnother case: converting 30 to base 16 → '1E'.\n\nWhat about when converting to base 1? Well, according to the problem statement, the input a and b are between 2 and 25, so the code doesn't have to handle base 1.\n\nNow, what about when the input c is '0' and b is R? According to the problem statement, in this case, the input is guaranteed not to be zero when Roman is involved. So the code doesn't need to handle that case.\n\nBut the code will crash if decimal_val is zero and b is R. However, according to the problem statement, this case is not possible.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat about when the input c is empty? The problem says that it's a non-negative integer, so the input is valid. So no empty string.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the input c is '0' and the output is '0' for base b.\n\nAnother possible case: when converting to base 10, the code returns the correct digits.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nSo the final code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base, which could be a standard base (2-25) or Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to a decimal integer and then converting that decimal integer to the target base or Roman numeral representation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in a specific base. We first convert this number to its decimal (base 10) equivalent. This conversion handles digits beyond 9 using letters (A-Z) for bases greater than 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base is a standard base or Roman numerals, we perform the appropriate conversion:\n   - **Standard Bases**: Convert the decimal number to the target base using standard digit representation (0-9 and A-Z for bases greater than 10).\n   - **Roman Numerals**: Convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        line1 = lines[i].strip()\n        line2 = lines[i+1].strip()\n        a_str, b = line1.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        c = line2\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as multiple lines, each pair of lines representing a test case. The first line contains the original base and the target base (or 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number in the original base.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The `to_decimal` function converts the input number from its original base to a decimal integer by iterating through each digit and computing its value.\n3. **Base Conversion**: The `decimal_to_base` function converts the decimal integer to the target base, handling digits beyond 9 by using letters (A-Z) for bases greater than 10.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The `decimal_to_roman` function converts the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, subtracting the largest possible values iteratively to construct the Roman numeral string.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion between different bases and Roman numerals, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for the given constraints.",
