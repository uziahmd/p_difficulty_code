The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., loses a round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The key points are:\n\n- Nikephoros's moves are cyclic through his sequence A. So for round i (starting from 0?), he uses A[i % m], where m is the length of A.\n- Similarly, Polycarpus uses B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n- For each round, determine who wins. If it's a draw, nothing. Otherwise, the loser gets a spot. So for each round, we need to check if Nikephoros's move beats Polycarpus's, or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round one by one. So simulating each round directly is impossible. We need an efficient approach.\n\nSo the plan is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, compute the number of wins in each cycle, and then multiply by the number of full cycles and add the remainder.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's consider that the sequences A and B are periodic. So the combination of their moves will have a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, and the pattern of moves will repeat.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call this period_length.\n2. For each round in 0 to period_length - 1, calculate the moves of A and B, determine the outcome, and count how many times each player loses in this period.\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period_length.\n4. The remaining rounds after full periods is remainder = n % period_length.\n5. Multiply the counts per period by total_periods, and add the counts from the first 'remainder' rounds of the next period.\n\nBut wait, what's the maximum possible period_length? Since m and k can be up to 1000, their LCM could be up to 1000*1000 = 1e6. Which is manageable because for each period_length, we can process all the rounds once.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute LCM of m and k.\n- For each of the period_length rounds, compute the moves for A and B, check the outcome, and accumulate the number of losses for each player.\n- Then, multiply these counts by the number of full periods (total_periods), and add the counts from the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut how do I compute the LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python's math module has gcd, but for Python versions before 3.5, perhaps I need to implement it. However, since the problem says to write code in Python, assuming that math.gcd is available, but note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which they are here.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n, then read A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nNow, for each i in 0 to period_length - 1:\n\n- a_move = A[i % m]\n- b_move = B[i % k]\n- determine outcome between a_move and b_move.\n\nFor each such outcome, increment counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nOnce we have the counts per period (say, per_period_nik, per_period_poly), then:\n\ntotal_periods = n // period_length\n\nremainder_rounds = n % period_length\n\nThen, total_nik = total_periods * per_period_nik + count_remainder_nik\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nBut how to compute the count_remainder_nik and count_remainder_poly? For the first remainder_rounds rounds in the period.\n\nSo, for that, we can precompute a list of the outcomes for each round in the period. Then, for the remainder_rounds, sum the first 'remainder_rounds' entries.\n\nBut for large period_length (up to 1e6), even storing this list is acceptable. Because 1e6 elements is manageable in memory.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nNow, how to compute the outcome between two moves.\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b, returns who wins, or if it's a draw.\n\nFor example:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a is R and b is S) or (a is S and b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results for up to 2 billion rounds without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Patterns**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The combined pattern of their moves will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: Simulate one full period of moves (up to the LCM length) to count how many times each player loses in this period.\n4. **Scale Up**: Use the counts from one period to compute the total losses for the entire number of rounds by considering the number of full periods and the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)  # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)  # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // gcd_val\n    \n    # Precompute the outcomes for each round in one period\n    nik_spots = 0\n    poly_spots = 0\n    period_results = []\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = get_outcome(a_move, b_move)\n        nik_spots += nik\n        poly_spots += poly\n        period_results.append((nik, poly))\n    \n    total_periods = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nik = total_periods * nik_spots\n    total_poly = total_periods * poly_spots\n    \n    # Add the remainder part\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        total_nik += period_results[i][0]\n        total_poly += period_results[i][1]\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is calculated to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within one period (determined by the LCM), the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome of each round is recorded.\n4. **Counting Losses**: The total number of losses for each player in one period is computed. This is then scaled up by the number of full periods in the total number of rounds.\n5. **Handling Remaining Rounds**: Any remaining rounds after the full periods are processed by examining the first few rounds of the next period.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating pattern of moves, ensuring the solution is both optimal and scalable.",
