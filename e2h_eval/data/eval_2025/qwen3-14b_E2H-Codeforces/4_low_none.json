The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. The sequences can be up to 1000 characters each. But n can be as big as 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round step by step is impossible because it would take O(n) time, which is not feasible for n up to 2e9. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nThe key here is to find patterns or cycles that repeat so that we can calculate the number of losses in bulk.\n\nLet me think about how the moves are determined. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo for each round, we can compute the moves of both players. Then determine who wins, if anyone.\n\nBut since n is up to 2e9, we can't check each round individually. So we need to find the number of rounds where each player loses, but in a way that uses the periodicity of the sequences.\n\nLet me think about the total number of possible unique pairs of moves. Since each sequence repeats every m and k steps, respectively, the combined pattern will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because LCM(m, k) is the least common multiple of m and k. Let's denote L = LCM(m, k). So after every L rounds, the same sequence of moves repeats.\n\nSo the idea is to calculate the number of losses in one full cycle of L rounds, then multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the number of losses in the remaining rounds (n mod L).\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute L = LCM(m, k). Since m and k can be up to 1000, L can be up to 1e6 (since LCM(1000, 1000) is 1000). Wait, 1000 and 1000 have LCM 1000. But for m=1000 and k=999, LCM could be 999000. So for m and k up to 1000, LCM can be up to 1e6 (approx). Which is manageable because even if L is up to 1e6, processing each of those rounds once is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the number of full cycles (full_cycles) = n // L\n\n- Find the number of remaining rounds (remainder) = n % L\n\n- For each full cycle, compute the number of times Nikephoros loses (a_loss) and Polycarpus loses (b_loss) in one L rounds.\n\n- Multiply a_loss * full_cycles and b_loss * full_cycles.\n\n- Then process the first 'remainder' rounds of the next cycle, adding to the counts.\n\nSo the total is (full_cycles * a_loss + remainder_a) and (full_cycles * b_loss + remainder_b).\n\nNow, how to compute the a_loss and b_loss for one L rounds?\n\nWell, for each of the L rounds, we can compute the moves of A and B, then determine who wins, and count accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute L? Well, LCM(m, k) can be calculated using the formula: LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need to compute the GCD first.\n\nSo first, compute the GCD of m and k. Then compute LCM.\n\nNow, for the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B. Then m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute the number of full cycles and remainder.\n\nNow, for the first part, compute the number of losses in one L rounds.\n\nBut for that, I need to loop over each of the L rounds, get the moves of A and B, and check who wins.\n\nBut L can be up to 1e6, which is acceptable. Because 1e6 operations are manageable.\n\nOnce we have the total per cycle, multiply by full_cycles.\n\nThen for the remainder, process each of the first 'remainder' rounds, again checking the moves and adding to the counts.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nCompute the per_cycle_a_loss and per_cycle_b_loss.\n\nThen total_a = full_cycles * per_cycle_a",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a large number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use the periodicity of the sequences to optimize our solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Periodicity**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The combined sequence of moves repeats every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute results for one full cycle and then scale it up.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the length of one full cycle of combined moves.\n3. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Determine how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds and the remaining rounds after these full cycles.\n4. **Loss Counting**: For each round in a full cycle, determine the number of losses for each player. Multiply this by the number of full cycles and add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // gcd_val\n    \n    # Function to compute the number of losses in a given number of rounds\n    def compute_losses(num_rounds):\n        a_loss = 0\n        b_loss = 0\n        for i in range(num_rounds):\n            a_idx = i % m\n            b_idx = i % k\n            a_move = A[a_idx]\n            b_move = B[b_idx]\n            if a_move == b_move:\n                continue\n            # Determine winner\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n                # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n                b_loss += 1\n            else:\n                # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n                a_loss += 1\n        return a_loss, b_loss\n    \n    # Compute for one full cycle\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    per_cycle_a, per_cycle_b = compute_losses(lcm)\n    \n    # Compute total from full cycles\n    total_a = full_cycles * per_cycle_a\n    total_b = full_cycles * per_cycle_b\n    \n    # Add the remainder rounds\n    rem_a, rem_b = compute_losses(remainder)\n    total_a += rem_a\n    total_b += rem_b\n    \n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read, including the number of rounds and the sequences of moves for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is computed to determine the cycle length.\n3. **Loss Calculation Function**: This function computes the number of losses for a given number of rounds by iterating through each round, determining the moves, and checking who wins.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder Handling**: The total number of full cycles and remaining rounds are calculated. The losses from one full cycle are multiplied by the number of full cycles, and the remaining rounds are processed separately.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses for each player is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
