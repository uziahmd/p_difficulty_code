Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving through a common border between blocks. The blocks are regions divided by infinite roads (lines) on a plane.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a block. Each block is a region separated by the roads. The key thing is that moving between blocks requires that they share a common boundary segment (not just a point). So, two blocks are adjacent if their shared boundary is a line segment (or part of a line), which implies that they are separated by exactly one road. Wait, but since roads are lines, each road divides the plane into two parts. So, each block is adjacent to other blocks across these roads.\n\nBut how do we model the blocks and their adjacency? It seems like the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent (i.e., share a common boundary). Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut the challenge is how to represent the blocks and determine adjacency without explicitly enumerating all possible regions, which is impossible given that there are n roads (up to 300), leading to potentially O(2^n) regions. That's way too big for any brute force approach.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way. Let's think about the problem differently. Since each step moves across a road, perhaps the number of steps is related to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The problem resembles a BFS traversal where each state is determined by the position relative to each road. Because each road divides the plane into two halves, the position of a point (home or university) relative to each road can be represented as a binary value (positive or negative side of the line). However, since there are n roads, the total number of possible states would be 2^n, which for n=300 is way too big. But 2^300 is astronomically large. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe we don't need to track all possible regions. Instead, perhaps the minimal steps can be determined by considering the parity of the number of roads that separate the home and university. But that might not be directly applicable.\n\nWait, think about the problem in terms of the dual graph. Each region is a node, and edges connect regions that are adjacent. But again, building this graph isn't feasible for large n.\n\nAlternative approach: Since moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, each step corresponds to crossing exactly one road. The minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home to the university. However, this isn't necessarily correct because crossing a road once may take you to a different region, but perhaps there's a way to cross multiple roads in a way that leads to the target.\n\nWait, but the minimal steps would correspond to the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university. However, how can we model that?\n\nLet me think of the home and university positions. For each road, the home is on one side of the line, and the university is on the other side. If that's the case, then the two points are separated by that road. So, if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road would be part of the path. However, how does that translate into steps?\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be thought of as a graph where each node is a region, and edges exist between regions that are separated by a single road. But again, the problem is how to represent regions.\n\nAnother angle: Since the home and university are not on any road, their positions are fixed. Let's think of the problem as a BFS where each state is determined by the set of roads that separate the current block from the home. Wait, perhaps not. But maybe we can model the problem based on the parity of the number of roads that separate the current position from the home.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by BFS and hypercube graphs. For each road, the home is either on one side or the other. Similarly for the university. Suppose we model each region by the signs of the equations a_i x + b_i y + c_i. For each road i, the sign of (a_i x + b_i y + c_i) determines which side of the road the point is on. So, for the home point, we can compute for each road whether it's positive or negative. Similarly for the university.\n\nNow, two regions (blocks) are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if two regions differ in exactly one road, that means they are separated by that road, and hence share a common boundary. If they differ in more than one road, then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we model the blocks as nodes in a graph where each node is defined by the relative position (sign) of a point with respect to each road. The key insight is that two blocks are adjacent if their corresponding sign vectors differ in exactly one road.
