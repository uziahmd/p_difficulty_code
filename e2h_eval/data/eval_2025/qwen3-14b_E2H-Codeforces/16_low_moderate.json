Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads in a plane. The home and university are each in their own blocks. We need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home's block to university's block. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block if they share a nonzero boundary segment. \n\nThe key here is to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n roads, the number of blocks can be huge, but maybe we don't need to represent all of them. Instead, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between adjacent blocks. Then, perform BFS from the home block to find the shortest path to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Well, since each block can be identified by the sign of the equations of the roads. For example, each road divides the plane into two regions. For each road, the block is on one side or the other. So, for each road, the block can be represented by a binary value (like +1 or -1) indicating which side of the line it's on. However, with n roads, there are 2^n possible combinations, which is way too big for n=300. That's impossible.\n\nWait, but that approach isn't feasible for n=300. So there must be another way. Let's think again.\n\nAnother idea: The movement between blocks is allowed when two blocks share a common border. That means that two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road. Because when you cross a road, you move into a different block. Wait, no. Because crossing a road would take you from one block to another. But if two blocks are separated by multiple roads, then maybe they are not adjacent. But how can we model adjacency?\n\nAlternatively, think of each block as being uniquely determined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road i, the block is on one side of the line. So, the sign of a_i x + b_i y + c_i. Since the home and university are not on any road, their positions will have a definite sign for each road.\n\nSo, the home's position defines a signature: for each road, compute the value of a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. Since the home is not on the road, this value is non-zero. So for each road, we can note whether it's positive or negative. Similarly for the university.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimal number of steps between the home's signature and the university's signature, where each step changes exactly one sign (since moving across a road changes the sign of exactly one equation). Wait, but that's only if the two blocks are separated by exactly one road. However, that's not necessarily true. Because two blocks can be separated by multiple roads. But how do their signatures differ?\n\nWait, two adjacent blocks must differ by exactly one road. Because if you cross a road, you change the sign of exactly that road's equation. So, the adjacency between blocks is equivalent to their signatures differing in exactly one bit. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of bit flips required to transform the home's signature into the university's signature, where each flip corresponds to changing the sign of a single road. However, this is only true if the two signatures differ in exactly one bit. But that's not the case. Because, suppose two blocks are separated by multiple roads. Wait, but how can two blocks be adjacent? They must share a common border, which is a segment of a road. So, they must be separated by exactly one road. Hence, their signatures differ in exactly one bit. Therefore, the problem becomes similar to a graph where each node is a signature (a binary vector), and edges connect nodes that differ in exactly one bit. The minimal steps between the home and university is the Hamming distance between their signatures. Wait, but that can't be right. Because the Hamming distance is the number of differing bits. However, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance, since each step can flip one bit. But that would imply that the answer is the number of roads where the home and university have different signs. But that's not correct. Let's look at the sample input.\n\nLet's check the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\nHome is (1,1), University is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0, and 1x + 0y +0 = 0 → x=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFirst road: 0*1 + 1*1 +",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the Crazy Town problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a plane divided by infinite roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a nonzero boundary segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be reduced to determining the minimum number of sign changes needed to transform the signature of the home block into the signature of the university block. Each road divides the plane into two regions, and the position of a point relative to a road can be determined by evaluating the linear equation of the road at that point.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Each block can be represented by a binary signature where each bit indicates the side of the road (positive or negative) on which the block lies. Moving between adjacent blocks involves crossing one road, which flips exactly one bit in the signature.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We compute the signature for both the home and university positions. The minimum number of steps required is the Hamming distance between these two signatures, which is the number of differing bits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    home_sign = []\n    univ_sign = []\n    \n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        home_sign.append(1 if val_home > 0 else -1)\n        univ_sign.append(1 if val_univ > 0 else -1)\n    \n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_sign, univ_sign):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n    \n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home, university, and the equations of the roads.\n2. **Signature Calculation**: For each road, we determine the sign of the value obtained by substituting the home and university coordinates into the road's equation. This gives us a binary signature for both points.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is the Hamming distance between their signatures, which is the count of differing bits in their respective signatures.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result using simple arithmetic and comparison operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
