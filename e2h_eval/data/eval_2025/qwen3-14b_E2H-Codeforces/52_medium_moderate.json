Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every 'b' used candles, he can make a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn will become another used candle after burning.\n\nSo, the approach here is to calculate all possible hours by considering both the initial candles and the ones made from recycling.\n\nLet me think of the example given. For input 4 and 2:\n\nHe starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, he has 4 used candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new ones. So he uses those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 used candles. Again, he can make 2 / 2 = 1 new. That adds 1 hour. Now he has 1 used candle. Which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see:\n\nInitial 6: 6 hours. Then 6 used. 6/3=2 new. So 2 hours. Now 2 used. Can't make any more (since 2 < 3). Wait but wait, the sample output is 8. Wait 6+2=8? Oh right. But wait, the note says the second example's output is 8. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but what if after making the new candles, you can collect the used ones again?\n\nSo the process is:\n\nTotal hours starts as 0.\n\nWe have a current number of candles. Each time we burn them, add the count to the total. Then collect the used ones, and make new ones. Repeat until we can't make any more.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStart with a candles.\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nBut maybe it's better to track the current number of candles and the used ones.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is:\n\nInitially, we have 'a' candles. Each time we burn them, they become used. Then, we can make new candles from the used ones.\n\nBut the process is:\n\nEach time you burn a candle, it contributes 1 hour. Then, you can collect the used ones and make new ones.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\ntotal = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nused = 0\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nEvery time you light a candle, it burns for an hour. So, each time you have some number of candles, you can burn them all, which adds that number to the total hours. Then, you collect those same number of used candles. Then, you can make new candles from them.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nStart with a = 4, b = 2.\n\ntotal = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = 4\n\nburn them: total +=4 → 4. Now, used_candles =4.\n\nMake new: 4//2=2. So new_candles =2. Then, used_candles becomes 4 - (2 * 2) = 0? Or maybe, the used candles are converted into new ones. So, each time you make new candles, you take 'b' used ones to make 1 new. So, the number of new candles is (used_candles // b). Then, the remaining used candles after that is (used_candles % b).\n\nWait, but in the first step, after burning the initial 4, you have 4 used. Then you make 4//2=2 new. So now, you have 2 new candles. Then you burn those, adding 2 hours. Now, you have 2 used. Make 2//2=1 new. Burn that, add 1 hour. Now, you have 1 used. Can't make any more. So total is 4+2+1=7.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_used = 0\n\nBut maybe the way to model it is:\n\nWhile you have candles to burn:\n\n- burn all current candles. add to total.\n\n- collect the used ones (equal to the number of candles you just burned)\n\n- make new candles from the used ones: new_candles = used // b\n\n- the remaining used candles after making new is used % b.\n\nBut then, the new_candles become the next set of candles to burn.\n\nWait, but how do you track the used candles?\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each time you burn current_candles, you add that number to total_hours. Then, those current_candles become used_candles. Then, you can make new_candles from the used_candles. Then, the new_candles become the next current_candles. But the used_candles after that is (used_candles - new_candles * b) ?\n\nWait, no. Because for each new candle made, you need to take b used ones. So, the number of new candles is (used_candles // b). Then, the remaining used candles is (used_candles % b). But then, the new_candles are added to the current_candles?\n\nWait, no. Because the new candles are made from the used ones. So, after making new_candles, the used_candles are reduced by (new_candles * b), and the new_candles are added to the current_candles.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the new_candles are made from the used ones. So, once you make the new candles, you can burn them in the next step.\n\nSo, here's the process:\n\nInitially, current_candles = a.\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nBut maybe the process is:\n\nLoop:\n\n- burn all current_candles. Add current_candles to total_hours.\n\n- add current_candles to used_candles.\n\n- new_candles = used_candles // b\n\n- used_candles = used_candles % b + new_candles ?\n\nWait, no. Because the new_candles are made from the used_candles. So, when you make new_candles, you take (new_candles * b) used_candles and convert them into new_candles. So the remaining used_candles is (used_candles - new_candles * b). Then, the new_candles are added to the current_candles for the next iteration.\n\nWait, but the new_candles are not used yet. So, the next step is to have current_candles = new_candles, and used_candles is the leftover from previous step.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nWe have a variable called 'current' which is the number of candles we can burn now.\n\nInitially, current = a.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nused = 0\n\nBut perhaps the steps are:\n\nWhile current > 0:\n\n   total += current\n\n   used += current\n\n   new = used // b\n\n   used = used % b\n\n   current = new\n\nSo, this seems like a possible approach.\n\nLet me test this with the first example.\n\nExample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial current =4, used=0.\n\nFirst loop:\n\ntotal +=4 → total=4\n\nused +=4 → used=4\n\nnew =4//2=2\n\nused =4%2=0\n\ncurrent =2.\n\nLoop again:\n\ntotal +=2 → 6\n\nused +=2 → 2\n\nnew =2//2=1\n\nused =2%2=0\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nLoop again:\n\ntotal +=1 →7\n\nused +=1 →1\n\nnew =1//2=0\n\nused =1%2=1\n\ncurrent=0.\n\nExit loop.\n\nTotal is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input 6 and 3.\n\nInitial current=6.\n\ntotal=0.\n\nLoop 1:\n\ntotal +=6 →6\n\nused=6.\n\nnew=6//3=2. used=6%3=0. current=2.\n\nLoop2:\n\ntotal +=2 →8. used=0+2=2.\n\nnew=2//3=0. used=2%3=2. current=0.\n\nExit. Total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5.\n\nInitial current=5.\n\ntotal +=5 →5. used=5. new=5//5=1. used=5%5=0. current=1.\n\nLoop again:\n\ntotal +=1 →6. used=0+1=1. new=1//5=0. current=0. Exit. Total is 6.\n\nWhich is correct. Because 5 candles burn for 5 hours, then 5 used make 1 new. Burn that for 1 hour. Total 6.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=3. Then initial 3 hours. Then 3 used → 1 new. Burn that, 1 hour. Then used is 1, which can't make anything. So total 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=3. Then initial 2 hours. Then used is 2. Can't make any new. So total is 2.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\ncurrent = a\n\nused = 0\n\nwhile current >0:\n\n    total += current\n\n    used += current\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    used = used % b\n\n    current = new\n\nreturn total.\n\nWait, but how about when you have multiple steps where you can make new candles?\n\nYes, this loop seems to handle that.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nThen:\n\ntotal = 0\n\ncurrent = a\n\nused = 0\n\nwhile current > 0:\n\n    total += current\n\n    used += current\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    used = used % b\n\n    current = new\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me test for the first example.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me think about the case when used is accumulated over multiple steps.\n\nFor example, suppose a=5, b=2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial current=5.\n\ntotal +=5 →5. used=5.\n\nnew =5//2=2, used=5%2=1. current=2.\n\nLoop:\n\ntotal +=2 →7. used=1+2=3.\n\nnew=3//2=1. used=3%2=1. current=1.\n\nLoop:\n\ntotal +=1 →8. used=1+1=2.\n\nnew=2//2=1. used=0. current=1.\n\nLoop:\n\ntotal +=1 →9. used=0+1=1. new=0. current=0. exit.\n\nTotal is 9.\n\nLet's check manually:\n\nStart with 5 candles. Burn them (5h). Used=5. Make 2 new (5//2=2, remainder 1). Now, used is 1. current is 2.\n\nBurn 2 (total 7). Used is 1+2=3. Make 1 new (3//2=1, rem 1). current is 1.\n\nBurn 1 (total 8). Used is 1+1=2. Make 1 new. current is 1.\n\nBurn 1 (total 9). Used is 2%2=0 +1=1. Then current is 0. So yes, total 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo this logic works.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the input is two integers, a and b.\n\nBut the input is given as a single line with two integers. For example, the sample input is ['4 2', '6 3'], but in the actual input, it's two lines? Or perhaps the input is a single line with two numbers. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo for the sample input, perhaps the input is two lines? Or perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases. But the user's code needs to read from stdin. For example, in the sample input given, the first example is input 4 2, output 7. The second example is input 6 3, output 8. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So the code should read a single line with two integers.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo the code should read a single line, split into two integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines, perhaps for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the code needs to process one line of input.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nSample input:\n\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\nSample output:\n\n['7', '8']\n\nBut that's probably indicating that the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, maybe that's a formatting mistake. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\nSo the code must read a single line of input, containing two integers. So for example, the first sample input is 4 2, and the output is 7. The second sample input is 6 3, output 8.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines. Maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement. But according to the problem description, the code should read a single line. Therefore, the code should read two integers from a single line.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b.\n\nSo code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the total as per the algorithm.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total = 0, current = a, used = 0.\n\nLoop while current >0:\n\n   total += current\n\n   used += current\n\n   new = used // b\n\n   used = used % b\n\n   current = new\n\nPrint total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, test cases.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=2.\n\nThen, current =1.\n\ntotal +=1 →1. used=1. new=0. current=0. So total is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. As before.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about a=0? But according to the constraints, a is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = 0\n\ncurrent = a\n\nused = 0\n\nwhile current > 0:\n\n    total += current\n\n    used += current\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    used = used % b\n\n    current = new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can illuminate his room using candles, considering he can reuse the burned-out candles to make new ones. The approach involves simulating the process of burning candles and reusing the remnants optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles.\n2. **Burning Process**: Each candle burns for one hour. After burning, the used candles can be collected and converted into new candles.\n3. **Recycling Process**: For every `b` used candles, a new candle can be made. This new candle can then be burned, contributing another hour of illumination.\n4. **Iterative Calculation**: Continue the process of burning and recycling until no more new candles can be made from the used ones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\ncurrent = a\nused = 0\nwhile current > 0:\n    total += current\n    used += current\n    new = used // b\n    used = used % b\n    current = new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the given number of candles (`a`) and initialize variables to keep track of the total hours (`total`), the current number of candles to burn (`current`), and the number of used candles (`used`).\n2. **Loop Until No More Candles**: While there are candles to burn (`current > 0`):\n   - Add the current number of candles to the total hours since each candle burns for one hour.\n   - Update the count of used candles by adding the number of candles just burned.\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made from the used ones using integer division.\n   - Update the number of used candles to the remainder after making new candles.\n   - Set the current number of candles to the newly made candles for the next iteration.\n3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when no more new candles can be made, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and reusing candles, ensuring that all possible hours of illumination are accounted for. The algorithm runs in O(log a) time complexity due to the repeated division of used candles, making it efficient even for the upper constraint limits.",
