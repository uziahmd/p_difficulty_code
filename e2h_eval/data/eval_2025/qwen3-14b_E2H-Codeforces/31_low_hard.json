Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers between -x and x. The new cards he finds must also be within that range. \n\nSo, first, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call that required sum R = -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimum number of cards needed to sum up to R, with each card's value between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers in that range, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the absolute value of R. Because if R is positive, we can use positive numbers; if it's negative, use negatives. But since the problem allows us to pick any numbers, the minimal number of cards depends on how much R is and the maximum allowed per card (which is x).\n\nFor example, if R is 5 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute at most 2. So 5 / 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards (like 2 + 2 + 1). But wait, the minimal number would be ceil(R / x), but only if R is positive. Wait, but what if R is negative? Well, since the absolute value is the same, the number of cards needed would be the same as for |R|.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think. Suppose R is 5. Each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( (R) / x ). But wait, if R is 5 and x is 2, then 5 / 2 is 2.5, so ceiling is 3. Which is correct. Similarly, if R is 4 and x is 2, then 4/2 is 2, so two cards. So yes, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |R| / x ), but wait, maybe not. Because if R is 3 and x is 2, then you can do 2 + 1, which is two cards. Which is ceil(3/2) = 2. So that works. So the formula seems to be ceil( |R| / x ), but wait, what if R is zero? Then no cards needed. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the given cards.\n2. Compute R = -S. If R is zero, return 0.\n3. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach sum R, with each card's value between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers, the minimal number is ceil( |R| / x ), but wait, maybe there's a case where even after using the maximum possible per card, you need to adjust.\n\nWait, let's think again. For example, R is 5, x is 3. Then 5 / 3 is 1.666..., so ceil is 2. Which would be 3 + 2 = 5. So two cards. That's correct. So the minimal number is indeed the ceiling of |R| divided by x. But wait, what if R is 1 and x is 1? Then 1/1 is 1, so one card. Correct. If R is 2 and x is 1, then 2/1 is 2. So two cards. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if R is 1 and x is 2? Then 1/2 is 0.5, ceil is 1. Which is correct. So the formula seems to work. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |R| / x ), but only if R is not zero. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. Let me think. Suppose R is 3 and x is 2. Then |R| is 3, divided by x is 1.5, so ceil is 2. Which is correct. So two cards (2 + 1). But what if R is 4 and x is 3. Then 4/3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. But 3 + 1 = 4. So two cards. So yes, that works.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nCompute the sum S of the input numbers. R = -S. If R is zero, answer is 0. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |R| / x ). But wait, what if R is not divisible by x? For example",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original and new) equals zero. The new cards must have values within the range from -x to x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Required Sum**: Calculate the required sum that needs to be achieved by the new cards to make the total sum zero. This is simply the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Handle Zero Case**: If the required sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: For non-zero required sums, determine the minimum number of cards needed using the formula `ceil(|required_sum| / x)`. This formula works because each card can contribute at most `x` towards the required sum, and we need to cover the entire required sum with the fewest cards possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        nums = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        total = sum(nums)\n        required = -total\n        if required == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            abs_required = abs(required)\n            min_cards = math.ceil(abs_required / x)\n            print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes multiple test cases.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: For each test case, the sum of the given numbers is computed.\n3. **Required Sum Calculation**: The required sum to balance the total to zero is determined by negating the current sum.\n4. **Zero Check**: If the required sum is zero, immediately output zero as no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the required sum by `x`, we determine the minimum number of cards needed. This ensures that even if the required sum is not perfectly divisible by `x`, we account for the remainder by adding one more card if necessary.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution using basic arithmetic operations and ensures that the minimum number of cards is determined optimally.",
