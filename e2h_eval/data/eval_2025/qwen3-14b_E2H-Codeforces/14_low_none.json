He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros in n!. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. For example, when n increases by 1, f(n) either stays the same or increases by 1 (if the new n is a multiple of 5, maybe more). Wait, no. For example, when n is 25, the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So f(n) can jump by more than 1. Therefore, for some m, there may be no n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. For example, if m is 5, but there's a jump from 4 to 6, then m=5 would have no solutions.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem says for m=1, the answer is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check that. For 5! it's 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! is 5040 (1), etc. So for n=5,6,7,8,9, the trailing zeros count is 1. Then for n=10, it's 2. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So the function f(n) increases by 1 at 5, then remains same until 9, then jumps by 1 again at 10.\n\nSo the key idea here is that for a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or other counts?) that satisfy the condition. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think: For each m, the possible n's that give exactly m trailing zeros would be a consecutive range of numbers. Because once the count increases beyond m, there's no way to get back. So for example, if there exists an n where f(n) = m, then there's a range of numbers where f(n) equals m. But how long is that range?\n\nWait, for example, when m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. That's five numbers. So the range is 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause when you reach 5, you add one zero. Then, the next numbers (6,7,8,9) don't add any more zeros. But when you hit 10, you add two zeros (since 10 is divisible by 5 once, but 25 is not yet there). Wait, but 10/5 is 2, and 10/25 is 0, so total is 2. So for n=10, the count is 2. So the numbers 5-9 have count 1. So the length is 5 numbers.\n\nBut how do I find the range of n's that produce exactly m trailing zeros?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Let's call it low.\n2. Find the maximal n such that f(n) = m. Let's call it high.\n3. If such numbers exist, then the count is high - low + 1. Otherwise, zero.\n\nBut how do I find low and high?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, there's a range of numbers where f(n) equals m. But how do I find if such a range exists?\n\nBut first, how do I find if there exists any n such that f(n) = m? Because for some m, there may be none. For example, m=5. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that $ n! $ (n factorial) ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values of $ n $ that satisfy the condition.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the count of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, so the number of 5s determines the number of trailing zeros. The formula for counting trailing zeros in $ n! $ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\n\nThis function is non-decreasing as $ n $ increases. Therefore, for a given $ m $, there may be a range of $ n $ values where the count of trailing zeros equals $ m $, or there may be no such $ n $ at all.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search**: We can use binary search to find the smallest and largest values of $ n $ such that $ \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = m $. If such values exist, they will form a contiguous range.\n2. **Check Validity**: If the smallest $ n $ that gives $ m $ trailing zeros has more than $ m $ trailing zeros, then there is no solution for that $ m $.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- A helper function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` computes the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $.\n- Use binary search to find the minimum and maximum $ n $ such that $ \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = m $.\n- If such $ n $ exists, output the range; otherwise, output 0.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    left = -1\n    right = -1\n\n    # Find the first n with exactly m trailing zeros\n    l, r = 0, 5 * m\n    while l <= r:\n        mid = (l + r) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            l = mid + 1\n        else:\n            r = mid - 1\n    if count_trailing_zeros(l) == m:\n        left = l\n\n    # Find the last n with exactly m trailing zeros\n    l, r = 0, 5 * m\n    while l <= r:\n        mid = (l + r) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) > m:\n            r = mid - 1\n        else:\n            l = mid + 1\n    if count_trailing_zeros(r) == m:\n        right = r\n\n    if left == -1 or right == -1:\n        return [0]\n    else:\n        return [right - left + 1] + list(range(left, right + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(result[0])\n    if result[0] > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result[1:])))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **count_trailing_zeros**: Computes the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ using repeated division by powers of 5.\n- **find_n_values**: Uses binary search to find the smallest and largest $ n $ that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n- **main**: Reads input, processes it, and prints the required output.\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency even for large values of $ m $ (up to 100,000), as binary search keeps the time complexity logarithmic in the search space.",
