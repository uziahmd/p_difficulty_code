He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those n's in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Let's think about how the count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the number of trailing zeros can either stay the same or increase by 1 or more. Wait, no. For example, when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases. For example, 5! has one zero. 6! also has one, until 10! which adds another. So, for numbers between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. Which matches the sample input.\n\nSo, the key idea is that for each m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers n that produce exactly m trailing zeros. Wait, why 5? Because when you hit a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1. But when you hit a multiple of 25, it increases by two. For example, 25! has 6 trailing zeros (25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So, when you go from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2. So, for m=5, there might be no numbers? Or maybe some numbers?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose m is 5. Let's compute the count for numbers around 25. Let's see:\n\nFor n=24: count is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. So 4 zeros. Then 25 gives 5+1=6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be zero. But for m=6, the numbers would be 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. So that's five numbers. So, the possible cases are that for some m, there are 0, 1, or 5 numbers. But how?\n\nWait, but maybe when the count increases by more than 1, there are gaps. So for example, if there's a jump from x to x + k, where k>1, then the numbers between x and x +k -1 would be missing. So for m values in that range, there are no solutions.\n\nSo the approach is to find for a given m, whether there exists any n such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. And if there are, find all such n's.\n\nBut how do I find these n's?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that correspond to m. Let's think about binary search. For example, for a given m, find the smallest n where the count is >= m, and then check if the count is exactly m. But how to find all n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's must lie in a certain range. Let's think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThe function f(n) is non-decreasing as n increases. So for each m, there's a range of n's where f(n) = m. But when there's a jump in f(n), like from 4 to 6, then there's no n with f(n) =5.\n\nSo, for a given m, the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. If there's no such n, output 0.\n\nBut how to find if there's any n such that f(n) =m?\n\nAnother approach: For a given",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently finding the corresponding values of `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial. The formula to count trailing zeros in `n!` is given by:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Range**: For a given `m`, we can use binary search to find the smallest and largest values of `n` such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly `m`. If no such `n` exists, the result will be zero.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: After determining the range of possible `n` values, we check if they indeed produce exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Find the lower bound where count_zeros(n) >= m\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    # Now low is the first n with count >= m\n    if count_zeros(low) != m:\n        return []\n    \n    # Find the upper bound where count_zeros(n) == m\n    high = low\n    while count_zeros(high) == m:\n        high += 1\n    return list(range(low, high))\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    if not input:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    m = int(input)\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(result))\n    if len(result) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` using the formula described above.\n\n2. **find_n_values Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest value of `n` such that the count of trailing zeros is at least `m`. It then checks the range of values starting from this `n` to find all values that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Main Function**: Reads the input, processes it using the `find_n_values` function, and prints the results in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid values of `n` using binary search, which keeps the solution within acceptable time limits even for large values of `m`.",
