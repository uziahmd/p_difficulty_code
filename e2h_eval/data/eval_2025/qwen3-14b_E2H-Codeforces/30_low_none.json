Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. The number A has 2n digits. Each player takes exactly n turns. On each turn, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number. The goal is to maximize the total sum of S1 (Homer's number) and S2 (Marge's number). And we have to output the sequence of moves (H or M) that achieves this maximum total. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. So the key is to choose, at each step, whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit, such that the total sum of their numbers is maximized. But since each player has to take exactly n digits, the decision isn't just greedy. Because choosing a digit now might affect future choices. For example, taking a higher digit now might leave lower digits for later steps, but maybe the optimal choice depends on the combination of digits taken by both players.\n\nThe challenge is to find the optimal sequence of choices. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of steps is 36. But for each step, the decision depends on the state of the remaining digits and how many moves each player has left.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For dynamic programming, maybe we can model the state based on the current position in the string, the number of moves Homer has left, and the number of moves Marge has left. Wait, but since the total number of moves is fixed (each has exactly n moves), the state can be represented by how many moves each has left. Wait, the total steps is 2n, so for each step, the number of moves left for Homer and Marge must satisfy h + m = remaining steps. For example, when there are k steps left, h + m = k. So perhaps the state can be represented as (h, m), where h is the number of moves Homer has left, and m is the number of moves Marge has left. But since h + m = (number of steps left), which is (current position in the string?), maybe we can track the state as (h, m), and the current position is determined by (original length - (h + m))? Wait, the original length is 2n. So when we have h moves left for Homer and m moves left for Marge, the total steps already taken is (original 2n) - (h + m) steps. So the current position in the string is (original length - (h + m)) digits into the string. Wait, no. Let me think: initially, there are 2n digits. Each move takes one digit. So after taking k steps, there are 2n -k digits left. So for a given state where Homer has h moves left and Marge has m moves left, the total steps taken so far is (original 2n) - (h + m). Because each step reduces the remaining steps by 1. So the current position is the (2n - (h + m))-th digit? Or maybe the next digit to take is the (original string's index (2n - (h + m)) )? Wait, let's say the original string is A[0], A[1], ..., A[2n-1]. Initially, the first digit is A[0]. After taking one step, the next digit is A[1], etc. So if we have taken (total_steps_taken) steps, the next digit is A[total_steps_taken]. So total_steps_taken = (original 2n) - (h + m). Because the total steps taken is (initial steps) minus (remaining steps). Wait, h and m are the number of moves each has left. So the total steps taken so far is (n - h) + (n - m) = 2n - h -m. So the next digit to take is at position (2n - h -m) in the original string. So for the state (h, m), the next digit is A[2n - h - m].\n\nSo the DP state can be (h, m), which represents the number of moves Homer and Marge have left. At each state, the next digit is known. Then, for each state, we can decide whether to take it as Homer's move (if h >0) or Marge's move (if m>0). But since the players take turns, but the choice is which one takes the next move. However, the problem says that before each turn, the players determine who will make the next move. So during the game, each turn is chosen by the players, but the problem requires that the sequence of moves leads to each having exactly n moves.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The key challenge is to make decisions at each step considering future possibilities, which can be efficiently handled using dynamic programming.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach where the state is represented by the number of moves left for Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`). This allows us to track the maximum total prize value achievable from any given state.\n2. **State Transition**: For each state `(h, m)`, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and recursively compute the maximum total prize from the resulting states.\n3. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we memoize the results of subproblems using a dictionary.\n4. **Greedy Choice with Backtracking**: After computing the optimal values, we backtrack through the DP states to reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    length = 2 * n\n\n    # Precompute the digits as integers\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h == 0 and m == 0:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        pos = length - h - m\n        current_digit = digits[pos]\n        max_total = -1\n        best_move = ''\n\n        # Homer's turn if he has moves left\n        if h > 0:\n            total_h, move_h = dp(h - 1, m)\n            total = total_h + current_digit * (10 ** (h + m - 1))\n            if total > max_total:\n                max_total = total\n                best_move = 'H' + move_h\n            elif total == max_total:\n                if best_move == '':\n                    best_move = 'H' + move_h\n                else:\n                    # Choose lexicographically smaller if needed, but problem allows any\n                    pass\n\n        # Marge's turn if she has moves left\n        if m > 0:\n            total_m, move_m = dp(h, m - 1)\n            total = total_m + current_digit * (10 ** (h + m - 1))\n            if total > max_total:\n                max_total = total\n                best_move = 'M' + move_m\n            elif total == max_total:\n                if best_move == '':\n                    best_move = 'M' + move_m\n                else:\n                    # Choose lexicographically smaller if needed, but problem allows any\n                    pass\n        return (max_total, best_move)\n\n    _, result = dp(n, n)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of length `2n`.\n2. **Digit Conversion**: Convert the string `A` into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function uses memoization to store results of subproblems. It takes the number of moves left for Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`) and returns the maximum total prize and the corresponding move sequence.\n4. **State Transitions**: For each state, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and compute the resulting total prize recursively.\n5. **Backtracking**: After computing the optimal values, we backtrack through the DP states to reconstruct the sequence of moves that leads to the maximum total prize.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible move sequences while leveraging memoization to avoid redundant calculations, leading to an optimal solution.",
