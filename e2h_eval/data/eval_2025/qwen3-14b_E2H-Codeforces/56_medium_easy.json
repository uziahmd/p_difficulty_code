Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between R rebel spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. And since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible permutations?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The key point is that any two line segments (from a spaceship to its assigned base) must not cross each other. So for a given permutation (matching), we have to check all pairs of line segments to ensure they don't intersect.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if R equals B. Because a perfect matching requires that the number of spaceships equals the number of bases. Wait, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So yes, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible. Oh wait, the input gives R and B. So first thing, if R != B, output No. But looking at the sample input, first case is 3 3, second is 2 1. So in the second case, since R=2 and B=1, the answer is No. So that's an initial check.\n\nSo first step: if R != B, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, when R = B, we need to check if there exists a permutation of the bases (or spaceships) such that when each spaceship is matched to a base in that permutation, all the connecting lines are non-intersecting.\n\nSo for all possible permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible matching), check if the lines between the i-th spaceship and the permuted base do not cross each other.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nI need a function that takes two line segments (each defined by two points) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nBut how to implement that? Well, there's a standard computational geometry approach. Let me recall.\n\nFirst, check if the two line segments intersect. The standard way is to check if the orientation of the points changes. Also, need to handle cases where the lines are colinear but overlapping. However, the problem statement says that no three points are on the same line. So, in our case, since all points are distinct and no three are colinear, any two line segments that are colinear would have to be overlapping. But since the problem says that no three points are on the same line, perhaps that's not possible here. Wait, but the line segments could be colinear. For example, if two line segments are part of the same line. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, but the line segments could be between two points, and another between two others. For example, if you have points A, B, C, D arranged in a straight line, but that's not allowed. Since the problem states that no three points are on the same line. Therefore, any two line segments (connecting two pairs of points) cannot be colinear. Because if they were, then their endpoints would be colinear. So for example, if two line segments AB and CD are colinear, then A, B, C, D are colinear, which would imply that there are three points on the same line. Which is not allowed. Therefore, the problem ensures that no two line segments can be colinear. Therefore, when checking for intersection, we can assume that any two line segments either cross each other (in which case they have exactly one point of intersection) or don't.\n\nSo, the standard line segment intersection check can be used.\n\nSo, the steps for checking two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) are:\n\n- Check if the two line segments intersect. The function should return True if they do.\n\nThe standard method for this is using orientations. Let me recall the steps.\n\nThe orientation of three points p, q, r can be determined by the cross product of vectors (q-p) and (r-p). The orientation can be 0 (colinear), 1 (clockwise), or 2 (counter-clockwise). But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, so for any three points, the orientation is not zero.\n\nBut in our case, when checking two line segments, the orientations would be used to check if the segments straddle each other.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n- The orientation of A, B, C is different from the orientation of A, B, D, and the orientation of C, D, A is different from the orientation of C, D, B. (This is the general case where the segments cross each other.)\n\nOR\n\n- One of the segments has an endpoint lying on the other segment. But since no three points are colinear, this can't happen. Because if, say, point C lies on AB, then points A, B, C are colinear, which is not allowed. So in this problem, the only possible intersections between two line segments are proper crossings (i.e., not at endpoints).\n\nWait, but the problem allows the line segments to share an endpoint? Well, the problem says that no two points coincide. So each line segment is between two distinct points. However, if two line segments share an endpoint, like AB and AC, then they meet at A. But in that case, the problem says that the paths do not intersect. Wait, the problem says that any two paths (straight lines) should not intersect. So if two line segments share an endpoint, then they do meet at that point. But according to the problem statement, is that considered as an intersection?\n\nThe problem says that the paths should not intersect. So if two paths share an endpoint, that's a point of intersection. But according to the problem's note, in the first example, connecting them in order works. Let's think about that.\n\nSuppose the first example has three spaceships and three bases. If they are connected in order, then each line is from spaceship i to base i. Suppose that none of these lines cross each other. But if two lines share an endpoint, that's allowed? Or not?\n\nWait, the problem says that the paths must not intersect. So if two paths share a common point (like an endpoint), then they do intersect. However, the problem says that no two points coincide. So each line is between two unique points. However, if two line segments share an endpoint, then they are connected at that point. So that would count as an intersection. But in the problem's note, the first example says that connecting in order works. So perhaps that implies that the line segments don't cross each other, but perhaps they share endpoints. Wait, but in that case, the problem's note may have a scenario where that's allowed. But according to the problem statement, the paths must not intersect. So that suggests that even sharing endpoints is not allowed. But that seems conflicting with the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers that two paths that share an endpoint do not count as intersecting? Because in the problem's note, the first example connects the rebels and bases in order. Let's imagine that the first spaceship is at (0,0), and the first base is at (-2,1). Then the line from (0,0) to (-2,1) is one path. The second spaceship is at (2,0), and the second base is at (0,3). The line from (2,0) to (0,3) is another path. Do these two lines cross? Let's see. Let me compute their equations.\n\nLine 1: from (0,0) to (-2,1). The slope is (1-0)/(-2 - 0) = 1/-2 = -1/2. The equation is y = -1/2 x.\n\nLine 2: from (2,0) to (0,3). The slope is (3-0)/(0-2) = 3/-2 = -3/2. Equation: y - 0 = (-3/2)(x - 2) → y = (-3/2)x + 3.\n\nFind if they intersect. Set equations equal:\n\n-1/2 x = -3/2 x + 3 → ( (-1/2 x) + 3/2 x ) = 3 → x = 3. Then y = -1/2 *3 = -1.5. But the original line segments are from (0,0) to (-2,1) and from (2,0) to (0,3). The intersection point is at (3, -1.5), which is outside both segments. Therefore, those two lines don't cross. So in this case, the example's matching is valid.\n\nBut what if two line segments share an endpoint? Let's say, for example, spaceship A is connected to base B, and spaceship C is connected to base B. Then the line segments would be AB and CB. These two lines share the point B. So they intersect at B. According to the problem's constraints, this is not allowed. Therefore, the matching must be such that no two line segments share an endpoint. But since each base is assigned exactly once, and each spaceship is assigned exactly once, the line segments are between unique pairs. So, for a valid matching, all the line segments are between unique pairs. But in that case, if two line segments share an endpoint, that would be a spaceship connected to two different bases, which is not possible. Wait, no. Because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So each line segment is from a spaceship to a base. So two line segments can't share the same spaceship or the same base. So, for example, if we have a matching where spaceship 1 is connected to base 1, and spaceship 2 is connected to base 2, then the line segments are (s1, b1) and (s2, b2). These two segments can't share an endpoint because each spaceship is connected to exactly one base, and each base is connected to exactly one spaceship. Therefore, no two line segments in the matching will share an endpoint. So, the only possible way two line segments can intersect is if they cross each other in the middle. Therefore, when checking for intersections between any two line segments in the matching, we just need to check whether they cross each other (properly intersect, not at endpoints). \n\nTherefore, the function to check if two line segments intersect can ignore the case where they share endpoints. Because in our problem, the line segments are between different pairs of points, and the problem says that no two points are the same. So, for the problem's constraints, two line segments in the matching can't share endpoints. Therefore, the check can be done as follows:\n\nFor two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2), check if they intersect properly (i.e., cross each other in the middle, not at endpoints). \n\nSo how to implement that?\n\nThe standard approach is to use the orientation method. The steps are:\n\n1. Check if the segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) intersect by checking if the orientations of (p1, q1, p2) and (p1, q1, q2) are different, and the orientations of (p2, q2, p1) and (p2, q2, q1) are different. If that's true, then they intersect.\n\nBut also, need to handle cases where one of the segments is a vertical line, etc. But the orientation method handles that.\n\nLet me code the orientation function.\n\nThe orientation function for three points p, q, r can be calculated as follows:\n\nval = (qy - py) * (rx - px) - (qx - px) * (ry - py)\n\nIf val is 0, the points are colinear. But in our problem, this can't happen. So for our problem, since no three points are colinear, the val can't be zero. So for any three points in the input, the orientation is not zero.\n\nBut during the checking of the line segments, the points p1, q1, p2, q2 are all distinct, but the line segments can cross each other.\n\nSo the function to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect is as follows:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n\n    # Compute orientations\n\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case: if points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: check if any of the endpoints lie on the other segment. But since no three points are colinear, this can't happen. So we can skip this.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but in the case where one of the segments is completely inside the other? For example, if AB is a long segment, and CD is a shorter segment that lies entirely within AB. But since no three points are colinear, that's not possible. Because for example, if C lies on AB, then A, B, C are colinear, which is not allowed. Therefore, in our problem, the only possible way that two line segments can intersect is if they cross each other in the middle, which is the general case covered by the above condition.\n\nSo the function can be written as above.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each possible permutation of the bases (since R=B, and each permutation represents a possible matching between the spaceships and bases), check whether all pairs of line segments (spaceship i to base in permutation[i]) do not intersect.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies this condition, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nNow, the problem is how to generate all permutations of the bases. Since R and B are up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3.6 million. Wait, 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, we need to check O(R^2) pairs of line segments. For R=10, that's 100 pairs. So total operations would be around 3.6e6 * 100 = 3.6e8 operations. That's 360 million operations, which might be a bit slow in Python.\n\nWait, but R and B are up to 10. Let's see, for R=10, the permutations are 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, for each pair of line segments (i,j) where i < j, check if they intersect. For R=10, the number of pairs is C(10,2) = 45. So for each permutation, 45 checks. So total operations would be 3,628,800 * 45 = 163,296,000 operations. Each operation is checking four orientations. How expensive is that?\n\nIn Python, that might be tight. But considering that the constraints are small (R and B up to 10), and the test cases are probably manageable. Let's think about the sample input. The first example has R=B=3, which has 6 permutations. For each permutation, 3 choose 2 = 3 pairs. So 6*3=18 checks.\n\nSo for R=10, 3.6 million permutations, each with 45 checks. Let's see, each check involves four orientation calculations. Each orientation calculation is a few arithmetic operations. So perhaps in Python, this is manageable. Let's proceed.\n\nSo now, the steps for the code:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read the R spaceships' coordinates, then read B bases' coordinates.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the B bases. For each permutation, check if all pairs of line segments between spaceship i and base permutation[i] do not intersect.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nBut wait, how to represent the bases and spaceships. For example, the spaceships are given in order. For a permutation, the i-th spaceship is connected to the permuted base. So for permutation p, the i-th spaceship is connected to p[i].\n\nBut the bases are given as a list. So, for example, if the bases are stored as a list bases, then for a permutation of the bases, each element is a base's coordinates.\n\nBut generating all permutations of the bases. For example, if the bases are [b1, b2, b3], then the permutations are all possible orderings. For each permutation, we check the matching between spaceship 1 to permutation[0], spaceship 2 to permutation[1], etc.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nif R != B: print No.\n\nelse:\n\n   read R spaceships as a list ships.\n\n   read B bases as a list bases.\n\n   generate all permutations of the bases.\n\n   for each permutation in permutations:\n\n       check if all pairs of line segments between ships[i] and perm[i] do not intersect.\n\n       if all pairs are non-intersecting, return Yes.\n\n   after checking all permutations, if none found, return No.\n\nNow, the problem is how to generate permutations. In Python, itertools.permutations can be used.\n\nBut for B=10, the permutations would be 10! = 3.6 million. For each permutation, check all pairs of line segments.\n\nBut how to check all pairs of line segments for a permutation.\n\nFor a given permutation, the line segments are (ships[0], perm[0]), (ships[1], perm[1]), ..., (ships[R-1], perm[R-1]).\n\nWe need to check that for any two different line segments (say, i and j), they do not intersect.\n\nSo for all i < j, check if the line segments between ships[i] and perm[i], and ships[j] and perm[j] intersect. If any pair does, then this permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we can loop over all i < j, and check if segments_intersect(ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]). If any of them returns True, then this permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, the code for the segments_intersect function.\n\nImplementing the orientation function:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n\n    # returns 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise, 0 if colinear.\n\n    # but since in our problem, no three points are colinear, so 0 is not possible.\n\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n\n    if val == 0:\n\n        return 0\n\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nBut for the purposes of the segments_intersect function, the actual value isn't needed, just the sign. So for the segments_intersect function:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    # A and B are endpoints of first segment, C and D of second.\n\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case: if points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but what if one of the segments is completely contained within the other? But since no three points are colinear, that can't happen. So the above function returns True only when the segments cross each other.\n\nBut wait, suppose that the two segments are AB and CD, and AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), and CD is from (1,1) to (3,3). But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, that's not allowed. Because the points A, B, C, D would be colinear. So the problem's input ensures that this can't happen. Therefore, the function is correct.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplement the orientation function and the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut in Python, for efficiency, perhaps we can inline the orientation checks. But for code clarity, better to have helper functions.\n\nNow, considering that the code needs to read inputs from stdin. The input format is a bit tricky. For example, the first line is R and B. Then R lines of spaceship coordinates, then B lines of base coordinates.\n\nBut in the example given, the first input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, but the input is given as two separate test cases? Or is that the input for two separate test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, but the sample shows two examples. However, the user's task is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin and outputs the correct answer. So, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as follows. The first line contains two integers R and B. Then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is R=3, B=3, then 3 spaceships, then 3 bases.\n\nThe second example is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nWhich is R=2, B=1. So the output is No.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line. The sample input shows two examples, but perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. The sample input is given as two separate test cases, but perhaps the user's code is supposed to read one test case. For example, in programming competition problems, the input is usually a single test case. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is given as two separate test cases, and the output is given as two separate outputs. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? But the problem's description says that the input is given as per the first line, etc. So perhaps the sample input is a list of two test cases, and the code is supposed to process each one and output the corresponding result. However, the problem's input format is unclear.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers R and B. Then the next R lines are the spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nBut the sample input is given as two separate test cases. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is 3 3, then three spaceships, then three bases.\n\nThe second example is 2 1, then two spaceships, then one base.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided a list of two inputs, which are two test cases. However, the code is supposed to read from stdin. Therefore, perhaps the code should read a single test case. But the sample shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input format is not clear. But the problem's note says that the sample input is given as two examples, and the output is given as two outputs.\n\nBut in programming competition problems, the input is usually one test case. However, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, looking at the problem's input description, it's unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the first input is a string that represents the first test case, and the second is another test case. However, the code is supposed to read from stdin. Therefore, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how to know how many?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. But in the sample input, the first example's input is given as a single input, and the output is 'Yes', and the second example's input is given as another input, and output is 'No'.\n\nBut the problem's input is not described as multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases for illustration, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case. Therefore, the code should read R and B, then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nBut how to read from stdin? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user provided the sample input as a list of two test cases. However, the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. Therefore, the code should read the input as follows:\n\nRead R and B from the first line.\n\nThen read R lines for the spaceships.\n\nThen read B lines for the bases.\n\nSo for the first example, the input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is R=3, B=3, then 3 spaceships, then 3 bases.\n\nSo the code should read that.\n\nBut how to handle the input? The code can read from stdin via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n\n    # p, q, r are tuples of (x, y)\n\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n\n    if val == 0:\n\n        return 0\n\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nThen, read R and B.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So:\n\nRead the entire input as a list of lines. For example:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to read line by line.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have multiple lines. So:\n\nRead R and B from the first line.\n\nThen read R lines for spaceships.\n\nThen read B lines for bases.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n\n    # Read input\n\n    input_lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    R, B = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n\n    ptr += 1\n\n    ships = []\n\n    for _ in range(R):\n\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n    bases = []\n\n    for _ in range(B):\n\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n    if R != B:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        return\n\n    # Now generate all permutations of the bases\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n\n        # Check all pairs of line segments in this permutation\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(R):\n\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n                # Check if segment between ships[i] and perm[i] intersects with segment between ships[j] and perm[j]\n\n                A = ships[i]\n\n                B = perm[i]\n\n                C = ships[j]\n\n                D = perm[j]\n\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n                    valid = False\n\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if valid:\n\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, the permutation is generated from the bases. However, in the case where R=B=0? Well, according to the problem constraints, R and B are at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nBut in the code, when R=B=1, the permutation is just one element. So for i=0, j ranges from 1 to R-1 (which is 0), so no loops. So the code returns valid=True.\n\nBut in that case, the code would print Yes.\n\nWhich is correct, since there's only one line segment, no intersections.\n\nBut what about when R=B=2? For example, two spaceships and two bases. The permutations are two possibilities. For each, check if the two line segments cross.\n\nBut the code would generate the permutations, check for each.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, the code loops over all i < j pairs, which for R=2 is one pair.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo ships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)], bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nOne possible permutation is the same order. So perm is [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nCheck all pairs:\n\ni=0, j=1:\n\nA = (0,0), B = (-2,1)\n\nC = (2,0), D = (0,3)\n\nCheck if segments intersect. Let's compute.\n\norientation(A,B,C) is orientation((0,0), (-2,1), (2,0)).\n\nval = (-2 - 0) * (0 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(2 - 0) ?\n\nWait, the orientation function is:\n\nval = (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n\nSo for p = (0,0), q = (-2, 1), r = (2, 0):\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2 - 0 = -2\n\n(r.y - p.y) = 0 - 0 = 0\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1 - 0 = 1\n\n(r.x - p.x) = 2 - 0 = 2\n\nval = (-2)*0 - (1)*2 = 0 - 2 = -2 → which is negative. So orientation is 2 (since val < 0).\n\nThen orientation(A,B,D) where D is (0,3):\n\nr is (0,3). \n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2, (r.y - p.y) = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1, (r.x - p.x) = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nval = (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6 - 0 = -6 → negative. So orientation is 2 again.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are same. So the first condition (o1 != o2) is false. So segments_intersect returns false.\n\nSimilarly for other pairs.\n\nSo in this case, the permutation is valid. Thus, the code returns Yes.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. Since R != B, output is No.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nShips at (0,0), (1,1). Bases at (0,1), (1,0).\n\nPermutations are [(0,1), (1,0)] and [(1,0), (0,1)].\n\nCheck first permutation:\n\nSegments (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0). These are vertical lines. They are parallel. So they don't cross.\n\nBut wait, the segments are from (0,0) to (0,1) and from (1,1) to (1,0). These are vertical lines, no intersection. So valid.\n\nBut wait, the code would check for segments_intersect between these two segments.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nA=(0,0), B=(0,1), C=(1,1), D=(1,0).\n\nCheck orientations:\n\no1 = orientation(A,B,C) → orientation of (0,0), (0,1), (1,1).\n\nval = (0 - 0) * (1 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) → 0 * 1 - 1 * 1 = -1 → negative → orientation 2.\n\no2 = orientation(A,B,D) → (0,0), (0,1), (1,0).\n\nval = (0 - 0) * (0 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) → 0 * 0 - 1 * 1 = -1 → orientation 2.\n\nSo o1 == o2 → condition fails. So returns False.\n\nThus, the segments do not intersect. So the permutation is valid. Thus, the code would return Yes.\n\nAnother permutation: [(1,0), (0,1)].\n\nSegments (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These are horizontal lines. They don't cross. So again valid.\n\nThus, code would return Yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about a case where two line segments cross?\n\nFor example, R=2, B=2.\n\nShips: (0,0), (2,2). Bases: (2,0), (0,2).\n\nPermutation is [(2,0), (0,2)].\n\nSegments are (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These are horizontal lines. Do they cross? No. So code returns valid.\n\nAnother permutation: [(0,2), (2,0)].\n\nSegments are (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). Vertical lines. No cross.\n\nBut if the permutation is [(2,0), (0,2)]? Wait, same as before.\n\nBut if the ships are (0,0) and (2,2), and the bases are (1,1) and (3,3). But wait, no, since R=B=2, and the bases are two points. But according to the problem's input constraints, no three points are colinear. So if the bases are (1,1) and (3,3), then the ships are (0,0) and (2,2). Then, the line segments from (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,2) to (3,3) are colinear. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear. So this scenario is not allowed. Thus, the input will not have such cases.\n\nAnother example: R=2, B=2.\n\nShips are (0,0) and (3,3). Bases are (1,2) and (2,1). Let's see.\n\nPermutation [ (1,2), (2,1) ].\n\nSegments (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute the orientation.\n\nA = (0,0), B = (1,2), C = (3,3), D = (2,1).\n\nCheck o1 = orientation(A,B,C) → points A, B, C.\n\nval = (1 - 0) * (3 - 0) - (2 - 0) * (3 - 0) → 1*3 - 2*3 = 3 -6 = -3 → negative → orientation 2.\n\no2 = orientation(A,B,D) → points A, B, D (2,1).\n\nval = (1-0)*(1 - 0) - (2-0)*(2 - 0) → 1*1 - 2*2 → 1-4 = -3 → negative. So o1 and o2 are same. So segments_intersect returns False.\n\nThen check o3 and o4.\n\no3 = orientation(C, D, A) → points C, D, A.\n\nval = (2-3)*(0 -3) - (1-3)*(0 -3) → (-1)*(-3) - (-2)*(-3) → 3 -6 = -3 → negative → orientation 2.\n\no4 = orientation(C,D,B) → points C, D, B (1,2).\n\nval = (2-3)*(2 -3) - (1-3)*(1 -3) → (-1)*(-1) - (-2)*(-2) → 1 -4 = -3 → negative. So o3 and o4 are same. So returns False. So the segments don't intersect.\n\nBut visually, the two lines:\n\nLine 1: from (0,0) to (1,2). Line 2: from (3,3) to (2,1). Do they cross?\n\nLet me",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting paths intersect. The solution involves checking all permutations of bases to see if any permutation results in non-intersecting paths.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R is not equal to B, immediately output \"No\" as a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the bases. For each permutation, check if the paths from each spaceship to its assigned base in the permutation intersect.\n3. **Intersection Check**: Use computational geometry to determine if two line segments intersect. This involves calculating the orientation of points to determine if segments cross each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    ptr = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n    ptr += 1\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[ptr].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                A = ships[i]\n                B = perm[i]\n                C = ships[j]\n                D = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into spaceships and bases coordinates.\n2. **Immediate Check**: If the number of spaceships and bases do not match, output \"No\".\n3. **Permutations**: All permutations of the bases are generated to check each possible assignment.\n4. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, every pair of paths is checked using the orientation method to determine if they intersect. If any pair intersects, the permutation is discarded.\n5. **Result**: If any valid permutation is found where no paths intersect, \"Yes\" is printed; otherwise, \"No\" is printed after all permutations are checked.",
