She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the operations she can perform. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but within the current open tabs' boundaries), or close all tabs to the left or right of the current position. Closing tabs affects the a and b values (the current min and max indices of open tabs). \n\nSo the challenge is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closes to achieve the desired state with minimal time.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The initial state has all tabs open. The desired state is that only tabs from l to r are open. So, we need to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. \n\nBut how do the operations work? For example, if she closes all tabs to the left of the current position, then the new a becomes the current position's index. Similarly for closing to the right. \n\nThe key here is that each close operation can eliminate a bunch of tabs at once, but you have to position the cursor correctly to do so. \n\nLet me think about the steps required. Suppose that the current position is pos. We need to close tabs left of l and right of r. \n\nBut depending on where l and r are relative to the initial position, the steps vary. \n\nLet me consider different cases:\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, maybe we need to close tabs to the left and right. But how?\n\nFor example, if the desired range is [2,4], and the current position is 3. Then, perhaps she can close all tabs to the left (if possible) and then to the right. But how does that work?\n\nWait, when you close tabs to the left of the current position, that would remove all tabs from a to i-1. But after closing, the a and b values change. \n\nLet me think of the first example given:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The desired state is tabs 2,3,4 open. So need to close tabs 1,5,6.\n\nIn the example explanation, the steps are:\n\nMove to tab 2 (from 3, which takes 1 second?), then close left (but there's nothing to the left of 2, so maybe that's not needed?), then move to 3, then to 4, then close right. Wait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Move from pos 3 to 2 (1 second). Then close all tabs to the left of 2 (which is none, since a is 1, but after closing, the a becomes 2. So that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the example explanation is different.\n\nWait the example says: shift the mouse to tab 2, close all tabs to the left of it. But if the current position is 2, then closing tabs to the left would close tabs from a (which is 1) to i-1 (which is 1). So that's closing tab 1. Then, after that, the a becomes 2, and b remains 6. Then, she moves to tab 3 (which is within the current a and b). Then moves to 4. Then closes all tabs to the right (which are 5 and 6). \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nMove left from 3 to 2 (1 sec). Close left (1 sec). Then move right to 3 (1 sec?), then to 4 (another 1 sec?), then close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 seconds. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the idea is that closing operations can be done once you are positioned correctly. But how to model this optimally?\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal steps to position the cursor such that you can close all the left and right tabs in the least steps.\n\nLet me think about the necessary steps. To close all tabs to the left of l, you need to have the cursor at l, and then close all to the left. Similarly, to close all tabs to the right of r, you need to have the cursor at r and close all to the right. Alternatively, maybe you can close them in some other way?\n\nWait, no. Because if you close all tabs to the left of the current position, then the a becomes the current position. So if you want to close all tabs left of l, you need to have the cursor at l, then close left. Similarly for closing right of r: cursor at r, close right",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified range [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Target Range**: The goal is to leave only tabs from index `l` to `r` open. This means closing all tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r`.\n2. **Cursor Positioning**: To efficiently close tabs, Luba needs to position her cursor correctly:\n   - To close tabs to the left of `l`, she must move to `l` and then close all tabs to the left.\n   - To close tabs to the right of `r`, she must move to `r` and then close all tabs to the right.\n3. **Calculate Moves**:\n   - If the current position is already within the target range [l, r], no moves are needed for closing, but we might need to move to either end of the range to perform the close operations.\n   - If the current position is outside the target range, calculate the moves required to reach the nearest end of the target range and then perform the close operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the desired range is already all tabs, no action needed\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Determine if we need to close left and/or right\n    need_close_left = l > 1\n    need_close_right = r < n\n\n    # Calculate the steps needed\n    steps = 0\n\n    # If we need to close left, we need to move to l and close left\n    if need_close_left:\n        # Distance from current pos to l\n        steps += abs(pos - l)\n        steps += 1  # close left\n\n    # If we need to close right, we need to move to r and close right\n    if need_close_right:\n        # After closing left, the current position is still at l (if we moved there)\n        # So, we need to move from l to r, or from original pos if not closing left\n        # Wait, need to think about the order.

Let's re-express:\n\n    # If need to close left and right:\n    # steps = (distance from pos to l) + 1 (close left) + (distance from l to r) + 1 (close right)\n    # which is |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2\n\n    # If need to close only left:\n    # steps = |pos - l| + 1\n\n    # If need to close only right:\n    # steps = |pos - r| + 1\n\n    # But what if pos is already in the correct position to close?\n\n    # For example, if need to close left, and pos is already at l, then steps is 1.\n\n    # So let's re-calculate:\n\n    steps = 0\n\n    if need_close_left:\n        steps += abs(pos - l) + 1  # move to l and close left\n    if need_close_right:\n        # After closing left, the cursor is at l. Now move to r\n        # So steps += |r - l| + 1\n        steps += abs(r - l) + 1\n\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Need to Close Left**: If the left boundary `l` is greater than 1, Luba must move to `l` and close all tabs to the left. This requires moving from the current position to `l` and one second to close.\n- **Need to Close Right**: If the right boundary `r` is less than `n`, Luba must move to `r` and close all tabs to the right. If she has already moved to `l` (for closing left), she then moves from `l` to `r` and closes the right side.\n- **Total Steps**: The total steps are calculated by summing the moves required to position the cursor correctly and the time taken to close the tabs. This approach ensures minimal movement and efficient closing operations.",
