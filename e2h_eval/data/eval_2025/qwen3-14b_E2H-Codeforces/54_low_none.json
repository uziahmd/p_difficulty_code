Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me think. In a regular polygon, each interior angle can be calculated, but here the angle we're talking about isn't necessarily an interior angle. Wait, the problem says that v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 are on its sides. So, for example, if we pick three vertices, the angle at v2 is formed by connecting v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So the angle between those two lines.\n\nSo, for a regular polygon, what's the measure of such an angle? Let's think about the regular n-gon. Let me recall that in a regular polygon, the central angles are 360/n degrees. But how does that relate to the angles formed by three vertices?\n\nLet me consider a regular polygon with n sides. Let's say we pick a vertex v2, and then two other vertices v1 and v3. The angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2. For example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 and v3 is two steps away, then the angle would be different than if they are further apart.\n\nWait, maybe there's a formula for the angle formed at v2 when you have k steps between v1 and v2, and m steps between v3 and v2. But since the polygon is regular, perhaps the angle depends on the number of sides between v1 and v3 around the polygon. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in a regular polygon, all the vertices lie on a circle. So, the angle at v2 would be an inscribed angle. Wait, but inscribed angles depend on the arc they subtend. Let me think. Suppose that the points v1, v2, v3 are on the circumference of a circle. Then the angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, no. Wait, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended at the center is twice that of the angle subtended at the circumference. So if the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is θ degrees, then the angle at v2 would be θ/2.\n\nBut in a regular polygon, the arc between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. So suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps (i.e., k edges) along the perimeter. Then the arc length is k*(360/n) degrees. But since the angle at v2 is formed by lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, the arc that's subtended by that angle would be the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Wait, but how many steps are between them?\n\nLet me take an example. For a square (n=4). Let's take vertices 1, 2, 3. If we take angle at vertex 2, with sides connecting to 1 and 3. The arc between 1 and 3 is 2 steps, which is 180 degrees. Then the angle at vertex 2 would be half of that? Wait, but in a square, the angle between adjacent vertices is 90 degrees. Wait, but if you connect 1-2-3, then the angle at 2 is 90 degrees, which is the interior angle. However, if we take vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 would be formed by connecting to 1 and 4. What's that angle?\n\nIn the square, the points are arranged in a circle. The arc between 1 and 4 is 3 steps (since 1-2-3-4), which is 3*90 = 270 degrees. But the angle at 2 would be subtended by the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't include 2. Wait, but the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't include 2 would be the shorter arc? No, the arc that is opposite to the angle. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. Let's think: suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k vertices. For example, in a square, if v1 is 1, v3 is 3, then between them there's one vertex (vertex 2). But if you take v1 as 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the closest possible angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular n-gon, each vertex lies on a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} $. The angle formed at a vertex by connecting it to two other vertices depends on the number of steps between those vertices along the perimeter.\n2. **Inscribed Angle Calculation**: The angle at a vertex $ v2 $, formed by vertices $ v1 $ and $ v3 $, can be derived from the arc subtended by $ v1 $ and $ v3 $ at the center of the polygon. This angle is half the measure of the arc between $ v1 $ and $ v3 $ that does not include $ v2 $.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Distances**: For each possible distance `k` between vertices (from 1 to n-2), calculate the corresponding angle and determine the closest match to the given angle `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import math\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # The angle between adjacent vertices in the polygon\n    central_angle = 360.0 / n\n    \n    # The angle at vertex v2 for a certain step count k\n    # For a regular polygon, when you have k steps between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2)\n    # the angle at v2 is (k * central_angle) / 2\n    # But since we need to choose v1 and v3 such that they are k steps apart around the polygon\n    # excluding v2, the maximum k is n-2 (when v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other but opposite to v2)\n    \n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    best_angle = 0.0\n    \n    for k in range(1, n - 1):\n        angle = (k * central_angle) / 2.0\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n            best_angle = angle\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k for consistency, though any is acceptable\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n                best_angle = angle\n    \n    # Now, we need to find three vertices with this k\n    # Let's choose v2 as 1, then v1 is 2, v3 is 2 + k\n    # But need to ensure that the vertices are within the range [1, n]\n    # So, for example, if v2 is 1, then v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + k\n    # But if k is large, we might wrap around.

But since k can be up to n-2, 2 + k can be up to n\n    # So for example, if n=4 and k=2, v3 would be 2+2=4 which is valid.\n    \n    # However, to make sure that the vertices are distinct and correct, let's pick v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as (2 + k)\n    # But wait, in the case of k steps between v1 and v3 (excluding v2), so if v2 is 1, v1 is 2, then v3 should be 2 + k (but considering modulo n? No, because we are in a regular polygon and k is chosen such that the arc between v1 and v3 is k steps.)\n    # So for example, in n=4, k=2, v2=1, v1=2, v3= (2 + 2) = 4.

The vertices are chosen in a straightforward manner to ensure they are distinct and valid within the polygon's structure.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the closest possible angle using geometric properties of regular polygons and iterate through possible configurations to determine the optimal solution.",
