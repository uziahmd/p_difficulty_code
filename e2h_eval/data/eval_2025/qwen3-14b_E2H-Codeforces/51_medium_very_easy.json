Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input. The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name. The third line is the pile of letters found. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the first two names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host names. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the concatenated string of the first two lines has the same character counts as the third line.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to take the first two strings, combine them into one, then sort them, and compare with the sorted third string. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the combined length of the first two is different from the third? For example, if the sum of lengths of guest and host is not equal to the length of the pile, then it's automatically NO.\n\nSo first check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO. Otherwise, proceed to check the characters.\n\nBut even if the lengths are same, the characters might not match. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Combine guest and host into a single string.\n2. Check if the combined string's sorted version equals the sorted pile string.\n\nYes, that's the straightforward way.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases. Like when the combined string has all letters same as pile, but in different order. But the sorted approach would handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: empty strings? But according to the input description, all lines are non-empty. So no problem.\n\nSo the steps for each test case are:\n\nRead three lines: guest, host, pile.\n\nCheck if the combined length of guest and host equals the length of pile. If not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if the sorted(guest + host) equals sorted(pile). If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nNow, how to read the input?\n\nWait, the input is given as three lines. So in Python, I can read them using input().strip() three times.\n\nBut wait, looking at the example input given:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, but the actual input is three lines. So for each test case, the three lines are the guest, host, and pile.\n\nWait, the example shows three different test cases. Each of the three elements in the list is a separate test case. For example, the first test case's input is:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo the code needs to process each of these three test cases, and output YES, NO, NO as per the example.\n\nWait, but how are the inputs provided? The problem says that the input file consists of three lines. Wait, but the sample input shows three different test cases. Oh, perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, each with their own three lines.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is three lines. So for each test case, the input is three lines. But the sample input shows three different test cases. So the actual input for the program is three lines, but the sample shows three different test cases. So maybe the problem is that the user is supposed to read three lines from stdin, but the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So for each test case, the input is three lines. But in the sample input, there are three test cases, each with three lines. So perhaps the program is supposed to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, the problem's sample input shows that the input is three lines, but the sample input is given as a list of three test cases. Wait, perhaps the original problem is that the user is supposed to read three lines from input, but in the sample input, there are three test cases. But that's confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile.\n\nSo, the program is supposed to read three lines from input. But the sample input shows three different test cases. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but in reality, the program is supposed to read three lines once.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each of the three elements in the list is a separate test case. For example, the first test case's input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich is the first element of the list. Then the second test case is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nAnd third test case is:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nSo the sample input is three test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how is that passed to the program?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as three separate test cases, but the actual program is supposed to read three lines once. So for example, the user runs the program once, and provides three lines as input, and the program outputs YES or NO once.\n\nBut the sample shows that the output is three answers. So perhaps the problem is that the program is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each of the three test cases is presented as three lines, but the actual program is supposed to read three lines once.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is formatted as a list of three test cases, but the actual input for the program is three lines. So the sample input is:\n\nFor example, the first test case's input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich is three lines. The output is YES.\n\nThen the second test case's input is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nOutput NO.\n\nThird test case's input is:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nOutput NO.\n\nSo the sample input is three test cases, each with three lines. But how is that passed to the program? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, but the problem statement says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as three test cases, each with three lines, but the actual program is supposed to read three lines once. So perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read three lines, and output one line (YES or NO).\n\nBut the sample shows that the output is three lines. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nAh, but the way the sample input is presented here is probably a list of three test cases. Each test case is three lines. So for each of these three test cases, the program is supposed to process them and output YES/NO. But how does that work in practice? Because in programming competitions, the input is usually given as a single set of lines. However, in this case, the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as three separate test cases, but the actual program is supposed to read three lines (one test case) and output one line.\n\nBut the sample shows three outputs. So perhaps the problem is that the program is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But the problem statement says that the input is three lines. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement's sample input is written in a way that the three test cases are presented as three separate entries, but the actual input for the program is three lines. But that's not possible. So perhaps the problem statement's sample input is written as three test cases, but the actual program is supposed to read three lines (i.e., one test case) and output one line.\n\nBut the sample output shows three answers. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the program is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But the problem statement says that the input is three lines. Which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the three test cases are given as three separate lines. But that's not the case. The problem says that the input consists of three lines. So for each test case, the input is three lines. So the sample input is three test cases, each with three lines, and the output is three answers.\n\nBut how does that translate into the actual input for the program? For example, in programming competition, the input is given as a single block. So perhaps the program is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But the problem statement says that the input consists of three lines. Which would imply that the program is supposed to process one test case.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me look back at the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo the input is three lines. So the program is supposed to read three lines, process them, and output YES or NO.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as three separate test cases, but in reality, the program is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample output shows three outputs. So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the actual input for the program is three lines. For example, the user is supposed to run the program once, and input three lines. But the sample shows three test cases, which would require the program to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is conflicting. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, each with three lines. So the actual input is three lines, but the sample shows three test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sample input is not in the correct format. Maybe the sample input is three lines, each being the three lines of the input. But that's not clear.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first element is a string that contains three lines. For example, 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' represents three lines. So the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich is the first test case. So the sample input is three test cases. But the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the problem statement's sample input is written in a way that each of the three elements in the list is a separate test case. So the program is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut then, how is the input provided? For example, in programming competition, the input is read from stdin. So perhaps the program is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input consists of three lines. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the sample output has three entries. So perhaps the actual problem is that the program is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's description is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the problem's note:\n\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left. In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\". In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nSo the sample input has three test cases. Therefore, the program must read three test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the standard way is to read all lines from stdin. So for example, if the input is three test cases, each with three lines, then the total number of lines is 3 * 3 = 9 lines.\n\nBut how to process that?\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows that the input is three lines. But perhaps the problem's sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the actual input is three lines. So perhaps the problem statement's sample input is incorrect, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but each test case is three lines. So the program is supposed to read three lines for each test case, and process them. But how many test cases are there?\n\nBut the problem's output says that the sample output is three entries. So perhaps the program is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the input is three lines. This is confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output show three test cases, perhaps the actual problem is that the program should read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. However, the problem statement says that the input consists of three lines. This is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly, and the actual input is three lines. For example, the sample input is three lines, and the sample output is one line. But the sample shows three outputs. This is very confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's note, the first sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\nWhich is a list of three test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the program should process multiple test cases, each of which has three lines. But how?\n\nIn that case, the input to the program would be multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. For example, the input could be:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\nBABBONATALE\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nWhich is 9 lines. The program would process three test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut the problem says that the input file consists of three lines. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's sample input is written in a way that each test case is a single line. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is written in a way that the input is three lines, and the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. But this is not possible. So perhaps the problem statement's sample input is wrong, and the actual input is three lines. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo the input is three lines. So the program is supposed to read three lines, and output one line (YES or NO). But the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. So how?\n\nWell, perhaps the sample input is a list of three test cases, and the sample output is a list of three answers. So the program is supposed to read multiple test cases, each of which has three lines. But how to determine how many test cases there are?\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention anything about multiple test cases. It says that the input is three lines. So this is very confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are given as lists, perhaps the problem is that the program is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the input consists of three lines. Which suggests that the program is supposed to read three lines once.\n\nBut how to reconcile the sample input and output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the actual input is three lines. For example, the first test case's input is three lines, and the output is one line. The sample input shows three test cases, but the actual input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the program is supposed to read one test case (three lines) and output one answer.\n\nBut then, why does the sample output have three answers?\n\nThis is a big confusion. However, given the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the actual problem is that the program needs to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. And the sample input shows three test cases, and the output shows three answers.\n\nSo, the program should read all lines from the input, and process each group of three lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nFor example, the input may be read as a list of lines. Then, for each i in range(0, len(lines), 3), take lines[i], lines[i+1], lines[i+2] as guest, host, pile.\n\nBut how to read the input? Well, in Python, we can read all lines from stdin using sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nSo, for example, if the input is three test cases, each with three lines, then the total number of lines is 9. So the code can process each group of three lines.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input consists of three lines. So this is conflicting. But given the sample input and output, it's likely that the problem expects us to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut then, the problem statement's sample input and output would make sense. For example, the sample input has three test cases, and the sample output has three answers.\n\nBut the problem statement's input description says that the input file consists of three lines. Which would imply that there is only one test case.\n\nThis is very confusing. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the program needs to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut how can we know? Let's look at the problem's example:\n\nSample input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSample output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nSo each element in the input list is a test case, consisting of three lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo the code needs to process each of these three test cases.\n\nBut how is this input provided to the program? For example, in programming competition, the input is usually given as a single block of text. So the input for the program would be:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\nBABBONATALE\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nWhich is 9 lines. The code needs to read them as three test cases, each with three lines.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all the lines, then iterate over them in groups of three.\n\nBut how to handle this in Python?\n\nSo, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them in chunks of three.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input consists of three lines. So this is conflicting. However, given the sample input and output, it's more likely that the problem requires handling multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement's description is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is represented as a single line with \\n separators. For example, the first test case is a single line with three strings separated by \\n. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's sample input is a list of three test cases, but the actual input is three lines, and the sample input is written in a way that each element of the list is a single test case's three lines concatenated with newlines.\n\nBut how to process that?\n\nWell, assuming that the program needs to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines, then the code would read all the lines from input, and for each group of three lines, process them.\n\nBut how to determine how many test cases there are? Well, the number of test cases would be len(lines) // 3, assuming that the input is properly formatted.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So that implies that there is only one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases.\n\nThis is very confusing. But given the sample input and output, perhaps the correct way to proceed is to assume that the program needs to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut since the problem says that the input consists of three lines, perhaps the sample input is incorrect, and the program should process one test case.\n\nBut then, the sample output would have one entry, not three.\n\nThis is a real problem. How to resolve this?\n\nPerhaps the problem statement is written incorrectly. Let's look at the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo the input is three lines. So the program should read three lines from input, process them, and output one line (YES or NO).\n\nThe sample input shows three test cases, but perhaps that's just a formatting issue. Perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but in reality, each test case is provided as three lines. For example, the sample input is three test cases, each with three lines, and the sample output is three answers.\n\nBut how to read that? For example, in programming competition, the program would read from stdin. So if the input is three lines, the program processes them once. But if the input is nine lines, then it processes three test cases.\n\nBut how can we know?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, each with three lines. And the sample output is a list of three answers. So the program must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the actual input consists of multiple test cases, each with three lines.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to write code that reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nFor example, in Python, we can read all lines from stdin, then process them in groups of three.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n    guest = lines[i]\n    host = lines[i+1]\n    pile = lines[i+2]\n    # process and print result\n\nBut this assumes that the input has a number of lines divisible by 3.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So if the code is written for multiple test cases, then in the case of one test case, it would work.\n\nBut the problem's sample input has three test cases, which would be nine lines.\n\nBut given that the sample input is given as three test cases, and the sample output is three answers, I think this is the correct approach.\n\nBut then, how to explain the problem statement's input description?\n\nMaybe the problem statement's input description is for a single test case, and the sample input shows multiple test cases.\n\nIn that case, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines, which implies that there is one test case.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think the correct approach is to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from input, group them into triplets, and process each triplet as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle the input correctly?\n\nNow, the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So for a single test case, the code will read three lines. For multiple test cases, the input would have 3 * N lines.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, which would be 9 lines.\n\nSo the code should process as many test cases as possible, given that the input has 3*N lines.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them in groups of three.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that approach.\n\nNow, the code for each test case is:\n\nguest = lines[i]\n\nhost = lines[i+1]\n\npile = lines[i+2]\n\nThen, check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile). If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing this approach with the sample input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nguest = 'SANTACLAUS'\n\nhost = 'DEDMOROZ'\n\npile = 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nCombined guest + host is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → length is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nPile length is len('SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS') → let's count:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → 18 letters. So lengths match.\n\nSorted(guest + host) should be same as sorted(pile).\n\nYes, so output YES.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nguest = 'PAPAINOEL'\n\nhost = 'JOULUPUKKI'\n\npile = 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'\n\nCombined guest + host: len is 9 + 10 = 19. Pile length is len('JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI') → let's see:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → count letters. Let's see:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → let's count:\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute the length. Let's see:\n\nOriginal guest is 'PAPAINOEL' (length 9), host is 'JOULUPUKKI' (length 10), total 19. The pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' → let's count the letters. Let me count the letters:\n\n\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" → J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → let's count:\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nJ (1), O (2?), let's see:\n\nBreakdown:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → that's 19 letters? Let me count:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ (1)\n\nO (2)\n\nU (3)\n\nL (4)\n\nN (5)\n\nA (6)\n\nP (7)\n\nA (8)\n\nO (9)\n\nI (10)\n\nL (11)\n\nE (12)\n\nL (13)\n\nU (14)\n\nP (15)\n\nU (16)\n\nK (17)\n\nK (18)\n\nI (19). Yes. So length is 19.\n\nSo lengths match.\n\nNow, check sorted(guest + host) vs sorted(pile).\n\nGuest + host: 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI' → let's see:\n\nBut what's the combined letters?\n\nguest: P A P A I N O E L → wait, 'PAPAINOEL' is P A P A I N O E L → letters are: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nCombined letters: guest + host has:\n\nP, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L, J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nNow, the pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'.\n\nLet me sort both.\n\nCombined sorted: let's list all letters.\n\nLet me count each letter.\n\nFor guest + host:\n\nCount of letters:\n\nP: 3 (from guest: 2 P's, host has 1 P?)\n\nWait, guest is 'PAPAINOEL' → letters are P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → P appears 2 times.\n\nHost is 'JOULUPUKKI' → letters are J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → P appears once.\n\nSo total P's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nA: guest has 2 A's. Host has none. Total 2.\n\nI: guest has 1, host has 1 → total 2.\n\nN: guest has 1, host has 0 → 1.\n\nO: guest has 1, host has 1 → 2.\n\nE: guest has 1, host has 0 → 1.\n\nL: guest has 1, host has 2 → total 3.\n\nJ: 1.\n\nU: host has 3 (from U, U, U?), let me see:\n\nHost is JOULUPUKKI → J O U L U P U K K I → U appears at positions 3, 5, 7 → three times.\n\nSo U count is 3.\n\nK: host has 2 K's.\n\nSo the combined letters:\n\nA: 2\n\nE: 1\n\nI: 2\n\nJ: 1\n\nL: 3\n\nN: 1\n\nO: 2\n\nP: 3\n\nU: 3\n\nK: 2\n\nNow, the pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'.\n\nLet's count the letters in the pile:\n\nLet me write the pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nLet's count each letter:\n\nJ: 1\n\nO: 2 (O appears in position 2 and 9?)\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ → 1\n\nO → appears in position 2, and position 9 (assuming the string is J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I).\n\nYes, O appears at positions 2 and 9 → count 2.\n\nU: appears in positions 3, 13, 15 → three times.\n\nL: positions 4, 11, 13? Let me recheck:\n\nThe string is:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nSo:\n\nL appears at position 4, 11, 13 → three times.\n\nN: 1.\n\nA: positions 6, 8 → 2 times.\n\nP: positions 7, 15 → 2 times?\n\nWait, position 7 is P, position 15 is P? Let me count:\n\nPositions (starting from 0):\n\n0: J\n\n1: O\n\n2: U\n\n3: L\n\n4: N\n\n5: A\n\n6: P\n\n7: A\n\n8: O\n\n9: I\n\n10: L\n\n11: E\n\n12: L\n\n13: U\n\n14: P\n\n15: U\n\n16: K\n\n17: K\n\n18: I.\n\nSo P is at position 6 and 14 → two times.\n\nSo P count is 2.\n\nBut earlier, the combined guest + host has P count 3. So in the pile, P count is 2. Hence, the sorted strings are not equal. Hence, output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would correctly output NO for the second test case.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, stripping whitespace (like newlines).\n\nThen, for each group of three lines, process them.\n\nBut what if the number of lines is not a multiple of three? Well, the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So for a single test case, it's okay. But if the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases, perhaps the input is designed to have a number of lines divisible by three.\n\nBut for the purposes of solving this problem, assuming that the code should read all lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n    # process in groups of three\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if len(combined) != len(pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the third test case's pile has an extra L. Let's check.\n\nThird test case:\n\nguest: BABBONATALE\n\nhost: FATHERCHRISTMAS\n\npile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nCombined guest + host is BABBONATALE + FATHERCHRISTMAS → let's calculate the length.\n\nguest length: len(\"BABBONATALE\") → B A B B O N A T A L E → 11 letters.\n\nhost: FATHERCHRISTMAS → F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → 14 letters. Total 11 + 14 = 25.\n\nPile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER → let's count the letters.\n\nBut the sample says that there's an extra L. So the length of the pile is 25 + 1? Or not?\n\nLet me compute the length of the pile.\n\n\"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" → let's count the letters:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R → let's see:\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to count the length.\n\nThe string is:\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R → let's count:\n\nBreak it into parts:\n\nBABCHRISTMAS → B A B C H R I S T M A S → 12 letters.\n\nBONATALLE → B O N A T A L L E → 9 letters.\n\nFATHER → F A T H E R → 6 letters.\n\nTotal 12 + 9 + 6 = 27 letters.\n\nBut the combined guest + host is 11 + 14 = 25 letters. So the pile has length 27, which is longer. Hence, output NO.\n\nThus, the code would output NO for this test case.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code reads all lines from stdin, groups them into triplets, and processes each.\n\nBut what if the input has three lines (single test case)? Then the code would process it correctly.\n\nThus, this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input consists of three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases, which would be nine lines. But the code handles both scenarios.\n\nThus, this code should be correct.\n\nNow, testing the code against the sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\nThree test cases, each with three lines.\n\nThe code will process each triplet and output YES, NO, NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut wait, in Python, when reading from stdin, using sys.stdin, each line includes the newline character. However, when using line.rstrip('\\n'), it removes the newline. But what if the input lines have trailing spaces? According to the problem",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the combined letters from the guest and host names exactly match the letters in the pile, both in count and type.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all input lines from standard input.\n2. **Group Processing**: Process each group of three lines as a separate test case. Each group consists of the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n3. **Validation Check**: For each test case:\n   - Check if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. If not, immediately return \"NO\".\n   - If the lengths match, sort the combined characters of the guest and host names and compare them with the sorted pile of letters. If they match, return \"YES\"; otherwise, return \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if len(combined) != len(pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line and stored in a list after stripping newline characters.\n- **Processing Groups**: The input is processed in groups of three lines, each representing a test case.\n- **Length Check**: Before comparing characters, we check if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. This helps in quickly eliminating cases where the number of letters does not match.\n- **Character Comparison**: Sorting the combined string of the guest and host names and comparing it with the sorted pile ensures that both the count and type of characters match, confirming that the pile can be rearranged to form the required names.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the required conditions using sorting, which is straightforward and effective given the constraints of the problem.",
