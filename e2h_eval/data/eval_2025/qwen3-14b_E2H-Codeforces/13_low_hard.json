For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the notes are ordered in a cyclic way. The order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And then it loops back. So each note has a position, and the distance between two notes is calculated based on their positions. But the distance is measured from the lower to the higher note. Wait, but when you have two notes, like E and C, the distance is 8 semitones because E is higher than C? Or wait, the problem says that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones, and between E and C is 8. Oh right, because the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So when you have two notes, the distance is (upper - lower) mod 12, but considering the order. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones when moving from X to Y in the scale. For example, C to E is 4 semitones. Because the order is C, C#, D, D#, E. So from C to E is 4 steps (each step is a semitone). So the distance between X and Y is (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? But wait, if Y is after X, then it's straightforward. But if Y is before X, then the distance would be (Y's position + 12 - X's position) ?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured along the musical scale. So for example, between C and E is 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. Because if you go from E to C, you can go up by 8 steps (since there are 12 notes total). So the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if you want the distance from X to Y when moving upwards. Wait, no. Let me think: if X is C (position 0), Y is E (position 4). Then the distance is 4. If X is E (position 4) and Y is C (position 0), then the distance is (0 + 12 - 4) = 8. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) if Y is after X, else (Y_pos + 12 - X_pos). But since the notes are cyclic, the distance can be calculated as (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. Wait, no. Because if Y is after X, then (Y - X) is positive, mod 12 gives the same value. If Y is before X, then (Y - X) is negative, mod 12 would give (Y - X + 12) which is the correct distance. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. But wait, in the example of C and E, the distance is 4, which is (4-0) mod 12 = 4. For E to C, (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Yes, that's correct. So the distance from X to Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. So, for example, if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is exactly the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So that's the way to compute the distance between two notes.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its index. Let's create a list of the notes in order. The order given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in some countries, B and H are the same note. Oh right, the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n1",
