For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C. So each note has a position in this list. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11. Then, when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the number of semitones from the first to the second, moving forward in the sequence. For example, distance from C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, D is 2, D# 3, E is 4). But if the notes are in reverse, like E to C, the distance would be 8 semitones because you have to go through all the notes after E until you reach C again. Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. So when considering X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the difference. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance is (total semitones in the scale) minus the difference? Or maybe the distance is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? No, wait the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones along the scale from X to Y. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. Because moving forward from E to C would require going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps.\n\nSo the way to compute the distance between two notes X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper note. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from X to Y, moving upwards. So if X is before Y in the list, then the distance is Y's position minus X's position. But if X is after Y, then the distance is (12 - (X's position - Y's position))? Or maybe (Y's position + 12 - X's position) mod 12? Wait, for example, if X is E (position 4) and Y is C (position 0), then the distance from E to C is 8 semitones. Which is (0 + 12 - 4) = 8. So yes, the formula for the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_pos + 12 - X_pos). But another way to compute it is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf X is C (0), Y is E (4): (4-0) = 4 mod 12 is 4. Correct.\n\nIf X is E (4), Y is C (0): (0-4) is -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. But wait, mod 12 can give negative numbers? No, in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. Wait, for example, (0 - 4) % 12 is 8. So yes, if we calculate (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12, that gives us the correct number of semitones between X and Y, moving upwards.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. So the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones you need to move up from X to reach Y. So for example, if X is E and Y is C, then you have to move up 8 semitones. So the formula is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. So that's how I'll compute the distance between two notes.\n\nSo first, I need to create a mapping from note names to their positions. Let's make a list of the notes in order. The order is given as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G",
