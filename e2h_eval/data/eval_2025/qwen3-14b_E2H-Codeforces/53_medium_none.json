    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm, how do I check all possible substrings and see which ones appear at least twice?\n\nThe brute force way would be to check all possible substrings of the string, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length among those that have at least two occurrences.\n\nBut since the string can be up to 100 characters long, the number of possible substrings is O(n²), which for n=100 is 10^4. For each substring, we can check if it appears again elsewhere. But how to efficiently do that?\n\nLet me think: For each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once we find the maximum such L, return it.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1. The maximum possible length for a substring that can appear twice is floor(len(s)/2). Wait, no. For example, in a string of length 5, a substring of length 3 can appear twice if they overlap. Like 'ababa' has 'aba' twice. So the maximum possible length is len(s) - 1. But for the substring to appear twice, the minimum length is 1. So for each possible length L starting from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1, check if any substring of length L occurs at least twice. Once found, return that L as the answer.\n\nSo the approach is to check for each possible L (starting from largest to smallest) and see if there's a substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once found, return that L.\n\nNow, how to check for each L?\n\nFor each L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears more than once.\n\nBut how to generate all substrings of length L? For example, for L=3, in a string of length 5, there are 3 substrings: positions 0-2, 1-3, 2-4.\n\nSo for each L, iterate through all starting indices from 0 to len(s) - L. For each starting index, take the substring s[i:i+L], and check if it exists again in the string.\n\nBut how to check if it exists again? Well, for each substring, we can collect all occurrences and check if the count is >=2.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking existence, perhaps for each L, we can collect all substrings of that length, and check if any of them appears at least twice.\n\nSo for example, for a given L, we can create a set of substrings. If the size of the set is less than the number of possible substrings (i.e., there's duplicates), then there exists at least one substring that appears twice. However, this approach might not work directly because even if there are duplicates, we need to check if there are at least two occurrences.\n\nWait, but for each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once. For example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So the set would have 'aba' and 'bab', but since 'aba' appears twice, we can note that.\n\nSo for each L, we can iterate through all substrings of length L, and track their counts. If any count is >=2, then return that L as the maximum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the given string s, iterate L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   For each L:\n\n      Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each substring of length L.\n\n      For each i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n          substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n          add to the dictionary.\n\n      Then check if any substring in the dictionary has count >=2.\n\n      If yes, return L as the answer.\n\n- If no such L is found, return 0.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the first sample input, the input is 'abcd', which has length 4. The maximum possible L is 3. Let's see:\n\nFor L=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bcd' — both unique. So no duplicates. Then check L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — all unique. Then L=1: each character appears once. So answer is 0.\n\nWhich matches the first sample.\n\nAnother sample: 'zzz' — length 3. For L=2, the substrings are 'zz', 'zz' — so count is 2. So answer is 2.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut what's the time complexity? For each possible L (up to n), and for each L, we process O(n) substrings. For each substring, we can hash it (O(L) time per substring). So overall, the time is O(n^3) in the worst case. For n=100, that's 1e6 operations, which should be acceptable.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way, but for n=100, even O(n^3) is manageable.\n\nSo let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead the input string. Let's say the input is read as a single string. Wait, the input is given as a list? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as the first line containing the string. Wait, the example shows input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but that's probably a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as a list of strings. Oh, perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is a single string, but the example shows three inputs and outputs. Maybe the example is for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the example is written in a way that the first input line is a list of strings? Or perhaps the example is written as a list, but in reality, the input is a single string.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. So for example, in the sample input, perhaps the input is a single string, but the example shows three different test cases. For example, the sample input may be three separate test cases. But the code is supposed to read a single string and output the answer.\n\nBut the example shows input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and outputs ['0', '3', '2']. So perhaps the actual input is a list of strings, but the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is written in a way that the input is a list of test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. So perhaps the example is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read a single string.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo for example, for the sample input, the user would input a single string, and the output is the answer for that string.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different inputs and outputs. So perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, but the code should read one string at a time.\n\nBut how does that work? For example, perhaps the sample input is three lines, each being a test case. But the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So maybe the code should read one line, process it, and output the answer. The sample shows that for three different inputs, the outputs are as given. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement isn't clear.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. So the code should read one line, which is the string, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different strings, and outputs three answers. So perhaps the sample is not in the correct format. Maybe the sample is written as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should read one string per test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. Therefore, perhaps the sample is written as a list of examples, but the actual code should process one string. So for example, in the sample input, the input is 'ababa', and output is '3'.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where the input is a single string, and the sample shows three different test cases. However, the code needs to process a single string.\n\nSo in the code, the input is read as a single string. For example, in Python, the code would read input().strip().\n\nSo the code needs to read a single string, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the example given in the problem is perhaps a list of test cases. For example, the first input is 'abcd', output is 0. Second input 'ababa' gives 3, third input 'zzz' gives 2.\n\nSo the code needs to process one string, and output the answer.\n\nSo now, the code structure.\n\nRead the input string.\n\nThen compute the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nLet me think of the code.\n\nFirst, read the string:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen, for the maximum possible length, starting from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   check if there's a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\nOnce found, return L.\n\nIf none found, return 0.\n\nNow, how to check for each L:\n\nWe can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWe can create a dictionary, or a set, and track the substrings.\n\nBut for checking if a substring occurs more than once, we can use a set. For example, for each substring, if we have seen it before, then return True.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if there's any duplicate.\n\nFor example:\n\nfor L in ...:\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            return L\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\n    # after checking all substrings, if no duplicates, continue\n\nBut wait, this approach would check for any duplicates. However, the first occurrence of a duplicate would trigger returning L. But in this case, since we are checking for L in descending order, once we find any L where there's a duplicate, we can return it immediately.\n\nBut this approach is more efficient, because for each L, once a duplicate is found, we can return that L as the maximum.\n\nSo for example, in the 'ababa' case, when L=3, the first substring is 'aba', then next is 'bab', then 'aba' again. So when processing the third substring, we check if it's in the set. Since 'aba' is already in the set, we return 3.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nBut what about overlapping occurrences? For example, in 'aaaaa', for L=3, the substrings are 'aaa' (positions 0-2), 1-3, 2-4. All are same. So the code would detect that.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef main():\n\n    s = input().strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                return\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    print(0)\n\nBut wait, what about the case where there are multiple substrings of the same length, but some occur twice. For example, if the string is 'abab', then for L=2, the substrings are 'ab', 'ba', 'ab'. The code would check 'ab' (add to set), then 'ba' (add), then 'ab' which is in the set. So returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'zzz' (length 3). For L=2, the substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). The first is added to the set. Then the second is checked, found in the set. So returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when the same substring occurs more than twice? Like 'aaaaa' (length 5). For L=3, the code returns 3 as soon as the second occurrence is found. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring occurs in multiple positions, but not overlapping? For example, 'abcabc', length 6. For L=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bca', 'cab', 'abc'. The code will detect the second occurrence of 'abc' and return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring occurs exactly twice? Like 'abba', for L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'. No duplicates. But for L=1: 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'. So the code would return 1. But the maximum possible is 1. But for the string 'abba', the substring 'b' occurs twice, and 'a' occurs twice. So the code would return 1.\n\nBut what about the string 'aabbaa'? For L=3, substrings are 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa'. No duplicates. For L=2: 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. The first occurrence of 'aa' is at i=0, then again at i=4. So the code returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut what if the string is length 1? Then len(s)-1 is 0, and the loop runs for L in range(0, 0, -1), which doesn't run. Then the code prints 0. Which is correct, since a single character cannot have a substring that occurs twice.\n\nAnother edge case: string of length 2. For example, 'aa'. Then L is 1. For L=1, the substrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). The code checks the first 'a' is added to the set, then the second 'a' is found in the set. So returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aaab' — for L=2, substrings are 'aa', 'aa', 'ab'. The code returns 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nRead the string, loop from max possible L down, check for duplicates in substrings of that length. Return first L where this is found.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in Python, for the case when the string is empty? But the problem says the string is non-empty. So no problem.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input: 'ababa' (the second test case)\n\nn = 5. The loop starts with L=4, then 3.\n\nFor L=4, the substrings are 'abab' (i=0) and 'baba' (i=1). Both are unique. So no.\n\nFor L=3, the substrings are:\n\ni=0: 'aba'\n\ni=1: 'bab'\n\ni=2: 'aba'\n\nSo when i=2, substr is 'aba', which is in the set (added at i=0). So returns 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 'zzz' (length 3). For L=2, the substrings are 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). So returns 2.\n\nSample input 'abcd' (length 4). For L=3: substrings 'abc', 'bcd' — no duplicates. Then L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — no duplicates. Then L=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' — no duplicates. So returns 0.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' (length 5). For L=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0) and 'aaaa' (i=1). So returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n",
