    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. The instability is the max minus min of the remaining elements. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to try removing each element one by one and compute the instability each time, then take the minimum. But wait, if the array is large (like up to 1e5 elements), that approach would be O(n^2), which would be too slow. Because for each element, finding the max and min of the remaining elements would take O(n) time each, leading to O(n²) total time. That's not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let's think about the properties here. The instability after removing one element depends on the max and min of the array after removal. But how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nWell, the original array's max and min are important. But when you remove an element, the new max and min could be either the original max/min (if the removed element wasn't the max or min) or some other value.\n\nWait, but for the case where the array has multiple instances of the max and min. For example, if there are multiple max elements, then removing one of them doesn't change the max. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo maybe the key is to consider the cases where the element being removed is either the max, the min, or something else.\n\nBut how do I find the best element to remove?\n\nLet me think: the optimal scenario is when after removing an element, the new max and min are as close as possible. So perhaps, the best options are to remove either the first occurrence of the max, the first occurrence of the min, or some other element that might reduce the difference.\n\nWait, but what if the array is sorted? Let's think about that. If the array is sorted, then the instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If I remove the first element, the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If I remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. But if I remove some element in the middle, the instability would be the same as the original, unless that element was the max or min.\n\nWait, but in the sorted array, the max is the last element and the min is the first. So if I remove the first element, the new min is a[1], and the max remains a[-1]. Similarly for removing the last element. But if I remove any other element, the max and min remain the same as the original array. Therefore, in this case, the best choice would be to remove either the first or last element, whichever gives the smaller instability.\n\nBut this is only when the array is sorted. However, the original array may not be sorted. So maybe the idea is to sort the array first and then check the possibilities.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when you remove an element, the max and min of the remaining array could be different. However, if the array is sorted, then the max and min are at the ends. So, if I sort the array, then the possible candidates for the best element to remove are the first few elements and the last few elements. Because removing elements from the middle won't affect the max and min, but removing elements from the ends could.\n\nSo, here's an idea: after sorting the array, the minimal instability after removing one element would be the minimum between:\n\n- the instability of the array with the first element removed (so the new min is a[1], and max is a[-1])\n\n- the instability of the array with the last element removed (so the new max is a[-2], and min is a[0])\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements that are the same as the min or max?\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 7]. Then removing the first element (1) gives [1,3,7], instability 6. Removing the second element (1) gives the same. But if you remove the 7, the instability is 3-1=2. Which is better. So, the minimal instability comes from removing the max.\n\nBut in the sorted array, the max is the last element. So, in this case, the best option is to remove the last element. But how do I know that?\n\nSo, perhaps, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between:\n\nthe instability when removing the first element (so the new min is a[1], and the new max is a[-1]),\n\nthe instability when removing the last element (new max is a[-2], new min is a[0]),\n\nand also the instability when",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the remaining array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps us efficiently determine the potential candidates for removal that could minimize the instability.\n2. **Evaluate Edge Cases**: After sorting, the optimal elements to remove are either the first or last element of the sorted array. This is because removing these elements can potentially reduce the range (instability) of the remaining elements.\n3. **Check All Possibilities**: By evaluating the instability when removing the first element and the last element of the sorted array, we can determine the minimum possible instability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    # Check removing the first element\n    instability = a[-1] - a[1]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    # Check removing the last element\n    instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are critical in determining the instability.\n- **Instability Calculation**: By removing the first element, the new instability is calculated using the second element as the new minimum and the last element as the maximum. Similarly, by removing the last element, the new instability is calculated using the second-to-last element as the new maximum and the first element as the minimum.\n- **Efficiency**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and checking the instability for the two edge cases takes O(1) time, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n), which is efficient for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
