She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the operations she can perform. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but within the current bounds of open tabs) or close all tabs to the left or right. Closing tabs is a key operation here because that's how she can eliminate tabs outside the desired range.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed. The initial state has all tabs open, and the cursor is at pos. The desired state is that only tabs [l, r] are open. So, any tabs outside this range need to be closed. But how?\n\nThe challenge is to find the minimal steps to close all tabs not in [l, r]. Let's consider different scenarios based on the position of the current cursor and the target range.\n\nFirst, check if the current tabs are already correct. If l == 1 and r == n, then no action is needed. Also, if the current pos is within [l, r], maybe some steps are needed, but maybe not. Wait, no. Because even if pos is inside, there might be tabs outside that need to be closed. For example, if l=2 and r=4, and the initial tabs are 1-6. Then tabs 1,5,6 need to be closed.\n\nSo the first thing is to determine which tabs need to be closed. Tabs less than l and greater than r. So, the problem reduces to closing all tabs left of l and right of r.\n\nBut how does the closing process work? For example, to close tabs to the left of l, she needs to move the cursor to the position l (since closing to the left of the cursor would close tabs up to i-1). Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\nWhen she closes all tabs to the left of the cursor, it closes [a, i-1], where a is the current minimum tab index. Similarly for the right. But when you close tabs, the a and b values (the min and max of open tabs) change. So, perhaps the optimal way is to first close all tabs to the left of l and then all tabs to the right of r. Or vice versa. But how to do that optimally?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to close both sides with fewer steps. Let's think of possible cases.\n\nCase 1: The target range [l, r] includes the current position. For example, if pos is within [l, r], then maybe we can close the left and right parts by moving to the correct positions and closing.\n\nBut how to model the steps?\n\nLet me think about the steps required to close the left part and the right part.\n\nFor example, suppose we need to close tabs to the left of l. To do that, Luba must move the cursor to l, and then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to move the cursor to r, and close all tabs to the right.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the target range? Let's take an example. Suppose the initial position is pos, and the target is [l, r]. Let's say that l is 2, r is 4, and pos is 3. Then, to close the tabs left of l (i.e., tab 1), she needs to move the cursor to l (position 2), then close left. Then, move to r (position 4) and close right. But how many steps does that take?\n\nMoving from pos (3) to 2 is one step. Then closing takes 1 second. Then moving from 2 to 4 takes two steps (2→3→4). Then closing takes another second. Total steps: 1 (move) + 1 (close) + 2 (move) + 1 (close) = 5 steps. Which matches the first example given in the problem.\n\nWait, the first example input was 6 3 2 4. The output is 5. Which aligns with that scenario.\n\nSo, the idea is that the minimal steps would involve:\n\n- Moving to the leftmost point of the target range (l), then closing left (which removes all tabs left of l).\n\n- Then moving to the rightmost point of the target range (r), then closing right (removes all tabs right of r).\n\nBut the order may vary. For example, maybe closing the right side first and then the left side could be better. But in some cases, the movement steps may be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to close both sides with fewer steps. For example, if the current position is already at l, then closing left would take 1 second. Then moving to r and closing right.\n\nBut what if the target range is such that l is 1 and r is n? Then nothing needs to be done. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother case is when the current position is already in the target range. Let's say l=1, r=5, pos=3. Then, the steps would be to close left (but since l is 1, there are no tabs to the left of l. So no need to close. Then close right (tabs to the right of r, which is 5. So if n is larger than r, then need to close those. But if r is equal to n, then no need.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nDetermine whether there are tabs to the left of l (i.e., l > 1) and to the right of r (r < n). For each of these, we need to perform a close operation.\n\nNow, the steps required would be:\n\nFor the left part: if l > 1, then need to move the cursor to l, and then close. The time to move depends on the current position. Similarly for the right part.\n\nBut how to calculate the movement steps?\n\nLet me think of the steps as follows:\n\nIf we need to close the left part, then we have to move from the initial position to l. Then close. Then, for the right part, move from l to r (if we closed left first) and then close. Or maybe after closing left, the a and b are adjusted. But when you close tabs to the left, the new a becomes l. So, when moving after that, the movement is constrained between a and b. But since we have already closed the left part, the movement is within the current open tabs.\n\nWait, but when we close the left part, the a is l. So, for example, if we have closed all tabs to the left of l, then the current open tabs are [l, ... , r]. So, the movement for the right part would be from l to r. So, the steps for moving from l to r is (r - l) steps. But maybe there's a more optimal way.\n\nBut the problem is that the order of closing left and right can affect the movement steps. For example, if you first close the left, then move to r, or first close the right, then move to l. Which is better?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So, the target is [2,4]. Initially, the open tabs are 1-6. So, the left part is 1, and the right part is 5,6.\n\nIf we first close the left part (tabs 1), then we need to move from pos=3 to l=2 (which takes 1 step). Then close left (1 sec). Then, the current position is at 2. Now, to close the right part, we need to move from 2 to r=4 (steps: 2 steps). Then close (1 sec). Total steps: 1+1+2+1 = 5. Which matches the example.\n\nAlternatively, if we first close the right part. How?\n\nWe need to move to r=4. From pos=3, moving to 4 is 1 step. Close right (tabs 5 and 6). Then, move from 4 to l=2 (steps: 2 steps). Close left (tabs 1). So total steps: 1+1 + 2 +1 = 5. Same as before.\n\nSo in this case, the order doesn't matter. But in other cases, maybe it does.\n\nAnother example: pos is at l. Let's say l=2, r=4, pos=2. So, the steps to close left is zero (already at l). Close left (1 sec). Then move to r (2 steps) and close (1 sec). Total 0+1 + 2 +1 = 4 steps. But if you first close the right, then you need to move from 2 to 4 (2 steps), close (1), then move to l (already there) and close (1). Total 2+1 + 0 +1 = 4 steps again. So same.\n\nSo, the order might not matter in some cases. But what about when the target is such that l is to the left of pos and r is to the right of pos. Like, pos is in the middle of the target range. Then, maybe the steps required to move to l and r can be optimized.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps can be calculated as:\n\nIf there are tabs to the left of l, then the steps required to reach l from the current position (pos) is |pos - l| steps. Then closing left (1 sec). Similarly for the right part: steps to reach r from l (after closing left) is (r - l) steps. Then closing (1 sec). So total steps would be (|pos - l| + 1) + (r - l + 1) ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. Let's suppose that we need to close both left and right parts. Then:\n\nTime = (steps to move to l) + 1 (close left) + (steps to move from l to r) + 1 (close right). \n\nBut steps to move from l to r is (r - l) steps. So total is (|pos - l| + 1) + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - l| + r - l + 2.\n\nAlternatively, if we first close the right part, then the steps would be:\n\nsteps to move to r (from pos) is |pos - r|. Then close right (1 sec). Then steps to move from r to l (which is r - l steps?), but wait, moving from r to l would take (r - l) steps. Then close left (1 sec). So total is |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - r| + r - l + 2.\n\nWhich option is better? It depends on whether |pos - l| or |pos - r| is smaller. But maybe there's a better way. For example, if the current pos is to the left of l, then moving to l is easier, and then moving to r. Or if pos is to the right of r, then moving to r first and then to l.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps for both options (closing left first or right first) can be considered, and choose the minimal one.\n\nBut maybe there's another scenario where you can close both left and right in a smarter way. However, considering that closing left and right requires that the cursor is at l or r respectively, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum of moving to l, closing left, moving to r, closing right. Or moving to r, closing right, moving to l, closing left.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nSo, the total steps for both cases:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nTotal steps: (distance from pos to l) + 1 (close left) + (distance from l to r) + 1 (close right) = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then left.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo, the minimal between option1 and option2 is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut wait, why (r - l) steps? Because moving from l to r requires (r - l) steps. For example, moving from l to l+1, then l+2, etc. So, yes, the number of steps is r - l.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the target range? For example, pos is between l and r. Then, the distance to l is (pos - l) steps, and distance to r is (r - pos) steps. So, for option1, the steps would be (pos - l) + (r - l) + 2. Option2 would be (r - pos) + (r - l) + 2. Which is better? Well, depends on which is smaller between (pos - l) and (r - pos). But perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is (distance to l or r) plus the steps to move between l and r plus 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a scenario where we can close both left and right with fewer steps. For example, if the current position is already at l, then moving to l is zero steps. Then moving to r is (r - l) steps. So steps would be 0 + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut what if the current position is at l and r is l? Then, no movement steps. So total steps is 0 + 1 (close left) + 0 + 1 (close right) = 2. But if l = r, then there's no tabs to the left or right. Wait, no. Let's think: if l = r, then the target is just one tab. So, the tabs to the left of l (if any) and to the right of r (if any) need to be closed.\n\nBut if l = r, then for example, if n is 5, l = 3, r = 3. Then, the tabs to the left (1, 2) and to the right (4,5) need to be closed.\n\nSo, the steps would be to move to l (3), close left (which closes 1 and 2), then move to r (3), close right (closes 4 and 5). But since we're already at 3, moving to r is 0 steps. So steps would be (distance from pos to l) + 1 (close left) + 0 steps (already at r) + 1 (close right). So total steps is |pos - l| + 2.\n\nBut in this case, the movement from l to r is zero steps.\n\nSo, in general, the formula for when we have to close both left and right is:\n\nmin( |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2, |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 )\n\nBut perhaps that's equivalent to (r - l) + 2 + min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|).\n\nBut how do we know whether we need to close left and/or right?\n\nSo first, we need to check if there are tabs to the left of l. That is, if l > 1. Similarly, check if there are tabs to the right of r (r < n).\n\nSo, the problem can be broken into four cases:\n\nCase 1: No tabs to close (l=1 and r=n). Answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Only left tabs to close (l=1, r < n). So need to close right part.\n\nCase 3: Only right tabs to close (r = n, l>1). Need to close left part.\n\nCase 4: Both left and right tabs to close.\n\nLet me think about each case.\n\nCase 2: Close right. How?\n\nWe need to move to r, then close right. The steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBecause once you are at r, closing the right (which is tabs r+1 to n). So steps to move to r, then 1 sec to close.\n\nSimilarly, for case 3: steps are |pos - l| + 1.\n\nFor case 4: steps are min( |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2, |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 ) ?\n\nWait, but why (r - l) steps? Because after moving to l (or r), you need to move to r (or l) to perform the second close. So for example, moving from l to r takes (r - l) steps.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the target range? For example, pos is between l and r. Then, moving to l takes (pos - l) steps. Then moving from l to r takes (r - l) steps. So total steps for movement is (pos - l) + (r - l) steps. Then adding the two close operations (each 1 sec). So total steps is (pos - l) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if pos is in the middle, maybe you can move directly to r first, then to l. But that would be (r - pos) + (r - l) steps. Which may be better or worse than the previous option.\n\nSo the minimal between the two options.\n\nSo the formula for case 4 is min( |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2, |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 ). But (r - l) is fixed. So the difference is between |pos - l| and |pos - r|. So the minimal is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut wait, let me think again. For example, if pos is at l, then |pos - l| is 0. So steps would be 0 + (r - l) + 2 = (r - l) + 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: pos is at r. Then |pos - r| is 0. Steps would be (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nFirst, check if l == 1 and r == n. Then answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck whether there are left tabs to close (left_close = l > 1) and right tabs to close (right_close = r < n).\n\nDepending on these, compute steps.\n\nIf left_close and right_close:\n\nthen steps = min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, no. Because the min is between |pos - l| and |pos - r|. Then add (r - l) + 2. Because the (r - l) is the steps between l and r.\n\nWait, for example, if we choose to go to l first, then steps to move to l is |pos - l|. Then steps to move to r is (r - l). Then 2 closes. So total steps is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nIf we choose to go to r first, steps to move to r is |pos - r|. Then steps to move to l is (r - l) steps (since from r, moving to l would take r - l steps). Then 2 closes. So total steps is |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2. So the minimal between the two options is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nYes.\n\nIf only left_close is true (r == n):\n\nThen, we need to close the left part. So steps are |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBecause we need to move to l, then close left (1 sec). Because after closing left, the right part is already correct (since r == n).\n\nWait, but what if r == n, but l > 1. Then, the left part is l-1, etc. So, after closing left, the right part is already okay (since r is n, so no tabs to the right of r). So, the steps are |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if only right_close is true (l == 1), steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut what if there are both left and right to close, but the pos is already in the target range?\n\nLike, l=2, r=4, pos=3, and n=6. So, need to close left (tabs 1) and right (5,6). Steps would be min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) + (4-2) + 2 → min(1, 1) + 2 + 2 → 1 + 4 = 5. Which matches the first example.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the pos is already at l or r?\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=4. So need to close tabs left (none, since l=2) and right (tabs 5). So, only right to close. So steps is |2 - 4| + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 steps. Let's see: move from 2 to 4 (2 steps), then close right (1 sec). Total 3 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So, need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5). So steps would be min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) + (4-2) + 2 → min(1, 1) + 2 + 2 → 1 + 4 = 5 steps. Which would be moving to l (2 steps?), no. Wait, |3-2| is 1. So steps to move to l is 1 step (3→2). Then move from l to r (2 steps: 2→3→4). Then 2 closes. So 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps. Correct.\n\nNow, what about when l is 1 and r is n? Then, answer is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: when l = r. For example, n=5, l=3, r=3. So, need to close tabs to the left (1,2) and to the right (4,5). So steps would be min( |pos - 3|, |pos - 3| ) + (3-3) + 2 → min(...) is |pos -3|, and (r - l) is 0. So total steps is |pos -3| + 0 + 2.\n\nFor example, if pos is 3: steps is 0 + 0 + 2 = 2. Which is correct. Move to 3 (already there), close left (1 sec), move to 3 (no steps), close right (1 sec). Total 2 seconds.\n\nAnother example: pos=1, l=3, r=3. So steps is |1-3| + 0 + 2 → 2 + 2 = 4. Let's see: move from 1 to 3 (2 steps), close left (1 sec), then move from 3 to 3 (0 steps), close right (1 sec). Total 2+1+0+1 = 4. Correct.\n\nNow, what if the target range is such that l=1 and r <n? So, only need to close right. Steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nFor example, input is 6 3 1 3. Output is 1. Let's see: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3. So, need to close right (tabs 4,5,6). So steps is |3 - 3| + 1 = 0 +1=1. Which matches the second example in the problem.\n\nAnother example: input 5 2 1 5. Output is 0. Since l=1, r=5, which is the entire range. So no steps needed.\n\nSo, putting all this together, the algorithm is:\n\nCalculate:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    answer is 0\n\nelse:\n\n    left_close = (l > 1)\n\n    right_close = (r < n)\n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n\n        steps = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    elif left_close:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_close:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # this can't happen because if l == 1 and r ==n, we already handled earlier\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r <n? Then left_close is false (since l=1), but right_close is true. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r <n, but pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to cover all cases.\n\nBut let's test the third example given in the problem:\n\nInput is 5 2 1 5. Output is 0. Since l=1 and r=5, which equals n=5. So the code returns 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 6 3 2 4. Which is the first example. l=2, r=4. n=6. So left_close is 2>1 → true. right_close is 4 <6 → true. So steps = min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) + (4-2) + 2 → min(1,1) + 2 + 2 → 1 + 4 = 5. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 6 3 1 3. Which is the second example. l=1, r=3. n=6. So right_close is true. left_close is false. So steps = |3-3| +1 = 0 +1 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when the pos is outside the target range? For example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5). So steps is min( |1-2|, |1-4| ) + (4-2) + 2 → min(1,3) = 1 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption: move to l=2 (1 step), close left (tabs 1). Then move to r=4 (2 steps), close right (tabs 5). Total steps 1 + 1 + 2 +1 = 5. Correct.\n\nAnother scenario: pos is to the right of the target range. For example, n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 4,5). So steps is min( |5-2|=3, |5-3|=2) → 2. Then (3-2) =1, +2 → 2 +1 +2 =5 steps.\n\nWhich would be:\n\nmove to r=3 (from 5, steps 2 steps (5→4→3). Close right (tabs 4,5). Then move from 3 to l=2 (1 step), close left (tabs 1). So steps: 2 + 1 + 1 +1 = 5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_close = l > 1\n\n    right_close = r < n\n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n\n        ans = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    elif left_close:\n\n        ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_close:\n\n        ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # impossible, since we checked l==1 and r==n earlier\n\n        ans = 0\n\n    print(ans)\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r <n? Then left_close is false, right_close is true. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r <n, and pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1 and r=3, n=5, pos=4. So need to close right (tabs 4,5). So steps is |4-3| +1 = 1 +1 = 2 steps. Which is moving from 4 to 3 (1 step), then close right (1 sec). Which closes tabs 4 and 5. Correct.\n\nBut what about if the pos is already to the right of r? For example, pos=5, l=1, r=3. Then steps is |5-3| +1 = 2 +1 =3 steps. Which is moving from 5 to 3 (steps 2) and close right (1). Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the target is l=1 and r <n, but the pos is already to the left of l? For example, l=1, r=3, pos=0. But according to the input constraints, pos is between 1 and n. So that's not possible. So the input pos is always valid.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → output 5. According to the code:\n\nl=2 !=1, r=4 !=6. So left_close and right_close are both true. min(|3-2|=1, |3-4|=1) → 1. (r-l) = 2. +2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. n=6. So right_close is true. steps is |3-3| +1 = 1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1 and r=5 (n=5). So output is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3. So need to close left (tabs 1,2) and right (tabs 4,5). So steps is min(|3-3|, |3-3|) + (3-3) +2 → 0 + 0 + 2 = 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=3, r=3. steps is min(|1-3|, |1-3|) + 0 +2 → 2 + 0 + 2 =4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=1, n=5. pos=5. Then steps is |5 -1| +1 = 4+1=5. Which is moving from 5 to 1 (4 steps) and close right (tabs 2-5). But wait, when you close right from position 1, you close all tabs to the right of 1 (i.e., 2-5). So steps are 4 steps to move to 1, then 1 second to close. So total 5 steps. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input: the input is four integers on one line. Wait, the input is given as a single line with four integers. But the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nSo, the input is one line with four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the sample input, the user provided:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut the output is ['5', '1', '0'].\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual code should read one line per test case.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nSo, the code should read one line, split into four integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines, which might be a mistake. But in the problem statement's example, the input is given as three lines, but the output is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But that's conflicting with the problem description.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers...\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. This suggests that perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement's input says that it's only one line. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nIn the sample input, the user has written:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut this is likely a formatting mistake. Perhaps the actual input is three separate test cases, each on their own line. So the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\", which implies that there's only one test case.\n\nThis is confusing. But looking at the problem's sample input and output, the sample input has three lines, and output three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is one line. So perhaps the problem statement's sample input is written in a way that's not accurate. For example, maybe the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code should process them.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is written as three lines for the sake of example, but the actual code should read one line.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nFor example, the first input line is '6 3 2 4' which outputs 5. The second input line is '6 3 1 3' which outputs 1. Third input line is '5 2 1 5' which outputs 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code should read one line of input. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's not accurate. However, in the problem statement, the user says that the code should read input from stdin and print to stdout. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, the problem says that the input is four integers, so the code should read one line, and process that line.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three lines. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. However, the problem says that the code should read one line of input. So, for example, in the first sample input, the code reads one line, and outputs one line.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting the code to read multiple test cases, each on their own line. However, the problem statement says that the input is one line. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo the input is one line. Therefore, the sample input must have been formatted incorrectly. For example, the sample input is three separate test cases, but the problem says that the code should read one line. So perhaps the sample input is written as three lines, but each line is a separate test case, and the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is one line. This is confusing. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem says \"the only line of input\", which suggests that it's one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is using a format where each line is a separate test case. However, in that case, the code should read all lines",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified range [l, r] in her browser, starting from a given cursor position. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the target range [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no operations are needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Tabs to Close**: Check if there are tabs to the left of l (l > 1) and/or to the right of r (r < n).\n3. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - **Both Left and Right Tabs to Close**: Calculate the minimum steps required to move to either end of the target range, then move to the other end and close both sides.\n   - **Only Left Tabs to Close**: Move to l and close the left side.\n   - **Only Right Tabs to Close**: Move to r and close the right side.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_close = l > 1\n    right_close = r < n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n        min_move = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))\n        steps = min_move + (r - l) + 2\n    elif left_close:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_close:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        steps = 0\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the target range [l, r] covers all tabs, no action is needed.\n2. **Left and Right Tabs Check**: Determine if there are tabs to close on both sides of the target range.\n3. **Steps Calculation**:\n   - **Both Sides**: The minimum steps are calculated by considering the shortest path to either end of the target range, moving to the other end, and closing both sides.\n   - **Single Side**: Directly calculate the steps needed to move to the respective end and close that side.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps required using straightforward movement and closure operations, leveraging the constraints and properties of the problem.",
