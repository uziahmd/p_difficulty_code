The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because for a sum to be odd, one has to be even and the other odd. So, if a chest is even, it needs an odd key. If the chest is odd, it needs an even key. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many even and odd chests there are, and similarly count the even and odd keys. Then, match them accordingly. \n\nWait, right. Let me break it down:\n\n- For chests, count the number of even (even_chest) and odd (odd_chest) numbers.\n- For keys, count the number of even (even_key) and odd (odd_key) numbers.\n\nThen, the maximum possible chests that can be opened is the minimum between even_chest and odd_key (since even chests need odd keys) plus the minimum between odd_chest and even_key (since odd chests need even keys). \n\nOh right! Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, but each key can only be used once. So the total for that part is min(even_chest, odd_key). Similarly for the other part. \n\nSo the answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key). \n\nWait, but how do I compute even_chest and odd_chest? Well, iterate through the list of a_i and count how many are even and odd. Same for the keys.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\nn=5, m=4\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\nSo, a_i's parity: 9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So odd_chest is 2 (positions 0 and 4?), even_chest is 3 (positions 1,2,3).\n\nKeys are [8,4,7,20]. Let's see their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7).\n\nSo the first part is min(even_chest=3, odd_key=1) → 1. The second part is min(odd_chest=2, even_key=3) → 2. Total 3, which matches the sample output. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nSecond example input:\nn=5, m=1\na is [2,4,6,8,10], all even. So even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\nkeys is [5], which is odd. So odd_key=1, even_key=0.\n\nSo the first part is min(5,1) → 1. Second part is min(0,0) → 0. Total 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: n=1, m=4. a is [10] (even). Keys are [20,30,40,50] all even. So even_key is 4, odd_key is 0. So even_chest is 1, odd_chest is 0. So min(1, 0) is 0. The other part is min(0,4) → 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the logic seems solid. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nThis should be efficient since it's O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for n and m up to 1e5.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the list a (n elements), then list b (m elements).\n\nCount even_chest: for each number in a, check if it's even. Similarly for odd_chest.\n\nSame for keys: count even_key and odd_key.\n\nThen compute the sum of min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd?\n\nIn Python, for a number x, x % 2 == 0 means even. So for each element in a, we can check that.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\na = list(map(int",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. The key condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. This means that an even chest must be paired with an odd key, and an odd chest must be paired with an even key.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Pairs**: Use the counts to determine the maximum number of valid pairs:\n   - Even chests can only be opened by odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can only be opened by even keys.\n3. **Calculate Result**: The result is the sum of the minimum counts of even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    odd_chest = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chest += 1\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    odd_key = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key += 1\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Parity Counting**: We iterate through the list of chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Pair Matching**: Using the counts of even and odd chests and keys, we determine the maximum number of valid pairs by taking the minimum of the respective counts for each valid pairing (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys).\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the sum of these two minimum values, which gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened under the given conditions.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the solution in linear time relative to the number of chests and keys, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
