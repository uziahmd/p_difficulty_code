She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. \n\nLet me start by understanding the problem thoroughly. \n\nWe have n tabs, and the mouse is at position pos. Each second, she can move left or right (but within the current a and b, which are the min and max of the open tabs). Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the current position. \n\nThe key here is that when she closes tabs, the a and b values change. For example, if she closes tabs to the left of the current position, then the new a becomes the current position's index. Similarly for closing to the right. \n\nSo the challenge is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closes to reach the desired state where only [l, r] tabs are open. \n\nFirst, let's think about the possible scenarios. The initial a is 1, and the initial b is n. But once some tabs are closed, a and b adjust accordingly. \n\nBut since the end goal is to have exactly the tabs [l, r], we need to make sure that all tabs outside this range are closed. \n\nLet me consider the steps needed. \n\nFirst, we need to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. \n\nBut how to do that efficiently? \n\nLet me think about the two main operations: closing left and closing right. \n\nFor example, if the current position is such that she can close all tabs to the left (i.e., the current tab is at l), then she can close them in one move. Similarly for the right. \n\nBut before that, she might need to move the cursor to the correct positions. \n\nSo the problem can be broken down into two parts: closing the left side (tabs before l) and closing the right side (tabs after r). \n\nBut the order in which these are done might affect the total time. \n\nLet me think about the possible cases. \n\nCase 1: The desired interval [l, r] is already the entire range of tabs (so l=1 and r=n). Then no action is needed. So answer is 0. \n\nCase 2: The current position is already in [l, r], and the required closing is only on one side. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nLet me think about the steps required to close the left part and the right part. \n\nFor example, to close the tabs to the left of l, she needs to be at position l, then close left. Similarly, to close the tabs to the right of r, she needs to be at position r, then close right. \n\nBut what if l is not in the current open tabs? No, because the initial tabs are all open, and the desired interval is [l, r]. So l and r are within the initial tabs. \n\nWait, but during the process of closing, the a and b change. However, the problem requires that in the end, the tabs [l, r] are open. So during the process, the steps must be such that closing operations don't accidentally close tabs in [l, r]. \n\nSo the strategy is to first close the tabs to the left of l, and then close those to the right of r. Or vice versa. \n\nBut the order may affect the steps needed. \n\nLet me think of an example. \n\nTake the first sample input: 6 3 2 4. \n\nThe desired interval is 2-4. \n\nInitially, the tabs are 1-6. \n\nThe cursor is at 3. \n\nShe needs to close tabs 1, and 5, 6. \n\nSo how to do it optimally? \n\nIn the sample explanation, she moves to 2, closes left (which would close tab 1). Then moves to 3, then 4, and closes right (closing 5 and 6). \n\nThat takes 5 steps. Let's see:\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 sec. \n\nClose left: 1 sec. \n\nThen move from 2 to 3 (1 sec), then to 4 (another sec). Then close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1+1 + 2 + 1 = 5. \n\nSo the steps are: move to l (position 2), close left. Then move to r (position 4), close right. \n\nBut the movement steps depend on where the current position is. \n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- Determine the steps needed to reach the position where you can close the left part (i.e., position l) and then close it. \n\n- Then determine the steps needed to reach the position where you can close the right part (i.e., position r) and then close it. \n\nBut the order of closing left and right might affect the steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. For example, maybe closing the right first and then the left. \n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps would be to do whichever requires less movement. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nLet me think about the two possible orders: close left first, then right; or close right first, then left. \n\nLet me think about each scenario. \n\nFirst, for closing left (tabs before l) and then right (tabs after r):\n\nTo close left, the cursor must be at l. \n\nTo get to l from the initial position (pos), how many steps? \n\nThe steps needed to move from pos to l is |pos - l|. \n\nOnce there, you can close left (1 sec). \n\nThen, after closing left, the a becomes l. Now, the current position is l. \n\nNow, to close the right part, you need to be at r. \n\nBut the current a is l, and the current b is n. So moving from l to r takes |r - l| steps. Then close right (1 sec). \n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + 1 (for closing left) + |r - l| + 1 (for closing right) = |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2. \n\nBut wait, what if the initial position is already at l? Then |pos - l| is 0. \n\nAlternatively, what if the initial position is already in the [l, r] range? \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nBut what if after closing left, the current position is l, and then moving to r. \n\nBut what about the other scenario: closing right first, then left. \n\nIn that case:\n\nFirst, move from pos to r. Steps: |pos - r|. \n\nClose right (1 sec). \n\nNow, the b becomes r. The current position is r. \n\nThen, move to l (steps |r - l|), and close left (1 sec). \n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2. \n\nSo comparing these two options, which is better? \n\nWhich of the two options (closing left first or right first) gives a smaller total time? \n\nBut there's also another possibility. What if the closing left and right can be done in a way that doesn't require moving all the way? \n\nWait, but to close the left, you need to be at l. Because if you are at any position i in [l, ...], then closing left would close all tabs from a to i-1. But if the current a is 1, then if you are at l, closing left would close all tabs from 1 to l-1. Which is exactly what we want. \n\nSimilarly, if you are at r, closing right would close all tabs from r+1 to n. \n\nSo, the steps for closing left and right are fixed. \n\nTherefore, the minimal steps would be the minimum between the two options: closing left first then right, or closing right first then left. \n\nBut wait, there's another possibility: maybe the current position is already in the [l, r] range, and you can close both sides with fewer steps. \n\nWait, for example, suppose that l is 2, r is 4, and pos is 3. \n\nIf you can close left and right in some way. \n\nBut how? \n\nWell, for example, if you are at position 3, you can close left (which would close tabs from a to 2, i.e., 1 and 2?), but wait, the initial a is 1. If you are at 3, closing left would close all tabs from a (1) to 2 (i-1). That's exactly the left part. Then, you can close right (from 4 to n). \n\nWait, but how? If you are at 3, then closing right would close all tabs from 4 to n. So that's exactly the right part. \n\nSo, in this case, you can do:\n\nClose left (from a=1 to 2) and close right (from 4 to n) in two steps. \n\nBut how to get to the correct position to do that? \n\nIf you are already at position 3, then you can close left (tabs to the left of 3) and then close right (tabs to the right of 3). \n\nBut in this case, closing left would close tabs up to 2, which is exactly what we need. And closing right would close tabs starting from 4. \n\nSo, in this case, the steps would be:\n\nMove from pos to 3 (if not already there) and then two closes. \n\nBut in the first example, the initial pos is 3. \n\nSo, the steps would be: \n\nClose left (1 sec) and close right (another 1 sec). \n\nBut why isn't that the case in the first sample? \n\nWait the first sample input is 6 3 2 4. So l=2, r=4. \n\nIf the current position is 3, then closing left would close all tabs from a=1 to 2 (i-1=2). That's exactly the left part. Then, closing right would close all tabs from 4 (i+1) to 6. Which is exactly the right part. \n\nSo in that case, the steps would be 2 seconds. But according to the sample, the answer is 5. \n\nWait, that's a contradiction. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because when you close the left, the a changes. Let me think again. \n\nIf you are at position 3, and you close left. That would close all tabs from a (initially 1) to i-1 (2). So after closing, the new a is 3 (since the current position is 3, and all tabs to the left are closed). \n\nBut then, when you try to close the right, the current position is 3, and the current a is 3, and current b is 6. \n\nClosing right would close all tabs from i+1 (4) to b (6). Which is exactly what we need. \n\nSo in this case, the steps would be:\n\nMove to 3 (already there), close left (1 sec), close right (1 sec). Total 2 seconds. \n\nBut the sample says the answer is 5. \n\nWait, that's impossible. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → Output is 5. \n\nBut according to this reasoning, it should be 2 steps. \n\nBut that's conflicting. So clearly, my reasoning is wrong. \n\nWait, why? Let me re-examine the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says that when you close tabs to the left or right of the cursor, it closes all tabs in the [a, i-1] or [i+1, b] segments. But after closing, the a and b change. \n\nBut in the scenario where you are at position 3, and you close left (i.e., close tabs to the left of 3). \n\nAt that moment, the current a is 1, and b is 6. \n\nClosing left would close all tabs from a to i-1 (1 to 2). So after that, the new a is 3. \n\nBut now, the current position is 3. \n\nThen, if you try to close the right, you can close all tabs from i+1 (4) to b (6). So that's exactly the right part. \n\nSo that would take two steps. But the sample says that the answer is 5. \n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding of the problem. \n\nWait, what's the problem statement again?\n\nThe problem says that the cursor can move to the left or right, but the movement is constrained by the current a and b. \n\nWait, when you close tabs, the a and b change. But during the movement steps, the movement is constrained by the current a and b. \n\nSo in the scenario where you are at position 3, and you close left (which closes tabs 1 and 2). After that, the a becomes 3, and b remains 6. \n\nNow, the current position is 3. \n\nBut to close the right, you need to be at position 3, and then close right. Which would close all tabs from 4 to 6. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nSo why does the sample say that it takes 5 steps? \n\nAh! Because the sample's explanation is different. But perhaps the sample explanation is not the optimal one. \n\nBut according to the sample input, the output is 5. But according to this reasoning, the answer should be 2. \n\nThis indicates that there's a mistake in my understanding. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the problem statement again. \n\nThe problem says that the initial tabs are from 1 to n. The desired state is to leave tabs l to r. So in the first sample, l is 2 and r is 4. \n\nSo the tabs that need to remain open are 2, 3, 4. \n\nBut when you close left (from position 3), you close tabs 1 and 2? No! Wait, no. Because the current position is 3, and closing left would close all tabs from a (1) to i-1 (2). So that would close tabs 1 and 2. But that leaves tabs 3, 4, 5, 6. Then, when you close right (from position 3), you close all tabs from i+1 (4) to b (6). So that would close tabs 4, 5, 6. \n\nBut that leaves only tab 3. Which is not the desired state. \n\nOh! Oh no! That's the mistake. \n\nAh, so the problem is that when you close left from position 3, you are closing tabs from a (1) to i-1 (2). So that's tabs 1 and 2. But then, when you close right from position 3, you are closing tabs from i+1 (4) to current b (6). So that would close tabs 4,5,6. \n\nSo after that, only tab 3 is left. But the desired state is tabs 2-4. \n\nSo this approach is wrong. \n\nOh! So the problem is that closing left and right in this way is not sufficient. \n\nSo what's the correct way? \n\nAh, the problem is that the left closing must close tabs to the left of l, and the right closing must close tabs to the right of r. \n\nSo, in this case, l is 2, r is 4. \n\nSo the left part is tabs before l (i.e., 1). The right part is tabs after r (5,6). \n\nSo, to close the left part (tabs 1), we need to be at l (2), and close left. Because then, the a is 1, and the current position is 2. Closing left would close tabs from a (1) to 1 (i-1=1). \n\nSimilarly, to close the right part (tabs 5,6), we need to be at r (4), and close right. Then, the tabs from 5 to current b (6) are closed. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nMove to l (2), close left (1 sec). Then move to r (4), close right (1 sec). \n\nBut how many steps does that take? \n\nLet's compute the steps. \n\nInitial position is 3. \n\nMoving from 3 to 2: 1 step. \n\nClose left: 1 sec. \n\nThen, moving from 2 to 4: 2 steps (2→3→4). \n\nClose right: 1 sec. \n\nTotal steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo my previous reasoning was incorrect because I thought that closing left from position 3 would close tabs up to 2, but that would also remove the desired tab 2. \n\nAh! So the mistake was in thinking that closing left from position 3 would close tabs before l (2), but in reality, the desired l is 2. So the left part is tabs before l, i.e., 1. So to close those, you have to be at l (2), then close left. \n\nSo the correct approach is: \n\nTo close the left part (tabs < l), you need to be at l, and then close left. \n\nSimilarly, to close the right part (tabs > r), you need to be at r, and then close right. \n\nSo the steps required are: \n\n- Move to l, close left (cost: |pos - l| + 1)\n\n- Move to r, close right (cost: |current position after previous steps - r| + 1)\n\nBut the current position after closing left is l. So moving from l to r takes |r - l| steps. \n\nTotal steps for this path: |pos - l| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nAlternatively, if you first close the right part (by moving to r, closing right), then move to l and close left. \n\nThe steps would be: |pos - r| + 1 (for closing right) + |r - l| (moving from r to l) + 1 (closing left) → |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nSo the minimal between these two options. \n\nBut what if l and r are adjacent, or if l is r? \n\nAlso, there are cases where you don't need to do either. \n\nFor example, if the current [l, r] is already the entire range (l=1, r=n), then no steps are needed. \n\nAnother example: if the current pos is already in the [l, r] range, and l is 1 and r is n. Then nothing to do. \n\nSo the first thing to check is whether the current [l, r] is already the entire range. \n\nBut also, there's a case where the initial position is already in the [l, r] range. \n\nBut what if the initial position is not in [l, r]? \n\nFor example, if l is 2, r is 4, and pos is 1. \n\nThen, the steps would involve moving to l (2), then closing left (which would close tab 1). \n\nBut then, the movement steps are |1 - 2| = 1 step. \n\nSo, the general formula for the minimal steps is the minimum between the two options (close left first or close right first) plus the movement steps. \n\nBut what if l is equal to r? Then, we need to close both sides. \n\nWait, for example, l = r = 3, n=5. So the desired tabs are just 3. \n\nSo, we need to close tabs 1-2 and 4-5. \n\nWhich requires moving to l (3), closing left (which closes 1-2), then moving to r (3) again, and closing right (which closes 4-5). \n\nBut since l and r are same, the movement steps between them is zero. \n\nSo total steps: |pos - l| + 1 (for closing left) + 0 (movement) + 1 (closing right) = |pos - l| + 2. \n\nBut in this case, the movement steps are |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2 = |pos - l| + 0 + 2. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo the formula seems correct. \n\nNow, what about when the desired range includes the entire current tabs? Like l=1 and r=n. Then, no steps are needed. \n\nSo the code must first check if l == 1 and r == n. If so, output 0. \n\nOtherwise, we need to compute the minimal steps between the two options. \n\nBut there's another scenario: when the current position is already in the [l, r] range. \n\nBut even so, the steps are as per the formula. \n\nBut what if the desired l is 1, and r is 5, and the initial pos is 3. Then, no steps are needed. \n\nBut what if l is 1, r is 5, but the initial pos is 6 (but that's impossible, since n is 5). \n\nSo, the code needs to check if the current [l, r] is already the entire range. \n\nBut how to check that? \n\nIf l == 1 and r == n → yes. \n\nElse, no. \n\nSo, the first step in the code is to check if l == 1 and r == n. If so, output 0. \n\nOtherwise, proceed. \n\nNow, the next thing is to check whether the current position is already in the [l, r] range. \n\nBut even if it's not, we need to move to l or r. \n\nBut what if the current position is already in [l, r]? \n\nFor example, pos is 3, l is 2, r is 4. \n\nThen, moving to l (2) takes 1 step. \n\nBut if you are already in the [l, r] range, then the movement steps are |pos - l| or |pos - r|, depending on which option you choose. \n\nSo, the code can proceed with the formula. \n\nSo, the minimal steps is min( (steps to move to l and then to r) , (steps to move to r and then to l) ). \n\nBut how to compute those steps. \n\nLet me formalize the two options:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then close right. \n\nTime for this option: \n\nmove_steps_to_l = |pos - l| \n\nthen close left (1 sec). \n\nThen, move from l to r: |r - l| steps. \n\nthen close right (1 sec). \n\nTotal: move_steps_to_l + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2. \n\nOption 2: Close right first, then close left. \n\nmove_steps_to_r = |pos - r| \n\nclose right (1 sec). \n\nmove from r to l: |r - l| steps. \n\nclose left (1 sec). \n\nTotal: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2. \n\nSo the minimal between the two options. \n\nBut what if l is to the right of r? No, because in the input, l ≤ r. \n\nSo, the code can compute the two options and take the minimum. \n\nBut there's another case: when l is 1, and we don't need to close anything to the left. \n\nFor example, if l is 1, then closing left is not needed. \n\nSimilarly, if r is n, then closing right is not needed. \n\nSo, the code must first check whether the left part (tabs before l) need to be closed, and similarly for the right. \n\nSo, the problem is not always requiring closing both left and right. \n\nSo, the code needs to check:\n\nIf l > 1 → need to close left part. \n\nIf r < n → need to close right part. \n\nSo, for example, if l is 1 and r is 5, and n is 5, then no steps are needed. \n\nBut if l is 1 and r is 4, n is 5, then need to close the right part. \n\nSo, the code needs to handle these cases. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCheck if the desired interval is the entire range. If yes, output 0. \n\nElse:\n\nCompute the required steps based on whether left and/or right need to be closed. \n\nSo, if l == 1 and r == n → 0. \n\nElse:\n\nIf l == 1, then no need to close left. Only need to close right. \n\nIf r == n, then no need to close right. Only need to close left. \n\nIf both l == 1 and r == n → handled earlier. \n\nSo, for example, if l is 1 and r < n: \n\nWe need to close the right part. \n\nSo, how to do that? \n\nWe need to move to r, then close right. \n\nThe steps would be |pos - r| + 1. \n\nBut what if the current position is already in [l, r] (which is [1, r])? \n\nBut in that case, moving to r would take |pos - r| steps. \n\nSimilarly, if r is n, then we need to close left. \n\nSo, the code needs to handle four cases:\n\nCase A: Need to close left and right. \n\nCase B: Need to close left only. \n\nCase C: Need to close right only. \n\nCase D: Need to close neither (already handled). \n\nSo, for case B: close left only. \n\nHow? \n\nWe need to move to l, then close left. \n\nSteps: |pos - l| + 1. \n\nBut what if the current position is already at l? Then steps are 1. \n\nSimilarly for case C: steps are |pos - r| + 1. \n\nBut what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range? \n\nBut for example, in case B: l is 1, r is 4 (n=5). So the desired interval is [1,4]. So need to close right (tabs 5). \n\nTo do that, need to move to r (4), then close right. \n\nSo steps: |pos - 4| + 1. \n\nBut what if pos is 5? Then, moving to 4 requires 1 step. Then close right (which closes 5). \n\nBut in that case, the current a is 1, and the current position is 4. \n\nSo, closing right would close tabs from 5 to 5 (since b is 5). \n\nYes. \n\nSo, for case B, the steps are |pos - l| + 1. \n\nFor case C, steps are |pos - r| + 1. \n\nFor case A, steps are min( option1, option2 ), where option1 is |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2, and option2 is |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe code should first check if l == 1 and r == n. If yes, output 0. \n\nElse:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n → no. \n\nThen, check if l == 1 → need to close right only. \n\nCheck if r == n → need to close left only. \n\nElse, need to close both. \n\nSo, let's code this logic. \n\nLet me think of the sample input. \n\nSample 1: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. n=6. So l != 1, r !=6. So case A. \n\nSo steps for option1: |3-2| + |4-2| + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. \n\noption2: |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. So min is 5. \n\nWhich matches the sample output. \n\nSample 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. n=6. So need to close right (tabs 4-6). \n\nSo steps: |3 - 3| (since r is 3) + 1 → 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample. \n\nSample 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. n=5. So output 0. \n\nAnother test case: input 5 2 1 3. So l=1, r=3. n=5. Need to close right (tabs 4-5). Steps: |pos - r| + 1 → |2-3| +1 = 1 +1 = 2. \n\nBut what if pos is 3? Then steps would be 0 +1 = 1. \n\nAnother example: input 5 5 1 3. So l=1, r=3. Need to close right. So steps are |5-3| +1 = 2 +1 =3. \n\nSo, the code should handle these cases. \n\nNow, how to implement this in code. \n\nThe code will read n, pos, l, r. \n\nFirst, check if l == 1 and r == n → print 0. \n\nElse:\n\nif l == 1 and r < n: need to close right. steps = |pos - r| + 1. \n\nelif r == n and l > 1: need to close left. steps = |pos - l| + 1. \n\nelse: need to close both left and right. \n\nIn this case, compute option1 and option2. \n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is n? Already handled. \n\nBut what if l is 1 and r is not n. Then, need to close right. \n\nSimilarly for r being n. \n\nSo, code steps:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    if l == 1:\n\n        # need to close right\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    elif r == n:\n\n        # need to close left\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # need to close both left and right\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n        steps = min(option1, option2)\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but this is not entirely correct. \n\nBecause, for example, when l is not 1, but r is n. Then, we need to close left. \n\nBut what if l is 2, r is 5, n is 5. Then, need to close left (tabs 1). \n\nSo steps is |pos - l| + 1. \n\nYes. \n\nBut let me think of a case where l is not 1 and r is not n. \n\nSo, for example, l=2, r=4, n=6. \n\nWhich is the first sample. \n\nSo, code computes option1 and option2. \n\nBut what about when the current position is already in the [l, r] range? \n\nLike, pos is 3. \n\nSo, for option1, |3-2| + |4-2| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: pos is 2. \n\noption1: |2-2| + 2 + 2 = 0 + 2 + 2 =4. \n\noption2: |2-4| + 2 + 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 =6. So min is 4. \n\nSo steps would be 4. \n\nBut what is the actual steps? \n\nMove to l (already there). Close left (1 sec). Then move to r (4) → 2 steps. Close right (1 sec). Total 1 + 2 + 1 =4. Correct. \n\nSo code seems correct. \n\nBut let's think of another case where the pos is outside [l, r]. \n\nFor example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. \n\nSo need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 4,5). \n\nSo steps:\n\nOption1: |1-2| + |3-2| + 2 → 1 +1 +2=4. \n\nOption2: |1-3| + 1 +2 → 2 +1 +2=5. So min is 4. \n\nWhich would be: move from 1 to 2 (1 step), close left (1 sec). Then move to 3 (1 step), close right (1 sec). Total 1+1+1+1=4. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother case: pos is 5, l=2, r=3. \n\nOption1: |5-2|=3 steps to move to l. Then 1 sec. Then move to r (3-2=1 step). Then 1 sec. Total 3+1+1+1=6. \n\nOption2: |5-3|=2 steps to move to r. Close right (1 sec). Then move to l (3-2=1 step). Close left (1 sec). Total 2+1+1+1=5. \n\nSo min is 5. \n\nSo code would compute option1=3 + 1 + 2 = 3+1+2? Wait no. \n\nWait option1 is |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2. \n\npos is 5, l=2, r=3. \n\nSo |5-2| = 3. |r-l| is 1. 3 + 1 + 2 = 6. \n\noption2 is |5-3| + |r-l| + 2 → 2 + 1 + 2 =5. \n\nYes. \n\nSo code returns 5. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo this seems to handle all cases. \n\nBut what about when the desired range is [l, r], and the current pos is already in the [l, r] range. \n\nFor example, pos is 2, l=2, r=3, n=5. \n\nSo need to close right (tabs 4-5). \n\nSteps: |2-3| + 1 → 1 +1 = 2. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: pos is 3, l=2, r=3, n=5. \n\nNeed to close right (tabs 4-5). Steps: |3-3| +1 → 0 +1=1. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, let's think about the case where l is 1 and r is not n. \n\nFor example, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3. \n\nNeed to close right (tabs 4-5). Steps: |3 -3| +1 = 1. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother case: pos is 5, l=1, r=3. Steps: |5-3| +1= 2+1=3. \n\nWhich would be: move from 5 to 3 (2 steps), then close right (1 step). \n\nYes. \n\nNow, let's think about the case where l is not 1, r is not n. \n\nBut the current pos is already in [l, r]. \n\nFor example, n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. \n\nWhich is the first sample. \n\nThe code computes option1 and option2 as 5. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases. \n\nBut what about when the desired l and r are such that l is 1 and r is n? \n\nWe have already handled that case. \n\nNow, let's check the second sample input:\n\nSample 2: 6 3 1 3 → output is 1. \n\nIn this case, l=1, r=3, n=6. \n\nSo, since l=1 and r <n, steps is |3 -3| +1 = 0+1=1. Correct. \n\nSample 3: 5 2 1 5 → output 0. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: input is 5 2 1 5 → output 0. \n\nAnother case: input 5 2 2 4. So l=2, r=4. n=5. \n\nSo, need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tab 5). \n\nSo code computes option1 and option2. \n\noption1: |2-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 0 +2 +2=4. \n\noption2: |2-4| + 2 + 2 → 2 +2+2=6. So min is 4. \n\nWhich would be: move to l (2), close left (1 sec). Then move to r (4) → 2 steps. Close right (1 sec). Total 0+1 +2+1=4. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother case: pos is 1, l=2, r=4. \n\nSo steps for option1: |1-2| + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2=5. \n\noption2: |1-4| + 2 + 2= 3 + 2 + 2=7. So min is 5.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while efficiently moving the cursor and closing tabs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l = 1 and r = n), no action is needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Closing Only Left or Right**: If the segment starts from the first tab (l = 1) or ends at the last tab (r = n), we only need to close tabs on one side. The steps required are calculated based on the distance from the current cursor position to the respective end of the segment.\n3. **Closing Both Sides**: If both sides need to be closed, we consider two strategies:\n   - Move to the left end (l) first, then move to the right end (r).\n   - Move to the right end (r) first, then move to the left end (l).\n   The minimum steps from these two strategies are chosen.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    if l == 1:\n        # Need to close right part\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    elif r == n:\n        # Need to close left part\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    else:\n        # Need to close both left and right\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n        steps = min(option1, option2)\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: Directly checks if the segment [l, r] is the entire range of tabs, which means no closing is needed.\n- **Closing One Side**: When the segment starts at the first tab or ends at the last tab, only one side needs closing. The steps are calculated based on moving to the respective end and closing.\n- **Closing Both Sides**: For segments that require closing both sides, two strategies are evaluated to determine the minimum steps required. The optimal strategy is chosen by comparing the steps needed for each approach.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by considering all possible scenarios and choosing the optimal path.",
