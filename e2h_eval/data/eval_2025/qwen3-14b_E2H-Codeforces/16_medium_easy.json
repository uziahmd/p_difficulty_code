Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads. Each road is a line equation. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home's block to university's block. A step is moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. So, adjacent blocks through a line segment (not just a point) are considered adjacent.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? Well, each block can be considered as a node in a graph, and edges exist between nodes if their regions share a common border. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between two nodes (the home's block and the university's block).\n\nBut the challenge is how to represent these blocks and determine adjacency. Since there are n roads, the number of regions can be very large. For example, with n lines, the maximum number of regions is O(n²), but for n=300, that's 90,000 regions. But considering that each step is moving across a line, perhaps there's a smarter way to model the problem without enumerating all regions.\n\nWait, but how can we model the blocks? Maybe instead of considering each block, we can model the problem based on the positions relative to each line. Because each line divides the plane into two halves. The position of a point relative to a line can be determined by the sign of the equation ax + by + c. For example, if a point (x,y) is on one side of the line, then ax + by + c is positive, and on the other side it's negative. Since the home and university are not on any line, their positions relative to each line are well-defined.\n\nNow, here's an idea: each block can be represented by a vector of signs. For each line, the block is on one side of the line, so for each line, we can note whether the point is in the positive or negative half-plane. However, since the arrangement of lines can create regions, the sign vector must be consistent with the arrangement of lines. But even so, two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one line's sign. Because moving across a line would flip the sign of that line. But wait, if two regions differ in exactly one line's sign, then they share a common border (the line itself). But if they differ in more than one line's sign, then perhaps they are not adjacent. So, the adjacency between regions is determined by differing in exactly one line's sign.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the two regions are separated by exactly one line. But maybe there's a case where two regions are separated by multiple lines, but still adjacent? No, I think that's not possible. Because if two regions are adjacent, their boundary is a line segment. Which implies that they are separated by exactly one line. Because if they were separated by two lines, then their boundary would be the intersection of those two lines, which is a point. So, the regions would not share a common boundary of non-zero length. Therefore, two regions are adjacent if and only if they differ in exactly one line's sign. \n\nSo, the key insight here is that each region can be uniquely identified by the sign of each line's equation evaluated at a point in that region. And moving from one region to another requires flipping exactly one sign. Therefore, the problem becomes similar to a graph where each node is a binary string (for each line, whether it's positive or negative), and edges connect nodes that differ in exactly one bit. However, the actual number of regions is 2^n, which is impossible for n=300. So, this approach is computationally impossible for n=300. \n\nBut wait, that's not feasible. For n=300, 2^300 is way too big. So there's no way to model this directly. So there must be another way.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the minimal number of steps between two points. Let me think: the home and university are two points. Each step corresponds to crossing a line. So the minimal steps is the minimal number of lines that you need to cross to get from the home's region to the university's region. Because each crossing flips the sign for one line. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of lines that separate the home and university, such that each step crosses one line.\n\nBut how to model this? Let me think of it as a BFS problem. Each state is the set of lines that have been crossed. Wait, but that's again not feasible. Alternatively, think of the problem as the minimal number of lines that you need to cross. For example, if the home and university are in the same region, then zero steps. Otherwise, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of lines that separate them.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph where each node represents the current \"sign configuration\" of the lines. However, since we can't track all possibilities, perhaps we can model the problem as a BFS where each state is the current position (home or university) and the number of steps taken. Wait, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of each line as a hyperplane. The home and university are points in the plane. The minimal steps is the minimal number of hyperplanes (lines) that you need to cross to get from the home to the university. Each crossing changes the sign of one line. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of lines that separate the home and university, where each line is crossed once. However, the lines are arranged such that each line divides the plane into two parts. The minimal number of crossings is the minimal number of lines that you need to cross to go from home to university. \n\nBut how to compute this? For example, if the home and university are on opposite sides of a single line, then you can cross that line once. So the answer is 1. If they are separated by two lines, then you need to cross both. But how to find this?\n\nWait, but the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of lines that you have to cross. Each step is crossing a line. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of lines that separate the home and university. However, this is similar to the concept of the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university. Because each line contributes a bit (positive or negative). The Hamming distance between the two vectors would be the number of lines that separate the home and university. But since each step can cross one line, the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors. Wait, but that's only if the lines are independent. But perhaps there are dependencies. For example, if the home and university are on opposite sides of two lines, but those two lines are parallel. Then, the Hamming distance is 2, but perhaps you can cross one line and then cross another line, but maybe there's a way to reach the destination with fewer steps. Wait, no. Because if two lines are parallel, then the regions between them are separated by those lines. For example, if the home is on one side of both lines, and the university is on the other side of both lines, then you need to cross both lines. So the Hamming distance would be 2, and the minimal steps is 2. So, perhaps the minimal steps is exactly the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and the university.\n\nBut why? Because each step allows you to cross a line. So, for each line that separates the home and university, you need to cross it once. So, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university. So, the problem reduces to counting how many lines have the home and university on opposite sides. Because for each such line, you need to cross it once. And since each crossing can be done in one step, the minimal steps is exactly the count of such lines.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me test with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 lines: 0x+1y+0=0 (y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0). \n\nLet's compute for each line whether home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nFor first line y=0: home is (1,1) → 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0. University is (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So opposite signs. So this line contributes to the count.\n\nSecond line x=0: home is 1>0, university is -1<0. Also opposite. So total count is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nIn the second sample input, the home is (1,1), university (-1,-1), and three lines: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. Let's check each line:\n\nLine 1: x=0. Home is +, univ is -, so opposite. Line 2: y=0. Same as above. Line 3: x + y -3 =0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0. For univ (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. Same sign. So this line does not contribute. So total count is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo that seems to fit. So the answer is the number of lines that separate home and university. \n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each step allows us to cross one line. So, if there are k lines separating them, then you need to cross each of them once. But how can you cross them in sequence? Because crossing one line may not affect the others. For example, suppose you have two lines that cross each other. Suppose home is in one region, and university is in the opposite region across both lines. Then, you can cross one line, then cross the other. So two steps. Which is the same as the count.\n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where some lines are crossed multiple times, but the minimal steps is less than the count? For example, suppose there are three lines that separate home and university. But perhaps crossing one line can somehow allow you to cross two others in one step? No, because each step is crossing a single line. So, for each line that separates the two points, you must cross it once. Hence, the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nSo the solution is to compute, for each line, whether the home and university are on opposite sides of that line. The number of such lines is the answer.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because in some cases, maybe the home and university are separated by multiple lines, but there's a path that crosses fewer lines. But according to the earlier reasoning, that's not possible. Because each line that separates the two points must be crossed once. So if there are k such lines, you need to cross them all. But how do we know that there's a path that crosses exactly those lines once?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose there are two lines that cross each other. The home is in one quadrant, and the university is in the opposite quadrant. So, the two lines separate them. So the answer is 2. But if you cross one line, then cross the other, you get to the destination. So yes, two steps. So the answer is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three lines. The home and university are separated by two lines. Then the answer is 2. So, regardless of the arrangement, the answer is the number of lines that separate them.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many lines have the home and university on opposite sides of them.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each line, compute the value of (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) and (a*x2 + b*y2 + c). If their product is negative, then the line separates them, so count it.\n\nThe answer is the count of such lines.\n\nWait, but why? Because the home and university are in different regions. The minimal steps required to move between them is the number of lines that separate them. Because each line that separates them must be crossed once. And each crossing is a step.\n\nSo the problem is as simple as that. So the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), the university coordinates (x2, y2), then read n lines. For each line, compute the sign of the home and the sign of the university. If they are different, increment the count. The answer is that count.\n\nWait, but why does that work? Let me think again. Because each time you cross a line, you change the sign for that line. So, to get from the home's region to the university's region, you need to flip the signs for all lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. Each such line must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where crossing a line that doesn't separate them (i.e., same sign for home and university) allows you to reach the university? For example, suppose there are two lines. Home is on the same side of both lines as the university. Then the answer is zero steps. But if there's a third line that separates them, then the answer is 1. But how?\n\nBut if the home and university are in the same region, then the answer is zero. But how can that be? Because the lines divide the plane into regions. If the home and university are in the same region, then they are connected via a path that doesn't cross any line. So the answer is zero. But if there's a line that separates them, then the answer is the count of such lines.\n\nSo the code is correct. So the problem reduces to counting the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each such line must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is the number of such lines. Because each step crosses exactly one line, and each line that separates them must be crossed once.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Lines are y=0 and x=0.\n\nFor y=0: home is (0*1 + 1*1 + 0) = 1 >0. University is 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. Product is negative → count +=1.\n\nFor x=0: home is 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1>0. University is 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. Product is negative → count +=1. Total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three lines: x=0, y=0, x + y -3 =0.\n\nFor x=0: same as before, count +=1.\n\nFor y=0: same, count +=1.\n\nThird line: x + y -3 =0. For home: 1+1-3 = -1. For university: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Both negative. Product is positive. So not counted. So total is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if home and university are in same region. Suppose no lines. Then answer is 0. If there are lines but none separate them. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by one line. Answer is 1.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nSo the code is simple: read the two points, then for each line, compute the value for each point, check if their product is negative. Count how many times that happens. Output that count.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the home and university are separated by multiple lines, but some of them are redundant? Like, if there are two lines that are parallel and both separate them. Then, the count is 2. But you need to cross both lines, so steps is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is as simple as that.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nFor each line:\n\nval1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\nval2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n   count +=1\n\nOutput count.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each line that separates the two points contributes to the count. And that count is the minimal steps. But why is that the case?\n\nBecause the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each such line must be crossed once. And each crossing is a step. So the minimal steps is exactly the count.\n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where you can cross some lines and then cross others, but the number is less than the count?\n\nWell, suppose there are two lines that separate the two points. Then, you have to cross both. Because each line divides the plane into two regions. If you cross one line, you are in a region that is on the other side of that line. But the other line may still separate you from the university. So you have to cross both. Hence, the minimal steps is two.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the problem is much easier than I thought. So the code is straightforward. Let me code that.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So the val1 and val2 can't be zero. So for each line, val1 and val2 are non-zero. So their product is positive or negative. So the code is safe.\n\nYes. So the code is as simple as that.\n\nNow, let me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor first line (0,1,0): val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line (1,0,0): val1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1. product -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nFirst line (1,0,0): val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 =1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 =-1. product negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond line (0,1,0): val1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1 → product negative → count +=1.\n\nThird line (1,1,-3): val1 is 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 is 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0 → no count. So total 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for samples.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, for each line, compute a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each line:\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, the input is given as per the problem statement. Let me check the input format.\n\nThe input is:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines, each with a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nSo code in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    count = 0\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n            count +=1\n\n    print(count)\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings. But the code is supposed to read from stdin. So the code is correct.\n\nBut why in the sample input, the first input is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut that's probably for testing purposes. But the code reads from stdin normally.\n\nSo the code is correct. Let me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives count 2. Output is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich gives count 2. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are same. But the problem says that it's guaranteed that neither is on a road. But the code would output 0 steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by 0 lines. So output 0.\n\nAnother case: one line that separates them. Output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct. So that's the solution.\n",
