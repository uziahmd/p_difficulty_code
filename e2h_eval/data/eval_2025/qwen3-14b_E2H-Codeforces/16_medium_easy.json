Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. Each road divides the plane into regions (blocks). The key is to model these blocks and find the shortest path between the home and university blocks. But how do we represent the blocks and their adjacency?\n\nHmm. Since directly representing each block isn't feasible (as there could be exponentially many regions), perhaps we can model the problem using BFS, where each state is a block, and transitions are between adjacent blocks. But how do we determine which blocks are adjacent?\n\nWait, but how can we uniquely identify each block? Well, each block can be represented by the set of roads that separate it from the home block. But that seems too vague. Alternatively, think about the parity of the regions. For example, each line divides the plane into two parts. The position of a point relative to each line can be determined by the sign of the equation. So, for each line, a point is either on one side or the other. The combination of these signs for all lines defines the block.\n\nBut since there are n lines, the number of possible combinations is 2^n, which for n=300 is way too big. That's impossible to handle directly. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: The movement between blocks is allowed when they share a common border. This means that two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one line. Wait, no. Because two adjacent blocks would be separated by a single line. But when you cross a line, you enter a different block. So, each time you cross a line, you move to a neighboring block. But how does that translate into adjacency?\n\nWait, the problem says that moving from one block to another is allowed if their common border has a non-zero length. Which implies that the two blocks share a common segment of a road (i.e., they are separated by exactly one road). So, each block is adjacent to other blocks that are separated by exactly one road. Therefore, the adjacency between blocks can be determined by whether they differ in exactly one road's sign.\n\nBut how to model this? Because each block can be represented by the signs of each line. So, for a given point (home or university), we can compute for each line whether it's on the positive or negative side. Then, the home's block is determined by this set of signs. Similarly for the university. The problem reduces to finding the minimum number of sign changes required to go from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration, with each step changing exactly one sign (since crossing a road changes the sign for that road).\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Because changing the sign of one line would take you to an adjacent block. However, the problem is that each step is moving across a road (so changing the sign of exactly one line). Therefore, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of lines that need to be flipped between the home's configuration and the university's configuration. But how?\n\nWait, for example, if the home and university are in the same block (i.e., same signs for all lines), then zero steps. If they differ in exactly one line, then one step. If they differ in two lines, then maybe two steps, but perhaps there's a way to get there via another path. Wait, but each step flips exactly one line's sign. So the minimal number of steps would be the number of differing lines between the home and the university's sign configurations. Because each step can flip one line. However, this is only possible if the differing lines can be flipped in sequence. But is that always possible?\n\nWait, no. Because flipping a line's sign depends on the order. Suppose the home's configuration differs from the university's in two lines. Let's say line A and line B. To reach the university's configuration, you can flip line A first, then line B. But each flip would take you through a different block. So the minimal steps would be 2. So the minimal steps between the two blocks is the number of differing lines. Because each differing line requires a flip, and each flip is a step.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a scenario where two differing lines are not independent? Like, maybe flipping line A and then line B is not possible? Or is it always possible?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the home is in a block that is on the positive side of line A and positive of line B. The university is on the negative side of line A and negative of line B. Then, the minimal steps would be two: cross line A, then cross line B. Alternatively, cross line B then cross line A. Either way, two steps. So the minimal steps is equal to the number of differing lines.\n\nBut what if there's some dependency? For example, if the two lines are parallel. Suppose two parallel lines. Then, the regions between them are separated by those lines. But if you have two lines that are parallel, then the home and university could be on opposite sides of both. Then, the minimal steps would be two steps (crossing each line once). So again, the number of differing lines.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is the number of lines where the home and university are on different sides. Because each such line must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step. So the minimal steps is the number of differing lines.\n\nWait, but why can't there be a case where you cross a line twice? Like, maybe there's a way to cross a line once, then cross another line, then cross the same line again, leading to a shorter path? No, because that would require more steps than the number of differing lines. For example, if you have two differing lines, crossing one, then the other, then the first again would be three steps. Which is worse than two steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of lines where the home and university are on different sides. \n\nWait, but how to verify this? Let's look at the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0, and 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. \n\nSo the home (1,1) is above y=0 (since 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0) and to the right of x=0 (1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0). So the home's signs are (positive for road 1, positive for road 2). The university is (-1,-1). For road 1: y=-1 → 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. For road 2: x=-1 → 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1 <0. So the university's signs are negative for both roads. So the number of differing lines is 2. Hence the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x + y -3 =0. Let's check the signs for home and university.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → 1*1 + 0 + 0 = 1>0 → positive.\nRoad 2: y=0 → 0 +1*1 +0 =1>0 → positive.\nRoad 3: x + y -3 = 1 +1 -3 = -1 <0 → negative.\n\nFor university (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → -1 → negative.\nRoad 2: y=0 → -1 → negative.\nRoad 3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → negative.\n\nSo home's signs are [pos, pos, neg], university's [neg, neg, neg]. So differing lines are road 1 and 2. Hence, the number of differing lines is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this suggests that the answer is indeed the count of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nBut wait, how to compute that? For each line, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If their product is negative, then they are on opposite sides. So for each line, check if (val1 * val2) < 0. If yes, increment the count. The answer is that count.\n\nBut why is that correct?\n\nBecause each such line must be crossed once. And each crossing is a step. So the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university. Because each such line is a boundary between the two regions, and you have to cross them once each.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where two lines are crossed in a way that allows fewer steps?\n\nFor example, suppose there are two lines that cross each other. The home is in a region that is on one side of both lines, and the university is on the opposite side of both. Then, you can cross one line, then cross the other. Which is two steps. Which is the same as the count.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three lines. The home and university differ in three lines. Then, you need three steps. So the answer is 3.\n\nBut what if the home and university are in regions that are separated by some lines, but there's a way to cross them in a different way? For example, if the home and university are separated by two lines, but there's a path that crosses one line twice. But that would require more steps.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal number of steps is exactly the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each line, whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such lines is the answer.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, for each line, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). Multiply them. If the product is negative, then the home and university are on opposite sides of that line, so we add 1 to the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if the product is zero? The problem says that neither home nor university is on any road, so the product can't be zero. So for each line, the product is either positive or negative.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1 (home), x2, y2 (university), then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize answer to 0.\n\nFor each line:\n\nval1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0: answer +=1\n\nAt the end, output answer.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each such line is a boundary that needs to be crossed once. So the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each step allows crossing one line. So the minimal steps is the number of lines separating the two points.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses each of those lines once, and no more?\n\nWell, considering that each line that separates the two points must be crossed once. So the minimal steps can't be less than the number of such lines. And since each such line can be crossed once, the steps can't be more than that. So the answer is exactly the count.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me check the sample input again.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nLines are y=0 and x=0.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nval1 for y=0: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1.\n\nval2 for (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nFor x=0 line: val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nThree lines. For the third line, x + y -3 =0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0. So no count. So the two lines x=0 and y=0 contribute. So total 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code is simple. Read the home and university coordinates. For each line, compute the values and check if their product is negative.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the first line as x1, y1.\n\nRead the second line as x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each a, b, c:\n\nval1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\nval2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n    count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's all? That seems too easy. But according to the samples, yes. But why is that the case?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is the minimal steps. So this approach would work.\n\nBut why is the answer the number of lines that separate the two points?\n\nBecause each such line must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of such lines.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where two lines are crossed in a way that allows fewer steps?\n\nFor example, suppose there are two lines that cross each other. The home is in a region that is on one side of both lines, and the university is on the opposite side of both. Then, you can cross one line, then cross the other. That's two steps. Which is the same as the count of lines. So the answer is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two parallel lines. The home is on one side of both, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, you need to cross each line once, so two steps. Which again is the count.\n\nSo the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=0. But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, the input says n is given as 1<=n<=300. Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nThe third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n is at least 1. So no case where n=0.\n\nAnother edge case: home and university are separated by zero lines. That is, they are in the same block. Then the answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by one line. Answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: multiple lines, but some are not separating the two points.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the Python code would be as follows.\n\nRead input:\n\nBut note that the input is given as multiple lines, but the first input is given as a string. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the input format. So for example, in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut in reality, the input is read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the code is supposed to read from standard input. So the code will read:\n\nRead the first line as x1, y1.\n\nRead the second line as x2, y2.\n\nRead the third line as n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's all. But why is this correct?\n\nYes, according to our analysis. Let's test against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nx1=1, y1=1; x2=-1, y2=-1.\n\nn=2.\n\nFirst line: a=0, b=1, c=0. val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 +0 =1. val2=0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: a=1, b=0, c=0. val1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1. val2=1*(-1) +0 +0 =-1. product -1 → count +=1. total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=3.\n\nFirst line: a=1, b=0, c=0. val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0=1. val2=1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: a=0, b=1, c=0. val1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0=1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product -1 → count +=1. Now count is 2.\n\nThird line: a=1, b=1, c=-3. val1 =1*1 +1*1 -3 = 1+1-3 = -1. val2 =1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0 → no increment. total count is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are in same block. For example, home (1,1), university (2,2). Roads: x + y = 0. Then, for both points, the value is 1+1=2>0. So product is positive. So count is 0. So output 0.\n\nAnother test case: one line. Home is on one side, university on the other. So count is 1. Output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code is correct. So the problem is solved by this approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city with infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If a point (home or university) lies on opposite sides of a road, then that road must be crossed to move from the home block to the university block.\n2. **Sign Check**: For each road, we check whether the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. This can be determined by evaluating the sign of the linear equation for both points. If the product of these values is negative, the points lie on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Crossings**: The minimum number of steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Position**: For each road, we compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Steps**: Each road that separates the home and university points contributes to one step. The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
