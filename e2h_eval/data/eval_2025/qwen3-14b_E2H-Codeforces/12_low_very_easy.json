The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1.\n- First task is at 3. So she moves from 1 to 3. How long? Well, clockwise. From 1 to 2 is 1 step, then 2 to 3 is another. So total 2 steps. Then she does the task. Then next task is 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2 clockwise, she has to go all the way around. From 3 to 4 (1 step), 4 to 1 (another), 1 to 2 (another). That's 3 steps. Then she does the second task. Then third task is 3 again. She's at 2. So moving clockwise from 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is to track Xenia's current position and accumulate the time taken to move from her current position to the next required house for each task, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nBut how to compute the movement between two houses?\n\nLet's think: For each consecutive pair of tasks (current position and next target), we need to compute the minimal steps required to move clockwise from current to next.\n\nWait, but since the movement is only allowed clockwise, the number of steps between house a and house b (when moving clockwise) is (b - a) mod n if a != b. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if a is 3 and b is 2, and n is 4. Then moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require 3 →4 →1 →2: which is 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) mod 4 = ( -1 +4 ) = 3 mod 4. So the general formula is (b - a) if b >=a, else (b -a +n). Which can be written as (b -a) % n if the movement is allowed only clockwise. Wait, but if a is 3 and b is 2, then (2-3) is -1, mod 4 gives 3, which is correct. So yes, the steps between a and b is (b - a) if b >=a, else (b -a +n). Which can be calculated as (b - a) % n if the mod is positive. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, (2-3) %4 is 3. So yes, the steps between a and b is (b - a) % n if you can only move clockwise. But wait, when a and b are same, it's zero steps.\n\nSo for each task, we need to compute the steps from the current position to the target, add that to the total, and update the current position.\n\nBut the tasks are given in order. So for the list a_1, a_2,...,a_m, we need to process them in order, keeping track of current position. For each task, compute the steps from current to a_i, add to total, then set current to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is 1. So for the first task, we compute steps from 1 to a_1. Then for the second task, steps from a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nYes. So the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each ai in the list a:\n\n    steps = (ai - current_position) % n if (ai - current_position) % n !=0 else 0 ?\n\nWait, no. Because (ai - current_position) could be negative. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operation handles that.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each task must be completed in the specified order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 as given.\n2. **Track Current Position**: Keep track of Xenia's current position as she moves from one task to another.\n3. **Calculate Movement Time**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the target house using the formula `(target - current) % n`, which efficiently computes the clockwise distance on a circular road.\n4. **Accumulate Total Time**: Sum up the time taken for each movement between consecutive tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    diff = (target - current) % n\n    total += diff\n    current = target\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Update Position**: After moving to the target house, update the current position to this target house for the next iteration.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular movement constraints, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
