The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down.\n\nThe first task is at 3. Starting from 1, moving clockwise: 1→2→3 takes 2 steps. Then, the second task is at 2. Since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Then the third task is at 3 again. From 2, moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive task, we need to compute the time it takes to get from the previous position to the current task's house, moving clockwise. But how do we compute that?\n\nLet's think about the movement between two points. Suppose Xenia is currently at position prev, and needs to move to position curr. Since the road is circular, moving clockwise, the number of steps is (curr - prev) mod n if curr >= prev? Wait no. Wait, if prev is 3 and curr is 2 in a 4-house setup, then moving clockwise would require (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Let's see: 3 →4 →1 →2 is 3 steps. Which is (curr - prev + n) % n. Because if curr is less than prev, then the difference would be negative, so adding n and mod n gives the correct steps.\n\nWait, for example, prev = 3, curr = 2. (2 - 3) is -1, adding 4 gives 3, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. If prev is 2 and curr is 3, then (3-2) = 1, which is correct. So the formula for steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which can be written as (curr - prev) % n if we take into account that in Python, modulo can handle negative numbers. Wait, but in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3, so yes. So the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) % n. But wait, let's check:\n\nprev = 3, curr = 2. (2 - 3) = -1. mod 4 is 3. Correct. So yes, the steps is (curr - prev) % n. But wait, what if prev is 1 and curr is 1? Then steps is 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the tasks are given as a list a_1 to a_m. But Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the time between them is zero. So we need to process each task in order, and for each task, compute the steps from the previous position to the current a_i, then add that to the total.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Initialize current position as 1 (since she starts there).\n\n- For each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   - Compute the steps from current position to a_i, using (a_i - current) % n. Wait no, because the movement is clockwise. Wait, if current is 1 and a_i is 3, then steps is 2. Which is (3 - 1) = 2. If current is 3 and a_i is 1, then steps is (1 -3) mod 4 = -2 mod 4 = 2? Wait no. Because moving clockwise from 3 to 1 would be 3 →4 →1, which is 2 steps. So (1 -3) is -2, mod 4 is 2. So yes, the formula (curr - prev) % n gives the correct steps. Wait, no. Wait,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a circular ringroad. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time taken to move between consecutive tasks, considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 as given.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current position to the next task's location.\n3. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Use modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement. The time to move from position `prev` to `curr` on a circular road with `n` houses is `(curr - prev) % n`. This formula correctly handles both clockwise and counter-clockwise movements by leveraging modulo operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    diff = (target - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Xenia starts at house 1.\n- **Task Iteration**: For each task, calculate the time to move from the current house to the target house using `(target - current) % n`. This ensures that moving clockwise around the circle is handled correctly.\n- **Update Position**: After each task, update the current position to the target house to prepare for the next task.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the total time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
