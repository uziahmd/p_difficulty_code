His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But since the teacher has the first and second tour points but not the names, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x. Wait, no— actually, the problem states that there exists some i and j where a_i + b_j >= x. But for the other participants, their total is a_i + b_i? No, wait. Wait, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i and second tour is b_i? Or are the a and b arrays for the same participants but in different orders?\n\nWait, the problem says that the second line is the first tour's points, third line is the second tour's points. But the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for example, participant 1's first tour score is a_1, and their second tour score is b_1? Or are the a and b arrays for the same participants but possibly shuffled? No, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but they are in arbitrary order. So for example, the first tour's points are given as a list, and the second tour's points as another list, but there's no correspondence between them. So the actual participants' total scores are a_i + b_j for some i and j? No, that can't be right. Wait, no. Because each participant must have participated in both tours. So for each participant, there's a first tour score and a second tour score. However, the problem gives the first tour's scores as a list (a1...an) and the second tour's scores as a list (b1...bn), but the order of the participants is arbitrary. So for example, participant k's first tour score is a_k, and their second tour score is b_k. But the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour but the problem is that the results have only points, no names. So the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to the same participant. Therefore, when trying to find Vasya's possible positions, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j?), but with the constraint that each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa. Wait, but that's not possible. Because if you have n participants, then each a_i must be matched with exactly one b_j, but the problem says that the teacher has the first and second tour results but doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to the same person. So for the purpose of determining Vasya's possible positions, we need to imagine that the teacher is trying to assign the a's and b's to participants in such a way that Vasya's total is at least x, and then find the best and worst possible ranks he can get.\n\nBut how does this work? Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points for both tours. So Vasya's total is a_i + b_j >= x for some i and j. But the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible rank Vasya could have, given that the actual assignments of a_i and b_j to participants are unknown. So the teacher has to consider all possible ways of matching a_i and b_j into pairs (each a_i paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa) such that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. Then, for each such possible pairing, determine what Vasya's rank could be. But since the problem says that Vasya is present in the Olympiad, it's guaranteed that there exists at least one such pairing.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because for the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he's as high as possible) and arrange others' totals to be as low as possible. For the worst possible rank, we want to minimize Vasya's total (so that he's as low as possible) and arrange others' totals to be as high as possible.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst place Vasya could have. So the best possible scenario for Vasya is when his total is as high as possible, and others' totals are arranged so that as many as possible are lower than him. The worst possible scenario is when his total is as low as possible (but still >=x) and others' totals are arranged to be higher than him",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining Vasya's best and worst possible ranks in an Olympiad based on the points from two tours, we need to consider all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours. Since the teacher doesn't know which participant corresponds to which scores, the task is to find the optimal and worst-case scenarios for Vasya's placement.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy Overview\n\n1. **Best Rank (Minimum Possible Rank):**\n   - To achieve the best rank, we want Vasya's total score to be as high as possible.\n   - We can do this by choosing the maximum possible sum from the first and second tour scores such that the total is at least `x`.\n\n2. **Worst Rank (Maximum Possible Rank):**\n   - To achieve the worst rank, we want Vasya's total score to be as low as possible (still ≥ x).\n   - At the same time, we maximize the number of participants with higher total scores than Vasya.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- We sort both the first and second tour scores.\n- For the best rank:\n  - Take the largest possible score from the first tour and pair it with the largest possible score from the second tour (to get the highest total).\n- For the worst rank:\n  - Take the smallest possible score from the first tour and pair it with the smallest possible score from the second tour (to get the lowest total that is still ≥ x).\n\nThen, for each scenario, we count how many other participants could have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's total.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    # Parse input\n    n, x = map(int, data[0].split())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2].split()))\n    \n    # Sort the scores\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n\n    # Best place: maximize Vasya's total\n    max_vasya = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] >= x:\n                max_vasya = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j]\n                break\n        if max_vasya != 0:\n            break\n\n    # Count how many participants can have total >= max_vasya\n    count_best = 0\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        for bj in b_sorted:\n            if ai + bj >= max_vasya:\n                count_best += 1\n                break\n\n    # Worst place: minimize Vasya's total\n    min_vasya = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] >= x:\n                min_vasya = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j]\n                break\n        if min_vasya != 0:\n            break\n\n    # Count how many participants can have total > min_vasya\n    count_worst = 0\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        for bj in b_sorted:\n            if ai + bj > min_vasya:\n                count_worst += 1\n                break\n\n    best_place = count_best + 1\n    worst_place = count_worst + 1\n\n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- Sorting both arrays: O(n log n)\n- Finding best and worst possible totals: O(n²) in worst case\n- Counting how many participants have better scores: O(n²) in worst case\n\nThis approach ensures correctness while being efficient enough for the given constraints.",
