A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs:\n\nThe input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires per friend: nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters...\". So for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices per toast is n slices. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute, and then take the minimum of those.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total drink available: k * l ml.\n   The maximum toasts based on drink is (total_drink) // (n * nl). Because each toast requires n * nl ml.\n\n2. Calculate total lime slices available: c * d.\n   Max toasts based on lime is (total_slices) // n. Because each toast needs n slices.\n\n3. Calculate total salt available: p grams.\n   Max toasts based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but the example given:\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nTotal drink is 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires 3*3=9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. For the first sample, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. So total toasts possible from drink is 20 / 9 = 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note where they say 20/3=6 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the note says that the total drink is 20ml. Then they say it's enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" Wait, but according to my previous calculation, each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend = 9 ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222, which would be 2. But the note says 6. Oh, so there's a mistake in my reasoning here. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right! Wait, the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl. But in the first sample, the note says that 20 ml is enough for 6 toasts. Let's check that. 6 toasts would require 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml? But 20 is less than that. Wait that doesn't make sense. So clearly, I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for one toast, each friend consumes nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. But in the note, the first sample says that 20 ml is enough for 6 toasts. Let's see: 6 toasts would require 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml? But 20 is less than that. That can't be. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" So 20 divided by 3 is",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, lime slices, and salt per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Total Drink Calculation**: Calculate the total amount of drink available from the bottles and determine how many toasts can be made based on this amount.\n2. **Lime Slices Calculation**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available and determine how many toasts can be made based on this number.\n3. **Salt Calculation**: Calculate the total amount of salt available and determine how many toasts can be made based on this amount.\n4. **Determine Minimum**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Therefore, we take the minimum value from the three calculations above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    values = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = values\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available: k * l\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Each toast requires n * nl ml of drink\n    toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices: c * d\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Each toast requires n slices\n    toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    \n    # Calculate total salt: p grams\n    # Each toast requires n * np grams\n    toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle. The number of toasts possible based on drink is determined by dividing this total by the required amount of drink per toast for all friends.\n3. **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is found by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime. The number of toasts possible based on lime slices is determined by dividing this total by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n4. **Salt Calculation**: The total amount of salt is divided by the required amount of salt per toast for all friends to determine the number of toasts possible based on salt.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value from the three calculations (drink, lime slices, salt) is printed as the result, as this determines the limiting factor for the number of toasts each friend can make.",
