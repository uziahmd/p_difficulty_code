A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible value determined by the available resources divided by the number of friends, right?\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. Let me note what each represents:\n\n- n: number of friends.\n- k: number of bottles of drink. Each bottle has l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n- c: number of limes. Each is cut into d slices. So total lime slices is c * d.\n- p: grams of salt.\n- nl: milliliters of drink per toast per friend. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. For t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. For all friends, total drink needed is n * t * nl.\n- np: grams of salt per toast per friend. Similarly, total salt needed for t toasts is n * t * np.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nTotal drink available (k*l) must be >= n * t * nl.\n\nTotal lime slices (c*d) must be >= n * t * 1 (since each toast per friend needs one slice).\n\nTotal salt (p) must be >= n * t * np.\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of:\n\n- (k*l) // (n * nl)\n- (c*d) // (n)\n- p // (n * np)\n\nBut wait, because for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts, so total slices needed is n * t. Because each toast per friend uses one slice. So yes, the total slices required is n * t. So the available slices is c*d. So the maximum t from that is (c*d) // (n).\n\nSimilarly, the drink: total drink is k*l. Each toast per friend requires nl ml. So for t toasts, total drink needed is n * t * nl. So maximum t from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nSalt is similar: total salt needed is n * t * np. So maximum t from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nBut wait, in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo:\n\nDrink: 4*5 = 20 ml. n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml per toast. So 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the note.\n\nLimes: 10 limes, each cut into 8 slices. Total 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 friends * 1 slice each. So 3 per toast. 80 /3 is 26.666..., floor 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait, the note says that for the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nAh, because the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to my calculation, the maximum t for limes is (c*d) // n. Which is (10*8)/3 = 80/3 = 26. So why does the note say that limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. So for t toasts, n*t slices are needed. So the total available is c*d. So the maximum t is (c*d) // (n). \n\nBut in the first sample, c*d is 10 * 8 = 80. n is 3. So 80//3 is 26. So why does the note say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nWait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That seems conflicting. Let me check the note again.\n\nThe note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\".",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink available is calculated as the product of the number of bottles and the volume per bottle.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices is calculated as the product of the number of limes and the number of slices per lime.\n   - **Salt**: The total amount of salt available is directly given.\n\n2. **Determine Constraints for Toasts**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available, considering each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total number of lime slices available, considering each toast requires one slice per friend.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available, considering each toast requires a specific amount of salt per friend.\n\n3. **Determine the Maximum Possible Toasts**: The answer is the minimum value derived from the three constraints calculated above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n\ntoast_by_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_by_drink, toast_by_lime, toast_by_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total volume of drink is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle. This is then divided by the total drink required per toast for all friends.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is determined by multiplying the number of limes by the number of slices per lime. This is then divided by the number of friends to determine how many toasts can be made with the available slices.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available is divided by the total salt required per toast for all friends.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the three constraints gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all resources are sufficient for that number of toasts.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the constraints and determines the optimal number of toasts using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring it handles all edge cases effectively.",
