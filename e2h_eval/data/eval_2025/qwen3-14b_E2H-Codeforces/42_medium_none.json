    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find all the percentages between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars at some point during the file copying process. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the progress bars work. Let me rephrase the problem. For each byte copied, there's a current file's progress and the total progress. Both are calculated as floor(100 * x / a_i) for the current file, and floor(100 * (sum of all previous files plus x) / total_sum) for the total. And these values update after each byte is copied. Also, initially, both are 0.\n\nSo the approach here is to simulate each byte being copied and check for each moment if the two percentages are equal. But since the number of files can be up to 100, and each file up to 1000 bytes, the total number of bytes is up to 100*1000 = 100,000. For each byte, we can compute the two percentages and track when they are equal. However, for each byte, checking both percentages might be computationally feasible here because even 1e5 steps are manageable.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way than simulating every single byte. Let's think. For each possible percentage value p (from 0 to 100), we need to check if there exists a moment where both progress bars show p.\n\nAlternatively, for each p, check if there exists a byte x in some file i such that:\n\nFor the current file i, floor(100x / a_i) = p.\n\nAnd for the total, floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum) = p.\n\nWhere sum_prev is the sum of the sizes of all previous files (files 1 to i-1), and x ranges from 1 to a_i (since after each byte, including the first one, the progress is updated). Also, note that the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0 for both, so p=0 is always present.\n\nBut how to check for each p whether there exists such x and i?\n\nBut maybe simulating is easier. Let's think about the simulation approach. For each file i, and for each byte x in 1..a_i, compute the current progress (for the file) and the total progress. Then collect all p's where they are equal. Also, remember that the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0 for both, so we must include 0 in the answer if it's possible. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the initial state is 0 for both. So 0 is definitely in the answer. However, the example shows that in the first case, the output includes 0 and 100. So for example, when the entire file is copied, the total progress is 100, and the current file's progress is also 100 (since x is a_i, so 100 * a_i / a_i = 100, floored to 100). So for the final byte, both are 100. So 100 is included.\n\nSo the simulation approach would be:\n\n- Compute the total_sum = sum(a_1 ... a_n)\n\n- For each file i, for each byte x in 1 to a_i:\n\n   - current_p = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n   - total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x, where sum_prev is sum of a_1 to a_{i-1}\n\n   - total_p = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_sum)\n\n   - if current_p == total_p, add it to a set of valid percentages.\n\nAlso, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0 for both. So we need to include 0 in the answer. However, during the simulation, when x=0 (but that's not part of the loop). Wait, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So for example, when the first byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. But before that, both are 0. So the initial state is 0. So we need to include 0 in the answer if there's a moment when both are 0. Which is always true because the initial state is 0. But wait, the problem says \"after copying each byte\". The initial state is before any bytes are copied. So the initial state is considered as a moment? Because the problem says \"the beginning of the copying\" both show 0. So the initial state counts. So 0 is always in the answer. However, in the example given, the first input has output starting with 0. So yes, we need to include 0.\n\nBut in the simulation approach, when we process all the bytes, the initial state is not covered. So we need to add 0 to the set of possible answers. But wait, what about when the total_sum is zero? Well, no, since each a_i is at least 1, so total_sum is at least 1. So the initial state is 0 for both. Therefore, 0 is always present.\n\nBut then, during the simulation, when x=0? No, because the simulation starts with x=1 for each file. So the initial 0 is not captured in the simulation. So we need to make sure that 0 is added to the result. But also, maybe there are other moments when both are 0. For example, during the copying of the first byte, maybe the total progress is 0, and the current progress is 0. But that depends on the size of the first file. For example, if the first file is 100 bytes. Then after copying 1 byte, the current progress is floor(100 * 1 / 100) = 1%, and the total is floor(100 * 1 / 100) = 1%. So in this case, the initial 0 is only present once. So in our code, we have to make sure to include 0 in the answer, regardless of anything else.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize a set with 0.\n\nThen, for each file i, compute sum_prev (sum of a_1 to a_{i-1}).\n\nFor each x from 1 to a_i:\n\n   current_p = (100 * x) // a_i\n\n   total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n   total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n   if current_p == total_p, add to the set.\n\nAdditionally, after all the bytes are processed, check if 100 is in the set. Because when the last byte is copied, the current_p for that file is 100, and the total_p is also 100. So that moment is captured. However, in the simulation, for x = a_i (the last byte of the file), current_p is 100 * a_i / a_i = 100, which is floored to 100. And the total_bytes is sum_prev + a_i, which is sum_prev + a_i = sum of all files up to i. But since the total_sum is the sum of all files, the total_p would be (100 * (sum_prev + a_i)) / total_sum. But for the last file, sum_prev + a_i is the sum of all files. So that's 100 * total_sum / total_sum = 100, which is floored to 100. So the last byte will be captured. So 100 is added to the set.\n\nBut what about if the total_sum is 0? No, since each a_i is at least 1, total_sum is at least 1. So the code should handle that.\n\nWait, but in the simulation, for the last byte of the last file, the total_p is 100. So that's captured. So the code will include 100 in the set if that happens. But what if the total_sum is such that the total_p for the last byte is 99? For example, suppose total_sum is 101, and the last byte is the 101st byte. Then 100 * 101 / 101 is 100, which is correct. So the code would capture that.\n\nSo the code would generate all the p's that are achieved during the simulation, plus 0.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 0. But during the simulation, when x is 0 (before any bytes are copied), but the code doesn't process that. So the code adds 0 to the set, and then processes all the bytes. However, perhaps there are other times when both bars are 0. For example, when the first file is 1000 bytes, and during the first byte, the current_p is 0 (since 100*1/1000 = 0.1, floored to 0). The total_p is (100 * 1)/total_sum. Suppose total_sum is 1000. Then total_p is 0.1, floored to 0. So in that case, during the first byte, both are 0. So the code would add that 0 again. However, since we are using a set, adding 0 again is okay.\n\nBut the initial state is 0, which is added once. However, during the simulation, the same 0 could be added again. But since the set is used, duplicates are handled.\n\nBut the problem says to output all numbers between 0 and 100 inclusive that have at least one moment where both bars show that number. So adding 0 to the set is correct, even if there are multiple times when it occurs.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and the list a.\n\n- Compute total_sum = sum(a)\n\n- Initialize a set called result, and add 0 to it.\n\n- For each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = sum(a[0..i-1])\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n      current_p = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n      total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n      total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n      if current_p == total_p:\n\n          add to result\n\n- After processing all bytes, collect all elements in the result set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut how to compute sum_prev for each file? Well, for the first file, sum_prev is 0. For the second, it's a[0], etc. So perhaps precompute the prefix sums.\n\nYes. Let's compute prefix_sums where prefix_sums[i] is the sum of the first i files. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. Then, for the i-th file (assuming 0-based index), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nSo for example, if the files are [a1, a2, a3], then:\n\nfile 0: sum_prev is prefix_sums[0] = 0\n\nfile 1: sum_prev is prefix_sums[1] = a1\n\nfile 2: sum_prev is prefix_sums[2] = a1 + a2\n\nSo, the code can precompute prefix_sums as follows.\n\nIn Python, for a list a, prefix_sums can be computed with:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, for the i-th file (0-based), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize a set called result with 0.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n      current_p = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n      total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n      total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n      if current_p == total_p:\n\n          add to result.\n\nOnce all are processed, collect the sorted list of the elements in result.\n\nBut wait, what about the moment when the entire transfer is complete? For example, after the last byte of the last file is copied. At that moment, both progress bars are 100. So that's captured in the code. Because for the last file, x is a[i], and sum_prev + x is prefix_sums[i] + a[i] = prefix_sums[i+1] = total_sum. So 100 * total_sum / total_sum is 100, which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the total_sum is such that the total_p is 100, but the current_p is also 100? That's captured.\n\nNow, considering the example given in the first input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nSo n=1, a = [6]. total_sum is 6.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 6].\n\nFor i=0, sum_prev is 0. For x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * x) // 6.\n\ntotal_bytes = 0 + x = x. total_p = (100 * x) // 6.\n\nSo current_p and total_p are the same. Thus, for each x, they are same. So all the percentages generated during the process are added. Also, the initial 0 is added. But for x=1, current_p is 100*1//6 = 16. So 16 is added. Similarly for x=2, 33, etc. So the output is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is 2 files of 100 and 500. The output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Let's think why. The total sum is 600. For the first file, which is 100 bytes. For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_p is (100 * x) // 100 = x // 1. So x%100. For example, x=1: 1%100=1. But the total_p is (100 * (0 + x )) // 600 = (100x)/600 = x/6. So for x=1, total_p is 0. So current_p is 1, total_p is 0. Not equal. But when x=6, current_p is 6, total_p is 1. So during the first file, the current_p is increasing faster than the total_p. But once the first file is done (x=100), the total_p is (100 * 100) / 600 = 16.666..., floored to 16. Then, when the second file starts. For each x in 1 to 500:\n\nsum_prev is 100. So total_bytes is 100 + x. The total_p is (100*(100 + x))/600. For example, when x is 500, total_bytes is 600, so 100 * 600 /600 = 100. So during the second file, the current_p is (100*x)/500 = (x/5) floored. The total_p is (100*(100 + x))/600 = (100 + x) * 100 / 600 = (100 + x) / 6.\n\nSo when does current_p equal total_p?\n\nLet me take an example. For x in the second file. Let's say x= 500. Then current_p is (100 * 500) // 500 = 100. total_p is (100 * (100 + 500 )) // 600 = 600 * 100 / 600 = 100. So that's equal. So 100 is included.\n\nBut for other values. Let's think about when the total_p is 95. Let's see:\n\ntotal_p = 95. So (100 * (100 + x )) // 600 = 95.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n95 <= (100*(100 +x )) / 600 < 96.\n\nMultiply by 600:\n\n95 * 600 <= 100*(100 + x) < 96 * 600\n\nDivide by 100:\n\n570 <= 100 + x < 576\n\nSo 570 - 100 = 470 <= x < 576 - 100 = 476. So x must be between 470 and 475 inclusive. Since x is in the second file (size 500), x can be 470 to 475. Then, the current_p is (100 * x ) // 500. Let's calculate for x=470:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * 470) / 500 = 94. So 94. Which is not 95. So that's not equal. So for x in that range, current_p is (x * 100) // 500 = (x * 0.2) floored. Let's compute for x=475: 475 * 100 / 500 = 95. So exactly 95. So for x=475, current_p is 95. So total_p is 95. So this is a valid case. Hence, 95 is in the output. Similarly for other values.\n\nSo the code would find these cases. So the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle this. Now, considering that for each x in each file, the code checks the two percentages and adds to the set if they are equal.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead n from input, then read the list a. Then compute prefix_sums, total_sum, etc.\n\nBut for the input, the user may have provided multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input, the input is given as a list of test cases. Wait, no. Wait, the user provided in the example:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\nBut the actual input is per test case. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nIn the first line is given n, then the second line has the a_i's.\n\nSo the code must read from stdin, which is for a single test case. But in the example given, the user provided multiple test cases. However, that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple examples. The actual code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nSo the code must read from standard input, which for the problem is a single test case.\n\nSo the code will read n, then the list of a_i's.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. So in Python:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute the rest.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a)\n\nCompute prefix_sums:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}\n\nThen for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\nfor x in 1 to a[i]:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\ntotal_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\ntotal_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\nif current_p == total_p:\n\n    add to the set.\n\nOnce all done, collect the sorted list.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where during the copy of a file, the current_p is 100? For example, when x = a[i], then current_p is (100 * a[i]) // a[i] = 100. And the total_p is (sum_prev + a[i]) * 100 // total_sum. Which is (prefix_sums[i] + a[i]) = prefix_sums[i+1], which is part of the total_sum. So for the last file, this would be total_sum, so 100 * total_sum // total_sum = 100. So 100 is added. So the code will capture 100.\n\nBut what about when the total_sum is not equal to the sum_prev + x? For example, in the middle of copying a file. But in that case, the total_p can be 100? Only if sum_prev + x >= total_sum. But sum_prev + x is the sum of the first i files (sum_prev) plus x, which is up to a[i]. So the maximum sum_prev +x is prefix_sums[i] + a[i] = prefix_sums[i+1], which is less than or equal to total_sum. So the maximum total_p is (100 * total_sum) // total_sum = 100. So when sum_prev + x equals total_sum, which is when x is a[i] and i is the last file. So that's captured.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing for the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=1, a=[6]\n\ntotal_sum = 6\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 6]\n\nFor i=0, sum_prev is 0.\n\nLoop x from 1 to 6.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_p = 100 * 1 //6 = 16 (since 100/6 is 16.666...)\n\ntotal_bytes = 0+1=1. total_p = 100 *1 //6 = 16. So equal. So add 16.\n\nSimilarly for x=2: 200//6 = 33.333... floored to 33. total_p is 200//6 = 33. So added.\n\nx=3: 300//6=50. total_p same. So added.\n\nx=4: 400//6=66.666... floored to 66. total_p same. Added.\n\nx=5: 500//6=83.333... floored to 83. Same.\n\nx=6: 600//6=100. total_p is 600//6=100. So added.\n\nSo the set after processing is {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100}.\n\nWhich matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is n=2, a=[100,500]. The output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nLet me see. How does the code capture these values?\n\nLet me think about when during the second file's processing. For example, when x is 475 (as discussed earlier), current_p is 95 and total_p is 95. So that would be added. Similarly, for other values.\n\nBut how to make sure that the code captures all of them.\n\nNow, the code would process all x in the first file (100 bytes) and the second (500 bytes).\n\nFor the first file, during processing, the current_p is (x * 100) // 100 = x. The total_p is (x * 100) // 600. So for x=1, 1 vs 0. Not equal. For x=6, 6 vs 1. Not equal. For x=600, but the first file is 100 bytes. So for x=100, current_p is 100, total_p is 100 * 100 / 600 = 16.666... floored to 16. So not equal. So during the first file, there's no match except for 0 (which is added initially). So during the first file, the code adds nothing except possibly 0 (but initial 0 is already added).\n\nThen during the second file, sum_prev is 100.\n\nFor x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * x) // 500 = (x * 100) // 500 = x//5 (since 100/500 is 0.2, so x*0.2 floored).\n\ntotal_p = (100 * (100 + x )) // 600.\n\nWe need to find x where x//5 == (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nLet me think about when this is true.\n\nLet me consider that for x in the second file, the total_p is floor( (100*(100 + x )) / 600 )\n\nLet me denote total_p as T, and current_p as C.\n\nWe need T = C.\n\nLet me think about when T = 95. As discussed earlier, x can be 475, which gives C=95 (475//5=95). And T is (100*(100 +475 )) / 600 = (575 * 100 ) / 600 = 57500 / 600 = 95.833..., which floored to 95. So yes, equal. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x=476, C is 476//5=95.2 → 95. T is (100*(100+476 )) / 600 = (576 * 100 ) /600 = 57600 /600 = 96 → floored to 96. So C=95 and T=96. Not equal.\n\nSo for x=475, it's added.\n\nWhat about x=470?\n\nC=470//5=94. T is (100*(100+470 )) /600 = 570 * 100 / 600 = 57000/600 = 95. So T=95, C=94. Not equal.\n\nSo only x=475 in this case.\n\nBut how about other values? For example, when T is 99. Let's find x such that T=99.\n\nSo:\n\n99 ≤ (100*(100 +x )) /600 <100 → multiply by 600:\n\n99 *600 ≤ 100*(100 +x ) < 100*600 → divide by 100:\n\n594 ≤ 100 + x < 600 → subtract 100:\n\n494 ≤ x < 500.\n\nSo x ranges from 494 to 499 inclusive.\n\nFor these x, T is 99. What is C?\n\nC is x//5.\n\nFor x=494: 494//5 = 98.8 → 98. So T=99, C=98 → not equal.\n\nx=495: 495//5 = 99. So C=99. T=99. So added. So 99 is in the set.\n\nSimilarly x=495, 496, 497, 498, 499.\n\nx=495: C=99, T=99 → yes.\n\nx=496: C=496//5= 99.2 → 99. T is (100*(100+496))/600 = (596 * 100)/600 = 59600 /600 = 99.333... → floored to 99. So yes. So C=99, T=99. So added.\n\nSame for x=497, 498, 499. For all of these, C is 99. So all of these x's would contribute 99 to the set.\n\nSo 99 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for T=98:\n\nFind x where T=98.\n\nSo 98 ≤ (100*(100 +x )) /600 <99 → multiply by 600:\n\n98*600 ≤ 100*(100+x) <99*600 → 58800 ≤ 100*(100 +x) < 59400 → divide by 100:\n\n588 ≤ 100 +x <594 → subtract 100:\n\n488 ≤x < 494 → x ranges from 488 to 493 inclusive.\n\nFor these x, T is 98. C is x//5.\n\nFor x=488: 488//5=97.6 → 97. T=98. Not equal.\n\nx=489: 489//5=97.8 → 97. T=98. Not equal.\n\nx=490: 490//5=98. So T=98. So added.\n\nx=490, 491, 492, 493.\n\nx=490: C=98, T=98 → yes.\n\nx=491: C=491//5=98.2 → 98. T= (100*(100+491))/600 → 591*100/600 = 59100/600 = 98.5 → floored to 98. So yes. So added. Similarly for x=491, 492, 493. So 98 is added.\n\nSo in this way, the code would capture 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Plus 0. So the output would be 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, a=[1]. Then total_sum=1. For x=1, current_p=100*1//1=100. total_p=100*1//1=100. So the set is {0, 100}. So output is 0, 100.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a=[1, 1]. total_sum=2.\n\nInitial 0 is added.\n\nFor first file (a=1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_p = 100*1//1 = 100. total_p = (100 * 1)/2 = 50. So not equal. So not added.\n\nFor second file, sum_prev=1.\n\nx runs from 1 to 1:\n\ntotal_bytes = 1 +1=2. total_p = 100*2//2=100. current_p is 100*1//1=100. So added. So the set has 0, 100. So output is 0, 100.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[2, 2]. total_sum=4.\n\nFor first file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_p = 100 *1//2=50. total_p = (100 *1)/4=25 → not equal.\n\nx=2: current_p=100. total_p is (100 *2)/4=50 → not equal.\n\nFor second file, sum_prev=2.\n\nx=1: total_bytes=3. total_p= (3*100)/4=75. current_p is 100*1//2=50 → not equal.\n\nx=2: total_bytes=4. total_p=100. current_p=100. So added. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: when during the processing of a file, the same percentage is achieved multiple times. For example, if during a file, the current_p and total_p are same for multiple x's. The code adds them once (as a set).\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that for large n and a_i, the code may take O(total_bytes) time. For n=100 and a_i=1000, total_bytes is 1e5, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a)\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize result = {0}\n\nThen for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\nfor x in 1 to a[i]:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\ntotal_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\ntotal_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\nif current_p == total_p:\n\n    add to result.\n\nFinally, sort the result and print each element separated by newlines.\n\nWait, the output format for the sample is like:\n\nFor the first sample, the output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is each number on a separate line. So the code must output the numbers in sorted order, each on its own line.\n\nSo in Python, after collecting the sorted list, print each element.\n\nSo code:\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nthen process all the x's.\n\nThen sorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nNow, code.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the prefix_sums:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            result.add(current_p)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the total_p is 100? For example, when the last byte is copied, the code adds 100. So the code should capture that.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first sample, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input: the second sample input is n=2, a=[100,500]. The output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Let's see if the code would capture those.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, during the second file, when x is in certain ranges, the code adds the corresponding percentages. For example, 95 is added when x=475, 96 when x=?\n\nLet me think about T=96. Let's compute for T=96.\n\nSo:\n\n96 <= (100*(100 + x )) /600 <97 → multiply by 600 → 96*600 = 57600 ≤ 100*(100 +x) ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the percentages between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the file copying process. The progress bars update after each byte is copied, and we need to check for moments when both bars show the same percentage.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute prefix sums to efficiently determine the cumulative size of files up to each point.\n3. **Simulating Copying Process**: For each byte copied in each file, calculate the current progress and total progress percentages. Check if these percentages are equal and record them.\n4. **Result Collection**: Use a set to collect all valid percentages, ensuring no duplicates. Finally, sort and print the results.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n        if current_p == total_p:\n            result.add(current_p)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files `n` followed by their sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: These are used to quickly compute the cumulative size of files up to each point, which helps in determining the total progress percentage efficiently.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, compute the current progress percentage relative to the file size and the total progress percentage relative to the total size of all files.\n4. **Set for Results**: A set is used to collect all unique percentages where both progress bars match. This ensures that each percentage is only recorded once.\n5. **Sorting and Output**: The collected percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the copying process and checks for matching progress percentages, ensuring correctness and optimal performance given the constraints.",
