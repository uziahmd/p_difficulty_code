A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\nSo, the input gives me several numbers: n (number of friends), k (bottles of drink), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, right. For each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink. So for one toast, all n friends together need n * nl milliliters. Similarly for the salt: each toast requires n * np grams of salt. And each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the total amount of drink available: k * l. Then, how many toasts can be made based on the drink? Each toast requires n * nl ml. So total toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, because if it's not divisible, we take the floor.\n\nSimilarly for the lime slices. Total slices available is c * d. Each toast needs n slices. So total toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt, total available is p grams. Each toast needs n * np grams. So toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of those three values. Because all three resources are required for each toast. So the maximum possible is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nWait, but let me check the example given.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink total is 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3*3=9 ml (since nl is 3). Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total for all friends is n * nl. So for the first example, per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the note. Then the limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (n=3). 80 / 3 is 26.666, floor 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, wait no. Wait in the note, the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but that's because each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. So for the first example, 3 slices per toast. So total toasts possible from limes is (10 * 8) / 3 = 80/3 = 26.666, which would be 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that doesn't make sense. Wait maybe I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". But according to my calculation, that would be if each toast requires one slice. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires a slice per friend. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. So in the first example, with 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666 toasts, which is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So the total number of toasts possible from the limes is (total slices) divided by n, floored.\n\nBut in the note, the first example has 10 limes cut into 8 slices each. Total slices is 80. Then the note says that the limes are enough for 80",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available from the bottles.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available from the limes cut.\n   - **Salt**: Use the given amount of salt directly.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Requirement**: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices Requirement**: Each toast requires `n` slices of lime for all friends.\n   - **Salt Requirement**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt for all friends.\n\n3. **Compute Maximum Possible Toasts**:\n   - For each resource, compute the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on the available quantity and the requirement per toast.\n   - The final answer is the minimum of these values since all resources must be sufficient for each toast.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split into individual numbers\n    numbers = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the variables\n    n = numbers[0]\n    k = numbers[1]\n    l = numbers[2]\n    c = numbers[3]\n    d = numbers[4]\n    p = numbers[5]\n    nl = numbers[6]\n    np = numbers[7]\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Drink per toast for all friends\n    drink_per_toast = n * nl\n    # Max toasts from drink\n    toasts_drink = total_drink // drink_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Slices per toast\n    slices_per_toast = n\n    # Max toasts from limes\n    toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // slices_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate max toasts from salt\n    salt_per_toast = n * np\n    toasts_salt = p // salt_per_toast\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers for processing.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: The total amount of drink is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle. The total lime slices are calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n- **Resource Requirements**: For each toast, the required amount of drink, lime slices, and salt are computed based on the number of friends and their individual requirements.\n- **Maximum Toasts Calculation**: The maximum number of toasts possible from each resource is determined by integer division of the total available resource by the requirement per toast. The minimum of these values is the answer since all resources must be sufficient for each toast.",
