A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs and the requirements.\n\nThe inputs are:\nn: number of friends\nk: number of bottles of drink\nl: milliliters per bottle\nc: number of limes\nd: number of slices per lime\np: grams of salt\nnl: milliliters of drink per toast per friend\nnp: grams of salt per toast per friend\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. But since there are n friends, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs those amounts. So for one toast, total for all friends would be n * nl ml of drink, n slices (since each friend has one slice), and n * np grams of salt.\n\nBut the question is how many toasts can they make. Let's think about the total available resources.\n\nFirst, total drink available is k * l ml. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, because if the division isn't exact, you can't have partial toasts. So integer division here.\n\nThen, the lime slices: total slices is c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So maximum toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: total is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources must be sufficient. So the number of toasts is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nDrink: 4 *5 =20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends *3 ml per toast per friend? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. For example, in the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. Total drink is 20. 20 /9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note where they say 20/3=6 toasts. Wait wait, wait, no. Wait the note says that the total drink is 20, which is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait, the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. But according to my previous calculation, per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says 20 /3 =6. Oh wait, maybe I got the per toast calculation wrong. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So for the first sample, n is 3, nl is 3. So 3 *3 =9 per toast. 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 =6 toasts\". Wait why is that? Because perhaps the problem is that the note is considering per friend. Let me re-read the note.\n\nIn the note, the example input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n=3 friends. The drink is 4*5=20 ml. The note says that it's enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. But why?\n\nAh! Oh wait! Maybe the problem is that each toast requires per friend nl ml. So for each",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink available is the product of the number of bottles and the milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices is the product of the number of limes and the slices per lime.\n   - **Salt**: The total amount of salt available is given directly.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Requirements Per Toast**:\n   - **Drink per Toast**: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters).\n   - **Lime Slices per Toast**: Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend).\n   - **Salt per Toast**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams).\n\n3. **Compute Maximum Possible Toasts for Each Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: Divide the total drink by the drink required per toast.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Divide the total lime slices by the slices required per toast.\n   - **Salt**: Divide the total salt by the salt required per toast.\n\n4. **Determine the Limiting Resource**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is found by taking the minimum value of the maximum possible toasts from each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    inputs = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the values\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = inputs\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Drink per toast (for all friends)\n    drink_per_toast = n * nl\n    # Max toasts from drink\n    max_drink = total_drink // drink_per_toast if drink_per_toast != 0 else 0\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Slices per toast (for all friends)\n    lime_per_toast = n\n    # Max toasts from limes\n    max_lime = total_lime_slices // lime_per_toast if lime_per_toast != 0 else 0\n    \n    # Calculate salt per toast (for all friends)\n    salt_per_toast = n * np\n    # Max toasts from salt\n    max_salt = p // salt_per_toast if salt_per_toast != 0 else 0\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: The total drink, lime slices, and salt are calculated based on the given inputs.\n- **Resource Requirements Per Toast**: Each resource's requirement per toast is computed considering all friends.\n- **Maximum Possible Toasts**: For each resource, the maximum number of toasts that can be made is determined using integer division.\n- **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum of the maximum possible toasts from each resource, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limit.",
