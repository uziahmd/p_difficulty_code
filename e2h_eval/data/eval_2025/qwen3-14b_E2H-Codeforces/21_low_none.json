The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Neko wants to open as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I should think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, it needs a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the problem reduces to counting how many even and odd chests there are, and then matching them with the available even and odd keys. But wait, the keys can be used once, and each chest can be opened once. So the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nOh right! Because each even chest needs an odd key. So if there are E_even chests (even a_i) and K_odd keys (odd b_j), then the number of possible matches here is min(E_even, K_odd). Similarly for the other case: odd chests (O_odd) and even keys (K_even), min(O_odd, K_even). Sum those two and that's the answer.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n   - For each a_i in the list, check if it's even or odd. Let's say even_chest_count and odd_chest_count.\n\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Similarly for the b_j list, count even_key_count and odd_key_count.\n\n3. The answer is min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) + min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each even chest can be matched with an odd key. But if there are more even chests than odd keys, then we can only use as many as the number of odd keys. Similarly for the other way around.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So odd_chest_count is 2, even_chest_count is 3.\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see:\n\n8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_key_count is 1, even_key_count is 3.\n\nSo min(3,1) is 1 (for even chests with odd keys) and min(2,3) is 2 (for odd chests with even keys). Total 3, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is 5 1, chests are all even (2,4,6,8,10). Keys is 5 (odd). So even_chest_count is 5, odd_key_count is 1. So min(5,1) is 1. The other term is min(0, 0) since there are no odd chests and even keys. So total 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chest_count is 1, odd_key_count is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. The other term is min(0, 4) which is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i. Count how many are even and odd.\n\nRead the list of b_j. Count how many are even and odd.\n\nCompute the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd?\n\nIn Python, for each number in the list, check if it's even (x % 2 == 0) or odd.\n\nSo for the a list:\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a_list if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_chest = n - even_chest.\n\nSame for the keys.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read the a list. Then read the b list.\n\nCompute even_chest, odd_chest, even_key, odd_key.\n\nThen answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes. That's the plan.\n\nNow, handle",
