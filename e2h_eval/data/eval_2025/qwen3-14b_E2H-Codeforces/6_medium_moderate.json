Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding two non-overlapping vouchers such that their total duration is exactly x, and their combined cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j where their durations add up to x. Also, they must not overlap. That means either the first ends before the second starts, or the second ends before the first starts.\n\nThe challenge is to find the minimal sum of costs for such pairs.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. So any O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. Need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) or O(n).\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each voucher, we can compute its duration. Let's denote duration as d. So for each voucher, d = ri - li + 1.\n\nWe need two vouchers with durations d1 and d2 such that d1 + d2 = x. And they don't overlap.\n\nSo, for each voucher, if we can find another voucher with duration (x - d), which doesn't overlap with it, then we can consider their sum of costs.\n\nBut how to efficiently find for each voucher, the minimal cost voucher of duration (x - d) that doesn't overlap with it?\n\nBut even that seems tricky. Because for each voucher, we have to check for vouchers with a certain duration, and also check if they don't overlap.\n\nAlternative idea: group vouchers by their duration. So, for each possible duration d, we have a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we can look into the group of vouchers with duration (x - d), and find those that don't overlap with it.\n\nBut even then, how to find the minimal cost in that group that doesn't overlap with the current voucher?\n\nBut considering that for each voucher, we need to check for vouchers of a specific duration (x - d), and find the minimal cost among those that are non-overlapping.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the minimal cost for vouchers of a certain duration that end before the current voucher's start, or start after the current voucher's end?\n\nHmm. Let's think about this. Suppose we have a voucher A with duration d1, and we need to find vouchers B with duration d2 = x - d1. For B to not overlap with A, either B ends before A starts (B's ri < A's li) or B starts after A ends (B's li > A's ri).\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can check for vouchers B with duration d2 = x - d1. For these B vouchers, we need to find those that are entirely before A, or entirely after A. Then take the minimum cost among those.\n\nBut how to find that quickly?\n\nFor example, if we have all vouchers of duration d2 sorted by their end time. Then for a given A, which starts at li, we can find all vouchers B that end before li. The minimal cost among them would be the best candidate for the first case (B ends before A starts). Similarly, if we have vouchers of duration d2 sorted by their start time, we can find all vouchers B that start after A's end (ri). The minimal cost among those would be the best candidate for the second case.\n\nSo, for each duration d, we can pre-process the vouchers of that duration. For example, for each d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time (ri), so that we can binary search for the maximum end time less than a certain value (like A's li). Then, among all such vouchers, find the one with minimal cost.\n\n- Another sorted by start time (li), so that we can binary search for the minimum start time greater than a certain value (like A's ri). Again, find the minimal cost among those.\n\nWait, but for each duration, how do we store the minimal cost? For example, if we have a list of vouchers sorted by end time, and for each position in that list, we have the minimum cost up to that point. Then, for a given value (say, target_end = li - 1), we can binary search the largest end time <= target_end, and then get the minimum cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly for the other case: sorted by start time, and for each position, the minimum cost from that index onwards.\n\nThis sounds like a possible approach.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, store two structures:\n\n   a. A sorted list of (end time, cost) sorted by end time. Also, a prefix minimum array. So for each index i in this list, prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i elements.\n\n   b. A sorted list of (start time, cost) sorted by start time. Also, a suffix minimum array. So for each index i in this list, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among elements from i to the end.\n\n2. For each voucher A in the list, compute d1 = duration of A. Check if x - d1 is a valid duration (i.e., exists in our preprocessed data). If not, skip.\n\n3. For the duration d2 = x - d1, we need to find vouchers B that are non-overlapping with A. There are two possibilities:\n\n   a. B ends before A starts (B's ri < A's li). So for this, we look into the sorted list of vouchers with duration d2, sorted by end time. Find the largest end time that is less than A's li. Then, get the minimum cost in that prefix.\n\n   b. B starts after A ends (B's li > A's ri). For this, look into the sorted list of vouchers with duration d2, sorted by start time. Find the smallest start time that is greater than A's ri. Then, get the minimum cost in the suffix from that index onwards.\n\n4. For each of these possibilities (a and b), if there are any such vouchers, take the minimal cost and add it to A's cost. Keep track of the global minimum across all such possibilities.\n\nBut how do we handle the cases where d1 + d2 = x, but d2 could be zero? Well, since x is at least 2 (since in the input, x is >=2?), no. Wait, the problem says x can be as low as 2. But the duration of a voucher is at least 1 (since li <= ri, so ri - li + 1 >=1). So, for example, if x is 2, then d1 can be 1 and d2 can be 1. So that's possible.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into groups by their duration.\n\n- For each voucher, check if there exists a duration (x - d1). If not, skip.\n\n- For the existing vouchers of duration d2, check both possibilities (before and after).\n\nBut how to handle the same voucher being considered twice? Like, if a voucher is used in both i and j. But since the problem requires i != j, but when checking for voucher A and voucher B, if A is in the group of d1 and B is in the group of d2, then they are different vouchers, because d1 + d2 = x. Unless d1 = d2 = x/2, and the same voucher is used twice. But in that case, since the voucher's duration is x/2, and we need two vouchers. However, the problem states that i and j must be different. So, in this case, we need to make sure that when we check for vouchers in the same group, we don't use the same voucher twice.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, suppose a voucher A has duration d, and x is 2d. Then, when processing voucher A, we check the group of d (since x - d = d). But when looking for vouchers in that group, we need to make sure that the voucher B is not A itself.\n\nBut how to ensure that? Because, in the case where there are multiple vouchers in the same group, perhaps the minimal cost is from another voucher. But if there's only one voucher in the group, and it's the same as A, then we can't use it. So during the checking process, when we look for vouchers in the same group, we need to make sure that the voucher B is not the same as A.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nHmm. This complicates things. Because for each voucher A, when we look into the group of d2 (which may be same as d1), we need to find the minimal cost in that group that is not A itself.\n\nBut how can we handle that?\n\nWell, for example, when we process voucher A, and check the group of d2 (same as d1), then when we look for vouchers in that group, we need to exclude A. However, if there are multiple vouchers in the group, then even if one of them is A, there might be others.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we handle this?\n\nAlternative approach: when considering a voucher A, and looking for vouchers B in the group of d2 (which could be same as d1), we can check if there are any vouchers in that group that are not A. If there are, then proceed to find the minimal cost among them. But how to do that?\n\nBut during preprocessing, for each group, the sorted lists include all vouchers. So when we look for vouchers in the group, we can find the minimal cost, but we need to make sure that the minimal cost is not from the same voucher as A.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a group of vouchers with duration d. When processing voucher A (which is part of this group), we need to find the minimal cost of vouchers in this group that are non-overlapping with A, and not A itself.\n\nBut this seems tricky. Because the minimal cost in the group could be A's own cost, but since we can't use it, we need to check if there's another voucher with the same minimal cost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing step, for each group, we can have the list of vouchers sorted and with their minima, but when checking for a particular voucher, we can check whether the minimal cost in that group (for the required non-overlapping condition) is from a different voucher.\n\nBut that seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can allow the same voucher to be considered, but then in the end, check if the two vouchers are different.\n\nBut that would complicate things. For example, if the same voucher is considered for both parts, but in reality, it's impossible because the durations would have to be x, but the voucher's duration is d, so x would have to be 2d, and the voucher would have to be non-overlapping with itself, which is impossible (since it's the same voucher, it overlaps with itself).\n\nTherefore, in the case where d1 = d2, when we process voucher A, and look for vouchers B in the same group, we need to make sure that B is not A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nPerhaps, when we check the group of vouchers with duration d2, and for the current voucher A (with duration d1), we can find the minimal cost in that group that satisfies the non-overlapping condition, and then check if that minimal cost comes from a different voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems complex. Let's think of an example. Suppose there's only one voucher in the group. Then, if we are processing it, and looking for another voucher in the same group, then there is none. So we can't use it. But if there are two vouchers, then even if one of them is A, there's another one.\n\nBut how to handle this during the processing.\n\nMaybe during the initial processing, for each group, we can have two separate data structures for the two cases (before and after), and for each of those, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if that minimal cost is from a voucher that is not A.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of voucher A, when looking for vouchers B in the group of d2, perhaps the minimal cost is found, but we need to make sure that there's at least one voucher in that group that is not A and satisfies the non-overlapping condition.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each group, we can have the list of vouchers sorted, and for each position in the sorted list, we can have the minimum cost up to that point. However, when we are looking for the minimal cost, we can check if the voucher that gives that minimal cost is the same as A. If so, then we need to check the next possible candidate.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can allow the same voucher to be considered, but then when we find that the two vouchers are the same, we ignore that case. However, this would require that during the checking phase, for each pair (A, B), we check that A and B are different.\n\nBut given that the problem allows for i and j to be different, but in this case, when d1 + d2 = x and d1 = d2, and the same voucher is considered, then B would be A, but that's not allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to handle this is:\n\nFor each voucher A, when looking for B in the same group (d2 = d1), we need to find B that is not A and satisfies the non-overlapping condition.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, when looking for vouchers B that end before A starts (case a), and the group is d2. Suppose the minimal cost in that group is from a voucher B that is not A. Then, that's okay. If the minimal cost is from A itself, then we need to check if there's another voucher in the group that ends before A starts. If not, then we can't use this case.\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps in practice, the number of vouchers with the same duration and overlapping with A is small, and we can handle it by checking if the voucher is the same as A.\n\nBut how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each group, we can store the vouchers sorted by end time, and for each voucher in that group, we can have their cost. Then, when we find the minimal cost in the group that ends before A's li, we can check if that voucher is not A.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher A, when looking for B in the same group (d2 = d1), we can check for the minimal cost in the group that ends before A's li. If the minimal cost is from a voucher B that is not A, then we can use it. Otherwise, we can't use this case.\n\nBut how to check that.\n\nThis seems difficult. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of all possible pairs of vouchers that satisfy the duration condition. For each such pair, check if they are non-overlapping and compute the sum of costs. The problem is to find the minimal such sum.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, this is O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can split the problem into two parts:\n\nFor each voucher, find the best possible voucher that comes before it (ends before it starts) and has duration (x - d), and vice versa.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. For each voucher, we can consider two scenarios:\n\n1. The first voucher is before the current voucher. So, for the current voucher, we need to find a voucher of duration (x - d) that ends before the current voucher's start. Then, the current voucher's duration plus that voucher's duration is x. The sum is current cost plus the voucher's cost.\n\n2. The second voucher is after the current voucher. So, for the current voucher, find a voucher of duration (x - d) that starts after the current voucher's end. Then, sum the costs.\n\nIf we can find the minimal cost for each scenario, then we can compute the overall minimum.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we need to find the minimal cost of vouchers of duration (x - d) that are before it, and the minimal cost of vouchers of duration (x - d) that are after it.\n\nThe key is to find these minimal costs efficiently.\n\nTo do that, we can preprocess for each duration d, two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by their end time, along with a prefix min array. So for a given end time, we can find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration d that end before a certain time.\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by their start time, along with a suffix min array. So for a given start time, we can find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration d that start after a certain time.\n\nBut how to build these structures.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each duration d, collect all vouchers with that duration. Then, for each such group, sort the vouchers by their end time. For each position in this sorted list, compute the prefix minimum of the costs. Similarly, sort the same vouchers by their start time, and compute the suffix minimum of the costs.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for any voucher A with duration d1, and looking for vouchers B of duration d2 = x - d1:\n\nCase 1: B ends before A starts.\n\nWe look into the group of d2. For that group, the sorted list by end time. We perform a binary search to find the largest end time that is less than A's li. Then, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimal cost for B in this case.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A ends.\n\nWe look into the group of d2. For that group, the sorted list by start time. Perform a binary search to find the smallest start time that is greater than A's ri. Then, the suffix min from that index gives the minimal cost for B in this case.\n\nBut what if the group d2 does not exist? Then, we skip.\n\nNow, the problem of overlapping with the same voucher comes into play. For example, if the voucher A is in the group d2 (i.e., d1 = d2), then when we look for B in the group d2, which includes A. But in case 1, B ends before A starts. However, since A's start is li, and B ends before li. But A's end is ri. So if B ends before li, and A starts at li, then B ends before A starts. But A's own end is ri, which is >= li. So if B is A, then B's end is ri, which is >= li. So B can't be A in this case. Wait, because for case 1, B ends before A's li. But A's own end is ri. So if B is A, then ri must be < li. But since li <= ri (as per the input constraints), this can only be true if li = ri and ri < li, which is impossible. Therefore, B cannot be A in case 1.\n\nSimilarly, in case 2, B starts after A's ri. If B is A, then A's start time (li) must be > A's ri. Which is impossible. Therefore, in both cases, when B is in the same group as A, but the non-overlapping condition is checked, B cannot be A. Therefore, there's no need to worry about the same voucher being considered here.\n\nThat's a crucial insight! Because, if B is the same voucher as A, then for case 1 (B ends before A's li), B's end time (ri) would have to be < li. But since li <= ri (as per the input), this is impossible. Similarly for case 2. Therefore, when we process voucher A, and look for B in the same group, the B's found in case 1 and 2 are guaranteed to be different from A. Therefore, we don't have to worry about that scenario.\n\nThat's great! So, this approach is safe. Thus, the problem of same voucher being considered is automatically handled.\n\nSo, this approach is correct.\n\nNow, the steps to implement this.\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we have:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by end time (ri), and a prefix min array.\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by start time (li), and a suffix min array.\n\nSo, how to create these structures.\n\nFor example, for a group of vouchers with duration d:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])  # sorted by ri\n\nprefix_min = array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nsuffix_min = array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end.\n\nOnce these are preprocessed, for each voucher A, we can check for d2 = x - d1.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, note that the vouchers can have varying durations. So, for each duration, we can have a dictionary mapping duration to these two sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nSo, for example, using a defaultdict to map durations to their sorted lists.\n\nBut for large n, this should be manageable.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines of li, ri, cost.\n\nCompute for each voucher, its duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup the vouchers by their duration. So, for each d, we have a list of vouchers.\n\nFor each such group, we need to create two sorted lists:\n\nsorted_by_end: sorted by ri, then for each position, compute the prefix min.\n\nsorted_by_start: sorted by li, then compute the suffix min.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list, we process it as follows:\n\nCompute d1 = duration of voucher.\n\nCheck if x - d1 is a valid duration (i.e., present in the groups). If not, skip.\n\nElse, get the group for d2 = x - d1.\n\nFor that group, check case 1 and case 2.\n\nCase 1: find vouchers in group d2 that end before voucher's li.\n\nTo find this, in the sorted_by_end list of group d2, find the largest ri that is < li.\n\nHow to do that? We can perform a binary search on the sorted_by_end list's ri values.\n\nOnce we find the index, if any, then the prefix_min up to that index is the minimal cost for case 1.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers in group d2 that start after voucher's ri.\n\nIn the sorted_by_start list of group d2, find the smallest li that is > ri.\n\nOnce found, the suffix_min from that index is the minimal cost for case 2.\n\nFor each case, if there is a valid voucher, then we can add the current voucher's cost to the found minimal cost and keep track of the global minimum.\n\nNow, the problem is how to perform the binary searches.\n\nFor case 1:\n\nWe have a list sorted by end time (ri). For each voucher in this list, we have their ri values. We need to find the largest ri that is less than A's li.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the upper bound of A's li - 1, then taking the index before that.\n\nFor example, in Python, using bisect.bisect_left or bisect.bisect_right.\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have a list of end times, sorted in ascending order. We want to find the rightmost element that is less than target (A's li).\n\nWe can use bisect_left to find the insertion point of target in the list. The insertion point gives us the first element >= target. So the elements before that index are all < target. So the maximum index is insertion_point - 1.\n\nIf insertion_point is 0, then there are no elements < target.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nsorted_ri = [1,3,5,7]\n\ntarget is 4. Insertion point is 2 (since 3 <4 <5). So elements before index 2 are [1,3], so the max is index 1.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nimport bisect\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_ri, target)\n\nif index > 0:\n\n   min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[index -1]\n\nelse:\n\n   no such voucher.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2:\n\nWe have a list of start times (sorted in ascending order). We need to find the first element that is > A's ri.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the first element in the sorted list that is greater than A's ri. The index can be found using bisect_right.\n\nFor example, sorted_li = [1,3,5,7]. target is 4. bisect_right returns 2 (insertion point after existing entries of 4). So elements from index 2 onwards are >4. So the minimal cost is the suffix_min[2].\n\nSo, in code:\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_li, target)\n\nif index < len(sorted_li):\n\n   min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n   no such voucher.\n\nOnce we have the min_cost_case1 and min_cost_case2, we can add them to the current voucher's cost and update the global minimum.\n\nNow, the problem is to build the sorted lists and their prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nLet me think about how to do that.\n\nFor each group (duration d), for the sorted_by_end list:\n\nsorted_by_end is a list of vouchers, sorted by their ri. For each voucher, we can extract the ri and cost. Then, the prefix_min array is built as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = cost of first voucher.\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], cost of ith voucher).\n\nSimilarly for the sorted_by_start list and suffix_min array.\n\nFor example, sorted_by_start is sorted by li. The suffix_min array is built from the end:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = cost of last voucher.\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min( cost of voucher i, suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nOnce these are precomputed, during the binary search steps, we can quickly retrieve the minimal cost.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe can create a dictionary, say, duration_data, which maps each duration d to a tuple of (sorted_by_end_list, prefix_min_list, sorted_by_start_list, suffix_min_list).\n\nSo for each duration d, we process the vouchers in that group.\n\nFor example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_data = defaultdict( lambda: ( [], [], [], [] ) )\n\nBut perhaps better to create for each duration d, a structure that contains the sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, for each duration d, we can process the vouchers as follows:\n\nvouchers_in_group = list of vouchers (each is a tuple (li, ri, cost))\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_in_group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nsorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_in_group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nThen, for the prefix_min:\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_end)\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_by_end)-1:\n\nprefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2] )\n\nSimilarly for suffix_min:\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n\nfor i in len(sorted_by_start)-2 downto 0:\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2] )\n\nOnce these are built, then for each voucher A, we can proceed.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read all vouchers, compute their durations, and group them by duration.\n\nThen, for each duration, build the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start lists, and their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, initialize the answer as infinity.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d1 = ri - li + 1\n\n   d2 = x - d1\n\n   if d2 < 1: continue (since durations are at least 1)\n\n   if d2 not in duration_data: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      group_data = duration_data[d2]\n\n      sorted_by_end_list = group_data's sorted_by_end\n\n      prefix_min_list = group_data's prefix_min\n\n      sorted_by_start_list = group_data's sorted_by_start\n\n      suffix_min_list = group_data's suffix_min\n\n      # case 1: find vouchers in d2 group that end before li of current voucher\n\n      # get the list of end times from sorted_by_end_list\n\n      # extract the end times for binary search\n\n      # but since sorted_by_end_list is sorted by ri, we can create a list of end times once.\n\n      # perhaps during preprocessing, for each group, we can have a list of end times and a list of start times.\n\n      # Alternatively, during the binary search, we can extract the ri from the sorted_by_end list.\n\n      # but for binary search, we need to have a list of the ri values.\n\n      # So during preprocessing, for each group, we can have:\n\n      # end_times = [voucher[1] for voucher in sorted_by_end_list]\n\n      # start_times = [voucher[0] for voucher in sorted_by_start_list]\n\n      # So during the preprocessing step, for each group, we can create these lists.\n\n      # Let's adjust the duration_data to store these.\n\nSo perhaps during the grouping phase, for each duration d, we store:\n\nsorted_by_end (list of vouchers sorted by end time)\n\nend_times (list of end times for these vouchers)\n\nprefix_min (list of prefix minima)\n\nsorted_by_start (list of vouchers sorted by start time)\n\nstart_times (list of start times for these vouchers)\n\nsuffix_min (list of suffix minima)\n\nSo, during the grouping phase, for each group, we can precompute these lists.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher A:\n\ncase 1:\n\ntarget_end = A's li - 1\n\nWe perform a binary search on end_times of the group d2 to find the largest end time <= target_end.\n\nSimilarly, case 2:\n\ntarget_start = A's ri + 1 (since we need B's li > A's ri)\n\nWait, no. For case 2, B's li must be > A's ri. So the target is A's ri. We need to find the first start time in the start_times list that is > A's ri.\n\nSo, for case 2, the code is:\n\nusing bisect.bisect_right(start_times, A_ri) gives us the first index where start_time > A_ri.\n\nSo, for example, start_times is [1,3,5,7], and A_ri is 4. bisect_right returns 2, which is the index of 5. So elements from index 2 onwards are >4.\n\nSo, during the code:\n\nFor case 1:\n\ncurrent_li = voucher's li\n\ntarget = current_li - 1\n\nWe need to find the largest end_time <= target.\n\nUsing bisect.bisect_left(end_times, target) gives us the insertion point. The index is insertion_point.\n\nIf insertion_point == 0: no such voucher.\n\nElse, the max index is insertion_point -1.\n\nIf insertion_point -1 >=0, then the min cost is prefix_min[insertion_point -1].\n\nFor case 2:\n\ncurrent_ri = voucher's ri\n\ntarget = current_ri\n\nWe use bisect.bisect_right(start_times, target) to get the insertion index. If insertion index is <= len(start_times) -1, then the min cost is suffix_min[insertion_index].\n\nNow, putting this together.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut first, how to handle the duration_data.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict( lambda: ( [], [], [], [], [] ) )\n\n# For each duration d, we have:\n\n# sorted_by_end (list of (li, ri, cost)), end_times (list of ri), prefix_min (list of min costs)\n\n# sorted_by_start (list of (li, ri, cost)), start_times (list of li), suffix_min (list of min costs)\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n\n    li, ri, cost = voucher\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    # add to duration_dict[d]\n\n    # but need to process all vouchers first, then build the sorted lists and min arrays.\n\nWait, no. We can't process the vouchers in the duration_dict while building them. So perhaps first, group all vouchers by their duration, then for each group, build the sorted lists and min arrays.\n\nSo, first, group all vouchers by duration:\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    groups[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration d in groups, process the group to build the sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min.\n\nSo:\n\nduration_data = {}\n\nfor d in groups:\n\n    vouchers_in_group = groups[d]\n\n    # process sorted by end time\n\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_in_group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n\n    # build prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_end)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_by_end)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2] )\n\n    # process sorted by start time\n\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_in_group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n\n    # build suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2] )\n\n    # store in duration_data\n\n    duration_data[d] = (sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min )\n\nOnce that is done, then for each voucher in the original list, we process it.\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nans = infinity\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d1 = ri - li + 1\n\n    d2 = x - d1\n\n    if d2 < 1:\n\n        continue\n\n    if d2 not in duration_data:\n\n        continue\n\n    # get the data for d2\n\n    sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min = duration_data[d2]\n\n    # case 1: find vouchers in d2 that end before li\n\n    target_case1 = li - 1\n\n    # find insertion point in end_times\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(end_times, target_case1)\n\n    if idx > 0:\n\n        min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[idx-1]\n\n        total = cost + min_cost_case1\n\n        if total < ans:\n\n            ans = total\n\n    # case 2: find vouchers in d2 that start after ri\n\n    target_case2 = ri\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(start_times, target_case2)\n\n    if idx < len(start_times):\n\n        min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[idx]\n\n        total = cost + min_cost_case2\n\n        if total < ans:\n\n            ans = total\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if ans is still infinity, output -1, else output ans.\n\nBut wait, what about when d2 is the same as d1? For example, when x is even and d1 = d2 = x/2. But as discussed earlier, the code handles that correctly, since the vouchers in the group d2 (which is same as d1) are processed, and the current voucher is not included in the case1 and case2.\n\nBut in this code, for case1, when we process the current voucher, the group d2 is the same as d1. But the code is looking for vouchers in the group d2 (same as d1) that end before current voucher's li. Since the current voucher's ri >= li, and the vouchers in group d2 that end before li would have ri < li. But the current voucher's ri is >= li. So the current voucher cannot be in that group (since it's ri >= li, but the group's vouchers have ri < li). So, the code is correct.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4\n\n1 2 5\n\n5 6 1\n\n1 2 4\n\nThe vouchers are:\n\nVoucher 0: li=1, ri=3, cost=4 → duration 3.\n\nVoucher 1: li=1, ri=2, cost=5 → duration 2.\n\nVoucher 2: li=5, ri=6, cost=1 → duration 2.\n\nVoucher 3: li=1, ri=2, cost=4 → duration 2.\n\nx is 5. So, for each voucher, we check if there's a d2 = 5 - d1.\n\nLet's take voucher 0 (d1=3). d2=5-3=2. So check group d2=2.\n\nGroup d2=2 has",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently searching for vouchers with specific durations later.\n2. **Preprocess Data Structures**: For each duration group, we sort the vouchers by their end time and start time. Additionally, we compute prefix minimum arrays for sorted end times and suffix minimum arrays for sorted start times. These arrays help in quickly finding the minimum cost of vouchers that meet the non-overlapping conditions.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, we determine if there exists another voucher with a complementary duration such that their combined duration equals the given value. Using binary search, we efficiently find the minimum cost of valid non-overlapping vouchers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Group vouchers by their duration\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        groups[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess duration data\n    duration_data = {}\n    for d in groups:\n        vouchers_in_group = groups[d]\n        # Sort by end time and compute prefix min\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_in_group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_end)\n        prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_by_end)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2])\n        # Sort by start time and compute suffix min\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_in_group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2])\n        # Store in duration_data\n        duration_data[d] = (sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d1 = ri - li + 1\n        d2 = x - d1\n        if d2 < 1:\n            continue\n        if d2 not in duration_data:\n            continue\n        # Get the data for d2\n        sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min = duration_data[d2]\n        # Case 1: find vouchers ending before li\n        target_case1 = li - 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(end_times, target_case1)\n        if idx > 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[idx-1]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost + current_min)\n        # Case 2: find vouchers starting after ri\n        target_case2 = ri\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(start_times, target_case2)\n        if idx < len(start_times):\n            current_min = suffix_min[idx]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost + current_min)\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: We first group all vouchers by their duration to facilitate efficient lookup later.\n2. **Sorting and Preprocessing**: For each duration group, we sort vouchers by their end and start times.
