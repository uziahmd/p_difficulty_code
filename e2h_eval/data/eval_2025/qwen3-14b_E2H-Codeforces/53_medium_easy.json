    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm, how do I check all possible substrings and see which ones appear more than once?\n\nAn idea: For each possible length starting from the maximum possible down to 1, check if there's a substring of that length that appears at least twice. Once found, return that length. Because we want the maximum possible.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Determine the maximum possible substring length. For a string of length n, the maximum possible is floor(n/2), because if a substring is longer than that, it can't appear twice. Wait, for example, if the string is length 5, the max possible is 2 (like 'ab' in 'ababa'). Wait, but for 'aaaaa', the maximum would be 4 (since 'aaaa' appears twice, overlapping). So for a string of length n, the maximum possible length to check is n-1. But checking all possible lengths from n-1 down to 1, and for each length, check if any substring of that length appears at least twice.\n\nBut how to efficiently check that?\n\nFor each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), generate all substrings of length L, track their occurrences, and see if any of them appears at least twice. If yes, return L as the answer.\n\nSo for the given string, let's say s. The maximum possible L is len(s) - 1. For example, for 'zzz', len is 3. The maximum L is 2. And indeed, 'zz' appears twice.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   create a set to store substrings of length L.\n\n   iterate through the string, taking each substring of length L.\n\n   for each substring, check if it's already in the set. If yes, return L as the answer.\n\n   else, add it to the set.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, no such substring is found, return 0.\n\nWait, but for example, in the first sample input, 'abcd' has len 4. So check L=3 first. The substrings are 'abc' and 'bcd'. Neither repeats. Then L=2: substrings 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — no repeats. Then L=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' — each occurs once. So answer is 0.\n\nYes, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 'ababa' len is 5. Check L=4 first. Substrings are 'abab' and 'baba' — no duplicates. Then L=3. Substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. When we check the first 'aba', add to set. Then 'bab' is new. Then next 'aba' is already in the set. So return 3.\n\nYes. So that works.\n\nSo the approach is to check for each possible L starting from the maximum possible, and for each L, check all substrings of that length. If any substring occurs more than once, return that L.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCompute the maximum possible L as len(s) - 1.\n\nLoop L from that maximum down to 1:\n\n   create a set.\n\n   for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in the set:\n\n           return L as the answer.\n\n       else:\n\n           add substr to the set.\n\nIf none found after all L, return 0.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All characters same. Like 'zzz' (sample input). For L=2, substrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2). So returns 2.\n\nEdge case 2: string of length 1. Then len(s) is 1, so len(s)-1 is 0. So loop from 0 down to 1? Wait, no. The loop for L would be in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1). For len(s) = 1, len(s)-1 is 0. So the loop starts at 0, and ends at 0 (since the end is 0, and step is -1). So the loop would run for L=0? But then, in the code, for L=0, the substrings would be of length 0. Which is empty string. But the problem says that the substring must be met at least twice. However, the problem says that the input string is non-empty, but for L=0, perhaps the code would return 0. However, according to the problem statement, the output is 0 in such cases.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is non-empty. For example, if the input is 'a', the output is 0, since there's no substring of length >=1 that occurs twice. So the code would return 0.\n\nBut in the code, when len(s) is 1, the loop for L starts at len(s)-1 = 0, and then the loop is for L in range(0, 0, -1), which doesn't run. Then returns 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: string with two same characters. Like 'aa'. Then len is 2. Check L=1. The substrings are 'a' (positions 0 and 1). So when processing the second substring, it's already in the set. So returns 1.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbaa'. Let's see. The maximum possible L is 5. Check for L=5: substrings are 'aabba' and 'abbaa' — no duplicates. Then L=4: 'aabb', 'abba', 'bbaa' — no. Then L=3: 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa' — no. Then L=2: 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. The first 'aa' is at position 0, then again at position 4. So when checking for L=2, during iteration, when i=4, substr is 'aa' which is already in the set. So returns 2. But wait, there's a longer substring. For example, 'aabbaa' has 'aa' at start and end. But also, the substring 'aabbaa' has 'aab' and 'abba' etc. Wait, but maybe there's a longer substring. Let's think. For example, 'aabbaa' has 'aa' as substring of length 2. But also, 'aabbaa' has 'aabbaa' — but that's the whole string. But for L=3, maybe 'aab' occurs once, 'abb' once, 'bba' once, 'baa' once. So no duplicates. So the maximum is 2. So the code would return 2.\n\nBut what about the substring 'aa' which occurs twice. So the code correctly returns 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Oh, the input is given as a list of strings, and the output is a list of numbers. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nOutput: ['0', '3', '2']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is a single string. Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. Wait, but the sample input shows that the input is a list of strings. Wait, perhaps the problem was presented as a list of examples, but the actual input is a single string. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty... So the code should read a single string from stdin. However, the sample input shows multiple examples, but perhaps that's part of the problem description. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but that's probably just an example of multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one string per input.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is the first input line containing the string. So the code should read a single string. But the sample input shows multiple strings. Wait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is a list of strings, but that's not clear. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty...\n\nBut the sample input shows:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nWhich is a list of three strings, and the output is a list of three numbers. So perhaps the actual problem is that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each being a string. However, the original problem's input is unclear. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input is a single string. But the sample input shows multiple strings. Wait, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases. For example, the sample input is three different test cases. But the original problem's input is a single string. So perhaps the problem is that the user provided a sample where the input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one string per run.\n\nBut that's conflicting. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nSo the input is a single string. However, the sample input shows multiple strings. That's confusing. But looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWhich suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each being a string. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is conflicting. But perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the input is multiple test cases, each on separate lines. Or perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is a list of strings, but the code is supposed to read each string from the input, process them, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the original problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says \"the first input line contains the string\" — implying that there is only one string.\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the note that says \"this is an easy question\", and the sample input shows three test cases, perhaps the actual problem is that the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input. For example, the input may be multiple lines, each being a string, and the output is the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code is supposed to process a single string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the input is a list of strings (like in the sample), but the code is supposed to process each of them. However, the original problem says that the input is a single string.\n\nThis is a critical point. Because if the code is supposed to process a single string, then the sample input is wrong. But perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one string per run.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the sample input is a list of strings, and the output is a list of numbers. Therefore, the code should read multiple test cases. For example, perhaps the input is a list of strings, each on a separate line, and the code should output the corresponding answers for each.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first input line contains the string. Which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the input is a list of strings, but the code is supposed to read them as a list. However, in practice, when you read from stdin in Python, you can read lines as input.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. For example, the input is multiple lines, each being a string. The output is one line per input string, with the answer.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the actual input is a single string. For example, the sample input shows three test cases, but the code is supposed to process one string per run.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as a list of strings, perhaps the code should read all the test cases from the input, process them, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, if the input is given as a list of strings, perhaps the code should read them as a list. However, in practice, when you read from stdin, you can read lines. So perhaps the input is multiple lines, each being a string.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So that suggests that the code is supposed to read a single string.\n\nThis is a problem. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Let me check the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\nBut the way the problem is presented, perhaps the actual input is a list of strings. For example, the code is supposed to read multiple strings from input, each on a separate line, and output the answers for each.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from stdin, split them into individual strings, process each, and output the answers.\n\nBut the problem's original description says that the first input line contains the string, which implies a single string. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a critical ambiguity. However, given the sample input and output, I think that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, the input is a list of three strings, and the output is a list of three numbers. So the code should read each string, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, if the input is given as a list of strings, perhaps in the code, the input is read via input().split() or similar.\n\nBut in practice, when the code runs, the input is given as lines. For example, the first line is the number of test cases, followed by each test case. Or perhaps each test case is on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says nothing about that. However, the sample input shows that the input is a list of strings, which is perhaps a way to represent multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the first input line contains the string, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that is not accurate. Maybe the sample input is a list of test cases, each of which is a string, and the code is supposed to process each of them.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the code should read all the input lines, split them into individual strings, and process each one.\n\nBut how to read the input in Python?\n\nFor example, if the input is given as:\n\nabcd\nababa\nzzz\n\nThen the code can read each line, process it, and output the result for each.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. Which would imply that there is only one line. However, the sample shows multiple lines.\n\nThis is confusing. But given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, I think that the code should process multiple test cases. So the code should read all input lines, for each line, process the string, and output the answer.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nIn the problem statement's sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, when the code is run, the input is given as lines. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case.\n\nSo, for example, the code would read all lines, for each line, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nIn that case, the code would look like:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    s = line.strip()\n    # process s and compute the answer\n    print(answer)\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. But in practice, each string is on a separate line.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input and output is given as lists, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single string. But in that case, the sample input and output would be inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code is supposed to process a single string. In that case, the code would read the input as a single string, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, which would require the code to process multiple inputs.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a single string, I think that the sample input is presented in a way that is not matching the actual input format. For example, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual problem is that each test case is a single string.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. Therefore, I will proceed under the assumption that the code is supposed to read a single string from the input.\n\nBut then, the sample input shows multiple strings. However, perhaps the sample input is just a way to present multiple test cases, and the actual code is supposed to process one string per run.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps the problem is that the user provided a sample where the input is a list of strings, but the actual code should process each string in the list. However, the code is supposed to read from stdin.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the input is given as multiple lines, each being a string. For example, the code reads all lines from stdin, splits them into individual strings, and processes each one.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nWell, for example, the code can read all lines, for each line, process the string, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which would correspond to three lines, each with one string.\n\nSo, in the code, the code would read each line, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        # process s\n        print(compute_max_length(s))\n\nBut then, for the sample input, the code would output 0, 3, 2 for the three test cases.\n\nBut how to handle the case when the input is given as a single line? Well, the code would process that line as a single test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. Therefore, perhaps the code should process a single string. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. This is very confusing.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem's original description says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is incorrect, and the actual code should process a single string.\n\nBut given that the sample shows multiple test cases, and the output is a list of numbers, I think that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given on a separate line. Therefore, I will proceed with that approach.\n\nSo, the code will read all lines from stdin, for each line, process the string, and output the answer.\n\nNow, the code for the function compute_max_length(s):\n\ndef compute_max_length(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                return L\n            seen.add(substr)\n    return 0\n\nWait, but for the sample input 'zzz', the code would check for L=2. The substrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), then 'zz' (positions 1-2). When the second 'zz' is checked, it is in the set, so returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nFor the sample input 'ababa', len is 5. The loop starts with L=4. For L=4, there are two substrings: 'abab' (positions 0-3) and 'baba' (positions 1-4). No duplicates. Then L=3. For i=0, substr is 'aba'; added. i=1: 'bab' added. i=2: 'aba' is in the set. So returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code for the entire problem would be:\n\nRead each line from stdin, process each string, and print the answer.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef max_substring_length(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                return L\n            seen.add(substr)\n    return 0\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        print(max_substring_length(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the input is empty? According to the problem statement, the input is non-empty, so the code is safe.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\nabcd\nababa\nzzz\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor 'abcd' → returns 0.\n\nFor 'ababa' → returns 3.\n\nFor 'zzz' → returns 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: 'aa' → returns 1.\n\nAnother test case: 'a' → returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → len is 5. For L=4: substrings are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3), 'aaaa' (positions 1-4). So returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping substrings? For example, 'ababa' with L=3. The first occurrence is at 0-2, then at 2-4. The code checks for substrings in order, and when the second occurrence is found, returns L.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which is an important consideration for our solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of multiple strings, each on a separate line. We need to process each string individually.\n2. **Substring Length Check**: For each string, check all possible substring lengths starting from the maximum possible length (which is one less than the string length) down to 1.\n3. **Set for Tracking Substrings**: For each length, use a set to track substrings of that length. If a substring is found more than once, return the current length as the result.\n4. **Early Termination**: As soon as a valid substring length is found, return it immediately, ensuring efficiency by checking from the longest possible length downwards.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef max_substring_length(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                return L\n            seen.add(substr)\n    return 0\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        print(max_substring_length(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The `main` function reads each line from standard input, strips any extraneous whitespace, and processes each string.\n2. **Substring Length Check**: The `max_substring_length` function iterates over possible substring lengths starting from the longest possible down to 1.\n3. **Tracking Substrings**: For each length, a set is used to track substrings. If a substring is encountered again, it means the substring appears at least twice, and the current length is returned immediately.\n4. **Efficiency**: By checking from the longest possible length downwards, we ensure that the first valid length found is the maximum possible, allowing for early termination and efficient processing.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the longest substring that appears at least twice, leveraging sets for quick lookups and iterating from the longest possible length to minimize unnecessary checks.",
