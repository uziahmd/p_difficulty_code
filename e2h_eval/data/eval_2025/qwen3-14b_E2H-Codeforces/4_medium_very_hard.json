The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. Nikephoros's moves are cyclic through his sequence A, and Polycarpus's through B. For each round, we compare their moves and determine who wins. The loser gets a red spot. If it's a draw, nothing happens.\n\nThe challenge is that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round step by step. So simulating all n rounds directly is impossible. We need an efficient way to calculate the number of wins for each player over all rounds.\n\nSo, how can I model this?\n\nLet me think about the sequences. Each player's move for round i depends on their sequence's length. For example, Nikephoros's move in round i is A[(i-1) mod m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus's move in round i: B[(i-1) mod k], where k is the length of B.\n\nThe key idea here is that the pattern of moves for both players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so the same pair of moves will repeat again.\n\nSo, if I can compute the number of wins for each player in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, then I can calculate how many full cycles there are in n rounds and multiply by that count, then handle the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, I need to find the LCM of m and k. Let's recall that LCM(a, b) = (a*b)/GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Oh right, Python has math.gcd, but that returns the absolute value, and since m and k are positive, that's fine.\n\nOnce I have the LCM, let's call it T, then the total number of full cycles is n // T, and the remainder is n % T. So for each full cycle, I can compute the number of wins for each player, multiply by the number of full cycles, and then add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut wait, what if T is larger than n? Then there are zero full cycles and the remainder is n. So the approach still works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n2. For the first T rounds, compute how many times Nikephoros loses (which is the number of red spots on him) and how many times Polycarpus loses (red spots on him).\n3. Multiply those counts by the number of full cycles (full_cycles = n // T)\n4. Then compute the remaining rounds (remainder = n % T), and compute the number of losses in those remaining rounds.\n5. Sum all parts to get the total.\n\nBut how to compute the number of losses in T rounds?\n\nWell, for each round from 0 to T-1 (assuming 0-based), I can compute the moves of each player, compare them, and count the losses.\n\nBut T can be as big as m*k. Since m and k are up to 1000, their product is up to 1e6. So for each T, which is up to 1e6, we can simulate each round once. That's manageable because 1e6 operations are acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCalculate T = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute for each of the T rounds, the moves of A and B, then check who wins. Count the number of times Nikephoros loses (add to his count) and Polycarpus loses (add to his count).\n\nThen, total for full_cycles is full_cycles * (countA, countB). Then, process the remaining rounds (remainder) by simulating the first 'remainder' rounds again.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round?\n\nFor a given round i (starting from 0?), let's say for the i-th round (i starts at 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's is B[i % k].\n\nWait, the first round is round 1? Or round 0? Let me check the example.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=7\n\nA is RPS (m=3), B is RSPP (k=4).\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: A[0] (R), B[0] (R) → draw.\n\nRound 2: A[1] (P), B[1] (S) → S beats P? Wait, no. Wait the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock.\n\nSo for each move:\n\nIf A's move is X and B's is Y, then:\n\nif X beats Y → Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nif Y beats X → Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nElse, draw.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), determine who wins.\n\nSo for the first round, R vs R: draw. No spots.\n\nSecond round: P (paper) vs S (scissors). Scissors beats paper. So B wins. Nikephoros (A) loses. So Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nThird round: S (scissors) vs P (paper). Scissors beats paper. A wins. So B gets a spot. So Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo for each round, we need to compute the moves for A and B, then check who wins.\n\nSo for the T rounds, we can precompute for each i (from 0 to T-1) the moves, compare, and count the number of times each loses.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n, then read A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k). How to compute LCM?\n\nWell, compute GCD first. For example, in Python:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut note that for Python versions before 3.9, math.lcm is not available, but since the problem says to write code that works, and assuming that the code will be run in an environment with Python 3.9+ or that the code can compute it via the formula.\n\nSo proceed with that.\n\nOnce T is known, compute the number of full cycles and remainder.\n\nNow, simulate T rounds once, and compute for each round, the outcome.\n\nBut how to simulate T rounds?\n\nFor each i in 0 to T-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen compare a_move and b_move.\n\nSo for each of these, we can compute whether A wins, B wins, or draw.\n\nSo for each of the T rounds, we can compute the number of times Nikephoros loses (so when B wins) and Polycarpus loses (when A wins).\n\nSo let's create variables total_a_loss and total_b_loss, which are the counts for the T rounds.\n\nOnce we have those, then:\n\nfull_cycles = n // T\n\nremainder = n % T\n\ntotal_a_loss_full = full_cycles * total_a_loss\n\ntotal_b_loss_full = full_cycles * total_b_loss\n\nThen, for the remainder rounds, we need to simulate the first 'remainder' rounds (from 0 to remainder-1) and add their counts.\n\nSo, for the remainder, we can loop from 0 to remainder-1, compute the same as before, and add to the totals.\n\nBut how to compute the remainder rounds?\n\nBut for that, perhaps we can compute the same way as for T rounds, but only for the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut for large T, say 1e6, and remainder up to 1e6, this would take O(1e6) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo overall, the time complexity is O(T) for the initial processing, which is O(1e6) steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem is to code this.\n\nBut let's think about the example given:\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7\n\nA = \"RPS\" (m=3)\n\nB = \"RSPP\" (k=4)\n\nT = LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo for 12 rounds, compute the number of losses.\n\nBut in the sample, n=7 is less than T=12, so full_cycles = 0, remainder =7. So we simulate 7 rounds.\n\nBut in the example, the output is 3 and 2. Let's check that.\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds:\n\nRound 1: A[0] = R vs B[0] = R → draw. No loss.\n\nRound 2: A[1] = P vs B[1] = S → S beats P. B wins. Nikephoros (A) loses. So a_loss +=1.\n\nRound 3: A[2] = S vs B[2] = P → S beats P. A wins. B loses. So b_loss +=1.\n\nRound 4: A[0] = R vs B[3] = P → P beats R. B wins. A loses. a_loss +=1.\n\nRound 5: A[1] = P vs B[0] = R → P beats R. A wins. B loses. b_loss +=1.\n\nRound 6: A[2] = S vs B[1] = S → draw. No loss.\n\nRound 7: A[0] = R vs B[2] = P → P beats R. B wins. A loses. a_loss +=1.\n\nSo total a_loss is 3 (rounds 2,4,7), and b_loss is 2 (rounds 3,5). Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, read the inputs. The first line is n. Then the next line is A, then the next is B.\n\nBut the input is given as a list, like in the example:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, but in actual input, the first line is n, then the second line is A, third line is B. So for the first sample input, the first line is 7, then the second line is RPS, third is RSPP.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is presented as a list, but that's probably for the purpose of the example. In reality, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo in the code, the input is read as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nThen, m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nThen compute for T rounds, the number of a_loss and b_loss.\n\nBut how to compute for each i from 0 to T-1:\n\nfor i in range(T):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    determine outcome.\n\nSo for each of these, we can compute the outcome.\n\nNow, the question is how to determine who wins between a and b.\n\nWe can write a helper function, or just use conditionals.\n\nLet me think: for a and b, the possible cases:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a is R and b is S) → a wins.\n\nif (a is S and b is P) → a wins.\n\nif (a is P and b is R) → a wins.\n\nElse, b wins.\n\nSo, for example, if a is R and b is P → b wins.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)  # no loss for either\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so b loses. So Nikephoros (a) has no loss, Polycarpus (b) has +1.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, a loses. Nikephoros (a) has +1, Polycarpus (b) no loss.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nWait, but the problem says that the first number is the number of red spots on Nikephoros (so when he loses) and the second is for Polycarpus. So, for example, when a wins, then Nikephoros (a) is the winner, so Polycarpus (b) loses. So the second number (Polycarpus's loss) increases by 1. So in the return value, (0,1) means Nikephoros has 0 new losses, Polycarpus has 1.\n\nYes. So in the helper function, returns (a_loss, b_loss) for this round.\n\nSo, for each round, we can compute the a_loss and b_loss.\n\nSo for the T rounds, we can compute total_a_loss and total_b_loss.\n\nOnce that is done, then:\n\nfull_cycles = n // T\n\nremainder = n % T\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * total_a_loss\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * total_b_loss\n\nThen, for the remainder rounds, we need to simulate the first 'remainder' rounds, and add their a_loss and b_loss.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWell, for the remainder rounds, we can loop from 0 to remainder - 1, and for each i, compute the a and b moves, and accumulate the a_loss and b_loss.\n\nBut for that, perhaps we can have a helper function that, given a number of rounds (say, x), computes the a_loss and b_loss for the first x rounds.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial calculation of T rounds, we can precompute a prefix array, but for the purposes of code, perhaps it's easier to just compute it again for the remainder.\n\nBut for the remainder, which is up to T-1 rounds, which is up to 1e6, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCompute for the first T rounds:\n\ntotal_a_loss, total_b_loss.\n\nThen, for the remainder:\n\nremainder = n % T\n\ncurrent_a = 0\n\ncurrent_b = 0\n\nfor i in range(remainder):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    da, db = get_result(a, b)\n\n    current_a += da\n\n    current_b += db\n\nThen add current_a to total_a and current_b to total_b.\n\nBut wait, the remainder is the number of rounds after the full cycles. So for example, if n is 7 and T is 12, then remainder is 7. So the code loops from 0 to 6 (7 rounds).\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n is zero? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nCase 2: when m or k is 1. For example, if A is \"R\", then for all rounds, Nikephoros plays R.\n\nAnother case: when T is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, so T is at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when n is exactly equal to T. Then remainder is zero, and no extra rounds.\n\nAnother case: when the remainder is zero. So the code adds zero.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the helper function, but perhaps inline.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    T = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # Now compute total_a_loss and total_b_loss for T rounds\n\n    total_a_loss = 0\n\n    total_b_loss = 0\n\n    for i in range(T):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        # determine who wins\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses. So Nikephoros (A) has no loss, Polycarpus (B) gets +1\n\n            total_b_loss += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses. Nikephoros (A) gets +1\n\n            total_a_loss += 1\n\n    # Now compute full cycles and remainder\n\n    full_cycles = n // T\n\n    remainder = n % T\n\n    # Add full cycles contributions\n\n    total_a = full_cycles * total_a_loss\n\n    total_b = full_cycles * total_b_loss\n\n    # Now process remainder rounds\n\n    for i in range(remainder):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            total_b += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_a += 1\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the first loop runs for T rounds. But for T up to 1e6, and for each iteration, it's O(1), so acceptable.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo m=3, k=4. T=12.\n\nIn the first loop, for 12 rounds. Let's compute total_a_loss and total_b_loss.\n\nBut for the first 7 rounds, the code's remainder loop would process 7 rounds. However, in the first loop, for T=12, the code counts all 12 rounds. But for the sample input, n=7, so full_cycles is 0, and remainder is 7. So the code processes 7 rounds in the remainder loop.\n\nBut in the code, the first loop is for T rounds, which is 12 rounds. But for the sample input, the code's first loop calculates total_a_loss and total_b_loss for 12 rounds. But since full_cycles is 0, those are multiplied by zero, and the remainder is processed. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the sample, the code's first loop would compute for 12 rounds. Let's imagine what happens in those 12 rounds.\n\nBut for the sample, the code's first loop would calculate the total_a_loss and total_b_loss for all 12 rounds. However, since the sample's n is 7, the code will process only the first 7 rounds in the remainder loop.\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0\n\nBecause all rounds are draws.\n\nSo for n=5, the code would compute T = LCM(8, 1) = 8. So for each of the 8 rounds, the moves are R vs R. So total_a_loss and total_b_loss are zero. Then full_cycles is 5//8=0, remainder is 5. Then process 5 rounds, all draws. So total remains 0 and 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n is larger than T.\n\nFor example, n = T + 1. Then full_cycles is 1, and remainder is 1. So the code would add the total for T rounds once, and then add the first round's result.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when T is 1? For example, m=1 and k=1. Then T=1. So for each round, the same move is played. So if A and B are same, then no loss. Else, each round is a loss for one of them.\n\nNow, the code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible error is when the remainder is zero. For example, n = T. Then remainder is zero, and the code doesn't process any additional rounds. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the first loop for T rounds is O(T), which is acceptable for T up to 1e6. But for m and k up to 1000, the maximum T is 1000*1000=1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 2e9, but the code is O(T) which is 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, this code should work.\n\nBut let me check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nThe code's first loop for T=12 rounds:\n\nLet me compute the total_a_loss and total_b_loss for all 12 rounds.\n\nBut perhaps I can compute that.\n\nBut for brevity, let's assume that the code correctly processes the first 7 rounds in the remainder loop.\n\nBut in the code, for the remainder loop, when i ranges from 0 to 6 (7 rounds), which is the same as the first 7 rounds of the T rounds.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should pass the sample.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the code, for the first loop, the code is looping over T rounds, which could be up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is written in Python. However, for very large T (like 1e6), the code may take some time, but given the constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nBut what about when T is 1e6, and n is 2e9? Then full_cycles is 2e9 // 1e6 = 2000, and the code multiplies the total_a_loss and total_b_loss by 2000, which is O(1).\n\nThus, the code is efficient.\n\nTherefore, this approach should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut I need to make sure that the code reads the input correctly. Let me check the input example:\n\nIn the first sample input, the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich would be read as n=7, A='RPS', B='RSPP'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWait, in the code, the helper function is inside the main function. Also, the code uses math.gcd, so need to import math.\n\nSo the code should have:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    ... \n\nBut in Python, the code must be written as a script. So the code will be:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    T = lcm(m, k)\n\n    total_a_loss = 0\n\n    total_b_loss = 0\n\n    for i in range(T):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            total_b_loss += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_a_loss += 1\n\n    full_cycles = n // T\n\n    remainder = n % T\n\n    total_a = full_cycles * total_a_loss\n\n    total_b = full_cycles * total_b_loss\n\n    for i in range(remainder):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            total_b += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_a += 1\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the function lcm is defined inside main. That's okay.\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of the inputs. Since m and k are positive, this is okay.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nT= lcm(3,4)=12.\n\nIn the first loop, for 12 rounds:\n\nLet me compute the total_a_loss and total_b_loss for all 12 rounds.\n\nBut perhaps it's tedious, but let's try to compute for the first 7 rounds and the rest.\n\nBut for the code, the first loop for T=12 rounds would calculate for all 12 rounds, but in the sample, the code only uses the first 7 rounds. But for the code, the remainder is 7, which is handled in the remainder loop.\n\nBut the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother test case is when n is 0, but according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nAnother case: when A and B are the same sequences. Then for all rounds, it's a draw. So the output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: when A is \"R\" and B is \"S\". Then for each round, A wins. So for n rounds, total_a_loss is 0, total_b_loss is n.\n\nThus, the code should return 0 and n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written as a Python script, reading from stdin and outputting the answer.\n\nThus, the code above should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player follows a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently determine the number of losses for each player over a potentially very large number of rounds (up to 2 billion).\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Since both players follow cyclic sequences, their move patterns repeat every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute the results for one full cycle of these patterns and then use this result to determine the outcomes for the entire number of rounds.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By calculating the results for one full cycle of the LCM length, we can then use this to compute the results for the total number of rounds by determining how many full cycles fit into the total rounds and handling any remaining rounds separately.\n\n4. **Simulation**: For each round within the LCM cycle, simulate the game to count the losses for each player. Use these counts to compute the total losses for all full cycles and then handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    total_a_loss = 0\n    total_b_loss = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_b_loss += 1\n        else:\n            total_a_loss += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * total_a_loss\n    total_b = full_cycles * total_b_loss\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds and the sequences of moves for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length after which both sequences repeat their moves.\n3. **Simulating One Cycle**: For each round within the LCM cycle, determine the outcome of the game and count the losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds and compute the losses for these cycles. Then handle the remaining rounds separately by simulating them directly.\n5. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of losses for each player after processing all rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially large number of rounds by leveraging cycle detection and simulation, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
