The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nThe input is n, then the sequences A and B. The output is two numbers: Nikephoros's red spots (his losses) and Polycarpus's red spots (his losses).\n\nFirst, I need to model how their moves are chosen. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. That would take O(n) time which is way too slow. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, compute the number of losses in one full cycle of both sequences, and then multiply by the number of full cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think: Let's consider the combined cycle length. Since each player's sequence repeats every m and k rounds respectively, the combined pattern of their moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n- Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it T. So in T rounds, the pattern of moves between the two players repeats.\n\n- Compute for each of the T rounds, how many times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Let's say in one T rounds, there are total_nik_losses and total_poly_losses.\n\nThen, the total number of full cycles is n // T, and the remainder is rem = n % T.\n\nSo the total losses would be (full_cycles * total_nik_losses) + (losses in rem rounds), same for Polycarpus.\n\nBut wait, what if T is larger than n? Then there's only one partial cycle. But the approach still works.\n\nSo first, compute T = LCM(m, k). Then calculate how many full cycles there are, and the remainder.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need to compute GCD first.\n\nNow, for the steps:\n\n1. Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n2. Compute T = LCM(m, k). But for big m and k, say 1000 each, LCM could be up to 1e6, which is manageable since 1e6 is manageable for a loop.\n\nBecause for each of the T rounds, we can simulate the moves and count the number of losses for each player. Then multiply by the number of full cycles, and add the remainder.\n\nBut for T up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000, their LCM is up to 1e6?), yes. Let's see: 1000 and 1000, their LCM is 1000. If m and k are co-prime, like 1000 and 999, their LCM is 999000, which is about a million. So for T up to 1e6, even with n up to 2e9, the per T processing is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k). Then:\n\n- For each round from 0 to T-1:\n\n   - Find the move of A: A[round % m]\n\n   - Find the move of B: B[round % k]\n\n   - Determine who wins, if any. Increment the counts accordingly.\n\nOnce we have the counts for one T rounds, multiply by the number of full cycles (full_cycles = n // T), and then add the counts from the remaining rounds (rem = n % T).\n\nBut how to compute the counts for the remaining rounds?\n\nYes. So the total for each player is:\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * nik_per_cycle + nik_in_rem\n\nSimilarly for poly.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each of the T rounds, what's the outcome.\n\nBut how to compute the outcome between two moves?\n\nLet's think: for each pair (a, b), determine if a beats b, or b beats a, or draw.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a is R and b is S: a wins. So Nikephoros (A's player) wins. So Polycarpus (B's player) gets a pinch. So Nikephoros's loss count is 0 for this round, and Polycarpus's loss count is 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait: the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so he gets a pinch. So Nikephoros's red spot count increases when he loses. So for each round, we need to check if Nikephoros loses, and increment his count, and similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo for each round, the possible cases:\n\nif a == b: no one gets a spot.\n\nelse:\n\n   determine who wins. If Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot (so his count increases by 1). If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we can compute which case it is.\n\nHow to code that?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b and returns which player wins, or if it's a draw.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible pair, we can check:\n\nif (a, b) is (R, S) → A wins → B loses → so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Polycarpus's is +1.\n\nWait, no. Nikephoros is the one who uses sequence A. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser. So Nikephoros's red spots (number of times he lost) would not increase. But Polycarpus's red spots would increase by 1.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check:\n\nif a beats b → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus gets a pinch (so his count increases by 1)\n\nif b beats a → Polycarpus wins → Nikephoros gets a pinch (so his count increases by 1)\n\nElse → no change.\n\nSo the code for determining the outcome:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)  # no one loses\n\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # A wins, B loses. So Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # B wins, A loses. Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nSo for each pair of moves, we can compute the (nik, poly) increments.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k). For each of the T rounds, compute the moves, then compute the increments for that round. Sum all these increments over the T rounds to get per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\nThen, full_cycles = n // T\n\nrem = n % T\n\nThen, total_nik = full_cycles * per_cycle_nik + sum of increments for first rem rounds.\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for the first rem rounds?\n\nSo, for the initial T rounds, we can precompute a list of (nik, poly) increments for each of the T rounds. Then, for the rem rounds, we can take the first rem elements and sum them.\n\nBut for T up to 1e6, storing that list is feasible.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A as a string, m = len(A)\n\nRead B as a string, k = len(B)\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly:\n\nInitialize per_cycle_nik = 0, per_cycle_poly = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to T-1:\n\n   a_move = A[i % m]\n\n   b_move = B[i % k]\n\n   nik_inc, poly_inc = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n\n   per_cycle_nik += nik_inc\n\n   per_cycle_poly += poly_inc\n\nThen, full_cycles = n // T\n\nrem = n % T\n\nNow, compute the total for the full cycles: total_nik = full_cycles * per_cycle_nik, same for poly.\n\nThen, compute the sum for the rem rounds. How?\n\nWe can precompute a prefix sum array for the T rounds. For example, prefix_sum_nik[i] is the sum of nik_inc for the first i rounds (from 0 to i-1). Similarly for prefix_sum_poly.\n\nThen, for rem rounds, the sum is prefix_sum_nik[rem] and prefix_sum_poly[rem].\n\nBut how to compute the prefix sums?\n\nYes. So during the initial loop over T rounds, we can build two arrays, nik_counts and poly_counts, where for each index i (from 0 to T-1), nik_counts[i] is the number of times Nikephoros lost in the i-th round (0 or 1), and same for poly_counts[i].\n\nThen, we can compute prefix_nik = [0]*(T+1), where prefix_nik[i] = sum of nik_counts[0..i-1]. Similarly for prefix_poly.\n\nOnce that's done, the sum for the first rem rounds is prefix_nik[rem] and prefix_poly[rem].\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, compute the GCD of m and k.\n\nBut how to compute GCD in Python? Well, we can use math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nBut for LCM, we can compute it as m * k // gcd(m, k). However, if m or k is zero? But in the problem statement, m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nSo, m = len(A), k = len(B). T = compute_lcm(m, k).\n\nOnce T is computed, proceed to compute for each of T rounds.\n\nNow, for the prefix sums:\n\nBut for T up to 1e6, even with 1e6 elements, it's manageable.\n\nSo code:\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nT = lcm(m, k)\n\nnik_counts = [0] * T\n\npoly_counts = [0] * T\n\nfor i in range(T):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    # compute result\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        nik_counts[i] = 0\n\n        poly_counts[i] = 0\n\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # A wins, B loses. So Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Poly's is 1.\n\n        nik_counts[i] = 0\n\n        poly_counts[i] = 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # B wins, A loses. Nikephoros's loss count is 1, Poly's is 0.\n\n        nik_counts[i] = 1\n\n        poly_counts[i] = 0\n\nThen compute prefix sums.\n\nprefix_nik = [0]*(T+1)\n\nprefix_poly = [0]*(T+1)\n\nfor i in range(T):\n\n    prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + nik_counts[i]\n\n    prefix_poly[i+1] = prefix_poly[i] + poly_counts[i]\n\nThen, full_cycles = n // T\n\nrem = n % T\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[T] + prefix_nik[rem]\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[T] + prefix_poly[rem]\n\nThen output total_nik and total_poly.\n\nWait, but for the full_cycles, each cycle contributes prefix_nik[T] (the sum of all T rounds). So yes.\n\nBut what if T is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, T is at least 1.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4).\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo T is 12.\n\nThen for each of 12 rounds, compute the moves.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor i from 0 to 11:\n\ni % 3: 0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2\n\ni % 4: 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3\n\nSo the pairs are:\n\ni=0: A[0] = R, B[0] = R → draw. (0,0)\n\ni=1: A[1] = P vs B[1] = S → P vs S. S beats P? Wait, the rules: scissors beat paper. So B's move is S, which beats A's P. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So nik_counts[1] = 1, poly_counts[1] = 0.\n\nWait, let me recheck the condition:\n\nif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') → A wins.\n\nElse if (a == 'S' and b == 'P') → A wins.\n\nElse if (a == 'P' and b == 'R') → A wins.\n\nElse, B wins.\n\nSo for a = P, b = S: a is P, b is S. Which is not in the above conditions. Because (a, b) is (P, S). The condition for A winning is (P beats R). So here, S beats P. So B wins.\n\nSo in this case, the code would go to the else clause, which is B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses → nik_counts[i] is 1, poly_counts[i] is 0.\n\nSo for i=1, the result is (1,0).\n\nLet's check the sample explanation. The first sample input is 7 rounds. Let's see how the code would process it.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nLet me compute for the first 7 rounds (since n=7).\n\nBut according to the code, T is 12. So full_cycles is 7//12=0, rem=7. So the code would take the first 7 rounds of the T=12 rounds.\n\nSo let's compute the first 7 rounds:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 6 (since rem=7, the first 7 rounds are 0-6).\n\nLet me compute each:\n\ni=0:\n\nA: R, B: R → draw. (0,0)\n\ni=1:\n\nA: P, B: S → B wins. Nikephoros loses. (1,0)\n\ni=2:\n\nA: S, B: P → A's S beats B's P. So A wins. So B loses. So (0,1)\n\ni=3:\n\nA: R (i%3=0), B: i%4=3 → B's move is P. A's R vs B's P. P beats R. So B wins. Nikephoros loses. (1, 0)\n\ni=4:\n\nA: i%3=1 → P. B: i%4=0 → R. P vs R: P beats R. A wins. B loses. (0,1)\n\ni=5:\n\nA: i%3=2 → S. B: i%4=1 → S. Draw. (0,0)\n\ni=6:\n\nA: i%3=0 → R. B: i%4=2 → P. R vs P: P beats R. B wins. Nikephoros loses. (1,0)\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds, the nik_counts are:\n\ni=0: 0\n\ni=1: 1\n\ni=2: 0\n\ni=3: 1\n\ni=4: 0\n\ni=5: 0\n\ni=6: 1\n\nTotal nik: 0+1+0+1+0+0+1 = 3.\n\nPoly counts for these rounds:\n\ni=0: 0\n\ni=1: 0\n\ni=2: 1\n\ni=3: 0\n\ni=4: 1\n\ni=5: 0\n\ni=6: 0\n\nTotal poly: 0+0+1+0+1+0+0 = 2. Which matches the sample output of 3 2. So yes, the code would return that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample is the second input:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). LCM(8,1) is 8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds, the moves are:\n\nA: R, B: R → draw. So all rounds are draws. So per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly are 0. For n=5, rem=5. So total_nik and total_poly are 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. For m and k up to 1000, T can be up to 1e6. For each T, the code loops once. Then, for the prefix sums. So the time complexity is O(T) which is acceptable for T up to 1e6. And since n can be up to 2e9, but the code handles it with O(1) operations after precomputing the T rounds.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n. The second line is A, the third line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is read as:\n\nThe first line is n, then the next line is A, then the next line is B.\n\nSo in code, the input is read as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 7, then RPS, then RSPP.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A as the next line.\n\nRead B as the next line.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    T = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # Now compute for T rounds.\n\n    nik_counts = [0] * T\n\n    poly_counts = [0] * T\n\n    for i in range(T):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            nik_counts[i] = 0\n\n            poly_counts[i] = 0\n\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            nik_counts[i] = 0\n\n            poly_counts[i] = 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            nik_counts[i] = 1\n\n            poly_counts[i] = 0\n\n    # Compute prefix sums\n\n    prefix_nik = [0] * (T + 1)\n\n    prefix_poly = [0] * (T + 1)\n\n    for i in range(T):\n\n        prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + nik_counts[i]\n\n        prefix_poly[i+1] = prefix_poly[i] + poly_counts[i]\n\n    full_cycles = n // T\n\n    rem = n % T\n\n    total_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[T] + prefix_nik[rem]\n\n    total_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[T] + prefix_poly[rem]\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, the sample input has the first case where n=7, and the code computes rem=7. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's think about when T is 0. But since m and k are >=1, T is at least 1.\n\nNow, for the case where T is 1, for example, m=1, k=1. Then the code works.\n\nWhat about when n is 0? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich gives:\n\nm=3, k=4. T=12.\n\nAs discussed, for rem=7, prefix_nik[7] is 3, prefix_poly[7] is 2. So output is 3 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich gives m=8, k=1. T=8.\n\nEach of the 8 rounds has A and B as R. So all counts are 0. So for n=5, rem=5. prefix_nik[5] is 0, same for poly. So output 0 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly T. Then rem is zero. So the code would take full_cycles = 1, rem=0. So total_nik is prefix_nik[T] * 1 + prefix_nik[0] (which is 0).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when T is very large, like 1e6? Well, for Python, creating lists of size 1e6 is manageable. For example, 1e6 elements for nik_counts and poly_counts, and prefix arrays of 1e6+1 elements. Even with 1e6, each list is about 4MB (assuming 4 bytes per int, but in Python it's more, but even with 1e6 elements, it's manageable).\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player (Nikephoros and Polycarpus) loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when the number of rounds, n, is very large (up to 2·10^9).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. This means their move sequences repeat after certain intervals. The combined cycle length for both sequences is determined by the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their respective sequences.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This LCM represents the number of rounds after which both sequences realign to their starting positions.\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: For each round within one full cycle (determined by the LCM), simulate the game and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Prefix Sums for Efficiency**: Use prefix sums to quickly compute the total losses over any number of rounds within a cycle.\n5. **Full and Remaining Cycles**: Calculate the number of full cycles and remaining rounds within the total number of rounds (n). Use the precomputed values from the cycle simulation to determine the total losses efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    nik_counts = [0] * T\n    poly_counts = [0] * T\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            nik_counts[i] = 0\n            poly_counts[i] = 0\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            nik_counts[i] = 0\n            poly_counts[i] = 1\n        else:\n            nik_counts[i] = 1\n            poly_counts[i] = 0\n    \n    prefix_nik = [0] * (T + 1)\n    prefix_poly = [0] * (T + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + nik_counts[i]\n        prefix_poly[i+1] = prefix_poly[i] + poly_counts[i]\n    \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    rem = n % T\n    \n    total_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[T] + prefix_nik[rem]\n    total_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[T] + prefix_poly[rem]\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds (n), and the sequences for Nikephoros (A) and Polycarpus (B).\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences A and B is calculated to determine the cycle length after which both sequences repeat their moves.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within the LCM cycle, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcomes (losses) are recorded.\n4. **Prefix Sums**: Prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the total losses over any number of rounds within a cycle.\n5. **Total Losses Calculation**: Using the number of full cycles and remaining rounds, the total losses for each player are computed efficiently using the precomputed prefix sums.\n\nThis approach ensures that even for very large values of n, the solution remains efficient by leveraging cycle detection and prefix sums.",
