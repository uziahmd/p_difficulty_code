    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the task is to find two things for a given p: the minimum number of nodes needed in a directed graph that is p-reachable, and then among all such graphs with that minimal node count, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly p-reachable means. The definition says that a directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Wait, but reachability here is mutual? Because if u and v are reachable from each other, then they are in a strongly connected component (SCC). So for each pair of nodes in an SCC, if u < v, they contribute to the count. But since the problem counts ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v, the total for a single SCC of size k is C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2. Because for each pair of nodes in the SCC, both directions are reachable, but since u < v, we only count one per unordered pair.\n\nSo the problem is about constructing a graph where the sum over all SCCs of C(size_of_SCC, 2) equals exactly p. And we need to find the minimal number of nodes possible for that sum, and then maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (which are pairs (u, v) where u can reach v but not vice versa, and u != v).\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The first part is to find the minimal number of nodes n such that there exists some way to partition the nodes into SCCs whose sizes' combinations add up to exactly p. Then, for that minimal n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo the key idea for the first part is to find the minimal n where the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all components equals p. But how do we choose the components?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, p=3. The minimal n is 3. How? Because C(3, 2) = 3. So if we have a single SCC of size 3, then that gives exactly 3 ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability. So that's why the answer is 3. However, if you have two components, say sizes 2 and 1, then C(2,2) is 1, and C(1,2) is 0. Total is 1, which is less than 3. So the minimal n is 3.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal n for any given p?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we want to maximize the sum of C(k_i, 2) for a given n. Wait, no. Wait, for a given n, the maximum possible sum of C(k_i, 2) is when we have one component of size n. Because C(n, 2) is larger than splitting into smaller components. For example, C(3,2) = 3, while splitting into 2 and 1 gives 1 + 0 = 1. So to get the maximum sum for a given n, we have a single component. But for our problem, we need to find the minimal n such that the maximum possible sum for that n is at least p, but also that there's a way to split into components so that the sum is exactly p.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum can be adjusted by splitting components. For example, if we have a component of size k, and split it into two components of sizes a and b, then the sum changes from C(k, 2) to C(a, 2) + C(b, 2). The difference is C(a, 2) + C(b, 2) - C(a + b, 2) = (a(a-1)/2 + b(b-1)/2) - ( (a + b)(a + b - 1)/2 ) = [ (a² -a + b² -b ) - (a² + 2ab + b² -a -b) ) ] / 2 = [ ... ] ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLet me compute the difference between the original and the split:\n\nOriginal value: C(k, 2) where k = a + b.\n\nSplit value: C(a,2) + C(b,2).\n\nDifference: split_val - original_val = [a(a-1)/2 + b(b-1)/2] - [ (a + b)(a + b -1)/2 ]\n\nExpanding the second term:\n\n(a + b)(a + b -1) = (a + b)^2 - (a + b) = a² + 2ab + b² - a - b.\n\nSo the difference becomes:\n\n[ (a² -a + b² -b ) / 2 ] - [ (a² + 2ab + b² - a - b ) / 2 ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n[ a² -a + b² -b - a² - 2ab - b² + a + b ] / 2 \n\nSimplify numerator:\n\na² -a + b² -b -a² -2ab -b² +a +b = (-a -2ab +a) + (-b +b) + ... \n\nWait:\n\nThe terms a² and -a² cancel. Similarly for b² and -b².\n\nThen:\n\n- a - 2ab + a + (-b + b) ?\n\nWait, the terms are:\n\n- a (from -a) \n\n- 2ab (from -2ab)\n\n+ a (from +a) \n\n- b (from -b) \n\n+ b (from +b) \n\nSo combining:\n\n(-a + a) cancels. (-b + b) cancels. So we're left with -2ab.\n\nSo the difference is (-2ab)/2 = -ab.\n\nSo splitting a component into a and b reduces the sum by ab. Therefore, if we want to reach a certain sum, we can start with the maximum possible sum (all in one component) and then split components to reduce the sum as needed.\n\nSo the approach for finding the minimal n is as follows:\n\nWe need to find the smallest n such that the maximum possible sum (C(n, 2)) is >= p, and then by splitting components, we can reach exactly p.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose p is 3. The maximum possible sum for n=3 is C(3,2)=3. So that's exactly p. So n=3 is possible.\n\nAnother example: p=4. What's the minimal n? Let's see:\n\nn=3: max sum is 3. Not enough.\n\nn=4: max sum is 6. Now, can we split into components such that the sum is 4?\n\nYes. For example, split into a component of size 3 (sum 3) and a component of size 1 (sum 0). But that gives 3. Not enough. Alternatively, split into two components of size 2 and 2. Then sum is 1 + 1 = 2. Still not enough. Or split into a component of size 3 and another of size 1, which gives sum 3. Not enough. Hmm. Wait, perhaps we need to split the initial component of size 4 into parts such that the total sum is 4. Let's see:\n\nOriginal sum is 6. We need to reduce it by 2. How can we do that?\n\nEach split reduces the sum by ab, where a and b are the sizes of the split. So let's split once. Suppose we split the 4 into a and 4-a.\n\nThe reduction is a*(4 - a). Let's see for various splits:\n\nSplit into 1 and 3: reduction is 1*3=3. New sum is 6 -3 =3. Which is less than 4.\n\nSplit into 2 and 2: reduction is 2*2=4. New sum is 6-4=2. Less than 4.\n\nSo that's not helpful. So maybe split twice?\n\nWait, perhaps the way to reach the sum is to split multiple times. For example, take the original 4-node component (sum 6). Split into 2 and 2 (sum 1 +1 = 2, total reduction 4). Now, if we split one of the 2s into 1 and 1. Then the reduction is 1*1=1, and the sum becomes 2 -1 =1. Not helpful. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is 5? Let's see. For n=5, the maximum sum is C(5,2)=10. To reach 4, we need to split components to reduce by 6. How?\n\nLet's think of splitting the 5 into components. For example, split into 3 and 2. The reduction is 3*2=6. So the new sum is 10-6=4. Exactly! So yes. So for n=5, the sum can be 4. Therefore, the minimal n is 5 for p=4. Which matches the sample input where for p=4, the output is 5 and 6 (but wait, the sample input for p=4 is not given. Wait, looking back at the sample input given, the user provided an example where input is 3,4,0. The output for 4 is 5 6. Let me check that.\n\nWait in the sample input, for p=4, the output is '5 6'. So the first part is the minimal n, which is 5. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the approach is: find the minimal n such that the maximum sum (C(n,2)) is >=p, and that (C(n,2) - p) can be achieved by splitting components, i.e., that (C(n,2) - p) can be represented as the sum of products of splits. But how?\n\nBut how do we find the minimal n? Well, the minimal n would be the smallest integer where C(n,2) >= p, and also that (C(n,2) - p) can be achieved through splitting. But how do we know that?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is determined by finding the smallest n where C(n, 2) >= p, and then checking whether (C(n,2) - p) can be formed as the sum of products of splits. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that C(n,2) >= p and that (C(n,2) - p) can be written as a sum of products of integers (each product corresponds to splitting a component into two parts, and each split reduces the sum by ab). But since splitting can be done multiple times, perhaps any value up to C(n,2) can be achieved. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer where C(n,2) >= p and (C(n,2) - p) can be written as a sum of terms of the form ab, where a + b = k (for some k), and each term is generated by splitting a component into a and b. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that C(n, 2) >= p and (C(n,2) - p) can be written as the sum of some products of integers. However, given that splitting can be done multiple times, perhaps any value up to C(n,2) can be achieved. For example, in the case of p=4, n=5 gives C(5,2) = 10. Then 10-4=6. Which is exactly 3*2, which is the split into 3 and 2. So that works.\n\nAnother example: suppose p=5. The minimal n is 4 because C(4,2)=6 >=5. Then 6-5=1. Can we split the component of 4 into parts such that the total sum is reduced by 1? How?\n\nSplitting into 1 and 3: reduction is 1*3=3. Then the sum is 6-3=3, which is less than 5. So that's not good. What about splitting into 2 and 2, which gives reduction 4. Sum is 6-4=2. Still not enough. Then, maybe split again. Suppose after splitting into 2 and 2 (sum 2), then split one of the 2 into 1 and 1. That reduces by 1*1=1. So total reduction is 4+1=5. Original sum was 6, so new sum is 6-5=1. Not helpful. So that's not working.\n\nHmm. So maybe for p=5, n=4 is not sufficient. So then we need to check for n=5. C(5,2)=10. 10-5=5. How can we split to reduce by 5?\n\nPossible splits: split into 3 and 2 (reduction 6). Then 10-6=4, which is less than 5. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, split into 4 and 1 (reduction 4). Then the sum is 10-4=6. Then split the 4 into 3 and 1 (reduction 3*1=3). Then sum is 6-3=3. Not enough. Hmm. Or split into 2 and 3 (reduction 6), then split the 2 into 1 and 1 (reduction 1). Total reduction 6+1=7. Sum is 10-7=3. Still not 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into 2 and 3 (reduction 6), then split the 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2*1=2). Total reduction 6+2=8. Sum is 10-8=2. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Let's think: what if we split into three components. For example, the initial component is 5. Split into 2 and 3 (reduction 6). Then split the 3 into 1 and 2 (reduction 1*2=2). So total reduction is 6+2=8. Then the sum is 10-8=2. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, split the initial 5 into 4 and 1 (reduction 4). Then split the 4 into 3 and 1 (reduction 3). Then sum is 10 - 4 -3 = 3. Still not 5. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to split once with reduction 5. Let me think. For example, if I have a component of size 5, and I split it into a and b where a*b = 5. But a + b =5. So possible a and b are 1 and 4 (product 4), 2 and 3 (product 6). Neither is 5. So no. So can't split once to get reduction of 5. So maybe it's impossible for n=5. Then perhaps n=5 is not sufficient. Then what about n=6? C(6,2) is 15. 15-5=10. Can we find splits that reduce by 10?\n\nFor example, split into 5 and 1 (reduction 5). Then sum is 15-5=10. Then split the 5 into 2 and 3 (reduction 6). Sum is 10-6=4. Still not 5. Hmm. Not helpful. Alternatively, split into 3 and 3 (reduction 9). Sum is 15-9=6. Then split one of the 3s into 2 and 1 (reduction 2). Sum is 6-2=4. Still not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, split into 4 and 2 (reduction 8). Sum is 15-8=7. Then split the 4 into 2 and 2 (reduction 4). Sum is 7-4=3. Not helpful. Not seeing a way to reach 5. Maybe n=6 isn't sufficient. Then perhaps n=5 is not sufficient, and n=6 is not sufficient either. Then what's the next step?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my approach is wrong. Perhaps the minimal n is determined by the following: the minimal n where the sum of C(k_i, 2) equals p. How can I find that n?\n\nAnother idea: the minimal n is the minimal number such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all components is exactly p, and the sum of the k_i is n. To minimize n, we need to arrange the components such that their C(k_i, 2) sum to p, and the total sum of k_i is as small as possible.\n\nThis sounds similar to the problem of representing p as the sum of triangular numbers (since C(k, 2) is the k-th triangular number minus something? Wait, no. C(k,2) is the triangular number T_{k-1} = k*(k-1)/2. So for example, T_2 = 3, which is C(3,2).\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the minimal n such that there exists a set of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m (each >=1) where sum_{i} k_i = n, and sum_{i} T_{k_i - 1} = p. Here T_{x} = x(x+1)/2. Wait no, T_{k_i - 1} = (k_i - 1)*k_i/2 = C(k_i, 2). Yes.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal n such that p can be expressed as the sum of some C(k_i, 2) terms, where the sum of the k_i is n.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal n?\n\nThis seems like a variation of the coin change problem, but with the twist that each \"coin\" is C(k, 2) for some k, and we need to find the minimal sum of k's (i.e., n) such that the sum of the coins equals p.\n\nBut how can we model this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal n by considering that to maximize the sum for a given n, we should have as few components as possible. For example, a single component of size n gives the maximum sum for that n. If that maximum sum is less than p, then n is not sufficient. Otherwise, if the maximum sum is >=p, then perhaps there's a way to split the components to get exactly p.\n\nBut how to confirm that?\n\nIn the earlier example where p=5 and n=4, the maximum sum is 6. So we need to reduce by 1. But how?\n\nMaybe there's a way to split components to reduce the sum by exactly 1. But how?\n\nWait, the only way to reduce the sum is by splitting components. Each split reduces the sum by ab, where a and b are the sizes of the split.\n\nSo for example, if we have a component of size 4, and we split it into a component of size 3 and 1. Then the reduction is 3*1 = 3. So the sum becomes 6-3=3. Which is less than 5. Not helpful.\n\nIf we split into 2 and 2, reduction is 4, sum becomes 2. Still not helpful.\n\nSo for n=4, it's impossible. Hence, the minimal n must be higher.\n\nThen, for n=5, the maximum sum is 10. We need to reduce by 5. So can we split into components such that the total reduction is 5?\n\nPossible splits:\n\nSplit the 5 into 2 and 3 (reduction 6). Then, the sum is 10 - 6 =4. Which is less than 5. Not helpful. But then, perhaps we can split again. For example, split the 3 into 2 and 1. Reduction is 2*1=2. Total reduction is 6 + 2=8. Sum is 10 -8=2. Still not 5.\n\nAlternatively, split the 5 into 4 and 1 (reduction 4). Sum becomes 10-4=6. Then split the 4 into 3 and 1 (reduction 3). Sum becomes 6-3=3. Still not.\n\nHmm. Another idea: what if we split into three components. For example, split 5 into 2, 2, and 1. How?\n\nFirst split into 2 and 3 (reduction 6). Then split the 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2). Total reduction is 6+2=8. Sum is 10-8=2. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, split the 5 into 2 and 3 (reduction 6), then split the 2 into 1 and 1 (reduction 1). Total reduction is 6+1=7. Sum is 10-7=3.\n\nNo. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Suppose I split the initial component of 5 into 1 and 4 (reduction 4), then split the 4 into 1 and 3 (reduction 3). Total reduction 4+3=7. Sum is 10-7=3. Still not 5.\n\nHmm. So it seems that for n=5, it's impossible to get a reduction of 5. So then, what's the next n?\n\nn=6. Max sum is 15. Need to reduce by 10. Let's see:\n\nSplit into 3 and 3 (reduction 9). Sum is 15-9=6. Then split one 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2). Total reduction 9+2=11. Sum is 15-11=4. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, split into 4 and 2 (reduction 8). Sum 15-8=7. Then split the 4 into 3 and 1 (reduction 3). Sum 7-3=4. Still not.\n\nAnother idea: split into 5 and 1 (reduction 5). Sum is 15-5=10. Then split the 5 into 2 and 3 (reduction 6). Sum is 10-6=4. No.\n\nWait, but we need to reduce by 10. Let's think of possible splits that can give us that.\n\nFor example, split into 2 and 4 (reduction 8). Then split the 4 into 2 and 2 (reduction 4). Total reduction 8+4=12. Sum is 15-12=3. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, split into 3 and 3 (reduction 9). Then split one of the 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2). Total reduction 9+2=11. Sum is 15-11=4. Still not.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's no way to get a reduction of 10 with n=6. So what about n=7?\n\nC(7, 2) = 21. Need to reduce by 16. Let's see:\n\nSplit into 6 and 1 (reduction 6). Sum is 21-6=15. Then split the 6 into 5 and 1 (reduction 5). Sum is 15-5=10. Then split the 5 into 4 and 1 (reduction 4). Sum is 10-4=6. Then split 4 into 3 and 1 (reduction 3). Sum 6-3=3. Then split 3 into 2 and 1 (reduction 2). Sum 3-2=1. Total reduction is 6+5+4+3+2=20. Which is more than 16. So not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, find a split that reduces by exactly 16. For example, split into 4 and 3 (reduction 12). Then split the 4 into 2 and 2 (reduction 4). Total reduction 12+4=16. Sum is 21 - 16 =5. Exactly! So yes. So for n=7, it's possible. Thus, for p=5, the minimal n is 7? But that seems high. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to split into components such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) is 5. For example, one component of size 3 (C(3,2)=3) and another component of size 2 (C(2,2)=1), and another component of size 2 (another 1). Total sum 3+1+1=5. The total nodes would be 3+2+2=7. Which matches the previous approach. So yes, that's possible. So the minimal n is 7 for p=5.\n\nBut how do we find this in general?\n\nThis suggests that the minimal n is determined by finding the minimal number of nodes such that p can be represented as the sum of C(k_i, 2) terms, and the sum of k_i is minimized.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for large p (up to 2e5)?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think greedily. Since C(k, 2) increases with k, to minimize the sum of k_i, we should use as large as possible components. So for example, for p, we can try to find the largest possible C(k, 2) that is <= p, subtract it from p, and repeat. This is similar to the greedy algorithm for making change with coins. However, this may not always work, but perhaps it's a starting point.\n\nLet me test this approach with p=5.\n\nThe largest C(k, 2) <=5 is C(3,2)=3. Subtract 3, remaining p=2. Next largest is C(2,2)=1. Subtract 1, remaining 1. Subtract another 1. So total components are 3,2,2. Sum of k_i is 3+2+2=7. Which is the same as before.\n\nAnother example: p=4. Largest is C(3,2)=3. Remaining 1. Then C(2,2)=1. So components 3 and 2. Sum is 5. Which matches the sample where p=4 requires n=5.\n\nAnother example: p=3. Largest is 3, sum is 3. So n=3.\n\nAnother example: p=6. Largest is C(4,2)=6. So sum is 4. So n=4.\n\nSo this seems to work. So perhaps the minimal n is determined by this greedy approach: decompose p into sum of C(k_i, 2) terms, choosing the largest possible each time. Then the sum of the k_i's is the minimal possible.\n\nBut why would this be optimal?\n\nBecause using larger components uses fewer nodes. For example, using C(3,2)=3 (nodes 3) is better than using two C(2,2) terms (sum 2, but nodes 2+2=4). So the greedy approach of taking the largest possible C(k, 2) each time would minimize the total nodes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal n can be found by decomposing p into the sum of C(k_i, 2) terms using the greedy approach, and summing the k_i's.\n\nBut how to implement this decomposition?\n\nFor each step, find the maximum k such that C(k,2) ≤ remaining_p. Subtract that from remaining_p, and add k to the sum. Repeat until remaining_p is zero.\n\nBut how to find k for each step?\n\nC(k,2) = k*(k-1)/2 ≤ rem.\n\nWe can solve for k:\n\nk^2 -k - 2*rem ≤ 0.\n\nThe solution to the equation k^2 -k - 2*rem = 0 is k = [1 + sqrt(1 + 8*rem)] / 2.\n\nSo for each rem, compute this value and take the floor.\n\nFor example, rem=5:\n\nsqrt(1 + 8*5) = sqrt(41) ≈6.4. So (1 + 6.4)/2 ≈ 3.7 → floor is 3. C(3,2)=3. Then rem becomes 2.\n\nrem=2: sqrt(1 + 8*2) = sqrt(17) ~4.12 → (1 +4.12)/2 ~ 2.56 → floor 2. C(2,2)=1. rem becomes 1. Again, same for 1. So total k's are 3,2,2. Sum is 7.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo the first part of the problem is to find the minimal n by decomposing p into the sum of C(k_i, 2) using the greedy approach.\n\nNow, once we have the minimal n, the next part is to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph.\n\nSo what's a unidirectional pair? It's an ordered pair (u, v) where u != v, there's a path from u to v, but no path from v to u.\n\nIn a directed graph, the number of such pairs depends on the structure of the graph. However, the problem states that the graph is p-reachable, which means that the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all SCCs is exactly p.\n\nSo the graph is composed of several SCCs, and between these SCCs, there are directed edges such that the reachability is as required. But to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to arrange the SCCs and their connections optimally.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the structure. Suppose the graph has several SCCs. Between any two different SCCs A and B, if there is a directed edge from A to B, then every pair (u in A, v in B) will be unidirectional if there is no path from B to A. Similarly, if there's a path from B to A, then those pairs would not be unidirectional.\n\nTo maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to arrange the SCCs into a DAG where each pair of SCCs has a directed edge in one direction (so that between any two SCCs, there's a single direction of reachability). This way, for each pair of SCCs (A, B), if there's an edge from A to B, then all pairs (u in A, v in B) are unidirectional, and similarly for (B, A) if there's an edge from B to A.\n\nBut since the graph must be a DAG of SCCs (because otherwise there would be cycles between SCCs, which would merge them into a single SCC), the DAG of SCCs must be a DAG.\n\nTo maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to arrange the DAG of SCCs such that for every pair of SCCs, there is a directed edge in one direction (so that for each pair, we get as many unidirectional pairs as possible).\n\nThis is equivalent to arranging the DAG as a linear order, where each SCC has edges pointing to all subsequent ones. For example, if there are m SCCs arranged in a linear order S_1, S_2, ..., S_m, then between S_i and S_j, if i < j, there's an edge from S_i to S_j. This way, every pair of nodes u in S_i and v in S_j (i < j) will have a path from u to v, and none from v to u. Similarly, if i > j, then there's a path from v to u. But for the purpose of counting unidirectional pairs, we need to count all ordered pairs (u, v) where u !=v and there's a path from u to v but not vice versa.\n\nIn this scenario, for each pair of SCCs S_i and S_j where i < j, all ordered pairs (u in S_i, v in S_j) are unidirectional. Also, for the same SCC, there are no unidirectional pairs since they are mutually reachable. So the total number of unidirectional pairs is sum_{i < j} |S_i| * |S_j| * 1 (since for each pair (u in S_i, v in S_j) where i < j, (u, v) is unidirectional, and (v, u) is not). Also, for the same SCC, there are no unidirectional pairs.\n\nBut how do we compute this sum?\n\nThe sum is equal to (total_nodes^2 - sum_{i} |S_i|^2 ) / 2. Because the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u !=v is total_nodes^2 - total_nodes. The number of pairs that are in the same SCC is sum |S_i|^2 - sum |S_i|. Then, the number of pairs that are in different SCCs is (total_nodes^2 - total_nodes) - (sum |S_i|^2 - sum |S_i| ). But since for each pair of different SCCs, exactly one direction is present (assuming the DAG is a linear order), the number of unidirectional pairs is exactly half of the cross-SCC pairs. Wait, no. Because for each pair of nodes u and v in different SCCs, exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) is present. So the total number of unidirectional pairs is the number of cross-SCC pairs. Because for each such pair, exactly one direction exists. However, the total number of cross-SCC pairs is (total_nodes^2 - sum |S_i|^2) / 2 ?\n\nWait, total number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u !=v is total_nodes*(total_nodes-1). The number of ordered pairs within the same SCC is sum (|S_i| * (|S_i| -1)). The number of ordered pairs between different SCCs is total_nodes*(total_nodes -1) - sum (|S_i| * (|S_i| -1)).\n\nBut since for each pair of nodes in different SCCs, exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) is present, the number of unidirectional pairs is exactly equal to the number of cross-SCC ordered pairs. Because each such pair contributes exactly one unidirectional pair.\n\nSo the total number of unidirectional pairs is:\n\n(total_nodes^2 - total_nodes) - sum (|S_i| * (|S_i| - 1)) )\n\n= total_nodes*(total_nodes -1) - sum (|S_i|^2 - |S_i| )\n\n= total_nodes*(total_nodes -1) - sum |S_i|^2 + sum |S_i| \n\nBut sum |S_i| is total_nodes. So:\n\n= total_nodes*(total_nodes -1) - sum |S_i|^2 + total_nodes \n\n= total_nodes^2 - total_nodes + total_nodes - sum |S_i|^2 \n\n= total_nodes^2 - sum |S_i|^2 \n\nSo the total number of unidirectional pairs is total_nodes^2 - sum |S_i|^2.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nIn order to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, given that the sum of C(|S_i|, 2) is fixed (equal to p), we need to minimize sum |S_i|^2, because the total is total_nodes^2 minus that sum.\n\nWait, because the unidirectional pairs count is total_nodes^2 - sum |S_i|^2. So to maximize this, we need to minimize sum |S_i|^2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, given that the sum of C(|S_i|, 2) is p, and the sum of |S_i| is n (the minimal n as computed earlier), find the arrangement of the |S_i|'s that minimizes sum |S_i|^2.\n\nBecause that will maximize the unidirectional pairs count.\n\nSo how to minimize sum |S_i|^2 given that sum C(k_i, 2) = p and sum k_i = n.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe know that for fixed sum of k_i, the sum of squares is minimized when the k_i's are as equal as possible. For example, if you have a sum of numbers, their squares are minimized when they are as equal as possible.\n\nBut here, we have the constraint that the sum of C(k_i, 2) is fixed. So how can we arrange the k_i's to minimize sum k_i^2?\n\nLet me think. For example, if we have two components: one of size a and one of size b. Then, sum C(k_i, 2) is C(a,2) + C(b,2). The sum of squares is a² + b².\n\nSuppose instead, we have a component of size a + b. Then, sum C(k_i, 2) is C(a + b, 2). Which is larger than C(a, 2) + C(b, 2) by ab. So if we want to have the same sum of C(k_i, 2), but split into components, then we have to split in a way that reduces the sum. But for our problem, the sum of C(k_i, 2) is fixed as p. So how can we arrange the components to minimize the sum of squares?\n\nThis seems like an optimization problem. Given that the sum of C(k_i, 2) is fixed, how to distribute the sizes of the components to minimize sum k_i².\n\nLet me think of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` and both nodes are mutually reachable. This is equivalent to summing combinations of sizes of strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph.\n2. **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we use a greedy approach to decompose `p` into the sum of combinations of component sizes. For each step, we find the largest possible component size that fits within the remaining value of `p`.\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum number of nodes is determined, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.
