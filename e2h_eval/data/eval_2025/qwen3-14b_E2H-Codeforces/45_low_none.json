There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays the second game, the other player (player 3) has zero games played. The difference is 1 (since the winner has 1 game already). So that's allowed. So the answer is 2. For n=4, the example says the answer is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play three games? Let's see. Suppose the winner plays three games. That would require that each time, the opponent has either the same number of games or differs by one. Let's think: the first game, the winner plays someone (say, player 2), then in the second game, they have to play someone who has 0 or 1 games. But after the first game, the winner has 1 game. Suppose they play against player 3 next. Then player 3 has 0 games. So that's allowed. Then the winner has 2 games. Now, to play another game, the opponent must have either 1 or 2 games. But the remaining players are player 4. How did they get here? Well, maybe player 4 had to play against someone else. But if there are four players, the initial matches would be two games. Let's say the first round is (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4). Then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner (1) has played two games. So maximum is 2. So for n=4, the answer is 2. \n\nSo the problem is to find, given n, the maximum possible number of games the winner can play, under these constraints. \n\nWhat's the pattern here? Let's think recursively. Let's say the maximum number of games is f(n). How can we model this?\n\nThe winner has to play as many games as possible. Each time they play, their opponent must have a number of games that's either equal to theirs or differs by one. \n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. For the winner to play k games, they must have opponents in each round. Each time, the opponent must have played either k-1, k-2, etc. games. But how does this relate to the total number of players?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this problem is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for the winner to play k games, the number of players required would be similar to the Fibonacci numbers. Let me think. \n\nFor example, let's consider that to have a player reach k games, they need to have a certain number of players. Let's think about the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games. Let's call this m(k). \n\nFor k=1, m(1) = 2. Because you need two players. \n\nFor k=2, the winner needs to play two games. Let's think. The first game is against one player (so 2 players). Then, the second game requires an opponent who has played 0 or 1 games. If the winner has played 1 game, the opponent could have played 0 or 1. But for the opponent to have played 1 game, they must have won one game. So the minimal number of players would be 3. Because, for example, the winner beats player 2, then beats player 3. But in this case, the opponent in the second game (player 3) has 0 games. So the minimal number of players for k=2 is 3. \n\nBut wait, if the winner plays two games, then the minimal number of players is 3. But for n=3, the answer is 2. \n\nNow, for k=3. What's m(3)? To get to three games, the winner must have an opponent in the third game. Let's think: the winner has played two games. The opponent must have played either 1 or 2 games. So for the opponent to have played 2 games, they would have to have a path of two wins. So the minimal number of players would be m(2) + m(2) - 1? Or something like that. Wait, maybe m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2). Because, for the winner to play k games, they need to have in the k-th game",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The key insight is that the structure of the tournament resembles a Fibonacci sequence, where the minimum number of players required for a winner to play `k` games follows a similar pattern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rule**: The rule states that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. This constraint implies a recursive structure where each game the winner plays requires a certain number of players, which can be modeled using Fibonacci numbers.\n2. **Fibonacci Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games can be derived from the Fibonacci sequence. If `f(k)` represents the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games, then `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)`. This is because each game the winner plays requires opponents who have either played the same number of games or one less.\n3. **Binary Search**: Given the constraints (up to 10^18 players), we use binary search to efficiently find the maximum number of games `k` such that the minimum number of players required for `k` games is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while fib[-1] <= n:\n        fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])\n    \n    # Now find the largest k such that fib[k+1] <= n\n    # Because the minimum players for k games is fib[k+1]\n    # For example, for k=1, fib[2]=2 (which matches n=2)\n    # For k=2, fib[3]=3 (matches n=3)\n    # So we need to find the largest index i where fib[i] <= n\n    # Then the answer is i - 1\n    # Because fib[2] = 2 corresponds to k=1, fib[3]=3 corresponds to k=2, etc.\n    # So the answer is the index minus 1\n    # But we need to handle cases where n is not exactly a Fibonacci number\n    # Let's find the largest i where fib[i] <= n\n    low = 1\n    high = len(fib) - 1\n    ans = 0\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if fib[mid] <= n:\n            ans = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return ans - 1\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    n = int(input)\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers until the values exceed the maximum possible input value (10^18). This helps in quickly determining the minimum number of players required for each possible number of games.\n2. **Binary Search**: Using binary search on the precomputed Fibonacci numbers, we find the largest index `i` such that the Fibonacci number at index `i` is less than or equal to `n`. The corresponding maximum number of games is `i - 1` because the Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, and the index adjustment accounts for the offset in the sequence.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of games using properties of the Fibonacci sequence and binary search, making it suitable even for very large values of `n`.",
