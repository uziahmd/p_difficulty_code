The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the sum of 2^i is maximized. Since each district's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, we want to keep the districts with the largest possible numbers. But there's a catch: we have to ensure that after removing k districts, the remaining ones are all connected. So the challenge is to find which districts to remove so that the largest possible districts are kept, while maintaining connectivity.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure connectivity? Because if we just remove the smallest k districts, maybe they are spread out in the tree such that removing them would disconnect the remaining ones. But since the tree is connected initially, maybe there's a way to select the districts to remove in a way that allows the largest ones to stay connected.\n\nLet me think. The optimal strategy would be to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. So perhaps we should prioritize keeping the districts with higher numbers. However, we need to make sure that those districts are connected. So maybe the approach is to find a subtree that includes the highest possible districts, and then remove the others.\n\nBut how to find that subtree? Let's think about the structure of the tree. Since the districts are numbered from 1 to n, and the value is 2^i, the highest value is 2^n. So we want to include district n, then n-1, etc., as long as they are connected.\n\nBut how to determine which districts to remove. Let's think of it as choosing n - k districts to keep, which must form a connected subtree. And among all possible such subsets, we need the one with maximum sum of 2^i. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, this sum is maximized when we include the largest possible districts. So the problem reduces to selecting the largest (n - k) districts that form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but how can we ensure that? For example, if we want to include the largest (n - k) districts, but they are not connected. Then we have to remove some of them and include lower-numbered ones. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to include all districts from some number m up to n, where m is chosen such that there are exactly (n - k) districts. However, this is only possible if those districts form a connected subtree. But that might not be the case. For example, if the tree is structured such that the higher-numbered districts are scattered.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model this as selecting the districts with the highest numbers, and then checking if they form a connected subtree. If they do, then that's the best. Otherwise, we need to remove some of the lower ones and include some higher ones. Wait, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the districts with higher numbers have higher values, perhaps we should start by keeping the largest (n -k) districts, and then check if they are connected. If they are not connected, then we need to remove some of the lower-numbered ones and include some others. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nBut given that the tree is connected, maybe there's a way to find the minimal set of districts to remove. Wait, but the problem is that the districts to remove are not necessarily the smallest ones. For example, if you have a tree where the highest-numbered districts are connected, but some lower-numbered ones are in between. But how to find that?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as selecting a subtree with exactly (n -k) nodes, which has the maximum possible sum. Since the sum depends on the nodes included, and higher-numbered nodes contribute more, we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nThis sounds similar to a problem where you need to select a connected subset of nodes with certain constraints. How can we approach this?\n\nPerhaps a greedy approach. Let's think about starting with the highest-numbered node (n), and then adding the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. But how to manage that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes. For example, we can perform a priority-based selection where we prioritize keeping higher-numbered nodes. But how to ensure connectivity.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since the tree is connected, and we want to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible, maybe we can perform a traversal (like DFS or BFS) starting from the highest-numbered node and include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But how to decide which nodes to include when there's a choice.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to keep the nodes with",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component with the maximum possible sum of fans. The key insight is to prioritize keeping the districts with the highest numbers since their fan counts grow exponentially.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fan Count**: Since the fan count for district `i` is `2^i`, we should aim to keep the largest possible districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected subtree. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered district and greedily including the next highest-numbered districts while maintaining connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We want to keep (n - k) districts, which are the largest possible.\n    # So we start from the largest node and try to include as many large nodes as possible.\n    # We can perform a BFS/DFS starting from the largest node, and mark nodes to keep.\n    # The nodes not marked will be removed.\n    \n    # We need to select (n - k) nodes, starting from the largest, and ensure they are connected.\n    # So we can do a BFS/DFS starting from node n, and collect the largest possible nodes.\n    \n    # We need to find the minimal set of nodes to remove, which are the smallest ones not in the connected subtree.\n    \n    # Let's perform a BFS starting from node n, and collect nodes in order of decreasing value.\n    # But how to ensure we collect the largest possible nodes?\n    \n    # Actually, since the tree is connected, if we start from node n and do a BFS/DFS, we can collect all nodes that are connected to it.\n    # However, if the number of nodes in that subtree is less than (n - k), then we need to expand.\n    # Wait, but we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n    \n    # Alternative approach: We can use a priority queue (max-heap) to always visit the highest-numbered node first.\n    # This way, we can greedily include the largest nodes first, ensuring connectivity.\n    \n    # Initialize a visited array\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    keep = [False] * (n + 1)\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Use a priority queue (max-heap) simulation using a heap with negative values\n    # Start with node n\n    heap = []\n    heap.append(-n)\n    visited[n] = True\n    while heap:\n        current = -heap.pop()\n        keep[current] = True\n        count += 1\n        if count == (n - k):\n            break\n        # Push all neighbors of current into the heap if not visited\n        for neighbor in edges[current]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                visited[neighbor] = True\n                heap.append(-neighbor)\n    \n    # Now, collect all nodes not in 'keep' and sort them\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not keep[i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Traversal**: Starting from the highest-numbered district (node `n`), we perform a traversal (using a max-heap simulation with a priority queue) to collect the largest possible districts while ensuring connectivity.\n2. **Greedy Selection**: By always visiting the highest-numbered unvisited node next, we ensure that we include the most valuable districts (in terms of fan count) first.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: The traversal ensures that the selected districts form a connected subtree. If the number of selected districts reaches `n - k`, we stop and collect the remaining districts to remove.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the remaining districts are connected and maximize the total fan count by prioritizing higher-numbered districts.",
