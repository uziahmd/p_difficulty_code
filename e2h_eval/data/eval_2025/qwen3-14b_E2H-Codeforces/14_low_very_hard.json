He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo for a given n, we can compute the number of trailing zeros. But here, the problem is inverse: given m, find all n's that produce exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's see why. The trailing zeros for 5! is 1 (from 5/5=1). For 6! it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly for 7,8,9. But when you reach 10, it's 2 zeros. So between 5 and 9, there are 5 numbers that give exactly 1 zero.\n\nSo the key is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Now, the challenge is to find those n's efficiently.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that correspond to m. Let's think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing. For example, as n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for a given m, there could be a range of n's that give exactly m zeros. However, sometimes there might be no such n. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Wait, let's check. Let's compute for n=24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0. Total 4. For n=25, 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 25 and 24, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Hence, the answer would be 0.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding if there exists n such that f(n) = m. If yes, then find all such n's. But how?\n\nThe approach I can think of is:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers after that which also have f(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since f(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, there could be a range of n's where f(n) equals m. However, because of the way the count increases (like when you hit multiples of 5, 25, etc.), there might be cases where there are multiple n's with the same count.\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's?\n\nLet me think about binary search. For example, to find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if that n's count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the range of n's where the count is exactly m.\n\nWait, but how to find the range?\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, find the lower and upper bounds of n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find those bounds?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose that for some n, f(n) = m. Then, the next number, n+1, will have f(n+1) equal to m if n+1 is not a multiple of 5. Otherwise, it increases by 1 or more. So the numbers that contribute to the same m are consecutive numbers until a multiple of 5 is hit.\n\nBut how to find the starting and ending points of such a range?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros are in a contiguous range. Because f(n) increases by 1 or more when n crosses a multiple of 5. So for example, if there exists some n where f(n) = m, then there's a range of numbers from a to b where f(n) = m, and the next number after b will have f(n) = m + k, where k >= 1.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Find the minimal n where f(n) = m",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes. Additionally, we must output these integers in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial. The formula to compute the number of trailing zeroes is:\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\n\nThis function $ f(n) $ is non-decreasing and increases by at least 1 when $ n $ crosses a multiple of 5. Therefore, for a given $ m $, if there exists an $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $, then all such $ n $'s will form a contiguous range.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search for Boundaries**:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $.\n   - Similarly, find the largest $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $.\n   \n2. **Check Validity**:\n   - If no such $ n $ exists (i.e., $ f(n) $ jumps over $ m $), return `0`.\n   - Otherwise, compute the range of $ n $'s and output them.\n\n3. **Edge Case Handling**:\n   - If $ m $ is not achievable (e.g., when the count of trailing zeros jumps from $ m-1 $ to $ m+1 $), return an empty list.\n\n---\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Binary search to find the lower bound of n where count == m\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    left = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cz == m:\n            left = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        elif cz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    # Binary search to find the upper bound of n where count == m\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    right = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cz == m:\n            right = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        elif cz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    if left == -1:\n        return 0, []\n    else:\n        return right - left + 1, list(range(left, right + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input)\n    k, values = find_n_values(m)\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, values)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **`count_trailing_zeros(n)`**: Computes the number of trailing zeroes in $ n! $ using the standard method.\n- **`find_n_values(m)`**: Uses binary search to find the smallest and largest $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $.
