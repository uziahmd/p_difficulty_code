He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many numbers n have exactly m trailing zeros in their factorial. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division gives zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors but the count remains the same until 10! which adds another 5 (from 10=2*5).\n\nWait, but how do I find the range of n's that give exactly m zeros?\n\nThe approach I think is:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers that also give the same count.\n\nBut how to find that minimal n? Well, maybe using binary search. Because the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. So for a given m, we can find the smallest n where the count is >=m. But then we need to check if that count is exactly m. Wait, but maybe there's no n that gives exactly m zeros. For example, if m is 5, but there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's think. Let's take m=5. Let's compute the trailing zeros for some numbers:\n\nFor n=24: 24/5 = 4, 24/25=0. Total is 4. So 24! has 4 zeros.\n\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So 25! has 6 zeros. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Therefore, for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the problem is, for a given m, find if there exists any n such that the count is exactly m. If yes, find all such n's.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n- For a given m, find the lower and upper bounds of n where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. The count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function. So for each m, there's a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. However, sometimes there's no such n. For example, m=5 as discussed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFind the minimal n where the count is >=m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the maximum n where the count is exactly m. Then all numbers between min_n and max_n (inclusive) would be valid.\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, in the sample input, m=1 gives 5 numbers. Why?\n\nBecause when n increases from 5 to 9, the count of trailing zeros is 1. Then at 10, it becomes 2. So the numbers 5-9 all have exactly 1 zero. So the count is 5 numbers. So the range is from 5 to 9.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe more? Let's think. Suppose m is 2. Let's see:\n\nn=10: count is 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0). So 10! has 2 zeros. Then 11! also has 2, until 14! (since 15 adds another 5). So numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14: 5 numbers. So again 5 numbers. Wait, but why?\n\nBecause when you reach a multiple of 5, the count increases. So between two multiples of 5, the count remains same. So for example, between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Between 10 and ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many positive integers $ n $ have exactly $ m $ trailing zeros in their factorial $ n! $. The solution involves leveraging the properties of trailing zeros in factorials and using binary search to efficiently find valid ranges of $ n $.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is calculated using the formula:\n$$\n\\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\nThis sum continues until the division yields zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach Overview**\n\n1. **Binary Search for Minimum $ n $ with at Least $ m $ Zeros**:\n   - We use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m $.\n   \n2. **Check if Exact Match Exists**:\n   - If the count of trailing zeros at this $ n $ is not equal to $ m $, then there are no values of $ n $ that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Find the Range of Valid $ n $**:\n   - If the exact match exists, find the maximum $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = m $. All integers between the minimum and maximum $ n $ (inclusive) will be valid.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Print the count of valid $ n $ values, followed by the sorted list of those values.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_values_with_m_zeros(m):\n    # Find the lower bound where count >= m\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    min_n = low\n\n    if count_trailing_zeros(min_n) != m:\n        return 0, []\n\n    # Find upper bound where count == m\n    high = min_n\n    while count_trailing_zeros(high) == m:\n        high += 1\n    max_n = high - 1\n\n    return max_n - min_n + 1, list(range(min_n, max_n + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        m = int(line.strip())\n        k, nums = find_values_with_m_zeros(m)\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, nums)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Example Execution**\n\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  1\n  5\n  ```\n\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  5\n  5 6 7 8 9\n  0\n  ```\n\nThis output correctly identifies that for $ m = 1 $, the numbers $ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 $ all result in exactly one trailing zero in their factorial. For $ m = 5 $, no such $ n $ exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Efficiency**\n\n- The function `count_trailing_zeros` runs in $ O(\\log_5 n) $ time.\n- Binary search runs in $ O(\\log n) $, making the overall algorithm efficient even for large values of $ m $ up to $ 100000 $.\n\nThis approach ensures correctness and optimal performance for all valid inputs.",
