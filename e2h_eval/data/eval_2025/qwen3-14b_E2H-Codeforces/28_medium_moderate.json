String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So we need to count the number of beautiful strings based on the given n, m, and g. Let me re-read the problem statement to make sure I get all the details.\n\nThe beautiful string s must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. Then, after some modifications, the resulting character must be g. The modifications are operations where you replace the last two characters with one. For example, replacing two zeros gives a 1, and any other pair (like 0 and 1 or 1 and 0 or two 1s) would give a 0. Wait, no—the description says: \"replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" Oh right, so only when replacing two zeros do you get a 1. Otherwise, any other pair (like 0 and 1, 1 and 0, or two 1s) gives a 0. So each modification reduces the length of the string by 1. And you can perform this operation as many times as needed, as long as the string has length at least two.\n\nThe key here is that the final character after all possible modifications must be equal to g. But how do we model this?\n\nWait, the problem says that we can perform some (possibly zero) number of modifications. So the process is: take the original string s, then apply some number of modifications until the string is reduced to a single character. And that final character must be equal to g. So the question is: for which strings s (with exactly n 0s and m 1s) is it possible that after applying some sequence of modifications, the result is g?\n\nBut how do we determine whether a given string s can be reduced to g via these operations?\n\nLet me think about the process of modifying. Each operation takes the last two characters and replaces them with a new character. Let's consider what the final character depends on. Since each operation reduces the length by one, starting from a string of length L = n + m, we need to perform exactly L-1 operations to reduce it to one character. However, the problem allows us to perform any number of operations (possibly less than L-1?), but wait, the problem says that the modifications can be done until we get to the desired character. Wait, no: the problem says that we can obtain character g from the string s with some number of modifications. So the process is that we can perform any number of modifications (possibly zero), but the end result must be the character g. However, since each modification reduces the length by one, the only way to end up with a single character is to perform exactly L-1 operations. Because otherwise, if you stop earlier, you'd have more than one character. So maybe the problem requires that the final result of reducing the string to one character via all possible operations must be equal to g. Because otherwise, if you stop before that, you have multiple characters, but the problem says that the character g must be obtained. Therefore, the process must end with exactly one character, which is g. Therefore, the question is: for a given string s (with n 0s and m 1s), when you reduce it to a single character through the allowed operations, is that character equal to g?\n\nSo the problem reduces to: count the number of binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s such that when you perform all possible reductions (i.e., until one character remains), the result is g.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for each such string, what is the value of the final character after all possible reductions. How does that depend on the initial string?\n\nLet me think about the reduction process. Let's consider that each operation replaces two characters with a new one. The replacement rule is: if the two characters are both 0s, replace with 1. Otherwise, replace with 0. Let's see if there's a way to model this as a function of the entire string.\n\nThis seems similar to a binary operation, perhaps with some associative property. Let me think about the parity or some invariant here.\n\nFor example, let's think about the process of reducing the string step by step. Suppose we have a string of length L. Each operation reduces the length by 1. The final result depends on the order of operations. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, maybe the final result is determined uniquely by the initial string, regardless of the order of operations. If that's true, then we can find a formula for the final character based on the initial string.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with some examples.\n\nTake the string \"00\". Replacing the two zeros gives 1. So the final character is 1.\n\nAnother example: \"01\". Since we can't perform any operation (length is 2, but the two characters are 0 and 1. Replacing them gives 0. So the final character is 0.\n\nAnother example: \"0011\". Let's see. Let's say we first reduce the last two 1s. They are not both 0s, so they become 0. Now the string is \"000\". Then, reduce the last two 0s to 1. Now the string is \"01\", which becomes 0. So final character is 0. Alternatively, another order: first reduce the first two 0s to 1. The string becomes \"11\". Then reduce them to 0. Final character is 0. Another order: reduce the first 0 and 0 (positions 0 and 1) to 1, then the string is \"11\" → 0. Or reduce the last two 1s first, then the rest. Either way, the final result is 0. So maybe the order doesn't matter. That suggests that the final result is determined by the initial string in a unique way.\n\nIf that's the case, then we can find a formula for the final character based on the count of 0s and 1s, or some other property.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern. Let's think recursively. Suppose the final character is determined by the entire string. Let's think about the parity of the number of 0s or something like that.\n\nLet me think of the process as building a binary tree, where each operation combines two elements into one. The final result depends on the way the operations are combined, but maybe there's an invariant here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a binary operation. Let me define an operator * such that combining two characters a and b gives:\n\na * b = 1 if a and b are both 0, else 0.\n\nBut this is a non-standard operation. Let's see what happens when combining three elements. For example, combining a, b, c. Suppose we first combine a and b, then combine the result with c. Or combine b and c first, then combine a with that result. Do we get the same outcome?\n\nLet me take an example. Let's say the three characters are 0, 0, 0. First, combine first two 0s: gives 1. Then combine with third 0: 1 * 0 = 0. Alternatively, combine last two 0s first: gives 1, then combine with first 0: 0. Same result.\n\nAnother example: 0, 0, 1. Let's combine first two 0s → 1. Combine with 1 → 1 * 1 = 0. Alternatively, combine the second two (0 and 1) → 0. Then combine with first 0: 0 * 0 = 1. Wait, this gives different results! So the order of operations affects the outcome. Which contradicts the earlier assumption. So the order does matter. But this would imply that the final character depends on the order of operations, which complicates things. However, the problem states that we can perform any number of modifications. But how do we know which sequence of operations leads to the desired g?\n\nBut the problem says that the string s is beautiful if it is possible to obtain g via some sequence of modifications. So even if there exists at least one sequence of operations that leads to g, then the string is counted.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because for some strings, depending on the order of operations, you can get different results. So the problem is to count the number of strings s where there exists at least one way to perform the modifications such that the final character is g.\n\nBut that makes the problem more complicated. How can we model this? Because for a given string, there might be multiple possible outcomes depending on the order of operations. So the question is whether there exists at least one way to perform the operations to reach g.\n\nBut how do we check that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the minimal or maximal possible value. For example, for a given string, what are the possible values that can be achieved through various sequences of operations?\n\nBut this seems complex. Let's think again of the example I had earlier: three characters 0,0,1. Depending on the order, we can get 0 or 1. So for this string, it's possible to reach either 0 or 1. Thus, if g is 0 or 1, this string would be counted as beautiful if either is required.\n\nBut then, the problem says that the string is beautiful if there exists a way to reach g. So the problem becomes: count the number of strings s with exactly n 0s and m 1s such that there exists a sequence of operations leading to g.\n\nBut how do we model that for a general string?\n\nThis seems really tricky. Let me think of the problem differently. Let me think of the process of reduction as a way to compute some value based on the initial string. Maybe the final value depends on the number of 0s and 1s in some way, but perhaps not directly.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a binary tree where each node represents a character, and the operations combine pairs. The final result is the root of the tree. The problem is that the structure of the tree (the order of combining) affects the result.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming. However, given that n and m can be up to 1e5, we need an efficient approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into considering the parity of the number of 0s. Let me think again about the operation rules. Let me think of the operation as follows: each time you combine two characters, you replace them with a new character. Let's track the number of 0s and 1s during this process. However, this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think of the example where the string is all 0s. For example, suppose the string is 000. Let's see:\n\nIf we combine the first two 0s to 1, then combine with the third 0: 1 and 0 → 0. So the result is 0.\n\nAlternatively, combine the last two 0s first to 1, then combine with the first 0: same result.\n\nAnother example: four 0s. Let's see:\n\nCombine first two → 1. Combine next two → 1. Now we have two 1s. Combine them → 0. Result is 0.\n\nAlternatively, combine first two 0s → 1, then combine with third 0 → 0, then combine with fourth 0 → 0 * 0 → 1. So the result is 1. Wait, that's different. Wait, let me retrace:\n\nOriginal string: 0000.\n\nFirst combine first two 0s → 1. Now the string is 1 0 0. Then combine the last two 0s → 1. Now the string is 1 1. Combine them → 0. So result is 0.\n\nAnother sequence: combine the first two 0s → 1, then combine the new 1 with the third 0. The two characters are 1 and 0. Not both 0s, so replaced with 0. Now the string is 0 and 0. Combine them to 1. So the result is 1. So different sequences can lead to different results. Thus, the same string can lead to different outcomes. Which means that for the problem, a string is considered beautiful if there's at least one sequence of operations that leads to g. \n\nBut how can we model this for all possible strings?\n\nThis seems very challenging. Let me think of the problem again. What is the condition that allows a string s to be reduced to g?\n\nLet me think of the possible values of the final character. For example, if the string has an even number of 0s, or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character depends on the parity of the number of 0s in the string. Let's test this.\n\nTake the example of the string \"00\" (n=2, m=0). The result is 1. Number of 0s is even (2). For the string \"000\" (3 zeros), we saw that it can be reduced to 0 or 1. So parity of the number of 0s may not directly determine the outcome.\n\nWait, but in the first case, two 0s → 1. In the case of three 0s, when reduced to 0, the number of 0s was 3, but the result was 0. When reduced to 1, the result was 1. So parity of the number of 0s is not directly linked.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the operation as a function. Let's think about the XOR of the number of 0s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a binary operation that can be represented as a function of the count of 0s and 1s. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nLet me think about the problem from another angle. Suppose that during the reduction process, every time we combine two characters, we are effectively performing a certain transformation. Let's think of this as a kind of binary operation and try to find some invariant.\n\nLet me think of the entire process as a way to compute the value of the string based on the number of 0s and 1s. Suppose that the final value is determined by the parity of the number of 0s modulo something.\n\nLet me take some small examples.\n\nCase 1: All 0s. Let's see:\n\nn=1, m=0 → string is \"0\". Can't do any operations. So the final character is 0. But according to the problem's note, for example, in the third sample input, n=1, m=1, g=1. The output is 0 because there are no such strings. Wait, but in this case, if the string is \"0\", then the final character is 0. But for the problem's conditions, the string must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So if n=1, m=0, and g=0, then the answer is 1.\n\nLet me think of the following possibilities:\n\nIf the string has k 0s and l 1s. Let me see what the possible final values are.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that the final value is determined by some function f(k, l). But how?\n\nLet me think for small values:\n\nCase 1: k=1, l=0. The string is \"0\". No modifications possible. Final value is 0.\n\nCase 2: k=2, l=0. The string is \"00\". One modification: becomes 1. So f(2, 0) = 1.\n\nCase 3: k=3, l=0. Possible ways to reduce:\n\nOption 1: Combine first two 0s to 1, then combine with third 0. The new string is \"10\" → combine to 0. So final value is 0.\n\nOption 2: Combine the last two 0s first. Then the string becomes \"01\" → combine to 0. Same result.\n\nSo f(3,0) = 0.\n\nCase 4: k=4, l=0. Let's see:\n\nOption 1: Combine first two 0s → 1. Then combine next two 0s → 1. Combine those two 1s → 0. Final value 0.\n\nOption 2: Combine first two 0s → 1, combine with third 0 → 0. Combine with fourth 0 → 1. So final value 1.\n\nSo for k=4, l=0, there are possible outcomes 0 and 1. Hence, the string can be reduced to either 0 or 1. Therefore, if g is 0 or 1, then this string would be counted.\n\nSo the function f(k,l) is not uniquely determined. It depends on the order of operations.\n\nThis suggests that for some strings, there are multiple possible outcomes. Hence, the problem requires that there exists at least one way to reach g.\n\nBut how can we model this for general n and m?\n\nAlternative approach: think of the problem as trying to find whether the final character can be g, given that the initial string has n 0s and m 1s. Let's think about the possible values that can be achieved based on the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think of the process as combining the characters in pairs. Each time two characters are merged into one. Let's think about the parity of the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it. Let me think of the following: each operation reduces the total number of characters by one. The initial length is L = n + m. After L-1 operations, we get one character. The key is to find for which combinations of n and m, there exists a way to perform operations such that the final character is g.\n\nAnother observation: the operation is equivalent to replacing two characters with a new one. Let's think of the entire process as a series of operations that can be represented as a binary tree. The root is the final character. Each internal node represents an operation combining two children.\n\nThe value of the root depends on the way the tree is structured. However, perhaps there's a way to find the possible values based on the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think of the following: each operation reduces the count of 0s and 1s in a certain way. For example, combining two 0s: they are removed and replaced with a 1. So the count of 0s decreases by 2, and the count of 1s increases by 1. Combining two 1s: they are replaced with 0. So 1s decrease by 2, 0s increase by 1. Combining a 0 and a 1 (in any order): they are replaced with 0. So the count of 0s decreases by 1 (since one 0 is removed, and one 1 is removed, and replaced with 0. So net change: 0s: -1 + 1 = 0? Wait, original counts: 0s and 1s. After combining, the new character is 0. So the count of 0s is (original count) - (number of 0s removed) + (number of 0s added). For combining a 0 and 1: we remove one 0 and one 1, add one 0. So the count of 0s changes by (-1 + 1) = 0. The count of 1s changes by -1.\n\nSo, depending on which two characters are combined, the counts change in different ways.\n\nBut since the order of operations can vary, the path taken affects the counts. However, the final state is a single character, which is either 0 or 1.\n\nLet me think of the entire process as a series of operations that transform the counts of 0s and 1s. The final count is either 1 (if the final character is 0) or 1 (if it's 1). But how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps there's a way to find the parity of the number of 0s and 1s, or some other invariant.\n\nLet me think of the following: let's consider the parity of the number of 0s in the initial string. Let me think of how the operations affect this parity.\n\nWhen combining two 0s: the number of 0s decreases by 2 (so parity remains the same). Then, adding a 1. So the number of 0s' parity changes by 0 (since subtracting 2 doesn't change parity). But the count of 0s is decreased by 2, and increased by 0 (because the new character is 1). So overall, the number of 0s decreases by 2, parity remains same.\n\nWhen combining two 1s: the number of 0s increases by 1. So parity of 0s flips.\n\nWhen combining a 0 and a 1: the number of 0s decreases by 1 (since we remove one 0 and one 1, and add one 0). So the net change is 0 (because -1 + 1 = 0). Wait, original 0 count: say x. After removing one 0 and adding one 0, the count is x - 1 + 1 = x. So the count of 0s remains the same. So parity of 0s remains same.\n\nSo combining two 1s flips the parity of the number of 0s. Other operations leave it unchanged.\n\nBut what is the final parity of the number of 0s? Let's think. Initially, the number of 0s is n. After all operations, the final character is either 0 or 1. So the final count of 0s is 1 if the final character is 0, else 0.\n\nSo the parity of the number of 0s in the final state is 1 if the final character is 0, else 0.\n\nLet me denote the initial parity of the number of 0s as p = n mod 2.\n\nLet me think about how the parity changes during operations. Each time we perform an operation that combines two 1s, it flips the parity of the number of 0s. Other operations do not change the parity.\n\nSo the total number of times we perform an operation that combines two 1s will affect the final parity.\n\nLet me denote the number of times such operations are performed as k. Then, the final parity of the number of 0s is p + k mod 2. And this must equal the final count of 0s (which is 1 if final character is 0, else 0).\n\nBut the final count of 0s is 1 if the final character is 0, else 0. So:\n\nfinal_parity = (p + k) mod 2 = final_count_0s.\n\nBut final_count_0s is 1 if the final character is 0, else 0. So:\n\nIf the final character is 0, then final_parity is 1. So:\n\n(p + k) mod 2 = 1.\n\nIf the final character is 1, then final_parity is 0. So:\n\n(p + k) mod 2 = 0.\n\nBut k is the number of times we combined two 1s. How does this relate to the possibility of achieving a certain final character?\n\nThis seems like a possible direction, but I'm not sure yet. Let's see.\n\nBut how can we model this? Since k can vary depending on the operations, but we have to choose a sequence of operations that leads to a certain final character.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of k. For example, if we can choose k to satisfy the equation (p + k) ≡ target_parity mod 2, then it's possible. But what are the constraints on k?\n\nBut how do we know if there exists a sequence of operations that allows us to choose k to meet this condition?\n\nAlternatively, since the parity of the final count depends on p and k, and we can choose k to adjust this, perhaps there's a way to find whether it's possible to reach a certain target_parity.\n\nLet me consider that the target is to have the final character be g. So:\n\nIf g is 0, then target_parity is 1. So we need (p + k) ≡ 1 mod 2 → k ≡ (1 - p) mod 2.\n\nIf g is 1, then target_parity is 0. So k ≡ (-p) mod 2.\n\nBut how can we ensure that such a k exists?\n\nWell, k is the number of times we combined two 1s during the process. So, for this to be possible, there must be a way to perform enough operations that combine two 1s to achieve the required parity.\n\nBut this seems abstract. Let me think of it in terms of the total number of 1s and 0s.\n\nAnother observation: during the entire process, the number of 1s and 0s changes based on the operations. Let me think of the entire process as a series of steps where each operation reduces the total number of characters by 1.\n\nThe initial total number of characters is L = n + m. The final number is 1.\n\nLet me think of the total number of operations that combine two 0s, two 1s, or a 0 and 1.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a be the number of times two 0s are combined.\n\nLet b be the number of times two 1s are combined.\n\nLet c be the number of times a 0 and a 1 are combined.\n\nEach operation reduces the length by 1. The total number of operations is L-1 = (n + m) - 1.\n\nSo:\n\na + b + c = L - 1 = n + m - 1.\n\nNow, let's track how the number of 0s and 1s changes.\n\nInitially, there are n 0s and m 1s.\n\nEach operation of type a (combining two 0s) removes two 0s and adds one 1. So the net change for 0s is -2, and for 1s is +1.\n\nEach operation of type b (combining two 1s) removes two 1s and adds one 0. Net change for 0s: +1, for 1s: -2.\n\nEach operation of type c (combining a 0 and 1) removes one 0 and one 1, adds one 0. Net change for 0s: -1 + 1 = 0. Net change for 1s: -1.\n\nAt the end, there is one character left. Let's say it is g. So:\n\nFinal number of 0s is 1 if g=0, else 0.\n\nFinal number of 1s is 1 if g=1, else 0.\n\nLet me write equations for the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nStarting with n 0s and m 1s.\n\nAfter all operations, the number of 0s is:\n\nn - 2a + b + 0*c = ?\n\nWait, for each operation of type a: subtract 2 from 0s.\n\nFor each operation of type b: add 1 to 0s.\n\nFor each operation of type c: no change to 0s.\n\nSo:\n\nTotal 0s: n - 2a + b = final_0s.\n\nSimilarly, total 1s: m - 2b + a - c = final_1s.\n\nBut since the final is either 0 or 1:\n\nIf g=0, then final_0s = 1, final_1s = 0.\n\nIf g=1, then final_0s = 0, final_1s = 1.\n\nSo:\n\nCase 1: g=0.\n\nn - 2a + b = 1.\n\nm - 2b + a - c = 0.\n\nAlso, a + b + c = n + m - 1.\n\nWe also have three variables a, b, c. Let me try to solve these equations.\n\nFrom the first equation: n - 2a + b = 1 → rearranged as b = 1 + 2a - n.\n\nFrom the second equation: m - 2b + a - c = 0 → rearranged as c = m - 2b + a.\n\nSubstituting b from the first equation into the second:\n\nc = m - 2*(1 + 2a - n) + a = m - 2 -4a + 2n + a = m - 2 + 2n -3a.\n\nThen, substituting into the third equation:\n\na + b + c = n + m - 1.\n\nSubstituting b and c:\n\na + [1 + 2a - n] + [m - 2 + 2n - 3a] = n + m - 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\na + 1 + 2a -n + m - 2 + 2n -3a = n + m -1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(a + 2a -3a) + (1 -2) + (-n + 2n) + m = n + m -1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0a -1 + n + m = n + m -1.\n\nWhich is:\n\nn + m -1 = n + m -1. So this holds for any a. So there are infinitely many solutions, as long as the expressions for b and c are non-negative integers, and the variables a, b, c are non-negative.\n\nSo, the system of equations for g=0 is consistent, provided that there exist non-negative integers a, b, c satisfying the above expressions.\n\nSimilarly, for g=1, the equations would be:\n\nn - 2a + b = 0.\n\nm - 2b + a - c = 1.\n\nAgain, solving these equations.\n\nLet me proceed with case 1: g=0.\n\nWe need to find if there exists a non-negative integer a such that:\n\nb = 1 + 2a - n ≥ 0,\n\nand c = m - 2 + 2n -3a ≥ 0.\n\nAdditionally, since a, b, c ≥ 0, we can derive constraints on a.\n\nBut how can we find whether such a exists?\n\nLet me think about the constraints.\n\nFirst, for b ≥ 0:\n\n1 + 2a - n ≥ 0 → 2a ≥ n - 1 → a ≥ ceil((n-1)/2).\n\nBut since a can be any integer ≥ 0, we need to find a such that this holds.\n\nSecond, for c ≥ 0:\n\nm - 2 + 2n -3a ≥ 0 → 3a ≤ m + 2n - 2 → a ≤ floor( (m + 2n -2)/3 )\n\nSo, the possible values of a must be in the range:\n\nceil( (n-1)/2 ) ≤ a ≤ floor( (m + 2n - 2)/3 )\n\nBut also, since a must be non-negative, we need to take max(ceil( (n-1)/2 ), 0) as lower bound.\n\nBut how do we know if there exists an integer a in this interval?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to find whether there's a solution based on certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the necessary conditions for the existence of such a, and then find the number of valid strings.\n\nBut this seems quite involved. Let's think of the problem again. We need to find the number of binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s such that there exists a way to perform operations to get g.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find conditions on n and m for which such a string exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find that the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 0s and the parity of the number of 1s, or something similar.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let me look back at the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 1 0 → Output 2. The beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\".\n\nLet me check for each of these strings whether they can be reduced to 0.\n\nTake \"01\": length is 2. Combine them → 0. So yes. So g=0 is achieved.\n\nSample Input 2: 2 2 0 → Output 4. The beautiful strings are \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\n\nLet me check one of them, say \"0011\". How can it be reduced to 0?\n\nOne possible way:\n\nCombine last two 1s → 0. Now the string is \"000\". Combine last two 0s → 1. Now the string is \"01\" → combine to 0. Yes.\n\nAnother way: combine first two 0s → 1. Now the string is \"111\". Combine last two 1s → 0. Now string is \"10\" → combine to 0. So yes.\n\nSo for this case, it's possible.\n\nNow, let's think about the conditions for the existence of such a string.\n\nAnother idea: the final character depends on the parity of the number of 0s and the total number of operations that combine two 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of 0s. Earlier, I thought that the parity of the number of 0s in the final state is 1 if the final character is 0, and 0 otherwise. And this parity is equal to the initial parity of 0s plus the number of times two 1s were combined (mod 2). So:\n\nfinal_parity = (n + b) mod 2.\n\nWhere b is the number of times two 1s were combined.\n\nBecause each time two 1s are combined, it adds 1 to the number of 0s (from the operation), which changes the parity of the number of 0s.\n\nBut since the final_parity is 1 for g=0 and 0 for g=1, we have:\n\nFor g=0: (n + b) mod 2 = 1 → b ≡ (1 - n) mod 2.\n\nFor g=1: (n + b) mod 2 = 0 → b ≡ (-n) mod 2.\n\nBut what's the relationship between b and other variables?\n\nBut this seems like a necessary condition for the existence of a solution. However, it may not be sufficient.\n\nBut if we can find that there exists a b with the correct parity, and that the other constraints are satisfied, then it's possible.\n\nBut how to connect this to the previous equations?\n\nLet me think of the case where g=0. We need to have:\n\nn - 2a + b = 1.\n\nAnd from the earlier analysis, b = 1 + 2a - n.\n\nBut also, from the parity condition, b ≡ (1 - n) mod 2.\n\nLet me substitute b into this:\n\nb = 1 + 2a - n.\n\nThen, mod 2, this is:\n\nb ≡ 1 - n + 0 (since 2a is 0 mod 2) → 1 - n mod 2. Which matches the required condition. So the parity condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nThus, the parity condition is already accounted for in the equations.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding whether there exists a non-negative integer a such that:\n\nb = 1 + 2a - n ≥ 0,\n\nand c = m - 2 + 2n - 3a ≥ 0.\n\nAdditionally, since a must be ≥ 0, and b ≥ 0, and c ≥ 0.\n\nSo for the case of g=0, we need to find if there exists an integer a such that:\n\na ≥ ceil((n-1)/2),\n\nand a ≤ floor( (m + 2n - 2)/3 ),\n\nand also, since a must be ≥ 0, the lower bound is max(ceil((n-1)/2), 0).\n\nIf there exists such an a, then there exists a way to perform the operations to get g=0.\n\nSimilarly, for g=1, we need to solve:\n\nn - 2a + b = 0 → b = 2a - n.\n\nAnd from the second equation:\n\nm - 2b + a - c = 1 → c = m - 2b + a - 1 = m - 2*(2a - n) + a - 1 = m -4a + 2n + a -1 = m + 2n - 3a - 1.\n\nAlso, the sum a + b + c = n + m - 1.\n\nSubstituting b and c:\n\na + (2a - n) + (m + 2n - 3a - 1) = n + m -1.\n\nSimplify:\n\na + 2a - n + m + 2n - 3a -1 = n + m -1 → (a+2a-3a) + (-n + 2n) + m -1 = n + m -1 → 0a + n + m -1 = n + m -1 → holds.\n\nSo again, the system is consistent, and we need to find a such that:\n\nb = 2a - n ≥ 0 → a ≥ ceil(n/2).\n\nand c = m + 2n - 3a - 1 ≥ 0 → 3a ≤ m + 2n - 1 → a ≤ floor( (m + 2n -1)/3 ).\n\nSo for g=1, the a must satisfy:\n\na ≥ ceil(n/2),\n\na ≤ floor( (m + 2n -1)/3 ),\n\nand a ≥ 0.\n\nSo for the string to be reducible to g, there must exist such an a.\n\nNow, the problem is to count",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be reduced to a given character `g` through a series of specified operations. The operations involve replacing the last two characters of the string with either a '0' or '1', depending on the pair being replaced.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Reduction Process**: Each operation reduces the length of the string by 1. The final character after all possible reductions must be `g`.\n2. **Constraints Analysis**: We need to determine if there exists a sequence of operations that can transform the string into `g`. This involves analyzing the number of '0's and '1's in the string and their possible transformations.\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**: Using equations derived from the reduction rules, we determine the valid ranges for the number of operations that combine pairs of characters. These ranges help us check if it is possible to reduce the string to `g`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef comb(n, k, memo):\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    if (n, k) in memo:\n        return memo[(n, k)]\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        res = 1\n    else:\n        res = (comb(n-1, k-1, memo) + comb(n-1, k, memo)) % MOD\n    memo[(n, k)] = res\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        m = int(input[idx+1])\n        g = int(input[idx+2])\n        cases.append((n, m, g))\n        idx += 3\n    \n    for n, m, g in cases:\n        if n + m == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        \n        total = 0\n        if g == 0:\n            # Check if there exists a valid a for g=0\n            # Find the range of a\n            lower_a = (n - 1 + 1) // 2  # ceil((n-1)/2)\n            upper_a = (m + 2 * n - 2) // 3\n            lower_a = max(lower_a, 0)\n            if lower_a > upper_a:\n                pass\n            else:\n                # Now, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the string\n                # which has exactly n 0s and m 1s\n                total = comb(n + m, n, {})\n        else:  # g == 1\n            lower_a = (n + 1) // 2  # ceil(n/2)\n            upper_a = (m + 2 * n - 1) // 3\n            lower_a = max(lower_a, 0)\n            if lower_a <= upper_a:\n                total = comb(n + m, n, {})\n        \n        print(total % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Combinatorial Calculations**: The function `comb` computes combinations using memoization to efficiently calculate binomial coefficients modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n2. **Range Determination**: For each test case, we determine the valid range of operations (a) that can transform the string into the target character `g`.\n3. **Feasibility Check**: Based on the derived ranges, we check if there exists a valid sequence of operations.
