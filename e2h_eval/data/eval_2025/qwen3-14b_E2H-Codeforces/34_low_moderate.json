And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all those sums. The output needs to be precise with at least six decimal digits.\n\nSo, the input gives me n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The task is to compute the average of all the possible consecutive k-day periods.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to compute the sum for each window of size k and then take the average of all those sums. However, if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach that checks each window by adding the elements each time would be O(n*k), which would be too slow for large n and k. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 1e5, then the total operations would be 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10, which is way beyond acceptable time limits.\n\nTherefore, I need a more efficient approach. The standard way to handle sliding window sums is using the sliding window technique, where you compute the sum for the first window, then for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's left behind and add the new element that comes in. This reduces the time complexity to O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Then, for each subsequent window (from position 1 to n - k), subtract the element that's no longer in the window (a[i-1]) and add the new element (a[i + k - 1]).\n3. Keep track of all these sums and then compute their average.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is the average of all these sums. So, the total number of windows is (n - k + 1). So, once I have all the sums, I can sum them all and divide by (n - k + 1).\n\nBut how to compute the sum of all the window sums efficiently?\n\nWait, let's think. Let's say I have the sum of each window. The total sum of all these window sums is equal to the sum of each element multiplied by the number of windows that include that element.\n\nFor example, each element a[i] is part of some number of windows. For instance, the first element is part of the first window only. The second element is part of the first and second window, etc. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf the window size is k, then each element a[i] is included in exactly min(i, n - k + 1) ... no, perhaps there's a formula here. For each element a[i], the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of positions where the window starts at or before i and ends at or after i.\n\nAlternatively, for the element at position i (0-based?), the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of possible starting positions such that the window includes i.\n\nLet me think in terms of 1-based indices. Suppose the array is 1-based. For a given element a[i], the earliest window that includes it is when the window starts at position (i - k + 1) if that's >=1. Wait, no. Let's think: the window starts at position s, and ends at s + k -1. So for a[i], the window must start at s such that s <= i <= s + k -1. Which rearranges to s <= i and s >= i - k + 1. Also, since s has to be >=1 and s +k -1 <=n. So the number of windows that include a[i] is equal to the number of valid s's in the range [max(1, i -k +1), min(i, n -k +1)].\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way. For each element, the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of possible starting positions where the window includes it. Let me think for the element at position i (1-based). The earliest window that includes it is when the window starts at position s = max(1, i -k +1). The latest window that includes it is when the window starts at s = min(i, n -k +1). Wait, maybe not. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose n=5, k=3. The windows are positions 1-3, 2-4, 3-5. For element at position 3, it's included in all three windows. For element at position 2, it's included in windows starting at 1 and 2. So for element at position i, the number of windows that include it is the number",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week consists of `k` consecutive days. The challenge is to compute this average in an efficient manner given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, we use a sliding window approach to maintain the sum of the current window efficiently. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n).\n2. **Sum Calculation**: We first compute the sum of the first `k` elements. For each subsequent window, we adjust the sum by subtracting the element that is left behind and adding the new element that comes into the window.\n3. **Average Calculation**: Once we have the sum of all window sums, we divide it by the total number of windows, which is `n - k + 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        # Read n and k\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            a = []\n        else:\n            a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n            idx += 1\n        # Compute the sum of all windows\n        total_sum = 0\n        window_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum += window_sum\n        for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n            window_sum = window_sum - a[i - 1] + a[i + k - 1]\n            total_sum += window_sum\n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n        # Print with 10 decimal digits\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and processed line by line to handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- **Sliding Window Sum**: The initial sum of the first `k` elements is computed. For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n- **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is accumulated and then divided by the number of windows to get the average, which is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average using linear time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.",
