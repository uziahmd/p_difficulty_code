Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l. \n\nFirst, I think the approach here is to sort the lantern positions. Because if they are sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered. Because the worst case is between two adjacent lanterns. Also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine part of the required d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance between the start of the street (0) and the first lantern. The required d must be at least half of that distance, because the lantern's light can cover up to d from its position. So if the first lantern is at a1, then the area from 0 to a1 - d must be covered. Wait, no. Wait, the lantern's coverage is from a_i -d to a_i +d. But since the street is from 0 to l, the coverage for the first lantern would be from max(0, a_i -d) to min(l, a_i +d). But for the entire street to be covered, the first lantern's coverage must reach from 0 to some point. So the first gap is between 0 and the first lantern. The maximum distance between two consecutive points (including the ends) will determine the required d.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is: after sorting the lanterns, the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns (after considering the ends) divided by 2 is the required d. Because for each gap between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance between them is the distance between them. The minimal d required for that gap is (gap)/2. Because if you have two lanterns at positions x and y (x < y), then the middle point between them is (x + y)/2. The distance from each lantern to that middle point is (y -x)/2. So to cover the entire street, the d must be at least (y -x)/2. But also, the first lantern's left side and the last lantern's right side need to be considered.\n\nFor example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The required d must be at least a1, because the first lantern's coverage must reach 0. Wait, no. Because the lantern's coverage is a radius d. So the leftmost point covered by the first lantern is a1 -d. To cover 0, a1 -d <= 0. Which implies d >= a1. But wait, that's if the first lantern is at a1. But if there are multiple lanterns, maybe the first lantern is not the only one. Wait, but if the first lantern is at a1, then the area from 0 to a1 -d must be covered. But if a1 -d is less than or equal to 0, then that area is covered. So the maximum distance from 0 to the first lantern is a1. So the required d must be at least a1, but that's only if there's no other lantern before it. But since the lanterns are sorted, the first lantern is the leftmost. So the first part is the distance between 0 and the first lantern. Similarly, the last part is the distance between the last lantern and l. So for these two ends, the required d is the maximum between (first lantern's position) and (l - last lantern's position). Then, between the lanterns, the maximum gap is the maximum of (a[i+1] - a[i]) for all i. Then, the required d is the maximum between the maximum gap divided by 2 and the two ends' distances.\n\nWait, but for example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to 3 is 3. So the d must be at least 3, because otherwise, the left end (0) is not covered. But if the lantern's radius is 3, then the coverage starts at 3-3=0, so that's covered. Similarly, if the last lantern is at position l - 2, then the distance from that lantern to l is 2, so d must be at least 2. \n\nBut between two consecutive lanterns, say positions x and y (sorted), the maximum distance between them is y - x. The worst case is the middle of this gap. So the required d for this gap is (y - x)/2. Because if you have a gap of length g, then the radius must be at least g/2 to cover the entire gap. \n\nSo putting it all together, the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. Let's call this max_gap.\n- Compute the first gap (the first lantern's position - 0) and the last gap (l - last lantern's position).\n- The required d is the maximum between (max_gap / 2), first_gap, and last_gap.\n\nWait, but for the first_gap, it's the distance between 0 and the first lantern. So the required d must be at least first_gap. Because the first lantern's coverage must reach 0. Similarly for the last gap.\n\nBut for example, if the first lantern is at position 5, then the first_gap is 5. So d must be at least 5. Because the lantern's coverage is from 5 - d to 5 +d. For 0 to be covered, 5 -d <= 0 => d >=5. \n\nSimilarly for the last lantern. So yes, the first and last gaps are compared directly. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nSort the array a.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The first distance is a[0]. So current max_d is max(max_d, a[0]).\n\nThen check the last lantern's position. The last distance is l - a[-1]. current max_d is max(max_d, l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference between a[i+1] and a[i], divide by 2, and compare with current max_d.\n\nThe maximum of all these values is the required d.\n\nYes. That makes sense.\n\nSo let's take the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 15, and the lanterns are at positions 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nFirst, check the first lantern is 0. So first_gap is 0, which doesn't contribute. Then the last lantern is 15, which is l=15. So last_gap is 0. Then the consecutive differences:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. First gap is 2 (distance from 0 to 2). Last gap is 5 -5=0. Then the consecutive difference is 5-2=3 → 1.5. So the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=1, l=10. The lantern is at 0. Then first gap is 0, last gap is 10-0=10. So d is 10. Because the lantern's coverage must reach 10. So the radius must be 10. Because the lantern is at 0, and the coverage is up to 0 +d. So to reach l=10, d must be 10.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=10, lantern at 5. Then first gap is 5, last gap is 5. The max between them is 5. So the required d is 5. Which makes sense because the lantern covers from 0 to 10 (since 5-5=0, 5+5=10).\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 3 and 7. Then the first gap is 3, last gap is 3. The consecutive difference is 4, divided by 2 is 2. So the maximum is 3. So d is 3. But let's see: the coverage for the first lantern is 3-d to 3+d. For d=3, that's 0 to 6. The second lantern covers 7-3=4 to 7+3=10. So between 4 and 6, there's overlap. But the entire street is covered. So yes, correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 0 and 10. Then the first gap is 0, last gap is 0. The consecutive difference is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So d=5. Which covers the entire street.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo now, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first element. The first gap is a[0] - 0. So max_d = max(max_d, a[0]).\n\nCheck the last element. The last gap is l - a[-1]. max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for i from 0 to n-2:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif current_required > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nFinally, output max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if n=0? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1. Because the input constraints say 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. So no problem.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nCompute max_d as 0.0.\n\nCheck first lantern's position: a[0]. The first gap is a[0] - 0. So max_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nCheck last lantern's position: l - a[-1]. max_d = max( max_d, l - a[-1] )\n\nThen loop through the sorted array, for each consecutive pair, compute the difference, divide by 2, compare to max_d.\n\nSo code in Python:\n\nRead input. For example, in the first sample input, the first line is '7 15', then the next line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nBut in Python, the input may be read via input().split().\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So for example:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\nThen compute the max_d as described.\n\nBut for the first and last elements, the code needs to check:\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif a[0] > max_d:\n\n    max_d = a[0]\n\nif (l - a[-1]) > max_d:\n\n    max_d = l - a[-1]\n\nThen for the consecutive elements:\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nThen print the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the first lantern is 0, so the first gap is 0. So the max_d is 0. Then the last gap is 15 -15 =0. Then the consecutive gaps are checked. So the maximum is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example, the second sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. After sorting, [2,5].\n\nFirst gap is 2.0. So max_d is 2.0. Last gap is 5-5=0. Then between 2 and 5, the gap is 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max is 2.0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the lanterns are not in order? Like the first sample input. The code sorts them, so that's handled.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple lanterns at the same position. For example, n=3, l=10, and a = [0,0,10]. Then sorted is [0,0,10]. The first gap is 0. The last gap is 0. The consecutive gaps are 0 (between first two 0s) and 10 (between 0 and 10). The max between 0 and 10/2=5. So the max_d is 5. Which is correct. Because the first two lanterns are at 0, so their coverage would cover up to 0 +d. The third lantern is at 10, so coverage is 10 -d to 10 +d. But since l=10, the coverage for the third lantern is up to 10. So the middle part between 0 and 10 is covered by the first and third lanterns. The maximum gap between the first and third is 10, so the required d is 5. So that's correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the gaps between consecutive are 5 and 5. Each divided by 2 is 2.5. The first and last gaps are zero. So the max is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead a list, sort it.\n\nCompute max_d.\n\nNow, for the first and last parts.\n\nBut wait, in the case when n=1, the code checks the first and last (same element). So for example, if a has one element, say 5, l=10. Then first gap is 5, last gap is 5. So the max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# first lantern\nif a[0] > max_d:\n    max_d = a[0]\n\n# last lantern\nif (l - a[-1]) > max_d:\n    max_d = l - a[-1]\n\n# check between lanterns\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in Python, when you print, how to format it with 10 decimal digits. For example, in the first sample, the output is 2.5000000000. So using the format string with .10f would do that.\n\nBut what about when the value is an integer, like 2.0? It would print as 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nAfter processing, max_d is 2.5. So the code would print 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2: max_d is 2.0 → 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the max_d is something like 2.5, but due to floating point precision, it's stored as something like 2.5000000000000001? Well, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-9. So using floating point division and calculations should be okay.\n\nBut in Python, when using floating point numbers, there could be precision issues. However, since all the operations are done with integers (the gaps are integers, divided by 2.0), so for example, if the gap is even, then it's exact. If it's odd, then it's a .5 value. So in Python, when you divide by 2.0, it's represented exactly as a float. For example, 3/2.0 is 1.5, which is exactly representable. So for the cases where the maximum is a .5 value, it's okay.\n\nBut for the first and last parts, the values are integers. So the max_d is either an integer or a .5 value. So when printed with 10 decimals, it's okay.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d starts as 0.0.\n\nFirst lantern is 0 → max_d is 0.0.\n\nLast lantern is 15. l - a[-1] is 0. So max_d remains 0.0.\n\nThen checking between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 =3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5 → max_d is 2.5.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nSo the max_d is 2.5 → output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d starts as 2.0 (a[0] is 2). Then l -a[-1] is 5-5=0 → no change.\n\nBetween the two lanterns, 5-2=3 → 1.5. So max_d is 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the first gap is 5, last gap is 5. So max_d is 5.0. Output is 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. The first gap is 0, last gap is 0. Between them, 10-0=10 → divided by 2 is 5.0. So output 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. The max between consecutive is 5/2=2.5. The first and last gaps are 0 and 0. So output is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[2, 3]. The first gap is 2, last gap is 5-3=2. Between them, 1 → 0.5. So max_d is 2.0. So output 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers. So the code is for a single test case. The sample input shows two examples, but perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case per run. So the code is correct as written.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead n and l, then the list of a_i, sort, compute the max_d as discussed, then print with 10 decimals.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, when reading input, sometimes there are leading or trailing spaces, but the code uses split(), which handles that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which is read as first line '7 15', then next line '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif a[0] > max_d:\n    max_d = a[0]\n\nif (l - a[-1]) > max_d:\n    max_d = l - a[-1]\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1? Then the for loop is skipped. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Python, when you have a list with one element, the for loop runs for n-1=0 times. So no problem.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d is 0.0, then a[0] is 0 → no change. Then l - a[-1] is 0. So no change. Then the for loop runs for 6 iterations. The maximum gap is 14-9=5 → 5/2=2.5. So the code outputs 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d starts as 2.0. Then l -a[-1] is 0. Then the for loop runs once, gap is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So max_d remains 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, l=10, a=[5]. The code computes max_d as 5.0 (from a[0] and l -a[-1] is 5). So output is 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0,0,10]. The first gap is 0, last gap is 0. Between the first two 0's, gap is 0. Between 0 and 10, gap is 10. So current is 5.0. So the max_d is 5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can light up a distance `d` from its position. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street to find the maximum distance that needs to be covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are critical as they determine the minimum radius needed to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Calculate Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum radius required to cover these gaps is half the size of the largest gap, as the lanterns need to cover the midpoint of each gap.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# Check the first lantern's distance from the start\nif a[0] > max_d:\n    max_d = a[0]\n\n# Check the last lantern's distance from the end\nif (l - a[-1]) > max_d:\n    max_d = l - a[-1]\n\n# Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\nfor i in range(n - 1):\n    gap = a[i + 1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Endpoint Checks**: The first lantern's position relative to the start of the street and the last lantern's position relative to the end of the street are checked to ensure these endpoints are illuminated.\n3. **Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted positions of the lanterns, we compute the gaps between each consecutive pair. The maximum radius required to cover these gaps is half the size of the largest gap, ensuring that the entire street is illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum radius required by considering both the gaps between lanterns and the endpoints of the street, ensuring optimal coverage with minimal radius. The complexity of the solution is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), making it efficient even for the upper constraint of n = 1000.",
