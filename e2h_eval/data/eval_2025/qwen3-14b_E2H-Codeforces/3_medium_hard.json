Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required radius based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the radius needs to cover that gap. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have two adjacent lanterns. Let's say they are at positions x and y, where x < y. The area between them that isn't covered by either lantern would be the middle part. Wait, no. Each lantern covers up to d distance. So for the two lanterns, the coverage would be from x-d to x+d and y-d to y+d. But since they are adjacent, the distance between them is y - x. To ensure that there's no gap between their coverage, the distance between them must be such that the coverage of the first reaches up to the coverage of the second. So the maximum distance between two consecutive lanterns is important here.\n\nWait, but the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns (after sorting) would determine the minimal d. For example, if two lanterns are s units apart, then the minimal d needed to cover that gap is s/2. Because each lantern can cover half of the gap. Like, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then each needs to cover 2 units. So the radius would be 2. But if the gap is larger than that, then the radius would have to be larger. \n\nBut wait, what if the gap is between the start of the street and the first lantern, or between the last lantern and the end of the street? Those also need to be considered. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The radius must cover that. So the required d would be a1. Similarly for the end of the street. \n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance between the start (0) and the first lantern. That's a candidate for max_d.\n3. Check the distance between the last lantern and the end (l). Another candidate.\n4. Then check all consecutive pairs in the sorted array. For each pair, compute the distance between them. The required d for that pair is (distance)/2. Because each lantern can cover half of the gap. So the maximum of these values would be the required d.\n5. The overall answer is the maximum between the first part (start to first lantern), the last part (last lantern to end), and the max of the consecutive pairs' (distance/2).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if the lanterns are arranged such that the largest gap between them is s, then the minimal d needed is s/2. But also, the ends need to be checked. For example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to 3 is 3. So the radius must be at least 3. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Sort the array of ai's.\n- Compute the initial max_d as the maximum between the first lantern's position and (l - last lantern's position).\n- Then iterate through the sorted array, compute the differences between consecutive elements. For each difference, compute half of it. Take the maximum of these values.\n- The final answer is the maximum between the initial max_d and this new maximum.\n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the street is length 15, and the lanterns are at 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15. Then the sorted array is [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nThe first part: the first lantern is at 0, so the distance from 0 to 0 is zero. The last lantern is at 15, so the distance from 15 to 15 is zero. So the initial max_d is zero. Then the consecutive differences are 3-0=3, 5-3=2, 7-5=2, 9-7=2, 14-9=5, 15-14=1. The maximum of these is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which matches the first sample input.\n\nAnother example is the second sample input: n=2, l=5, positions 2 and 5. The sorted array is [2,5]. The first part is 2 (distance from 0 to 2), and the last part is 0 (since 5 is at the end). Then the consecutive difference is 5-2=3. Divided by 2 gives 1.5. So the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array. Then check the first and last positions. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases. What if there is only one lantern? For example, n=1, l=10, and the lantern is at 5. Then the max_d is max(5, 5) which is 5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct because the lantern covers from 0 to 10 (radius 5). \n\nAnother case: n=1, lantern at 0. Then the max_d is max(0, l -0) = l. So the answer is l. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are not sorted. So we need to sort them first.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of ai.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_diff = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_required = current_diff / 2\n\nif this is larger than the current max_d, update.\n\nAt the end, the answer is max_d.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the initial max_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0. Then the max of the consecutive differences is 5 (from 9 to 14). 5/2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nRead list of ai.\n\nSort ai.\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n ==0? Well, according to input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo:\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nthen for i in 1 to n-1:\n\ndiff = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent = diff / 2.0\n\nif current > max_d:\n\n   max_d = current\n\nThen output max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nYes. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street? Like, for example, if there's a gap between two lanterns that's larger than the max_d calculated. But no, because the code checks the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. For example, if two lanterns are 6 units apart, then the required d is 3. So the code would capture that.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nIn Python, read the input. For example, the first input line is '7 15', then the next line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nWe need to read n and l, then the list of ai.\n\nThen sort the list.\n\nThen compute the initial max_d.\n\nBut wait, the first lantern's position is a[0], but the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0], but if a[0] is 0, then that distance is 0. So the initial max_d is max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nBut for example, if the first lantern is at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 0. So the required d for that part is 0. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of ai.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen loop through the sorted list, checking consecutive differences.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    diff = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = diff / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first example:\n\nInput is 7 15, and the lanterns are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, the list is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The initial max_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0. Then the consecutive differences are 3-0=3 → 1.5, then 5-3=2 → 1.0, then 7-5=2 → 1.0, 9-7=2 → 1.0, 14-9=5 → 2.5, 15-14=1 → 0.5. So the max_d becomes 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nThe second sample input: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. initial max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then the difference between 5-2=3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d remains 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then initial max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. Then no other steps. Output 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then initial max_d is max(0, 5-5=0) → 0. Then the difference between 5-0=5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct, since the lanterns are at 0 and 5. Each covers up to 2.5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nBut what if the lanterns are at 0 and 3, and l=5. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 5-3=2). Then the consecutive difference is 3-0=3 → 1.5. So the max is 2. So the answer is 2. Which is correct. Because the lantern at 3 covers up to 3 + 2 =5. So the end of the street is covered. The first lantern covers from 0-2 (but the start is 0, so that's okay). The gap between 0 and 3 is covered with d=1.5. But the end requires d=2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple lanterns at the same position? Like, n=3, l=10, a=[0,0,10]. Then sorted list is [0,0,10]. The initial max_d is max(0, 10-10=0). Then check consecutive differences: 0-0=0 → 0. Then 10-0=10 → 5. So the max_d is 5. Which is correct. Because the lanterns at 0 and 10. The middle part between 0 and 10 is covered by 5. So the radius is 5. The first part is 0, the end is 0. So the answer is 5.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 10-10=0). The consecutive differences are 5-0=5 → 2.5, and 10-5=5 → 2.5. So max_d is 2.5. Which is correct. The radius is 2.5. The street is covered from 0 to 5+2.5=7.5? Wait, no. Wait, the lanterns are at 0, 5, 10. Each has radius 2.5. So the first lantern covers from 0-2.5 to 0+2.5 → -2.5 to 2.5. But since the street starts at 0, it covers 0 to 2.5. The second lantern covers 5-2.5=2.5 to 5+2.5=7.5. The third covers 7.5 to 10+2.5=12.5. But the street ends at 10. So the entire street is covered. So yes, 2.5 is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the code reads the input, sorts the list, computes the initial max_d, then loops through the sorted list. Then prints the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you print using format, how to make sure that it's printed with 10 decimal digits. For example, in the sample input, the first output is 2.5, which is printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSo the code uses the format string with .10f. That should be correct.\n\nBut what about when the answer is an integer? For example, in the second sample, the answer is 2.0. So the code would print 2.0000000000, which is correct.\n\nNow, what about floating point precision? Since the problem allows absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, using floating point calculations in Python (which uses double-precision) should be sufficient.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, testing the code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted becomes [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen check the differences between consecutive elements:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → now max_d is 2.5.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nSo output is 2.5 → correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.\n\nCheck 5-2=3 → 1.5. So max_d remains 2. Output 2.0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Output is 5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0,0,10]. Output is 5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Output is 2.5.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNeed to read input. But note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Wait, the input given in the example is two separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... \n\nThe next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the input is for one test case. But in the example given, the user provided two inputs, but perhaps that's for two separate test cases. However, the code needs to process one test case per run. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows two examples. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per one test case. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. But the actual code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nFirst line contains n and l.\n\nNext line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. But in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich seems to be two test cases. But perhaps the user is showing two separate examples, but the code is supposed to read one test case. So the code should read from stdin, which for the problem would be one test case. So the code is correct as written.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement that in Python.\n\nBut in Python, when reading from stdin, sometimes there are multiple lines. So for example, the code reads the first line as n and l, then the next line as the list of ai.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        diff = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = diff / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if the input is something like:\n\nn=1, l=0? No, according to the problem statement, l is at least 1.\n\nBut according to input constraints, l is 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nAnother thing: when n is 1, the code checks a[0], which is the only element. Then l - a[-1] is l - a[0]. So the code computes max(a[0], l - a[0]). Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the code with the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → after sorting [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0. Then the loop checks the differences between consecutive elements.\n\nThe maximum of the differences is 5 (between 9 and 14), which divided by 2 is 2.5. So output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]. max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then the difference between 5-2=3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d remains 2. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can light up a segment of length `2d` around its position. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking consecutive gaps.\n2. **Check Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius.\n3. **Check Consecutive Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The minimum radius required to cover this gap is half the size of the gap, as each lantern can cover half the gap on either side.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required minimum radius is the maximum value among the distances calculated from the ends of the street and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        diff = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = diff / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of lanterns) and `l` (length of the street), followed by a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking consecutive gaps.\n3. **Initial Maximum Distance**: The initial maximum distance is determined by considering the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Consecutive Gaps Check**: By iterating through the sorted list of lantern positions, we check each gap between consecutive lanterns. The maximum gap determines the minimum radius required to ensure coverage between those two lanterns.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required by focusing on critical points where coverage might be insufficient, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
