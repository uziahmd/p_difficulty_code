Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So a standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time.\n\nHmm. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe there's a way to optimize based on that. Let me think. For each weight category, we can sort the items in descending order of cost per unit weight. Then, for each weight type, we can take as many as possible of the highest value items first.\n\nBut how do we combine these? Because taking some items of weight 1, 2, or 3 might have different trade-offs. For example, maybe taking a few weight 3 items gives more value than taking multiple weight 1 or 2 items.\n\nWait, but since the weights are small, perhaps we can handle each weight group separately. Let me think about grouping all items by their weight. For example, group all weight 1 items, sort them in descending order of cost. Same for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce sorted, for each group, we can precompute prefix sums. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each group, we can compute the total weight and value. However, since the total weight is m, we need to find the combination that gives maximum value.\n\nBut even with that, trying all combinations would be too slow. So maybe there's a way to iterate through possible numbers of weight 3 items and then compute the optimal for the remaining weight using weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the weight is up to 3, maybe we can model it with dynamic programming but optimized for the small weights.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that for each weight group, we can take as many as possible of the highest value items. But since the problem is similar to the unbounded knapsack but with items of limited counts (each item is unique, so it's 0-1 knapsack), but with the weight being only 1, 2, 3. However, even with that, for n=1e5, we can't do a standard DP.\n\nAnother approach: since the weight is limited to 3, maybe we can process each group (weight 1, 2, 3) and for each, take the top k items. Then, for each possible number of weight 3 items, we can compute the best way to fill the remaining weight with weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFirst, group all items by their weight. For each group, sort them in descending order of cost. Then compute prefix sums for each group.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, we have a list sorted in descending order. The prefix sum array would allow us to know the maximum value if we take the first k items. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nNow, the main idea is to try all possible numbers of weight 3 items, and for each possible number, compute the optimal selection of weight 1 and 2 items for the remaining weight.\n\nBut how do we efficiently compute the optimal selection for weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nLet's think about the weight 1 and 2 items. For a given remaining weight W, how can we choose the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nThis seems like a classic problem. Let's say we have two groups: weight 1 and weight 2. For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (say, x), we can take up to (W - 2x) weight 1 items. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking the first (W - 2x) of them would give maximum value. However, trying all x for each W could be expensive.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute their prefix sums. Then, for any given remaining capacity, we can find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: Suppose we have a total capacity of X. We can take some number of weight 2 items (say, a) and some number of weight 1 items (say, b), such that 2a + b ≤ X. The goal is to maximize the sum of their values.\n\nBut since the weight 2 items are sorted, and the weight 1 items are sorted, we can precompute prefix sums for both.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nsum_1[k] = sum of the first k weight 1 items.\n\nsum_2[k] = sum of the first k weight 2 items.\n\nFor a given X, the maximum value is max over a (from 0 to min(k2, X//2)) of (sum_2[a] + sum_1[ min( (X - 2*a), len_1 ) ] )\n\nBut for each X, iterating through all possible a would be O(X), which could be up to 3e5. If we have to do this for each possible number of weight 3 items, that would be O(m * X), which may be too slow.\n\nBut maybe we can find a way to compute this maximum quickly.\n\nLet me think of X as fixed. Let's say that we have a maximum number of weight 2 items possible, say, a_max = min( len_2, X // 2 ). For each a from 0 to a_max, the corresponding b is X - 2a. However, since we can take at most len_1 items of weight 1, the actual number of items is min(b, len_1). So the total value is sum_2[a] + sum_1[ min(b, len_1) ].\n\nBut how can we find the maximum of this over all a in [0, a_max]?\n\nThe key observation here is that for each a, the value is sum_2[a] plus sum_1[ min( X - 2a, len_1 ) ].\n\nBut since sum_1 is non-decreasing, and sum_2 is also non-decreasing, perhaps there's a way to find the optimal a quickly.\n\nAlternatively, since for a given X, the optimal a is somewhere around X//2, but not sure.\n\nBut if we can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2, then for each X, we can compute the maximum value in O(1) or O(sqrt(X)) time.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each X, we can compute the maximum possible by considering that for the weight 2 items, the optimal number of items a is either up to the maximum possible, or up to the maximum possible that allows some weight 1 items. Maybe we can find the optimal a by considering that when you increase a by 1, you lose 2 units of weight, which could be replaced by two weight 1 items (if available).\n\nBut how to find the optimal a?\n\nAnother approach: For a given X, the maximum value can be found by considering all possible a in the range [max(0, a_max - K), a_max], where K is a small number (like 1000), and then pick the best among those. However, this would depend on the data.\n\nAlternatively, for each X, we can note that the optimal a is either floor((X - k)/2) for some k. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, perhaps the best way to take items is to take as many as possible of the higher value items. But combining the two types complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: for each possible number of weight 2 items (a), the maximum number of weight 1 items is (X - 2a). But since the sum_1 is the sum of the first (X - 2a) items (if possible), the total is sum_2[a] + sum_1[ min( (X - 2a), len_1 ) ].\n\nBut how to find the maximum over a?\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(a) = sum_2[a] + sum_1[ min( (X - 2a), len_1 ) ].\n\nWe can note that for a in 0 to a_max, this function may have a single peak. So perhaps we can use ternary search to find the maximum.\n\nBut for ternary search, the function must be unimodal. Is that the case here?\n\nNot sure. Let's imagine that when a increases by 1, 2a increases by 2. So X - 2a decreases by 2. So the sum_1 part would decrease by the value of the next item (if X - 2a was large enough). But sum_2 increases by the next item's value. So the function may have a single peak. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each X, the optimal a is around (X - s)/2, where s is the number of weight 1 items taken. But this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, for each X, we can compute the maximum between two possibilities: take as many weight 2 items as possible, or take as many weight 1 items as possible, and check a few nearby values.\n\nBut perhaps the following approach would work:\n\nFor each X, the optimal a is in the range [max(0, a_max - K), a_max], where K is a small number (like 1000). Since the sum_2 and sum_1 are sorted, the maximum value would be achieved when a is around the point where the marginal gain of adding another weight 2 item is higher than the loss of losing two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to determine K? Well, since the weight of each item is 1 or 2, and the sum_1 is sorted, the difference between taking a weight 2 item and two weight 1 items depends on their values. However, if K is set to something like 3000, then even for X up to 3e5, checking 3000 possibilities per X would be manageable.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the X comes from the remaining weight after choosing some weight 3 items. So for each possible number of weight 3 items, say, t, we compute X = m - 3*t. Then, for that X, we need to compute the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nSo the overall plan would be:\n\n1. Group the items into three lists: w1, w2, w3. Sort each list in descending order of cost.\n\n2. Compute prefix sums for each list. For example, prefix1[i] is the sum of the first i items in w1.\n\n3. For each possible number of weight 3 items taken (t), which can be from 0 to min( len3, m//3 ), compute the maximum possible value for the remaining weight (m - 3*t) using the weight 1 and 2 items.\n\n4. The maximum over all t would be the answer.\n\nBut how to compute step 3 efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible t values. Since len3 can be up to 1e5, and m is up to 3e5, the maximum possible t is up to 1e5 (if all items are weight 3 and m is 3e5). So for each t, we need to process O(1) or O(some small number) steps.\n\nNow, for each t, the remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*t. We need to find the best way to take weight 1 and 2 items with total weight ≤ rem.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly?\n\nLet me think again about the weight 1 and 2 items. For rem, the maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is a_max = min( len2, rem // 2 ). But even if we take a_max weight 2 items, we can take up to (rem - 2*a_max) weight 1 items. However, perhaps there's a better combination.\n\nBut if I can find the optimal a for this rem, then I can calculate the value.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute for the weight 1 and 2 items, for all possible capacities up to m. But since m can be 3e5, and for each possible capacity, this would be O(m) time. However, with the weight being 1 and 2, maybe there's a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, but for the weight 1 and 2 items, the problem is similar to the classic knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2. However, since the items are sorted, and we can take any subset (but each item can be taken once), perhaps we can find a way to compute the optimal value for each possible capacity.\n\nBut for the general case, that's not straightforward. However, given that the items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each capacity the optimal selection.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, since they are sorted, the optimal strategy is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. So for example, for a given capacity, take as many of the highest value weight 2 items as possible, and then fill the rest with weight 1 items. But this might not always be optimal. For example, if taking one less weight 2 item allows taking two weight 1 items with higher total value.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps there's a way to find the optimal selection by considering the best between taking some number of weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\nFor a given rem, the maximum possible number of weight 2 items is a_max = min(len2, rem // 2). Let's say we take a from 0 to a_max. For each a, the remaining weight is rem - 2*a. Then, the number of weight 1 items we can take is min(rem - 2*a, len1). The total value is sum_2[a] + sum_1[min(rem - 2*a, len1)].\n\nSo for each rem, the optimal value is the maximum of this expression over all a in 0..a_max.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly?\n\nIf a_max is up to 1e5, and for each t (up to 1e5), then the total time would be O(1e10), which is way too slow.\n\nTherefore, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nWe need a better way.\n\nAlternative idea: since the weight of the items is small, maybe we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value for weight 1 and 2 items. But how?\n\nLet me think about the weight 1 and 2 items. Let's consider that the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, and same for weight 2. Then, for a given capacity, the optimal selection is to take as many as possible of the highest value items.\n\nBut how to model this? For example, for a capacity of X, the optimal is to take some number of weight 2 items and some number of weight 1 items. However, the optimal choice between these two is not obvious.\n\nBut here's an idea: for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, the maximum possible number of weight 1 items. However, this seems similar to what we discussed before.\n\nBut perhaps we can find that for the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal way to fill a capacity X is to take as many of the highest value items as possible, regardless of their weight. But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can merge the two lists into a single list sorted by value per unit weight. However, since the items are of different weights, this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, think of the weight 1 and 2 items as a combined list of items. But since each item is unique and can't be split, we need to choose a subset.\n\nBut this brings us back to the original problem of 0-1 knapsack with items of weight 1 or 2, which is not efficient for large m.\n\nWait, but for items of weight 1 and 2, there's a way to compute the maximum value using dynamic programming. Let me think.\n\nLet's create a DP array for the weight 1 and 2 items. The DP[i] represents the maximum value achievable with weight i.\n\nInitially, DP[0] = 0.\n\nFor each weight 1 item, we can iterate from m down to 1, and update DP[j] = max(DP[j], DP[j - 1] + value of item).\n\nSimilarly for each weight 2 item, iterate from m down to 2, and update DP[j] = max(DP[j], DP[j - 2] + value of item).\n\nBut with m up to 3e5 and n up to 1e5, this would be O(nm) time, which is not feasible for Python.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the items are grouped into weight 1 and 2. And since they are sorted, perhaps we can optimize the DP.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, since they are sorted in descending order, taking the first k items would give the maximum value for k weight 1 items. Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\nSo for the DP approach, perhaps we can process all weight 1 items first, then all weight 2 items, but in a way that takes advantage of the sorted order.\n\nLet me think about processing the weight 1 items. Since they are sorted, the optimal way to take them is to take as many as possible. So for the DP, after processing all weight 1 items, for each j, DP[j] is the maximum sum of the first k items where k is up to j (since each is weight 1). So for j, DP[j] = sum_1[min(j, len1)].\n\nSimilarly, for the weight 2 items, we can process them in a way that for each j, we can take some number of weight 2 items, but again, since they are sorted, taking the first a items would be optimal.\n\nBut how to combine them?\n\nAlternatively, the DP for weight 1 and 2 items can be computed as follows:\n\nInitialize dp as an array of size (rem + 1), where rem is up to m.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0, and for j > 0, dp[j] = 0.\n\nFor each weight 1 item, we can update dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - 1] + c_i), for j from m down to 1.\n\nBut with len1 up to 1e5, this would be O(1e5 * 3e5) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSame for weight 2 items.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nBack to square one.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think again about the problem. Since the weight of each item is 1, 2, or 3, perhaps we can handle each weight group separately and find an optimal way to combine them.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows:\n\n- For weight 3 items, we can take up to t items, where t is from 0 to min(len3, m // 3).\n\n- For each t, we can take 3*t weight, and the remaining weight is m_rem = m - 3*t.\n\n- Then, for m_rem, we need to find the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nSo the crux is how to compute for m_rem the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the weight 1 and 2 items:\n\nFor each possible m_rem, we can take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill the rest with weight 1 items. But this is not necessarily optimal, but perhaps we can check a few possibilities around this value.\n\nFor example, take the maximum possible a (number of weight 2 items) and then check a-1, a, a+1, etc., up to some limit. Since the number of weight 2 items is limited by m_rem//2, and the number of weight 1 items is limited by m_rem - 2*a, perhaps checking a few values around the maximum a would be sufficient.\n\nBut how many values do we need to check?\n\nLet me think: for a given m_rem, the maximum a is a_max = min(len2, m_rem // 2). Then, for this a_max, the number of weight 1 items is b = m_rem - 2*a_max. However, if there are more weight 1 items available than b, we take b. Otherwise, take all weight 1 items.\n\nBut maybe there's a better a than a_max. For example, if a_max is 5, but taking a=4 allows taking more weight 1 items that have higher total value.\n\nBut how can we find this without checking all possible a?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, and weight 2 items are sorted, perhaps the optimal a is in the vicinity of a_max, or the a that would allow using as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think of this as follows: For a given m_rem, the optimal a is between max(0, a_max - K) and a_max, where K is a small number, say 300. Because if the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, then each subsequent item has lower value than the previous. Similarly for the weight 1 items. So the difference between taking a and a-1 is that we lose the value of the a-th weight 2 item and gain the value of two weight 1 items (if possible). So if the value of the a-th weight 2 item is greater than the sum of two weight 1 items, then it's better to take a. Otherwise, better to take a-1 and take those two weight 1 items.\n\nBut since we don't know what the two weight 1 items are, this is hard to compute. However, if we assume that the best a is either a_max or a_max - 1, or a_max - 2, etc., up to a certain number, then checking those possibilities could suffice.\n\nBut how to determine how many possibilities to check?\n\nLet me think of the worst case. Suppose that the weight 2 items have very high value, but taking one less weight 2 item allows taking two weight 1 items with higher total value. For example, weight 2 item has value 100, and two weight 1 items have total value 200. In this case, taking a_max - 1 would be better.\n\nBut if we check a_max and a_max - 1, then we can find this.\n\nIn general, for each possible a, the difference between taking a and a-1 is the value of the a-th weight 2 item versus the value of two weight 1 items (if there are enough weight 1 items left). So, for each a, the decision depends on this comparison.\n\nBut since we don't know which a is optimal, perhaps we can check all possible a in the range [max(0, a_max - K), a_max], where K is up to 300. This would allow us to find the optimal a in this range.\n\nThe question is, what is a suitable value for K? Well, if K is 300, then for each m_rem, we check 300 possibilities. Since m_rem can be up to 3e5, and the number of t's (for weight 3 items) is up to 1e5, the total number of operations would be 1e5 * 300 = 3e7, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut why would this work?\n\nWell, suppose that the optimal a is within K steps of a_max. Why would that be the case?\n\nBecause, for each a, the value of the a-th weight 2 item is less than or equal to the value of the first a-th weight 2 items. Similarly, the weight 1 items are sorted. So, for example, if taking a_max weight 2 items and some weight 1 items is not optimal, then the next best option is to take a_max - 1 weight 2 items and add two weight 1 items. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, the first two items are the highest value ones. If those two are better than the a_max-th weight 2 item, then we take them. Otherwise, not.\n\nSo, the optimal a is either a_max, a_max - 1, ..., until the point where the value of the a-th weight 2 item is no longer better than the value of the next two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how far could this go? It depends on the data. However, since each weight 2 item has a value that is at least as high as the next ones, and the weight 1 items are sorted, it's possible that the optimal a is within a small number of steps from a_max.\n\nThus, choosing K as 300 (or even 1000) would cover all possible cases where the optimal a is not a_max.\n\nBut how to choose K? Well, given that the constraints for the problem are tight, but given that the time complexity would be acceptable for K=300, we can proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor each t in 0 to max_t:\n\n   rem = m - 3*t\n\n   if rem < 0: skip\n\n   compute the best value for rem using weight 1 and 2 items:\n\n      a_max = min( len2, rem // 2 )\n\n      start = max(0, a_max - 300 )\n\n      best_val = 0\n\n      for a in start ... a_max:\n\n          remaining_weight = rem - 2*a\n\n          b = min( remaining_weight, len1 )\n\n          current_val = sum_2[a] + sum_1[b]\n\n          if current_val > best_val:\n\n              best_val = current_val\n\n      also, check a values from 0 to min(a_max, 300), but maybe that's redundant.\n\n      Also, what about when a is larger than a_max? No, since a_max is the maximum possible.\n\n      So, for each t, we check a_max - 300 to a_max, and take the best among them.\n\nThen, the overall maximum is the maximum between all t's best_val plus the sum of the first t weight 3 items.\n\nBut what about cases where the optimal a is less than a_max - 300? Well, in that case, our approach would miss it. However, given that the weight 2 items are sorted, the value of the a-th item is decreasing. So, for a below a_max - K, the sum_2[a] would be smaller than sum_2[a_max - K], and the remaining_weight would be larger, allowing more weight 1 items. However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, the sum_1[b] would be increasing with remaining_weight. But how to balance these two factors?\n\nBut in practice, this approach may pass all test cases. However, to make it safe, perhaps we should check a few possibilities around a_max, and also around the maximum possible number of weight 1 items.\n\nAlternatively, we can also check the case where we take as many weight 1 items as possible, and then fill the rest with weight 2 items.\n\nBut again, how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, for the same rem, we can also check the maximum possible b (number of weight 1 items) and then take as many weight 2 items as possible for the remaining weight.\n\nBut again, this would require checking a few possibilities.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the initial approach is the best.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that plan.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read n lines of wi and ci.\n\n3. Separate the items into three groups: w1, w2, w3.\n\n4. Sort each group in descending order of ci.\n\n5. Compute prefix sums for each group. For example, prefix1[i] is the sum of the first i items in w1. Similarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n\n   Note: for the prefix sums, we need to handle up to the length of the group. For example, prefix1[0] = 0, prefix1[1] = w1[0], prefix1[2] = w1[0] + w1[1], etc.\n\n6. Now, for each possible t (number of weight 3 items taken):\n\n   a. The maximum possible t is min( len(w3), m // 3 )\n\n   b. For each t, compute the sum of the first t items of w3: sum3 = prefix3[t]\n\n   c. rem = m - 3*t\n\n   d. For rem, compute the best value from w1 and w2 items.\n\n   e. total = sum3 + best_value_from_1_and_2\n\n   f. keep track of the maximum total.\n\nSo, the key part is step d.\n\nImplementing step d:\n\nAs discussed earlier, for rem, compute a_max = min( len2, rem // 2 )\n\nThen, iterate a from max(0, a_max - 300) to a_max, and for each a, compute b = rem - 2*a. Then, take min(b, len1) items from w1, sum them with sum2[a].\n\nTake the maximum of these.\n\nBut what if a_max is less than 300? Then, we start from 0.\n\nBut this would cover all possible a's in that range.\n\nSo, in code, for each rem, we can:\n\ndef get_max_1_2(rem, prefix1, len1, prefix2, len2):\n\n    max_a = min(len2, rem // 2)\n\n    start = max(0, max_a - 300)\n\n    best = 0\n\n    for a in range(start, max_a + 1):\n\n        # compute the remaining weight after taking a weight 2 items\n\n        rem_w = rem - 2*a\n\n        # take min(rem_w, len1) weight 1 items\n\n        b = min(rem_w, len1)\n\n        current = prefix2[a] + prefix1[b]\n\n        if current > best:\n\n            best = current\n\n    return best\n\nBut what if the rem is negative? Well, in that case, the code would not call this function. Because when we choose t, rem is m - 3*t, which can't be negative, since t is chosen up to m//3.\n\nSo, this function should be called only when rem >=0.\n\nNow, the question is: what value of 300 is safe? Well, in the worst case, for example, if the optimal a is a_max - 300, but the code checks only up to a_max - 300, then it will find it. However, if the optimal a is further away, the code would miss it.\n\nBut how to choose this number?\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, for rem=2, the weight 2 items can be taken as 1 item (value 2) or 0 items and take 2 weight 1 items (value 3). So the optimal is 3. The code would check a_max = min(1, 2//2) = 1. So start is max(0, 1 - 300) = 0. So check a=0 and a=1.\n\nAt a=1: rem_w = 2 - 2*1 = 0 → b=0 → sum2[1]=2 + sum1[0] = 0 → total 2.\n\nAt a=0: rem_w=2 → take min(2, len1=1) → 1 → sum2[0] + sum1[1] = 0 + 3 = 3 → best is 3.\n\nThus, it works.\n\nAnother example: if the optimal a is a_max - 301, then the code would miss it. However, given that the weight 2 items are sorted, the value of a_max - 301 would be much less than a_max. For example, taking a_max - 301 items of weight 2 would mean that we are missing 301 items of weight 2. Since each of these items has higher or equal value than the ones after, the sum2[a_max - 301] would be much smaller than sum2[a_max], and the rem_w would be larger. However, the sum1[b] would be larger. But whether this combination is better depends on the data.\n\nBut in practice, given the time constraints, this approach may pass all test cases, especially since the problem is from a competition and the test cases may not be designed to break this approach.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps we can increase the K value. However, what is the maximum possible K that would be needed?\n\nLet me think: suppose that for each a, the value of taking a weight 2 items is worse than taking a-1 weight 2 items and two weight 1 items. Then, the optimal a would be a_max - k, where k is the number of steps until the value of the a-th weight 2 item is less than the sum of two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how many steps could this take?\n\nAssume that each weight 2 item has value less than the sum of two weight 1 items. Then, the optimal a is zero, and take all weight 1 items. So in this case, the code would check from a_max - 300 to a_max. But if a_max is large (say, 1e5), then checking from a_max - 300 to a_max would miss the optimal a=0.\n\nThis would be a problem. Hence, this approach is not correct.\n\nThus, this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think again. For the weight 1 and 2 items, since they are sorted, the optimal solution is to take as many of the highest value items as possible, regardless of their weight. But since items have different weights, how to combine them?\n\nBut since the items are sorted in descending order of their value, perhaps we can merge the two lists into a single list sorted by value, and then take the top items until the weight is filled.\n\nBut this is not exactly correct, because taking a higher-value item with higher weight may not be better than taking several lower-value items with lower total weight.\n\nBut for example, if we have a weight 2 item worth 3, and two weight 1 items worth 2 each, taking the weight 2 item is better (3 vs 4). But if the weight 2 item is worth 2, then taking two weight 1 items is better.\n\nSo merging the items into a single list sorted by value, and then taking as many as possible from the top, while keeping the total weight under the limit.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nThis sounds like the greedy algorithm for the fractional knapsack, but since we can't split items, it's not directly applicable. However, for the 0-1 knapsack, the greedy approach doesn't work, but perhaps for this specific case where items are of weight 1 or 2 and sorted by value, it could be possible to find an optimal solution with some greedy approach.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet me consider that the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, and the weight 2 items are also sorted in descending order. For a given capacity rem, the optimal selection would consist of some number of weight 2 items and some number of weight 1 items. Let's denote that the optimal selection is to take x weight 2 items and y weight 1 items, such that 2x + y <= rem.\n\nTo find x and y, we can think of the following:\n\nThe maximum possible x is min( len2, rem // 2 ). For this x, the y is min( rem - 2x, len1 ). But as discussed earlier, this may not be optimal.\n\nHowever, what if we also consider the case where x is the maximum possible, and also the case where x is the maximum possible minus 1, and compare those two options?\n\nThis would cover the cases where taking one less weight 2 item allows taking more weight 1 items. But this would still miss cases where taking two less weight 2 items allows taking more weight 1 items, but this could be handled by checking a few more possibilities.\n\nBut again, this is not guaranteed to work for all cases.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to proceed with this approach, and see.\n\nLet me try to modify the previous approach. For each rem, compute the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible (a_max), and then fill with weight 1 items.\n\n- Taking a_max - 1 weight 2 items, and fill with weight 1 items.\n\n- Taking a_max - 2 weight 2 items, and fill with weight 1 items.\n\nAnd so on, up to some limit like 300.\n\nBut again, this is similar to the previous approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, compute the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible.\n\n- Taking as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\n- Taking the maximum between these two, and possibly some intermediate values.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, the maximum between the two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Take as many weight 2 items as possible.\n\nScenario 2: Take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nBut what if the optimal is somewhere in between?\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, it's sufficient to consider these two scenarios and a few others.\n\nLet's try this approach.\n\nFor scenario 1: a_max = min(len2, rem // 2",
