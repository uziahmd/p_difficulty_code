Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is to take the first two strings, concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in the concatenated string matches exactly with the count in the third string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to use the Counter class from collections. For example, for the first two lines, combine them into one string, create a Counter. Then create a Counter for the third line. Then compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each character. So if the counts are the same, then it's possible to rearrange the letters.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Create a Counter for this concatenated string.\n4. Create a Counter for the third line.\n5. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length of the first two lines is different from the third line? For example, if the first two lines have a total length of 5, and the third line has 6 letters. Then obviously, it's impossible. So checking the lengths first could be a quick check. But since the Counter will automatically account for that (if the counts are different, the Counters will differ), maybe it's redundant but not harmful.\n\nBut perhaps adding a check for the total length could save some time. For example, if the sum of the lengths of the first two lines is not equal to the length of the third line, then immediately return NO. Otherwise, proceed to check the counts.\n\nYes, that's a good idea. Because if the lengths are different, there's no way the counts can match. So adding that check first can save some processing time.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCheck if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if the combined counts of guest and host match the counts of the pile.\n\nSo how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead three lines. Let's say:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, check if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile): print 'NO'\n\nElse, check the counts.\n\nBut how to check the counts?\n\nWe can use collections.Counter.\n\nSo:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you compare two Counter objects, they are considered equal if they have the same counts for all elements. So that's exactly what we need.\n\nBut what about if there are characters in the pile that are not present in the combined string? For example, if the combined string has 'A' once, but the pile has 'A' twice. Then the Counter would catch that.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        return\n\n    combined = guest + host\n\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, the problem says that all lines are not empty and consist of uppercase letters. So no need to handle empty lines.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is:\n\nInput:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo the combined length of first two is len(\"SANTACLAUS\") + len(\"DEDMOROZ\") ?\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S) ?\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nS (1), A (2), N (3), T (4), A (5), C (6), L (7), A (8), U (9), S (10) → yes, 10 letters.\n\nDEDMOROZ: D E D M O R O Z → 8 letters. So total 18.\n\nThe pile is S",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and the host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Length Check**: First, check if the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, it is immediately impossible to form the names from the pile, so we output \"NO\".\n3. **Character Count Check**: Use a character counter to compare the frequency of each character in the combined names (guest + host) with the frequency of each character in the pile. If both counters match exactly, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure we handle the input correctly.\n- **Length Check**: By comparing the total length of the guest and host names with the length of the pile, we quickly eliminate cases where the number of letters does not match.\n- **Counter Comparison**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile. If these counts match exactly, the pile can be rearranged to form the names; otherwise, it cannot.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the length and character distribution, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
