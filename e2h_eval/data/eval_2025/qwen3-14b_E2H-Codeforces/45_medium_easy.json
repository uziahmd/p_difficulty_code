There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key constraint here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced binary tree. But here, the structure isn't fixed, and we need to arrange the matches in a way that maximizes the number of games for the winner, following the given rule.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: first, he plays against player 2 (so he wins, one game). Then, he plays against player 3. But wait, the rule says that when two players play, their number of previous games can differ by at most one. So for the second game, the winner has already played once, and the opponent (player 3) hasn't played any. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. Hence, the maximum is 2.\n\nBut for n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because in a normal knockout, with 4 players, the winner plays 2 games. But maybe there's a way to arrange it so they play more? But according to the note, for n=4, the maximum is 2. So perhaps the structure of the tournament is constrained by the rule.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible number of games the winner can have, given that each time they play, their opponent must have a number of previous games that's within one of theirs.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each time they play, they must have an opponent who has played either the same number of games as them, or one less. Let's think about how the winner's path could be structured.\n\nFor example, the first game, the winner has 0 games before. The opponent also has 0. Then, after winning, the winner has 1 game. For the next game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, the winner would need to have opponents that have as many games as possible. So maybe each time, the opponent has one less game than the winner. That way, the winner can keep playing.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let's think of the maximum possible games. For the winner to play k games, they need to have opponents in each round. Let's model this as a Fibonacci-like sequence. Because each time, the number of players required to get to that stage depends on previous steps.\n\nLet me think: suppose that to have a player reach k games, the number of players needed is something like the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for example, to have the winner play k games, in the first game, they need one opponent. Then, for the second game, the winner has played once, and the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. But to maximize, maybe the opponent has played 1 game. So that requires that opponent to have had a prior match. So the number of players required for the winner to have k games is the sum of the players required for the previous steps.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a tree where each node represents the number of players needed to allow the winner to have a certain number of games. Let's say f(k) is the minimum number of players required such that the winner can play k games. Then, what is f(k)?\n\nFor the first game, f(1) = 2. Because you need two players.\n\nFor the second game, the winner has to play another game. The opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. But to get to that point, the opponent must have won their previous matches. So for the second game, the winner has played once, and the opponent must have played once as well. Wait, no. Because if the opponent has played once, that means they had to have a prior match. So the total players needed would be f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 2 = 4? But in the example where n=3, the answer is 2. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe my approach is wrong. Let's think again.\n\nThe maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by how many opponents they can face, each time meeting the condition that the difference in previous games is at most one. So, for the winner to play k games, each game must be against someone who has played either the same number of games as them, or one less.\n\nLet me think of the process as building up the number of games. Let's imagine that the winner plays in a way that each time, they face an opponent who has played exactly one less game than them. For example:\n\n- Game 1: the winner has 0 games, opponent has 0. After winning, the winner has 1 game.\n- Game 2: the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. To maximize, the opponent should have played 1 game. So the opponent must have had a prior game. So that requires that the opponent was in a subtree where they had to play 1 game. Therefore, the total number of players required for the winner to reach 2 games is the sum of the players needed for the winner's previous game (which is 2 players) plus the players needed for the opponent's path (which is 2 players?), but maybe that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. To have the winner play k games, they must have played k-1 games before, and then play another game. But for the k-th game, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. To maximize the number of games, we want the opponent to have played k-1 games. But how is that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is equal to the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Or something similar. Because each time, the number of players needed is the sum of the players needed for the previous steps.\n\nLet me look for a pattern.\n\nLet's see for small values:\n\nFor k=1: the winner plays once. So n=2. So f(1)=2.\n\nFor k=2: the winner needs to play two games. How many players are needed? For the first game, 2 players. For the second game, the opponent must have played 1 game. So that requires that the opponent comes from a subtree where they had to play 1 game. So that would require 2 players. But the winner is part of that. So total players is 2 + 2 - 1 = 3? Because the winner is part of both groups. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The initial match between the winner and someone else (so 2 players). Then, the winner needs to play another match. The opponent must have played 1 game. So that opponent must have been in a group that required 2 players. So the total players is 2 (original) + 2 (for the opponent's group) minus 1 (the winner is counted in both groups?) No, because the opponent is a separate player. So the total would be 2 (from the first match) plus 2 (from the opponent's path) minus 1? Not sure.\n\nWait, the winner's first game is against one player. Then, the second game is against someone who has already played once. That someone must have come from a sub-tournament where they played once. Which requires 2 players. So the total number of players needed for the winner to have 2 games is 2 (original) + 2 (opponent's path) - 1 (since the winner is in both groups?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the total players is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because for the winner to have k games, they need to have played k-1 games, and their opponent in the k-th game must have played k-1 games (so that the difference is zero), which requires that opponent to have come from a subtree that allows for k-1 games. Wait, but that seems like it would be f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the winner plays k games. The last game is against an opponent who has played (k-1) games. How did that opponent get to (k-1) games? Well, that opponent must have had a path where they played (k-1) games. So the total number of players required for that is f(k-1). But the winner also had to have played (k-1) games before that. So the winner's path is f(k-1) players. But wait, the winner's path is already accounted for in the f(k-1) players. So perhaps the total is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because the opponent in the k-th game must have played (k-1) games, but that requires that the opponent's path is f(k-1) players. However, the winner's path to get to (k-1) games is f(k-1) players. But that's overlapping. Hmm, this seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the example for k=2. The minimal number of players needed is 3. Because for the winner to play 2 games, the first game is against one player, then the second game is against another player who has played once. How does that happen? The second player must have played once. That requires that they had a prior game. So that's another two players. But wait, that would be 2 (original) + 2 (for the opponent's path) minus 1 (the winner is in both groups?), but that's 3. So f(2) = 3.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3, the winner needs to play 3 games. The third game's opponent must have played 2 games. Which requires that the opponent's path is f(2) = 3 players. And the winner's path to get to 2 games is f(2) = 3 players. So total players is 3 + 3 - 1 = 5? Or is it f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5? Which would make sense. Then, for k=3, f(3) = 5. \n\nLet me check this with the example. If n=5, then the maximum number of games is 3. Let's see. The winner plays 3 games. How?\n\nFirst game: beats player 2. Second game: beats player 3 (who had one game). Third game: beats player 4 (who had two games). Wait, but how does player 4 have two games? That would require that player 4 had to play two games before facing the winner. So the structure would be something like:\n\nRound 1: (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4). Winners are 1 and 3. Then, round 2: 1 vs 3. Winner plays against 5? Wait, but that would be a third game. But in that case, the opponent (player 5) has zero games. So the difference is 2 (the winner has played two games, opponent has zero). That's not allowed. So that's not allowed. So maybe the structure is different. \n\nAlternatively, for n=5, the maximum games is 3. How can that be achieved?\n\nLet me think of the structure as follows:\n\nGame 1: Player 1 vs 2 → 1 wins (1 game)\nGame 2: Player 1 vs 3 → 1 wins (2 games)\nGame 3: Player 1 vs 4 → 1 wins (3 games)\n\nBut for the third game, the opponent (player 4) has 0 games. The difference is 2, which is not allowed. So that's invalid.\n\nSo how can the opponent have played 2 games? Let's think. For the third game, the opponent must have played 2 games. So that opponent must have had two prior wins. So for example, the opponent could be player 5, but that would require that they had two prior wins. So how?\n\nLet me imagine:\n\nFirst, player 1 plays against player 2. He wins. (1 game)\nThen, player 1 plays against player 3. He wins. (2 games)\nNow, for the third game, the opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. Suppose the opponent is player 4, who has played 1 game. How can he have played 1 game? That would require that he had a prior match. So, maybe in the first round, player 4 plays against player 5, and wins. Then, in the second round, player 1 plays against player 4. But then, player 1 has played 1 game (after first round), and player 4 has played 1 game. So that's allowed. Then, after that, player 1 has 2 games. Now, to play a third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. Suppose there's another player who has played 2 games. How?\n\nBut in this case, there's only 5 players. Let me try to build the structure:\n\nPlayers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nRound 1:\nMatch 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins (1 game)\nMatch 2: 3 vs 4 → 3 wins (1 game)\nMatch 3: 5 vs ...? Wait, there are 5 players. So in the first round, there are 2 matches (with 4 players) and one player left. But that's not possible in a knockout tournament. Wait, but the tournament is arranged in a way that allows for the rules. So maybe the initial matches are arranged in a way that not all players are in the same round.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tournament is structured in a way that some players have to wait. For example, for n=5, the first round could have some byes. But the problem says that the tournament is knockout from the first game. So every player must play until they lose.\n\nBut perhaps the structure is not a balanced binary tree. So for n=5, the minimal number of players required to have the winner play 3 games is 5. So according to the earlier hypothesis, f(3) = 5. So for n=5, the answer is 3.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the structure as follows:\n\nThe winner needs to have 3 games. So the first game is against someone, then the second game against someone who has played one game, then the third game against someone who has played two games.\n\nTo get that, the structure would be:\n\nFirst, the winner plays against player A (game 1). Then, the winner plays against player B, who has played one game (so B had to win one game before). Then, the winner plays against player C, who has played two games (so C had to win two games before).\n\nSo, for player B, he must have had one game. That requires that he had a prior match. Similarly, player C must have had two games, which requires that he had two prior matches.\n\nSo the total number of players required for the winner's path is:\n\nFor the first game: 1 player (A).\n\nFor the second game: player B's path requires 2 players (B and another).\n\nFor the third game: player C's path requires 3 players (since to have two games, it's f(2) = 3 players).\n\nBut then, the total players would be 1 (for A) + 2 (for B) + 3 (for C) ?\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Because the winner is part of these groups. Maybe the formula is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let's see:\n\nf(1) = 2\n\nf(2) = 3\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nf(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nf(5) = 8 +5 = 13, etc.\n\nThis looks like the Fibonacci sequence. So the minimal number of players required to have the winner play k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Wait, because:\n\nIf we consider the Fibonacci numbers starting with F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, F(4) = 3, F(5) = 5, etc. Then:\n\nf(1) = 2 = F(3) + something? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the f(k) sequence:\n\nk | f(k)\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 5\n4 | 8\n5 | 13\n\nWhich is the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(3) = 2, F(4) = 3, F(5) = 5, etc. So f(k) = Fib(k+2), assuming Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, etc.\n\nSo for example, f(1) = Fib(3) = 2, f(2)=Fib(4)=3, f(3)=Fib(5)=5, f(4)=Fib(6)=8, etc. \n\nSo the idea is that for the maximum number of games k, the minimal number of players needed is Fib(k+2). So given n, we need to find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤ n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest k where Fib(k+2) ≤ n. \n\nLet me test this with the examples:\n\nSample input 2: n=3. What is the maximum k? Fib(k+2) ≤3.\n\nFib(3) = 2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5. So for k=2, Fib(2+2)=Fib(4)=3 ≤3. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample input 4: n=4. Fib(5)=5>4. So the maximum k is such that Fib(k+2) ≤4. Fib(4)=3 ≤4, Fib(5)=5>4. So k+2=4 → k=2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nAnother example: n=5. Fib(5)=5, so k+2=5 →k=3. So the answer is 3. \n\nWhat about n=8? Then Fib(6)=8, so k=4. So answer is 4.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the point where they exceed 1e18, then for a given n, perform a binary search on the list to find the maximum k.\n\nSo first, generate all Fib numbers up to 1e18. Let's see how many terms that would take.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially. Let's compute the terms:\n\nFib(1) = 1\n\nFib(2) = 1\n\nFib(3) = 2\n\nFib(4) = 3\n\nFib(5) = 5\n\nFib(6) = 8\n\nFib(7) = 13\n\nFib(8) = 21\n\nFib(9) = 34\n\nFib(10) = 55\n\n...\n\nEach term is roughly 1.6 times the previous. So for Fib(80), it's going to be around 2^80 / sqrt(5) (approximate formula). Since 2^60 is about 1e18, so Fib(80) is way larger than 1e18. So the number of terms needed is about 80 or so. So precomputing them is feasible.\n\nOnce we have the list of Fib numbers, for a given n, we can find the largest Fib number that is <=n, then subtract 2 from its index to get k.\n\nWait, for example, Fib(4) =3. For n=3, the Fib number is Fib(4) =3. Then k is 4-2=2.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n- Precompute Fib numbers until they exceed 1e18.\n\n- For a given n, find the maximum m such that Fib(m) ≤n.\n\n- The answer is m-2.\n\nBut wait, what if n is not exactly a Fib number?\n\nFor example, n=4. The largest Fib number <=4 is Fib(4)=3 (since Fib(5)=5>4). Then m=4, answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6. The Fib numbers are 1,1,2,3,5,8... So the largest Fib <=6 is 5 (m=5). Answer is 5-2=3. Let's see: can the winner have 3 games? For that, Fib(5)=5 ≤6. So yes. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the list of Fib numbers (starting from Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, etc.)\n\n- For the input n, find the maximum m where Fib(m) ≤n.\n\n- The answer is m-2.\n\nBut wait, what if n is less than Fib(3)=2? For example, n=1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 2.\n\nSo for n=2, Fib(3)=2. m=3, answer 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nGenerate the Fib numbers up to 1e18.\n\nFor example:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nthen while the next term is <= 1e18:\n\nfib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])\n\nOnce we have this list, for a given n, find the largest m such that fib[m] <=n.\n\nBut the indexes here are 0-based or 1-based?\n\nLet me think: let's generate the list as follows:\n\nfib = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...]\n\nSo for Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc. So the index in the list is i, and Fib(i+1) is the value.\n\nWait, for example, the list starts as:\n\nindex 0: 1 (Fib(1))\n\nindex 1: 1 (Fib(2))\n\nindex 2: 2 (Fib(3))\n\nindex 3: 3 (Fib(4))\n\nindex 4: 5 (Fib(5))\n\nSo for a given Fib(m), the index is m-1.\n\nSo, for example, Fib(4) is 3, which is at index 3.\n\nSo for a given n, find the largest m such that Fib(m) <=n. Then answer is m-2.\n\nBut how to find m?\n\nWe can loop through the list until we find the first Fib number that exceeds n, then take the previous one.\n\nBut since the list is small (say, up to 90 elements), even a linear search is acceptable.\n\nSo the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nprecompute the fib list.\n\nfind the largest m where Fib(m) <=n.\n\nthe answer is m-2.\n\nBut let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 2: n=3.\n\nfib list is [1,1,2,3,5,...]\n\nthe Fib(m) values are 1,1,2,3,5...\n\nfor n=3, the largest m is 4 (since Fib(4)=3). answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample input 4: n=4. The largest Fib(m) is 3 (m=4). answer 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample input 10: output is 4.\n\nLet's see. For n=10, the Fib numbers are 1,1,2,3,5,8,13...\n\nthe largest Fib(m) <=10 is 8 (m=6). answer is 6-2=4. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=5. answer is 3 (m=5, Fib(5)=5. 5-2=3).\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nGenerate the list of Fib numbers, then find the maximum m such that Fib(m) <=n.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the Fib list generation.\n\nLet's code:\n\nInitialize a list, say fibs = [1, 1]\n\nthen while the next number is <= 1e18:\n\nnext_num = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\nappend to fibs.\n\nOnce generated, for input n, iterate through the list to find the maximum m.\n\nBut since the list is in order, we can do a binary search.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the list is small. Let's generate it.\n\nLet me compute how many elements there are:\n\nLet me compute Fib numbers until they exceed 1e18.\n\nLet me start:\n\nFib(1) = 1\n\nFib(2) = 1\n\nFib(3) = 2\n\nFib(4) = 3\n\nFib(5) = 5\n\nFib(6) = 8\n\nFib(7) = 13\n\nFib(8) = 21\n\nFib(9) = 34\n\nFib(10) = 55\n\nFib(11) = 89\n\nFib(12) = 144\n\nFib(13) = 233\n\nFib(14) = 377\n\nFib(15) = 610\n\nFib(16) = 987\n\nFib(17) = 1597\n\nFib(18) = 2584\n\nFib(19) = 4181\n\nFib(20) = 6765\n\nFib(21) = 10946\n\nFib(22) = 17711\n\nFib(23) = 28657\n\nFib(24) = 46368\n\nFib(25) = 75025\n\nFib(26) = 121393\n\nFib(27) = 196418\n\nFib(28) = 317811\n\nFib(29) = 514229\n\nFib(30) = 832040\n\nFib(31) = 1,346,269\n\nFib(32) = 2,178,309\n\nFib(33) = 3,524,578\n\nFib(34) = 5,702,887\n\nFib(35) = 9,227,465\n\nFib(36) = 14,930,352\n\nFib(37) = 24,157,817\n\nFib(38) = 39,088,169\n\nFib(39) = 63,245,986\n\nFib(40) = 102,334,155\n\nFib(41) = 165,580,141\n\nFib(42) = 267,914,296\n\nFib(43) = 433,494,437\n\nFib(44) = 701,408,733\n\nFib(45) = 1,134,903,170\n\nFib(46) = 1,836,311,903\n\nFib(47) = 2,971,215,073\n\nFib(48) = 4,807,526,976\n\nFib(49) = 7,778,742,049\n\nFib(50) = 12,586,269,025\n\nFib(51) = 20,365,011,074\n\nFib(52) = 32,951,280,099\n\nFib(53) = 53,316,291,173\n\nFib(54) = 86,267,571,272\n\nFib(55) = 139,583,862,445\n\nFib(56) = 225,851,433,717\n\nFib(57) = 365,435,296,162\n\nFib(58) = 591,286,729,879\n\nFib(59) = 956,722,026,041\n\nFib(60) = 1,548,008,755,920\n\nFib(61) = 2,504,730,781,961\n\nFib(62) = 4,052,739,537,881\n\nFib(63) = 6,557,470,319,842\n\nFib(64) = 10,610,209,857,723\n\nFib(65) = 17,167,680,177,565\n\nFib(66) = 27,777,890,035,288\n\nFib(67) = 44,945,570,212,853\n\nFib(68) = 72,723,460,248,141\n\nFib(69) = 117,669,030,460,994\n\nFib(70) = 190,392,490,709,135\n\nFib(71) = 308,061,521,170,129\n\nFib(72) = 498,454,011,879,264\n\nFib(73) = 806,515,533,049,393\n\nFib(74) = 1,304,969,544,928,657\n\nFib(75) = 2,111,485,077,978,050\n\nFib(76) = 3,416,454,622,906,707\n\nFib(77) = 5,527,939,700,884,757\n\nFib(78) = 8,944,394,323,791,464\n\nFib(79) = 14,472,334,024,676,221\n\nFib(80) = 23,416,728,348,467,685\n\nFib(81) = 37,889,062,373,143,906\n\nFib(82) = 61,305,790,721,611,591\n\nFib(83) = 99,194,853,094,755,497\n\nFib(84) = 160,500,643,816,367,088\n\nFib(85) = 259,695,496,911,122,585\n\nFib(86) = 420,196,140,727,489,673\n\nFib(87) = 679,891,637,638,612,258\n\nFib(88) = 1,100,087,778,366,101,931\n\nFib(89) = 1,779,979,416,004,714,189\n\nFib(90) = 2,880,067,194,370,816,120\n\nFib(91) = 4,660,046,610,375,530,309\n\nFib(92) = 7,540,113,804,746,346,429\n\nFib(93) = 12,200,160,415,121,876,738\n\nFib(94) = 19,740,274,219,868,223,167\n\nFib(95) = 31,940,434,634,989,999,905\n\nFib(96) = 51,680,708,854,858,223,072\n\nFib(97) = 83,621,143,489,848,222,977\n\nFib(98) = 135,301,852,344,706,446,049\n\nFib(99) = 218,922,995,834,554,669,026\n\nFib(100) = 354,224,848,179,261,115,075\n\nSo for n up to 1e18, the Fib numbers up to Fib(86) is about 4e17, Fib(87) is ~6.7e17, Fib(88) ~1.1e18, Fib(89) ~1.7e18, Fib(90) ~2.8e18.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of previous games between opponents. The solution involves leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key constraint is that two players can only compete if the difference in their previous game counts is at most one. This leads us to model the problem using the Fibonacci sequence, where each term represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given number of players `n`. This is derived from the observation that the structure of the tournament must allow for such a progression, similar to how Fibonacci numbers grow.\n3. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to a value exceeding $10^{18}$ (the upper bound for `n`). This allows efficient lookup during the solution phase.\n4. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: For a given `n`, find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n` using a simple linear search through the precomputed list. The position of this Fibonacci number in the sequence gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18\n    fibs = [1, 1]  # Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1\n    while True:\n        next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n        if next_val > 10**18:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_val)\n    \n    # Find the maximum m such that Fib(m) <= n\n    max_m = 1  # since Fib(1) = 1\n    for i in range(len(fibs)):\n        if fibs[i] <= n:\n            max_m = i + 1  # because Fib(1) is at index 0, so i+1 is m\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # The answer is max_m - 2\n    print(max_m - 2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate all Fibonacci numbers up to a value greater than $10^{18}$. This ensures we cover all possible input values efficiently.\n- **Determine Maximum Games**: By iterating through the precomputed Fibonacci numbers, we find the largest value that does not exceed the input `n`. The position of this value in the Fibonacci sequence directly translates to the maximum number of games the winner can play, adjusted by subtracting 2 (as derived from the sequence properties).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and leverages mathematical insights to ensure optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
