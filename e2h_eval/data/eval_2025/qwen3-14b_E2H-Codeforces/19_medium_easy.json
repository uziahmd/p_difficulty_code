The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the sum of 2^i is maximized. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, the higher-numbered districts contribute way more than the lower ones. So our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring that the remaining districts form a connected component.\n\nBut how do we ensure connectivity? Well, since the original structure is a tree (because there's exactly one path between every pair of districts), removing some nodes will leave a subtree. But the problem is that when we remove nodes, we have to make sure that the remaining nodes are connected. So the approach is to select a subset of nodes that forms a connected subtree, and has size (n -k), and among all such subsets, choose the one with the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nBut since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible numbers, perhaps we can model this as choosing the largest (n -k) districts, but ensuring they are connected. However, that's not always possible. For example, if the largest districts are spread out in the tree, we might need to include some smaller ones to connect them.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to approach this greedily. Since higher-numbered districts have higher values, we want to keep them. So the optimal strategy would be to keep the largest possible districts, but ensuring they are connected. How can we do that?\n\nAn approach could be to start from the highest-numbered node and perform a traversal, selecting nodes in a way that ensures connectivity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a tree where we include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Let's think of the problem as selecting a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, and each higher node is worth more, perhaps we can model this as a priority-based selection.\n\nAnother idea: The optimal set of districts to keep is a subtree that includes the largest (n -k) districts. However, since the tree may not allow that, we need to find the minimal number of lower-numbered nodes that must be included to connect the higher ones.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model this as follows: We need to select a connected subtree of size m = n -k. To maximize the sum, we want to include the m largest possible districts. However, if those m districts are not connected, we need to include some smaller ones to connect them. But how to find which ones?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to keep the highest possible nodes. Let's imagine that we want to keep all nodes except the smallest k. But that's not possible if those nodes are not connected. So perhaps we need to find the minimal number of nodes to remove from the lower end to make the rest connected.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think of the tree structure. Since the tree is connected, but when you remove certain nodes, the rest may not be connected. So the idea is that the optimal set of nodes to keep is the set of nodes with the highest numbers, but connected. So perhaps we can model this as starting from the largest node and then adding the next largest nodes that are connected to the existing set.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAnother thought: The problem resembles finding a subtree with m nodes (m = n -k) that has the maximum sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes, and each node's value is 2^i, which is unique and increasing, the maximum sum is achieved by selecting the m largest nodes that can form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting the m largest nodes (where m = n -k) that form a connected subtree. But how to find that?\n\nThe approach would be to select all the nodes with numbers from (m) to n, but check if they form a connected subtree. If not, then we need to include some smaller nodes to connect them. However, this seems complicated.\n\nWait, but the nodes with higher numbers are more likely to be in a connected subtree. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nStart by considering all nodes from m to n. Then, check if they form a connected subtree. If they do, then we can keep them and remove the others. Otherwise, we need to find which nodes to add from the lower numbers to connect them.\n\nBut how to check if the nodes from m to n form a connected subtree? That seems computationally intensive for large n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to keep the highest (n -k) nodes, but with the necessary connections. However, since the tree is connected, perhaps we can find the minimal set of nodes to include so that the highest nodes are connected.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since the nodes have values 2^i, which are strictly increasing, the optimal set of nodes is the largest (n -k) nodes that form a connected subtree. So to find this, perhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the highest node, and greedily include the next largest nodes that are connected to the current set.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. We need to select (n -k) nodes. Let's denote m = n -k.\n\n2. We want to select the m largest nodes possible, but they need to be connected.\n\n3. So, we can think of building a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nHere's a possible algorithm:\n\n- Start with the highest node (node n). Add it to the set.\n\n- Then, perform a BFS or DFS, adding the next highest nodes that are connected to the current set. But how?\n\nBut this seems like a priority-based approach. For example, we can use a priority queue (max-heap) that holds nodes that are adjacent to the current set. We can start with node n. Then, for each step, we take the highest-numbered node that is adjacent to the current set and add it to the set. Repeat until we have m nodes.\n\nThis way, we are greedily adding the highest possible nodes that can be connected to the current set.\n\nYes! This seems promising. Because each time, we add the highest possible node that can be connected to the existing subtree. This way, we ensure that we get the maximum sum.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Compute m = n -k.\n\n- We need to select m nodes. Start with the highest node (n) and then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current set.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nWe can model this as a modified BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's how:\n\n- We can create a priority queue (max-heap) that contains nodes that are adjacent to the current set. Initially, the current set contains node n. We then look at all neighbors of node n and add them to the priority queue.\n\n- Then, for each step, we take the node with the highest number from the priority queue. If it's not already in the set, we add it to the set and then add all its neighbors to the priority queue (if they are not already in the set or the queue).\n\nWait, but this might not work correctly. Because the priority queue would have multiple entries for the same node, but we need to process them only once. However, since we are using a max-heap, the first time a node is processed, it's the highest possible time, and any subsequent entries can be ignored.\n\nBut how to track whether a node has been added to the set or not.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize a set S containing node n.\n\nCreate a priority queue (max-heap) that contains all neighbors of node n, with their numbers as the priority.\n\nAlso, have a visited array to track which nodes have been added to S.\n\nThen, for each step from 1 to (m-1):\n\n   Extract the node with the highest number from the priority queue.\n\n   If it's not in S, add it to S, and add all its neighbors to the priority queue.\n\nRepeat until S has m nodes.\n\nOnce we have S, the nodes not in S are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut wait, this approach ensures that we select the m nodes with the highest possible numbers, connected in a way that they form a subtree. Because each time, we choose the highest possible node that is adjacent to the current set. This way, the sum of the selected nodes is maximized.\n\nYes, this makes sense. Because, for example, if there are two nodes A and B, both adjacent to the current set, and A has a higher number than B, then choosing A first would allow us to include higher numbers in the set, which is better.\n\nSo this approach would select the best possible nodes.\n\nOnce we have the set S, the answer is all the nodes not in S, sorted in increasing order.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this algorithm efficiently, given that n can be up to 1e6.\n\nLet's think about the data structures. For each node, we need to have its neighbors. So we can build an adjacency list. Then, the priority queue (max-heap) can be implemented with a heap structure. However, in Python, the heapq module is a min-heap, so to implement a max-heap, we can insert negative numbers.\n\nBut for large n, say 1e6, and m up to 1e6, the algorithm needs to be O(m log n) time, which should be acceptable.\n\nWait, but for each node added to the set, we add all its neighbors to the priority queue. However, since each node can be added multiple times to the priority queue (but only processed once), the total number of operations on the heap would be O(n log n), which for n=1e6 is manageable?\n\nBut for n=1e6, O(n log n) is acceptable, but in practice, Python can be slow. However, given that the problem says it's an easy question, perhaps this approach is acceptable.\n\nLet's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3\n\nn=6, k=3. So m = 6 -3 = 3.\n\nWe need to select 3 nodes.\n\nStart with node 6. Then, add its neighbors. Let's see the tree structure.\n\nThe input is:\n\nEdges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo the adjacency list would be:\n\n1: [2]\n\n2: [1, 6, 4, 3]\n\n3: [2]\n\n4: [2]\n\n5: [6]\n\n6: [2,5]\n\nSo the initial node is 6. Its neighbors are 2 and 5.\n\nThe priority queue starts with 5 and 2. Since it's a max-heap, the first node to be extracted is 5. Then, we add 5 to the set. Now, the set has {6,5}.\n\nThen, we add the neighbors of 5 (which is 6, already in the set, and others? No. So nothing added to the queue.\n\nNext, the priority queue has 2. Extract 2. Add to the set. Now, set is {6,5,2}. Now, we have m=3 nodes. So the selected nodes are 6,5,2. The sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. Which matches the sample. The removed nodes are 1,3,4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works for the first sample.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n8 4 → m = 8 -4 =4.\n\nSample output is 1 3 4 5. So the selected nodes are 2,6,7,8? Or what?\n\nWait the output is the removed districts. The output is [1,3,4,5]. So the kept nodes are 2,6,7,8. Let's see their sum: 2^2 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 = 4 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 452. Which is the maximum.\n\nNow let's see how the algorithm would proceed.\n\nStart with node 8. Its neighbors are 7 (assuming the edges are as per the second input. Let me check the second input.\n\nSecond input:\n\n8 4\n\nEdges:\n\n2 6\n\n2 7\n\n7 8\n\n1 2\n\n3 1\n\n2 4\n\n7 5\n\nSo the adjacency list:\n\n1: [2, 3]\n\n2: [6,7,1,4]\n\n3: [1]\n\n4: [2]\n\n5: [7]\n\n6: [2]\n\n7: [2,8,5]\n\n8: [7]\n\nSo the initial node is 8. Its neighbor is 7. So the priority queue has 7.\n\nExtract 7. Add to set. Now set is {8,7}. Then add neighbors of 7: 2, 8 (already in set), 5. So add 2 and 5 to the priority queue. The priority queue now has 5 and 2. The next highest is 5. Add 5 to the set. Now set has {8,7,5}. Then add neighbors of 5 (only 7, already in set). Next, the priority queue has 2. Extract 2. Add to the set. Now set has 4 elements (8,7,5,2). So the kept nodes are 8,7,5,2. Wait, but the sample output says that the removed nodes are 1,3,4,5. Wait that would mean that 5 is removed. But according to this approach, 5 is kept. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me check the second sample again.\n\nSample input for the second case is:\n\nInput:\n\n8 4\n\nEdges:\n\n2 6\n\n2 7\n\n7 8\n\n1 2\n\n3 1\n\n2 4\n\n7 5\n\nSo the tree structure:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 6,7,1,4.\n\nDistrict 7 is connected to 2,8,5.\n\nDistrict 8 is connected to 7.\n\nDistrict 1 is connected to 2 and 3.\n\nDistrict 3 is connected to 1.\n\nDistrict 4 is connected to 2.\n\nDistrict 5 is connected to 7.\n\nDistrict 6 is connected to 2.\n\nSo the algorithm starts with node 8. Then adds 7. Then adds 5 and 2. Then, the next step is to extract 5 (since 5 is higher than 2?), no. Wait, the priority queue is a max-heap. So after adding 2 and 5, the queue has 5 and 2. The max is 5. So we take 5. Then add it to the set. Then add its neighbors (7, which is already in the set). Then the queue has 2. Take 2. Now the set is {8,7,5,2} (size 4). So the kept nodes are 8,7,5,2. The sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^7 + 2^8 = 4 +32 + 128 +256 = 420. But the sample output says that the removed nodes are 1,3,4,5. Which implies that the kept nodes are 2,6,7,8. Their sum is 4 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 452. Which is higher than 420. So why didn't the algorithm pick those nodes?\n\nAh, here's the problem. The algorithm's approach is flawed. Because in the second sample, the correct selection is to keep 2,6,7,8, which sum to higher value than the algorithm's selection of 2,5,7,8.\n\nSo why didn't the algorithm choose that? Because during the selection process, after selecting 8 and 7, the next candidates are 5 and 2. The algorithm picks 5 first, but 2 is lower than 5. But if we pick 2 instead of 5, then we can add 6, which is higher than 5. So the algorithm's approach is not correct.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach is wrong. Because in this case, selecting 2 instead of 5 would allow us to include higher-numbered nodes later.\n\nSo what's the problem here? The algorithm's greedy approach of taking the highest available node at each step doesn't lead to the optimal selection. Because in this case, even though 5 is higher than 2, including 2 allows us to include 6, which is higher than 5. So the algorithm's choice of taking 5 first leads to a worse overall sum.\n\nSo the initial approach is incorrect. Therefore, we need a different strategy.\n\nHmm. This is a problem. So how can we adjust the approach to avoid this mistake?\n\nAlternative idea: The priority should not be just the node's number, but the potential to include higher-numbered nodes. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial approach is greedy and may not consider future possibilities. However, given that the node numbers are unique and strictly increasing, perhaps there's a way to prioritize nodes with higher numbers.\n\nWait, but in the second sample, the algorithm's approach selected 5 (value 32) instead of 2 (value 4), but 2 is part of a subtree that includes 6 (value 64) and 4 (value 16), etc. So by choosing 2 instead of 5, we can get higher values.\n\nBut the problem is that the algorithm's priority is based on the node's value. So when the algorithm has the option to choose between 5 and 2, it chooses the higher one. However, that's not the optimal choice.\n\nSo the initial approach is not correct. Therefore, we need a different method.\n\nLet me think again. What is the correct way to select the nodes?\n\nThe optimal set is the one with the maximum sum of 2^i. Since 2^i increases exponentially, the best way to maximize the sum is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. However, the nodes must form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree of size m = n -k, which contains the maximum possible number of high-numbered nodes. How to do this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that the optimal subtree must contain all the nodes from some threshold upwards. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, in the second sample, if the threshold was 2, then the nodes 2, 6, 7, 8 are included. Which is better than 2,5,7,8.\n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to find the minimal set of nodes to exclude, which are the smallest possible, but ensuring connectivity.\n\nAnother idea: The optimal set is the set of nodes that includes all nodes except for the smallest k nodes, provided that they are connected. If not, then we need to include some of the small nodes to connect the larger ones.\n\nBut how to determine which ones?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: The nodes with higher numbers are more valuable, so we want to include them. So the optimal subtree must include all nodes from some value x upwards, plus possibly some lower nodes to connect them. But how to find x?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting the m nodes with the highest possible numbers, and then checking if they form a connected subtree. If they do, that's the optimal. If not, we need to replace some lower nodes with higher ones that can connect the components.\n\nBut how to check if the m highest nodes form a connected subtree?\n\nFor example, in the second sample, the m = 4. The top 4 nodes are 8,7,6,5. Are they connected? Let's see:\n\nNode 8 is connected to 7. Node 7 is connected to 2 and 5. Node 6 is connected to 2. Node 5 is connected to 7. So the nodes 8,7,5,6 are connected through 7 and 2? Wait, node 6 is connected to 2. But 2 is not part of the top 4 nodes. So the nodes 8,7,6,5 are not connected. Because 6 is connected to 2, which is not in the set. So the set {8,7,6,5} is not connected. Therefore, we need to include 2 (which is lower than 5) to connect them. But then, the set becomes {8,7,6,2}, which is connected. The sum is 2^2 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 = 4 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 452. Which is better than including 5 instead of 2.\n\nSo the problem is that the top m nodes may not be connected, so we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But how?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can think of this as a problem of selecting the nodes with the highest possible numbers, but ensuring that they are connected. To do this, we can perform a reverse process: start from the highest nodes and keep adding nodes that are needed to connect them.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, the way to do this is to find the minimal set of nodes that connects the highest nodes. But again, how?\n\nAnother idea: Since the tree is connected, any subset of nodes that forms a connected subtree must have a certain structure. Perhaps we can model this as a minimum spanning tree problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a variation of the maximum spanning tree. However, the weights are based on the node values, not the edges.\n\nWait, but the problem is to select a connected subtree of size m, which maximizes the sum of the node values. Since the node values are 2^i, which are unique and increasing, the optimal subtree is the one that contains the highest possible nodes.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to select all nodes except the smallest k, but if they are not connected, then we need to find which nodes to include to connect them. However, this seems complex.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's imagine that the optimal subtree must contain the node with the highest number (n). Because otherwise, if we don't include it, we could replace one of the nodes in the subtree with n, which would increase the sum.\n\nSimilarly, the subtree must include the next highest nodes as long as they are connected. So the subtree must contain all the highest nodes that can be connected to each other.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to start with the highest node, then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. But the previous approach failed in the second sample because of the order in which nodes were added.\n\nIn the second sample, the initial approach selected 8, then 7, then 5, then 2. But the optimal is to select 8,7,2,6. How can we ensure that 2 is added before 5?\n\nBecause 2 has a lower value than 5, but adding 2 allows for the inclusion of 6, which has a higher value than 5.\n\nAh! So the problem with the initial approach is that it selects the highest available node at each step, but that might prevent adding even higher nodes later.\n\nSo, perhaps the priority should not be the node's value, but the potential of the node's subtree. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a priority queue where the priority is the node's value, but when adding nodes to the queue, we also consider their neighbors. However, the previous approach didn't work in the second sample.\n\nLet me re-examine the second sample scenario. \n\nWhen the algorithm starts with node 8, and adds its neighbor 7 to the priority queue. Then, the priority queue has 7. Extract 7, add to the set. Now, add its neighbors: 2, 8 (already added), 5. So the queue now has 5 and 2. The highest is 5, so extract 5 and add to the set. Now, the set has 8,7,5. Then, the queue has 2. Extract 2, add to the set. Now, the set has 4 nodes. The sum is 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^5 + 2^2 = 256 + 128 + 32 +4 = 420. However, if instead, after adding 7, we had added 2 instead of 5, then the set would have 8,7,2. Then, the neighbors of 2 are 6, 1, 4, 7. Adding 6 (which is higher than 5), and then 6 would be added next. So the set would be 8,7,2,6. Sum is 256+128+4+64= 452.\n\nSo the issue is that the algorithm chose to add 5 first, but adding 2 would allow adding 6 later, which is higher than 5.\n\nSo the problem is that the algorithm is choosing the highest available node, but this choice prevents adding higher-value nodes in the future.\n\nTherefore, the priority queue approach is flawed. It's a greedy algorithm that doesn't account for future gains.\n\nHmm. So how to adjust this? This feels like a problem where we need to consider not just the immediate gain but also future potential. But how to do that?\n\nAnother idea: Instead of using the node's value as the priority, use the value of the node plus the potential of its subtree. But how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, since the node's value is 2^i, and each node's value is unique and higher than all smaller nodes, perhaps the optimal way is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, even if it means temporarily including lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to include all nodes from a certain threshold upwards, and then connect them by adding the minimal necessary lower nodes.\n\nBut how to determine this threshold?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nStart with all nodes from m to n. Check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, that's the optimal. If not, we need to find which nodes to add from below to connect them.\n\nBut how to check if they form a connected subtree?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive for large n, but perhaps we can find the connected components of these nodes and see if they are connected.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes from m to n as a candidate set. We need to connect them. The minimal number of nodes to add from below to connect them is the number of required connections. But again, how?\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nAnother idea: The problem is similar to finding a Steiner tree, but since the node values are so skewed, perhaps we can find a way to include the highest nodes and the necessary lower ones.\n\nLet's think of it as follows:\n\nThe optimal set must include all nodes from a certain point upwards. For example, in the second sample, the optimal set includes nodes 2,6,7,8. These are the nodes with numbers >= 2. But why not include node 5?\n\nBecause including node 5 would require excluding node 6, which has a higher value.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal set is to include all nodes from a certain value x upwards, plus the minimal number of nodes below x to connect them.\n\nBut how to find x?\n\nAlternatively, since the sum is maximized by including as many high nodes as possible, perhaps the optimal set is the set of nodes with numbers >= x, where x is chosen such that the number of nodes in this set plus the number of connecting nodes from below equals m.\n\nBut how to find x?\n\nThis seems challenging.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe can think of the problem as follows. Since the sum is dominated by the highest nodes, we want to include as many of them as possible. So, we can try to include the highest possible nodes and ensure that they are connected. The way to ensure connectivity is to include the necessary lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo, we can start by including all nodes from m to n. Let's call this set S. If S is connected, then we're done. If not, we need to find which nodes to include from below to connect the components of S.\n\nBut how to find those nodes?\n\nFor example, in the second sample, m=4. The nodes from 5 to 8 are 5,6,7,8. Are they connected? Let's see:\n\nNode 5 is connected to 7. Node 7 is connected to 8. Node 6 is connected to 2, which is not in the set. So the set {5,6,7,8} is not connected. So we need to connect 6 to the rest. To do that, we need to include node 2 (which is lower than 5). Including node 2 allows us to connect 6 to the rest. So now, the set becomes {2,5,6,7,8}, which has size 5. But m is 4. So we need to remove one node. Which one? The lowest one in the set, which is 2. But then, the set becomes {5,6,7,8}, which is not connected again. So this approach is not working.\n\nThis suggests that including the highest nodes and then adding lower ones to connect them may not be straightforward.\n\nAlternative idea: Use Krusky's algorithm for maximum spanning tree, but for nodes. Wait, not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the optimal set must be a subtree that contains the node with the highest number, n. Because otherwise, we can replace any node in the subtree with n, which has a higher value.\n\nSimilarly, the subtree must contain the next highest node, unless it's not connected to the rest. So the subtree must contain the highest node, and then the next highest nodes that can be connected to it.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to start from node n, and perform a BFS or DFS, but prioritizing nodes with higher numbers. But how to ensure that the higher nodes are included.\n\nWait, this brings us back to the original idea, but with the realization that in the second sample, the algorithm's approach was incorrect. So why did it fail?\n\nBecause the algorithm chose to add 5 before 2, but 2 allows adding 6, which is higher than 5. So perhaps the priority should not be the node's value, but something else.\n\nLet me think: When considering which node to add next, we should choose the one that has the highest possible value, but also considers the potential of its neighbors. But how to model this?\n\nMaybe the correct priority is the value of the node itself. But in the second sample, the algorithm chose 5 over 2, leading to a lower overall sum. Why is that?\n\nBecause 5 is higher than 2, but adding 2 allows us to add 6, which is higher than 5. So the algorithm's choice was locally optimal but globally suboptimal.\n\nThis suggests that a greedy approach based on node values may not work, and we need a different strategy.\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each node has a weight of 2^i, and we want to select a subtree of size m with maximum total weight. This is equivalent to finding a subtree with m nodes that has the maximum sum of node weights.\n\nThis is a classic problem, but I'm not aware of an efficient algorithm for it. However, given the specific structure of the weights (exponential), perhaps there's a way to exploit it.\n\nSince 2^i is exponentially increasing, the optimal subtree must contain as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So, the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the highest possible nodes, even if it requires including some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal set of lower nodes needed to connect the highest nodes.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. Start with the set of nodes from m to n. Let's call this set S.\n\n2. Check if S is connected. If yes, done.\n\n3. If not, find the minimal number of nodes to add from below to connect S. These nodes would be the ones that are on the paths between the disconnected components of S.\n\n4. Once connected, if the total number of nodes is m, we're done. If not, we may need to remove some nodes from S and add others.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the optimal subtree must include all nodes from a certain number x upwards, and possibly some lower nodes to connect them. We need to find x such that the number of nodes in the connected subtree formed by x to n plus the necessary lower nodes equals m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: Since the sum is dominated by the highest nodes, we can try to include as many high nodes as possible. Let's start with the highest node, and then include the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. But this time, we should prioritize nodes that are connected to the current subtree and have higher values, but also consider their neighbors.\n\nWait, this is the same as the initial approach, but why did it fail in the second sample?\n\nIn the second sample, the initial approach added 8, then 7, then 5, then 2. But the optimal is to add 8,7,2,6. So why wasn't 2 chosen before 5?\n\nBecause when the priority queue had 5 and 2, it chose 5, which has a higher value. But adding 2 would allow adding 6 later, which is higher than 5.\n\nSo the issue is that the priority queue is not considering the future potential of the nodes. It's choosing the highest available node, but that node may block the inclusion of higher-value nodes later.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach is not correct, and a different strategy is needed.\n\nLet me think of the following alternative approach: the priority should be based on the node's value plus the maximum value of its subtree. But how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the problem as a variant of Prim's algorithm for maximum spanning tree. In Prim's algorithm, we start with a node and add the edge with the highest weight that connects to the current tree. But here, we want to select nodes, not edges.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this as a maximum spanning tree problem where the nodes are weighted, and we want to select a subtree of size m. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting nodes such that each new node added is the one with the highest possible value that is connected to the current subtree. But this is what the initial approach does, and it failed in the second sample.\n\nBut why? Let's re-examine the second sample's scenario.\n\nAfter selecting 8 and 7, the priority queue contains 5 and 2. The algorithm chooses 5, but what if it chose 2 instead? Let's see what would happen.\n\nIf after adding 7, the queue has 5 and 2. We choose 2 instead of 5. Now, the set is {8,7,2}. Then, add the neighbors of 2: 6, 1, 4, 7 (already in the set). So the priority queue now contains 6, 1, 4, 5 (from earlier). The highest is 6. Add 6 to the set. Now the set has size 4, which is m=4. The nodes are 8,7,2,6. This gives a higher sum.\n\nSo the algorithm would choose 2 over 5 if it were possible. But how can we ensure that?\n\nThe problem is that the initial approach uses a max-heap based on the node's value, but in this case, choosing a lower-value node (2) allows us to include a higher-value node (6) later. So the priority should not be based on the node's value alone.\n\nThis suggests that the priority should be based on the potential of the node to enable higher-value nodes to be added. But how to quantify that?\n\nThis seems like a problem that requires looking ahead, which is not feasible in a greedy approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Use a priority queue where the priority is the node's value, but when adding nodes to the queue, we also consider their neighbors. For example, when a node is added to the queue, its neighbors are added with their own values. This is what the initial approach does. But in the second sample, it failed.\n\nSo why is that?\n\nBecause when the queue has 5 and 2, the algorithm chooses 5, but 2 is part of a subtree that includes 6, which is higher than 5. But how can the algorithm know that?\n\nIt seems that the initial approach is not sufficient. So perhaps we need to rethink the entire approach.\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Since the sum is 2^i, the optimal set of m nodes is the set of m nodes with the highest possible values, provided they form a connected subtree. If they don't, then we need to replace some lower nodes with higher ones that can help connect the subtree.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to replace?\n\nLet's assume that the optimal set is the set of m nodes with the highest values, but with some lower nodes replaced by higher ones to connect them.\n\nBut how to find this set?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a priority queue, but with a different priority.\n\nWait, here's another idea: instead of using the node's value as the priority, use the value of the node plus the value of all its descendants. But this is not feasible without knowing the subtree.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a priority queue where the",
