The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that we want to maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, we want to keep the districts with the highest possible numbers. But there's a catch: removing some districts might disconnect the graph. So we need to ensure that after removing k districts, the remaining ones are all connected.\n\nWait, but the original structure is a tree since it's given that there's exactly one path between every pair of districts. So the tree has n nodes, and we need to remove k nodes such that the remaining n - k nodes form a connected subtree. And we want to maximize the sum of 2^i for those nodes.\n\nSo how do we approach this? Well, since higher-numbered districts have much higher values, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. However, we need to make sure that they are connected. So maybe the strategy is to keep the highest possible districts, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to find which districts to remove?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that we need to select n - k districts that form a connected subtree. To maximize the sum, we need to include as many high-numbered districts as possible. So perhaps we can start by including the largest districts and then check if they are connected. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as selecting the districts to keep. The optimal set would be the largest (n - k) districts that form a connected subtree. But how to find that?\n\nBut how can we ensure that the largest districts are connected? For example, if the largest district is node n, then we need to include it. Then, we need to include as many of the next largest as possible, but ensuring that they are connected to it.\n\nWait, here's an idea: The optimal solution is to keep the districts with numbers from (some value) up to n, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. Because higher numbers have exponentially larger values, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal set of districts to remove, which are the lower-numbered ones, but ensuring that the remaining ones form a connected tree.\n\nBut how to determine which ones to remove?\n\nAnother approach: We need to choose n - k districts that form a connected subtree. Since the sum is maximized when we have the highest possible numbers, the best way is to include the largest possible numbers, but possibly exclude some lower ones that are not connected.\n\nBut how to check connectivity? Maybe we can model this as building a subtree that includes all the nodes from some threshold upwards, but that might not be possible. For example, if the node n is connected to node n-1, then including them is easy. But if the node n is isolated, then we can't include it unless we include its neighbors.\n\nWait, but the tree structure is arbitrary. So perhaps the correct way is to perform a greedy approach where we start from the highest-numbered nodes and try to include as many as possible, while keeping the subtree connected.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting a subtree with exactly (n -k) nodes, which has maximum sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, and each node's value is 2^i, the maximum sum is achieved when the included nodes are the largest possible.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find a subtree with (n -k) nodes that includes as many of the largest-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree?\n\nHere's a thought: The subtree must include the node with the highest number (n), otherwise, if we don't include it, we could have included it and removed some other node with lower value, which would give a better sum. Therefore, the optimal subtree must include node n. Similarly, once we include node n, we need to include as many of the next highest nodes as possible, but ensuring that they are connected to the subtree.\n\nThis suggests that we can model this as a priority-based approach where we start from node n and greedily add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nAlternatively, here's a method inspired by Krusky's algorithm or Prim's:\n\nWe can think of the problem as building a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes. We can start with the node n. Then, we need to add the next highest nodes (like n-1, n-2, etc.) but only if they are connected to the existing subtree. If they are not connected, we need to find a way to connect them by adding some nodes. However, since we want to maximize the sum, we want to avoid adding lower-numbered nodes if possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the tree is connected, and we need to include the highest possible nodes, maybe we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from node n, and collect all nodes in the order of their priority (highest first). Then, the first (n -k) nodes in this order would be the ones to keep. However, this may not work because the order of traversal may not account for the necessity to include certain nodes to connect others.\n\nWait, but maybe the correct approach is to perform a traversal that prioritizes higher-numbered nodes. For example, we can perform a BFS or DFS, but always visiting the children with higher numbers first. Then, when we collect the nodes in the order of traversal, the first (n -k) nodes would be the ones that are kept. However, this is not necessarily correct, but maybe it's a way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: since we need to keep the subtree connected, and we want to maximize the sum, we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to keep the highest (n -k) nodes that form a connected subtree. How to find this?\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include? Let's think of the following approach:\n\nWe can start by considering all nodes from n down to 1. We want to include as many as possible. However, we need to ensure that the nodes are connected.\n\nSo here's an idea: we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the highest node (n), and include all nodes that are reachable through higher-numbered nodes. Wait, but that might not capture all possibilities. Alternatively, think of the problem as trying to select the nodes with the largest numbers, and for each node, check if it's connected to the existing selected nodes. If it is, include it. Otherwise, skip it. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nWait, but the tree is a connected graph. So if we start with node n, then to include node n-1, we need to check if there's a path between n and n-1 that doesn't go through any nodes that are not included. But since the tree is connected, there's a path between any two nodes. However, if we are including nodes in order of their numbers, perhaps we can build a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the subtree must include node n. Then, we can think of the subtree as a tree rooted at n, and we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So, for each node, we can decide whether to include it based on whether it's connected to the subtree. But how to do this?\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible solution:\n\nWe need to select n -k nodes. Since the sum is maximized when the nodes are the largest possible, we can think of the problem as trying to include the largest (n -k) nodes, but ensuring they are connected. However, it's possible that some of these nodes are not connected. So, perhaps we can use a priority queue approach where we start with the highest node and then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to check if a node is connected to the current subtree?\n\nAn alternative idea comes from the fact that the tree is connected. Suppose we start with node n. Then, we can collect all nodes that are in the subtree of the highest nodes. For example, for each node, we can process them in descending order, and add them to the subtree if they are connected to the current subtree.\n\nWait, but how to check that. Let's think of the following:\n\nWe can use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure. However, since we need to select nodes in a way that ensures connectivity, perhaps we can process nodes in descending order (from n down to 1), and for each node, if it's connected to the current set (the ones already added), we add it. Otherwise, we skip it. But how to determine if it's connected to the current set?\n\nBut the problem is that the tree's edges are fixed. So, when processing node i, if any of its neighbors have already been added to the set, then it can be connected. So perhaps we can model this with a BFS or DFS approach, adding nodes in order of their value.\n\nLet me think of this as a modified BFS. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Process nodes in order of decreasing value (from n down to 1).\n2. For each node, if it hasn't been added to the subtree yet, check if it's adjacent to any node that is already in the subtree. If yes, add it to the subtree. If not, skip it (since adding it would require adding other nodes which may not be part of the subtree).\n3. Continue until we have added (n -k) nodes.\n\nBut this approach would ensure that the nodes added are the largest possible, and connected. Because we process the largest nodes first, and add them if they can be connected to the existing subtree.\n\nWait, but how do we know that this will result in the maximum sum? Because adding the largest nodes first, and connecting them as possible.\n\nLet's take the first example:\n\nInput is 6 3. So n=6, k=3. We need to select 3 nodes to remove, leaving 3 nodes. The optimal is to keep 2,5,6. But according to the example output, the answer is removing 1,3,4. The kept nodes are 2,5,6. Let's see how the process would work.\n\nProcessing nodes in order 6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nStart with 6. Add it to the subtree. Now count is 1.\n\nNext is 5. Check if any neighbor of 5 is already in the subtree. Let's look at the tree structure. The input for the first example is:\n\nEdges are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\nLet me draw it:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nSo for node 5, its neighbors are 6. Since 6 is already in the subtree, we add node 5. Now count is 2.\n\nNext node is 4. Its neighbors are 2. But 2 is not in the subtree yet. So can't add it. So skip.\n\nNext node is 3. Neighbors are 2. Not in the subtree. Skip.\n\nNext node is 2. Neighbors are 1,6,4,3. 6 is already in the subtree. So add node 2. Now count is 3. Which is n -k = 6-3=3. So the subtree is 6,5,2. Which gives sum 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. Which matches the sample. So the nodes kept are 2,5,6. The nodes removed are 1,3,4. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. So the idea is:\n\n- We process the nodes in order from highest to lowest.\n\n- For each node, if it's not yet added, check if any of its adjacent nodes are already in the subtree. If yes, add it to the subtree. Else, skip.\n\n- We continue until we have collected (n -k) nodes.\n\nThe nodes that are not collected are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nBecause for each node, we need to check if any of its adjacent nodes are already in the subtree. For that, we can use a visited array or a boolean array indicating whether the node is in the subtree.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read the tree and build adjacency lists.\n\n- Initialize a visited array (or set) to track which nodes are in the subtree.\n\n- Initialize a count variable to 0.\n\n- Iterate through the nodes in order from n down to 1.\n\n- For each node i:\n\n   if not visited[i], check if any of its neighbors are visited. If yes, add it to the subtree (mark as visited, increment count).\n\n   else, skip.\n\nOnce the count reaches (n -k), we stop.\n\nThen, the nodes not in the visited array are the ones to be removed. We collect them, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple ways to collect (n -k) nodes, but this approach may not capture the optimal one? Let's think of a scenario where including a lower-numbered node allows for more higher-numbered nodes to be included. However, since we are processing nodes in descending order, and including them whenever possible, I think this approach would capture the optimal set.\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose n=4, k=1. So we need to keep 3 nodes. The tree is a chain 1-2-3-4. So the optimal is to keep 2,3,4. How does the algorithm work?\n\nProcess nodes 4,3,2,1.\n\nStart with 4: add it. count=1.\n\nCheck 3: neighbor is 4 (already in subtree). Add it. count=2.\n\nCheck 2: neighbor is 3 (in subtree). Add. count=3. Done. So the kept nodes are 4,3,2. Removed is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose the tree is 1 connected to 3, and 2 connected to 3. So the tree is like 1-3-2. n=3, k=1. Need to keep 2 nodes. Which is better: 3 and 2 (sum 2^3 + 2^2 = 12) or 3 and 1 (sum 8+2=10). So the optimal is to keep 3 and 2. How does the algorithm process?\n\nProcess nodes 3,2,1.\n\nStart with 3: add. count=1.\n\nCheck 2: neighbor is 3 (added). Add. count=2. Done. So kept are 3,2. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=4, k=1. Tree is 1 connected to 2, 2 connected to 3, 2 connected to 4. So the tree is like 1-2-3 and 2-4. The optimal is to keep 2,3,4 (sum 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 4 +8 +16= 28). Or maybe 2,3,4. Let's see.\n\nProcessing nodes 4,3,2,1.\n\nStart with 4: add. count=1.\n\nCheck 3: neighbors are 2 (not added). So no. Skip.\n\nCheck 2: neighbors are 1 (no), 3 (no), 4 (yes). So add 2. count=2.\n\nCheck 1: neighbors are 2 (added). So add. count=3. But we need to keep 3 nodes. But the optimal is to keep 2,3,4. However, according to this approach, the kept nodes are 4,2,1. Which has sum 16 +4 + 2 = 22. Which is worse than 2,3,4 (sum 28). So this approach would fail here. Wait, why?\n\nAh! Because in this case, the algorithm would process node 3 before node 2. Wait no. Wait the nodes are processed in descending order. So the order is 4,3,2,1.\n\nSo first process 4. Add it. Then process 3. Its neighbors are 2. Which is not in the subtree. So can't add. Then process 2. Its neighbors are 1 (not added), 3 (not added), 4 (added). So add 2. Now count is 2. Next is 1. Its neighbor is 2 (added), so add. Count is 3. So the kept nodes are 4, 2, 1. But the optimal is 2,3,4. How come?\n\nBecause the algorithm didn't add 3. But why? Because when processing 3, the algorithm checks if any of its neighbors are in the subtree. At that time, the subtree contains 4. But 3 is connected to 2, which is not in the subtree. So the algorithm skips adding 3. However, if we had added 3, then we could have added 2 and 4, but how?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the algorithm processes nodes in order of descending value. So node 3 is processed before node 2. So when processing node 3, the subtree has only node 4. Node 3 is connected to 2, which is not in the subtree. So the algorithm can't add node 3. Then, when processing node 2, it can be added because it is connected to 4. Then, node 2 is added. But node 3 is not in the subtree. So the algorithm ends up with nodes 4, 2, 1. But the optimal is 2,3,4. How can this be achieved?\n\nIn this scenario, the optimal set is 2,3,4. Which is connected. But according to the algorithm, node 3 is not added. So why?\n\nBecause when processing node 3, the subtree contains only node 4. The algorithm checks if any neighbor of 3 is in the subtree. The neighbors of 3 are 2. But 2 is not in the subtree. So node 3 is not added. However, if we added node 2 first, then node 3 can be added. But the algorithm processes node 3 before node 2. So in this case, the algorithm fails to find the optimal solution.\n\nSo this suggests that the approach is incorrect. What's wrong here?\n\nThe problem is that the algorithm processes nodes in descending order, but adding a lower-numbered node (like 2) may allow adding higher-numbered nodes (like 3) later. However, since the algorithm processes 3 first, and can't add it, but then adds 2, which allows adding 3 later?\n\nBut in this example, when processing node 3, the subtree only contains 4. Then node 3 is not added. Then, when processing node 2, it is added. Now, the subtree contains 4 and 2. Then, when processing node 3 again? No, because the processing is in order of descending numbers. Once the algorithm processes node 3, it moves on. So node 3 is processed once, and not added. Then, after processing node 2, the subtree has 4 and 2. Now, the next node to process is 1. So node 3 is not processed again.\n\nThus, the algorithm misses the opportunity to add node 3, even though it's higher than node 2.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach is flawed. How can we fix this?\n\nThe issue is that the algorithm processes nodes in descending order, but adding a node (like 2) that is lower than another node (like 3) may allow adding higher-numbered nodes. But since 3 was processed earlier, and couldn't be added, it's not considered again.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach should be to prioritize adding nodes that are higher, but also allow for adding their neighbors even if they are processed later.\n\nWait, but how can we do that? Because once we process a node, if it's not added, we can't go back. So maybe the initial approach is not sufficient.\n\nAlternative idea: Think of the problem as building a maximum spanning tree where the nodes' weights are their values, but the tree must have exactly n -k nodes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where we need to select a subset of nodes with size (n -k) that forms a connected component, and the sum of their 2^i is maximum. Since the sum is maximized by including the largest possible nodes, the optimal subset is the largest (n -k) nodes that are connected in the tree.\n\nBut how to find the largest (n -k) nodes that form a connected subtree?\n\nThis feels like a problem where we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the largest node and include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to ensure that the subset is connected.\n\nAnother approach is to think of the problem as the following: the optimal subset must include the largest (n -k) nodes, but possibly some of them are not connected. So we need to find the minimal number of nodes to remove from the top (n -k) nodes to make them connected. But this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the optimal subset is the largest (n -k) nodes, but with some lower-numbered nodes included to connect them. However, since lower-numbered nodes have smaller values, we want to minimize their inclusion. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of lower-numbered nodes needed to connect the largest (n -k) nodes.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, here's a different idea: since the sum depends on the nodes included, and the 2^i terms are exponentially increasing, the optimal solution must include the node n. Then, the problem reduces to including as many of the nodes with numbers higher than some value, and possibly some lower ones to connect them.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to perform a BFS or DFS starting from node n, and collect all the nodes in the order of their priority (highest first). Then, the first (n -k) nodes in this order would be the ones to keep.\n\nWait, but how to collect them in that order. For example, during BFS/DFS, we can prioritize visiting higher-numbered nodes first.\n\nLet me think of this. Let's imagine that we perform a BFS starting from node n. For each node, when we visit its neighbors, we process them in order of descending number. This way, higher-numbered nodes are visited first. Then, the order in which nodes are visited is prioritizing higher numbers. Then, the first (n -k) nodes in this traversal order would be the ones to keep.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's take the previous example where the tree is 1-2-3 and 2-4. Processing node 4 first. Then, during BFS, we look at neighbors of 4, which is 2. Then process 2, then look at its neighbors (excluding 4), which are 1 and 3. Process 3 first (higher number than 1), then 1. So the traversal order is 4, 2, 3, 1. Then, if we need to select 3 nodes (n -k =4-1=3), we would select 4,2,3. Which is the optimal solution.\n\nSo this approach would work. How to implement this?\n\nThe idea is to perform a traversal (like BFS or DFS) starting from node n, and always visit the neighbors with higher numbers first. Then, collect the nodes in the order of traversal. The first (n -k) nodes in this order are the ones to keep. The rest are to be removed.\n\nThis makes sense because the traversal prioritizes higher-numbered nodes, ensuring that we collect as many high-numbered nodes as possible, while maintaining connectivity.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Build the adjacency list for the tree.\n\n2. Perform a traversal (BFS or DFS) starting from node n, always visiting the neighbors in descending order (so that higher-numbered nodes are visited first).\n\n3. Collect the nodes in the order of traversal.\n\n4. The first (n -k) nodes in this list are the ones to keep. The rest are to be removed.\n\nIn the previous example where the algorithm failed, this approach would work:\n\nTraversal order is 4, 2, 3, 1. Take first 3 nodes (4,2,3). Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the first sample. Traversal order would be 6,5,2,4,3,1. Take first 3 nodes (6,5,2). Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the case where the tree is 1-2-3-4. Traversal order would be 4,3,2,1. Take first 3 nodes (4,3,2). Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems promising.\n\nNow, how to implement this traversal.\n\nFor each node, when we visit its neighbors, we need to process them in descending order. So during BFS, when we visit a node, we add its neighbors to the queue, sorted in descending order, but making sure not to revisit nodes already processed.\n\nBut how to manage that. Let's think of using a priority queue (max-heap) for the traversal. But for BFS, we need to process nodes level by level. However, using a priority queue may not maintain the BFS order, but for our purposes, perhaps it's sufficient to prioritize higher-numbered nodes.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a BFS approach where for each node, we process its neighbors in descending order, adding them to the queue. This way, higher-numbered nodes are processed earlier.\n\nLet me think of the steps for this:\n\nInitialize a queue with node n. Also, a visited array to mark visited nodes.\n\nWhile the queue is not empty:\n\n   Dequeue node u.\n\n   Add u to the traversal list.\n\n   For each neighbor v of u:\n\n      if not visited:\n\n         mark as visited.\n\n         enqueue v.\n\nBut this is a standard BFS. However, the order in which neighbors are processed affects the traversal order. For example, if u has neighbors 3 and 5, we need to process 5 first.\n\nThus, during the traversal, for each node u, we need to process its neighbors in descending order. So for each node u, when we look at its neighbors, we sort them in descending order and enqueue them in that order. However, since the traversal is BFS, this ensures that higher-numbered neighbors are processed earlier in the same level.\n\nWait, but in BFS, the order of enqueuing affects which nodes are processed next. For example, if we enqueue higher-numbered nodes first, then they will be processed before lower-numbered ones in the same level.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize a queue with node n.\n\nMark it as visited.\n\nWhile the queue is not empty:\n\n   Dequeue node u.\n\n   Add u to the traversal list.\n\n   Sort the neighbors of u in descending order.\n\n   For each neighbor v in this sorted list:\n\n      if not visited:\n\n         mark as visited.\n\n         enqueue v.\n\nThis way, during traversal, higher-numbered nodes are processed first.\n\nThis should generate a traversal order that prioritizes higher-numbered nodes, ensuring that the first (n -k) nodes are the highest possible.\n\nLet's test this approach with the previous example where the algorithm failed.\n\nExample: Tree is 1-2-3 and 2-4. n=4, k=1. Need to select 3 nodes.\n\nTraversal starts with 4.\n\nAdd 4 to list. Mark as visited.\n\nNeighbors of 4 are [2]. Sort in descending order (only 2). Enqueue 2.\n\nNext dequeue 2. Add to list. Now list is [4,2].\n\nNeighbors of 2 are [1,3,4]. But 4 is already visited. Sort the remaining [3,1] in descending order: 3,1. So enqueue 3, then 1.\n\nDequeue 3. Add to list. Now list is [4,2,3]. Since we need 3 nodes, we stop here. The nodes kept are 4,2,3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example where the previous approach failed.\n\nYes, this approach would work.\n\nAnother example: the tree is a chain 1-2-3-4. Starting with 4. Neighbors are 3. Enqueue 3. Dequeue 3, add to list. Neighbors are 2. Enqueue. Dequeue 2, add to list. Neighbors are 1. Enqueue. Dequeue 1. So the traversal list is [4,3,2,1]. For n-k=3, we take first 3 elements: 4,3,2. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to be a correct approach.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently in Python.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 1e6. So we need an O(n log n) approach. For each node, we sort its neighbors in descending order. For each node, the number of neighbors is O(1) on average (since it's a tree). But for each node, sorting its neighbors takes O(d log d), where d is the degree. For a tree, total degrees is O(n), so overall sorting steps are O(n log n) in total.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nFirst, read n and k.\n\nThen read n-1 edges.\n\nBuild adjacency list as a list of lists. For each node, store its neighbors.\n\nThen, for each node, sort its neighbors in descending order.\n\nThen perform BFS as described.\n\nOnce the traversal list is built, take the first (n -k) nodes. These are the nodes to keep. The rest are to be removed.\n\nThen, collect all nodes not in the traversal list's first (n -k) elements, sort them, and output.\n\nWait, but the traversal list contains all nodes, since it's a BFS starting from node n and visiting all nodes. Because the tree is connected. So the traversal list has exactly n nodes. So, the first (n -k) nodes are kept, and the rest (k) are removed.\n\nWait, no. Because the traversal list is built by visiting all nodes. So the first (n -k) nodes are the ones to keep, and the rest are to be removed.\n\nBut how to collect the ones to remove.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\ntraversal_order = list generated by BFS as described.\n\nkeep_nodes = traversal_order[:n -k]\n\nremove_nodes = [nodes not in keep_nodes]\n\nBut how to check which nodes are in keep_nodes. Since the traversal_order contains all nodes once, we can create a visited array, but perhaps it's easier to create a set of keep_nodes.\n\nBut for large n, using a set is O(1) per check.\n\nBut in Python, for n up to 1e6, creating a boolean array is feasible.\n\nSo:\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\nfor node in traversal_order[:n -k]:\n\n    visited[node] = True\n\nthen collect all nodes from 1 to n where visited is False.\n\nBut wait, the traversal_order contains all nodes, so the first (n -k) nodes are kept, and the rest are not. So the nodes to remove are the ones in traversal_order[n -k:].\n\nBut since the problem requires the output to be the districts to remove, sorted in increasing order.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample, traversal_order is [6,5,2,4,3,1]. The first 3 (n -k =6-3=3) are [6,5,2]. The rest are [4,3,1]. So the districts to remove are 4,3,1. Sorted gives 1,3,4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can collect the nodes to remove as traversal_order[n -k:], then sort them.\n\nYes! Because the traversal_order contains all nodes, and the first (n -k) are kept. The rest are removed. So the nodes to remove are the last k nodes in traversal_order. Then, we can collect them, sort them, and output.\n\nThis is a very efficient way. Because for the traversal_order list, which is of length n, we take the last k elements. Then sort them.\n\nBut why is this correct?\n\nBecause the traversal_order is built by visiting nodes in order of priority (higher numbers first), and the first (n -k) nodes are the ones kept. The rest are removed. So the nodes in traversal_order[n -k:] are the ones not kept, and hence to be removed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nBuild adjacency list.\n\nFor each node, sort its neighbors in descending order.\n\nPerform BFS starting from node n, adding nodes to traversal_order in the order they are visited.\n\nCollect the last k nodes in traversal_order, sort them, and output.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the previous example where the initial approach failed.\n\nExample where the tree is 1-2-3 and 2-4. n=4, k=1.\n\ntraversal_order is [4,2,3,1]. The first 3 nodes are 4,2,3. The last 1 node is [1]. Output is [1], which is correct.\n\nAnother example where the traversal_order would have the correct nodes.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nBut for large n (up to 1e6), we need to handle the BFS efficiently.\n\nImplementing the BFS:\n\nWe can use a deque for the queue. For each node, when we process it, we iterate through its sorted neighbors (descending order), and enqueue them if not visited.\n\nBut for each node, the adjacency list is stored as a list, and sorted once before processing.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor _ in range(n-1):\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    adj[a].append(b)\n\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\nThen, for each node in 1..n, sort adj[node] in descending order.\n\nBut for Python, for each node in adj, we can sort the list in reverse order.\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    adj[i].sort(reverse=True)\n\nThen perform BFS:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\ntraversal_order = []\n\nq = deque()\n\nq.append(n)\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\nwhile q:\n\n    u = q.popleft()\n\n    traversal_order.append(u)\n\n    for v in adj[u]:\n\n        if not visited[v]:\n\n            visited[v] = True\n\n            q.append(v)\n\nWait, but this is a standard BFS, but with the neighbors sorted in descending order. So when processing the neighbors of u, they are added in sorted order. However, since we are using a queue, the order of processing is level by level. For example, if u has neighbors sorted in descending order, then the first neighbor (highest) is added to the queue first, so when the next level is processed, it will process that neighbor first.\n\nYes. So this ensures that during BFS, higher-numbered nodes are processed earlier.\n\nOnce the traversal_order is built, the nodes to remove are the last k elements.\n\nThen, we collect those, sort them, and print.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the first sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3\n\nEdges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nAdjacency list for each node:\n\nnode 1: [2]\n\nnode 2: [6,4,3,1] (after sorting in reverse order?)\n\nWait, original edges for node 2: connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. When sorted in reverse order, they are 6,4,3,1. So adj[2] is [6,4,3,1].\n\nSimilarly, node 6's neighbors are 2,5. Sorted in reverse: 5,2.\n\nSo during BFS:\n\nstart with node 6. Add to traversal_order. Then process its neighbors: 5 and 2. Since they are sorted in reverse, first 5, then 2. So 5 is added to the queue first, then 2.\n\nWait, no. The code appends the neighbors in sorted order. For node 6's neighbors, which are [5,2], sorted in reverse (descending) order. So the adj[6] is [5,2].\n\nSo when processing node 6, we look at its neighbors 5 and 2. Both are unvisited. So we add them to the queue. Since we are using a deque and appending them in order, first 5 is added, then 2. So the queue is now [5, 2].\n\nNext, we process node 5 (popleft). Add to traversal_order. Its neighbors are [6]. 6 is already visited. So nothing added. Queue is [2].\n\nProcess node 2. Add to traversal_order. Its neighbors are [6,4,3,1]. 6 is visited. So check 4, 3, 1. All unvisited. So add them in order to the queue. The adj[2] is [6,4,3,1], but we process them in the order of the list. So for each v in adj[2], which are 6 (visited), 4 (unvisited), 3 (unvisited), 1 (unvisited). So we add 4, then 3, then 1. So the queue is now [4,3,1].\n\nNext, process 4. Add to traversal_order. Its neighbors are [2]. Already visited. So queue is [3,1].\n\nProcess 3. Add to traversal_order. Its neighbors are [2]. Already visited. Queue is [",

The key insight is that higher-numbered districts have exponentially more fans, so we should prioritize keeping them while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, which means there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since the number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`, we need to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We use BFS starting from the highest-numbered district (district `n`) to traverse the tree. During traversal, we prioritize visiting neighbors in descending order of their numbers to ensure we collect the highest-numbered districts first.\n4. **Traverse and Collect**: Using BFS, we collect the districts in an order that prioritizes higher numbers. After collecting all districts, the first `n-k` districts in this order are kept, and the remaining `k` districts are removed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        b = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n\n    # Sort each adjacency list in descending order\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        adj[i].sort(reverse=True)\n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    traversal_order = []\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(n)\n    visited[n] = True\n\n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        traversal_order.append(u)\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                q.append(v)\n\n    # The last k elements in traversal_order are the ones to remove\n    remove_list = traversal_order[-k:]\n    remove_list.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, remove_list)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts `n` and the number of contestants to remove `k`.\n2. **Building the Tree**: An adjacency list is constructed to represent the tree.\n3. **Sorting Neighbors**: Each node's neighbors are sorted in descending order to prioritize higher-numbered nodes during traversal.\n4. **BFS Traversal**: Starting from the highest-numbered node `n`, we perform BFS to traverse the tree, ensuring higher-numbered nodes are visited first.\n5. **Selecting Districts to Remove**: After BFS traversal, the last `k` nodes in the traversal order are selected for removal since they are the lower-numbered nodes that were processed later. These nodes are sorted and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by keeping the highest-numbered districts while maintaining connectivity through the BFS traversal.",
