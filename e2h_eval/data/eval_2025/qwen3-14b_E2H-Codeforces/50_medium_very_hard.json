    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nA good tree has edges with weights either 1 or -1. And for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. So for every node, the product of its adjacent edges is -1. \n\nHmm. Let's think about what this implies. For each node, the number of edges incident to it with weight -1 must be odd. Because the product of the edges is -1. Since each edge contributes either 1 or -1, the product is -1 only if there's an odd number of -1s. So for every node, the degree (number of edges connected to it) must have an odd number of -1s. Wait, but the product depends on the count of -1 edges. Let me think: the product of all edges incident to node i is (-1)^k * 1^{d_i -k} where k is the number of edges with -1. So that equals (-1)^k. This needs to be -1. Therefore, (-1)^k = -1 → k must be odd. So for each node, the number of edges incident to it with weight -1 is odd. \n\nBut how does that affect the structure of the tree? Well, since each edge connects two nodes. Let me think about the sum of all these conditions. Let's consider the sum over all nodes of the number of -1 edges incident to them. Each edge is counted twice in this sum (once for each endpoint). Let me denote that sum as S. Then S is equal to twice the total number of -1 edges. But each node contributes an odd number. So S is the sum of n odd numbers. The sum of n odd numbers is even if n is even, and odd if n is odd. But since S is twice the number of -1 edges, which is even. So this gives us that sum of n odd numbers must be even. Which implies that n must be even. Wait, because sum of n odds is even only if n is even. Because each odd is 2k+1, sum of n odds is 2*(sum of k_i) + n. So that sum is even iff n is even. \n\nSo this implies that when n is odd, there are no good trees. Because the sum would be even only if n is even. Therefore, if n is odd, the answer is zero. Let's check the sample input. For example, the second test case is n=1. Wait, n=1. But a tree with one node has zero edges. Then for that node, the product of edges (which is empty product, 1) must be -1. Which is impossible. So for n=1, there are no good trees. Hence the answer is zero. Which matches the sample input where n=1 outputs 0. Similarly, when n is odd, like 3, then there are no good trees. So in our code, first check if n is 1 or odd. If so, output 0. \n\nSo the first step is to check if n is even. If not, return 0. \n\nNow, assuming n is even. Then we need to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees. \n\nBut how to approach this? Let's think about the constraints for a good tree. \n\nEach edge is either +1 or -1. Also, for each node, the number of -1 edges incident to it is odd. \n\nLet me think about the structure of such trees. Let's consider that for any tree, each node has degree ≥1 (since it's a tree). But for the conditions, the number of -1 edges per node is odd. \n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think about the variables. Each edge has a weight, which is ±1. Let's think of the problem as assigning to each edge a value of ±1, such that for every node, the product of the edges around it is -1. \n\nAlternatively, for each node, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. \n\nBut since the product is multiplicative, perhaps there's some relation between the edges. \n\nLet me think about the product of all the products for all nodes. Let's compute that. \n\nFor each node i, product of edges incident to i is -1. Multiply all these products together. \n\nOn the left side, we get the product over all nodes of (product of edges adjacent to i). \n\nBut each edge is adjacent to two nodes. So each edge's weight is multiplied twice. So the overall product is the product of (each edge's weight)^2. Which is 1^ (number of edges). Because each edge's weight squared is 1. \n\nSo the product of all the node products is 1. \n\nOn the other hand, each node contributes -1, so the product is (-1)^n. \n\nTherefore, (-1)^n = 1. Which implies that n must be even. Which aligns with our previous conclusion. So when n is even, this condition is satisfied. So for even n, there exists possible good trees. \n\nSo now, given that n is even, how do we count the number of good trees and compute the required sum?\n\nBut the problem isn't to count the number of good trees, but to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees. \n\nLet me think about how to model this. \n\nFirst, note that for a tree, d(1,n) is the sum of the weights of the edges along the path from node 1 to node n. \n\nBut how can we compute the sum over all good trees of this value?\n\nLet me think of linearity of expectation. Wait, but here we're dealing with a sum over all possibilities. Maybe we can find the expected value of d(1,n) multiplied by the number of good trees. But perhaps there's a clever way to compute the contribution of each edge to the total sum. \n\nAlternatively, for each edge e, determine how many times it contributes +1 or -1 to the total sum across all good trees. Then multiply by the number of times it's present in the path from 1 to n. \n\nWait, but the problem is that the path from 1 to n depends on the structure of the tree. So for different trees, the path varies. So perhaps we need to find for each edge e, the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n in a good tree, multiplied by the number of good trees, multiplied by the weight of e (either +1 or -1). \n\nBut this seems complicated. However, maybe there's some symmetry or other properties that can help. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem with some constraints and find the total sum by considering the constraints. \n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For each node, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. \n\nThis seems similar to a system of equations. Let me think of each edge as a variable x_e ∈ {+1, -1}. For each node i, the product of x_e for all edges e adjacent to i is -1. \n\nBut solving this system may help us find the number of solutions, and perhaps also find the sum of certain functions over these solutions. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the system of equations. For each node i, the product of x_e around i is -1. \n\nLet me take the logarithm? Well, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, think in terms of parity. Since the product is -1, the number of -1 edges adjacent to i is odd. \n\nBut for each node, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it is odd. \n\nLet me consider the variables as the edges. For each edge, assign a variable which is 0 or 1, indicating whether it's -1 (1) or +1 (0). Then, for each node i, the sum of variables of edges adjacent to i is congruent to 1 mod 2. \n\nSo the problem reduces to solving a system of linear equations over GF(2). \n\nBut the system is: for each node i, sum_{e adjacent to i} x_e ≡ 1 mod 2. \n\nBut the system may not be independent. Let's see. \n\nThe sum of all equations: sum_{i} (sum_{e adjacent to i} x_e) ) ≡ n mod 2. \n\nBut each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint). So the left side is 2 * sum_e x_e ≡ 0 mod 2. \n\nThus, the right side must be 0 mod 2. Which is true since n is even. \n\nSo the system is consistent. \n\nNow, the number of solutions is 2^{m}, where m is the number of variables minus the rank of the system. \n\nBut the system has n equations. However, they are not independent. Because the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2, which is satisfied since n is even. \n\nSo the rank of the system is (n-1). Because the equations are dependent. So the dimension of the solution space is (number of variables) - (rank). \n\nNumber of variables is (n-1), since a tree has n-1 edges. \n\nSo the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } ? No, wait. The rank of the system is (n-1) - 1? Or what? \n\nWait, the system has n equations, but they are not all independent. The sum of all equations is 0 mod 2. So the rank is at most (n-1). But what's the actual rank?\n\nLet me think for a tree. Let's take the example of n=2. There is one edge. The equations for node 1 and node 2: each has exactly one edge. So the sum for node 1 is x_1 ≡ 1 mod 2. Similarly for node 2: x_1 ≡ 1 mod 2. So the equations are the same. Thus, the rank is 1. So the number of solutions is 2^{(number of variables) - rank} = 2^{1 - 1} = 1. Which matches the first sample input. \n\nFor n=4, the sample input says that there are 16 good trees. Let's check. \n\nNumber of variables is 3 edges. The system has 4 equations, but they are dependent. The rank is 3. Because if we have equations for nodes 1,2,3, then the equation for node 4 is determined. So the number of solutions is 2^{3 - 3} = 1? But the sample says for n=4, there are 16 good trees. Wait, this contradicts. \n\nWait, this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect. \n\nWait, the sample for n=4 says that there are 16 good trees. Let's think again. \n\nWait, the total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}. For n=4, that's 4^2 * 2^3 = 16 * 8 = 128. But the number of good trees is 16. How does that fit into the system of equations?\n\nAh, because the system of equations is not just about the edge weights. Because the trees themselves are part of the problem. \n\nWait, earlier I thought that the variables are the edge weights, but the system of equations is for the edge weights of a fixed tree. So for each tree, the system of equations is a set of constraints on the edge weights. So the number of good trees is the number of trees multiplied by the number of valid weight assignments for that tree. \n\nBut if for each tree, the number of valid weight assignments is 2^{k}, where k is something. \n\nSo the total number of good trees is (number of trees) × (number of valid assignments per tree). \n\nBut the sample for n=4 says that there are 16 good trees. Let's compute that. \n\nNumber of trees for n=4 is 4^{2} = 16. So for each tree, the number of valid assignments is 1. Then 16 × 1 = 16. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo for each tree, the number of valid assignments is 1. Which suggests that the system of equations has exactly one solution. \n\nBut how? Let me think again. \n\nFor a given tree structure, the system of equations is: for each node, the sum of variables (x_e) for edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. \n\nBut for a tree, the system has n equations. However, the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2 (as discussed before). Since n is even, this is satisfied. So the system has n-1 independent equations, and the rank is n-1. Therefore, the number of solutions is 2^{(number of variables) - (rank)}. \n\nNumber of variables is (n-1) (edges). Rank is (n-1) - 1? Or n-1? \n\nWait, for example, in the case of n=2, the number of variables is 1, the rank is 1 (the equations are same for both nodes). So the number of solutions is 2^{1 - 1} = 1. Which is correct. \n\nIn the case of n=4, the number of variables is 3. The system has 4 equations, but they are dependent. The rank is 3. So the number of solutions is 2^{3 - 3} = 1. Which would mean that for each tree, there is exactly one valid assignment of weights. Therefore, the total number of good trees is (number of trees) × 1 = 4^{n-2} × 1. For n=4, 4^2 = 16, which matches the sample. \n\nSo this suggests that for any tree structure, the system of equations has exactly one solution. So the number of valid weightings per tree is 1. \n\nBut how? Because the system is a system of linear equations over GF(2). For a tree, the system is such that the equations are dependent. So the rank is n-1, and the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1. \n\nYes. Because the system has n equations, but the rank is n-1, and the number of variables is n-1. So the solution space is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1. \n\nSo for any tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign the edge weights so that the product condition is satisfied. \n\nThat's a key insight! \n\nTherefore, the number of good trees is equal to the number of possible trees (n^{n-2}) multiplied by 1. So the total number of good trees is n^{n-2}. \n\nBut wait, for n=2, that gives 2^{0} = 1, which matches the first sample. For n=4, 4^2 = 16, which matches the third sample. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nNow, the problem is to compute the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees. \n\nBut since for each tree, there's exactly one valid weighting, the sum is equal to the sum over all trees (T) of d_T(1,n), where d_T(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights on the path from 1 to n in tree T, with the unique weighting that makes T a good tree. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: for each tree T, compute the sum of edge weights on the path from 1 to n in T, under the unique valid weighting of edges, and sum all those values across all trees T. \n\nSo how to compute this sum?\n\nLet me think about the unique weighting for a given tree. \n\nFor a given tree, the edge weights are determined by the system of equations. \n\nBut how can we find the edge weights? \n\nLet me think of the system again. For each node, the sum of x_e (mod 2) for edges adjacent to it is 1. \n\nThis is equivalent to saying that the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to node i is 1 mod 2. \n\nBut since the system has exactly one solution, we can find x_e in terms of some variables. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to express the edge weights in terms of the tree structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a clever way to compute the sum over all trees of d(1,n) under their unique weighting. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think of the following approach: For each tree T, the unique weighting is determined by the equations. Let me think of the variables x_e as the edge weights (either ±1). For each edge e, x_e is either +1 or -1. \n\nBut since the system is linear over GF(2), perhaps there's a way to express x_e as some function of the tree structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the value of d(1,n) in terms of the tree structure. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the system of equations again. For each node i, the sum of x_e (mod 2) for edges adjacent to i is 1. \n\nLet me consider that the sum over all edges adjacent to node i of x_e is 1 mod 2. \n\nIf I think of x_e as variables in GF(2), then this is a system of equations. \n\nLet me think of the system as follows. Let me pick a root for the tree, say node 1. Then, for each node except the root, we can assign x_e based on the parent's constraints. \n\nWait, but how? Let me think recursively. Suppose I have a tree rooted at node 1. For each node, the sum of x_e for its adjacent edges must be 1. \n\nLet me imagine that for each node, except the root, I can assign x_e (the edge from the node to its parent) based on the constraints. \n\nLet me take an example. Suppose we have a tree rooted at node 1. For each node v, let's consider the edge from v to its parent p(v). Let me call this edge e_v. \n\nFor the root node (node 1), the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. \n\nFor each other node v, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to it includes x_e_v (the edge to the parent) and the edges to children. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to assign x_e_v such that the constraints are satisfied. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the system as follows. Let me choose an arbitrary spanning tree. Then, the system of equations can be solved by setting variables in a way that propagates constraints. \n\nLet me try to model this. Let me pick an arbitrary tree structure. Let me root the tree at node 1. For each node except the root, there is exactly one parent. \n\nLet me denote the edge from node v to its parent as e_v. \n\nNow, for each node v (except root), let's define the value of x_{e_v} as follows. \n\nThe sum of x_e for edges adjacent to v must be 1 mod 2. The edges adjacent to v are e_v (to parent) and the edges to children. \n\nBut if I can express the sum for each node in terms of the edges to children and the parent edge. \n\nBut this seems recursive. Let me think of the root node first. \n\nFor the root node, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it (which are edges to children) must be 1 mod 2. \n\nFor non-root nodes, suppose that for each node v, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. \n\nBut the edges adjacent to v are the edge to its parent (e_v) and edges to children. Let me denote the sum of x_e for edges to children as S_v. Then, the equation is x_{e_v} + S_v = 1 mod 2. Therefore, x_{e_v} = 1 + S_v mod 2. \n\nBut how to compute S_v? \n\nThis seems like a recursive approach. For example, for a leaf node (other than the root), S_v is 0 (no children), so x_{e_v} = 1 mod 2. \n\nBut then, for the parent of that leaf, the S_v would include x_{e_leaf} (which is 1) plus other children edges. \n\nBut this seems complex. However, perhaps there's a way to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value of x_e for each edge can be determined based on the parity of the number of nodes in some subtree. \n\nAlternatively, since the system of equations has a unique solution, perhaps the value of x_e for each edge is determined by the parity of the number of nodes in a certain way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of all x_e around the tree is related to the number of nodes. \n\nBut I'm stuck here. Let me think of another approach. \n\nSince for each tree, there's exactly one valid assignment of edge weights. So for each tree, the sum d(1,n) is determined uniquely. \n\nBut how to compute the sum over all trees of this value?\n\nMaybe we can find that for each tree, d(1,n) is equal to -1 multiplied by the number of edges on the path from 1 to n. Or something similar. \n\nWait, in the first sample, n=2. The tree has one edge. The unique assignment is x_e = -1. So d(1,2) is -1. \n\nIn the third sample, n=4. The sum of d(1,4) across all good trees is -10. \n\nBut how to find this? \n\nLet me think about the sum of d(1,n) over all trees. Since each tree contributes exactly once. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this using generating functions or combinatorics. \n\nAnother idea: since each edge's weight is determined uniquely by the tree structure, maybe we can find for each edge e, the contribution of e to the total sum. That is, for each edge e, compute how many trees have e on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the expected value of x_e (the weight) in those trees. \n\nBut since each tree contributes exactly once, and for each tree, the weight of e is either +1 or -1. \n\nSo the total sum is the sum over all edges e of [ (number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n) × (expected value of x_e for those trees) ].\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBut how to find the expected value of x_e for trees where e is on the path from 1 to n. \n\nAlternatively, for each edge e, let's find the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the value of x_e in those trees. \n\nBut how to find x_e for a given tree and edge e? \n\nAlternatively, since the edge weights are uniquely determined by the tree's structure, perhaps there's a relation between the position of the edge in the tree and its weight. \n\nLet me think again about the system of equations. For each tree, the system of equations defines x_e. \n\nBut how to find x_e for a particular edge? \n\nLet me consider that the system is a set of equations where each equation corresponds to a node. Let me imagine that I can solve this system for x_e. \n\nLet me think of the equations again. For each node i, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to i is 1 mod 2. \n\nLet me think of the tree as a graph. Let me pick an arbitrary root, say node 1. For each node, except the root, there is exactly one parent. Let me denote the edge from node v to its parent as e_v. \n\nNow, for the root node, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it (i.e., edges to children) is 1 mod 2. \n\nFor each other node v, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to it is x_e_v (the edge to the parent) plus the sum of x_e for edges to children. This must be 1 mod 2. \n\nLet me denote for each node v, s_v as the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to v, excluding the edge to the parent. For the root, the parent edge doesn't exist, so s_root is the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it. \n\nFor non-root nodes, the equation is x_e_v + s_v = 1 mod 2. Therefore, x_e_v = 1 + s_v mod 2. \n\nBut s_v is the sum of x_e for edges to children of v. \n\nThis suggests a recursive way to compute the x_e values. \n\nLet me think of this recursively. Starting from the leaves and moving up to the root. \n\nFor a leaf node v (not the root), it has no children. So s_v = 0. Hence, x_e_v = 1 + 0 = 1 mod 2. So the edge from v to its parent has x_e_v = 1. \n\nThen, for the parent of v, the s_parent includes x_e_v. \n\nThis seems like a way to compute x_e for each edge. \n\nBut how does this affect the root? \n\nLet me think of the root node. For the root, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it (edges to children) is 1 mod 2. Let's denote this sum as S_root. \n\nBut according to the equations, S_root = 1 mod 2. \n\nBut how is this compatible with the recursive calculation? \n\nLet me take an example. Suppose we have a tree with root 1 and two children, 2 and 3. \n\nEach of 2 and 3 is a leaf. \n\nFor node 2: s_2 = 0 → x_e_2 = 1 mod 2. Similarly, for node 3: x_e_3 = 1 mod 2. \n\nThe root node's sum is x_e_2 + x_e_3 = 1 + 1 = 2 mod 2 = 0. But according to the equation, this should be 1 mod 2. Contradiction. \n\nWait, this suggests that there's an inconsistency. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, because the root's equation is that the sum of x_e for its adjacent edges is 1 mod 2. In this example, the sum is 0. So this would violate the equation. \n\nWhich suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. \n\nBut earlier analysis said that there is exactly one solution for the system. So where is the mistake here?\n\nLet me re-examine the equations. \n\nIn this example, the tree has three nodes: 1 (root), 2, and 3. Each connected to 1. \n\nThe equations for nodes 1, 2, and 3:\n\nFor node 1: x_12 + x_13 = 1 mod 2.\n\nFor node 2: x_12 = 1 mod 2.\n\nFor node 3: x_13 = 1 mod 2.\n\nSolving these equations: x_12 = 1, x_13 = 1. Then the sum for node 1 is 1 + 1 = 2 mod 2 = 0, which is not equal to 1. Contradiction. \n\nBut this suggests that there is no solution. Which contradicts the previous conclusion that there is exactly one solution. \n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh! Wait, earlier I thought that the system has exactly one solution for any tree. But in this case, the system has no solution. \n\nBut why? \n\nBecause for this tree, n=3, which is odd. So according to our earlier analysis, there are no solutions. But in this case, the tree is for n=3. Which is odd. So the system is inconsistent. \n\nAh! Right! Earlier, we concluded that when n is even, the system is consistent, and when n is odd, it's not. So in this case, n is 3, which is odd, so there are no solutions. \n\nBut in our previous example with n=4, the system is consistent. \n\nSo the problem arises only when n is even. \n\nSo for even n, the system has exactly one solution. \n\nSo back to the case where n is even. \n\nLet me take an example with n=4. Suppose the tree is a star with root 1 connected to nodes 2, 3, 4. \n\nFor this tree, let's try to find the solution. \n\nEquations:\n\nNode 1: x_12 + x_13 + x_14 = 1 mod 2.\n\nNode 2: x_12 = 1 mod 2.\n\nNode 3: x_13 = 1 mod 2.\n\nNode 4: x_14 = 1 mod 2.\n\nAdding the equations for nodes 2,3,4: x_12 + x_13 + x_14 = 3 mod 2 = 1 mod 2. Which matches the equation for node 1. So the solution is x_12=x_13=x_14=1. \n\nSo the sum for node 1 is 1+1+1 = 3 mod 2 = 1. Correct. \n\nSo for this tree, the edge weights are all -1. \n\nThen, the path from 1 to 4 is just the edge between them. So d(1,4) is -1. \n\nBut according to the third sample, for n=4, the sum over all good trees of d(1,4) is -10. \n\nSo for this particular tree, the contribution is -1. \n\nBut there are 4^{2} = 16 trees. So there are 16 different trees, each contributing some value. \n\nBut how to find the sum across all trees?\n\nThis brings me back to the original problem. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each tree T, the value of d(1,n) is equal to the sum of the edge weights on the path from 1 to n. Each edge's weight is determined by the system of equations. \n\nBut how to find this sum across all trees?\n\nMaybe we can find that for each tree, the value of d(1,n) is equal to -1 multiplied by the number of edges in the path from 1 to n. Or something similar. \n\nBut in the star example, the path from 1 to 4 has 1 edge, and the weight is -1. So d(1,4) is -1. \n\nIn another example, suppose the tree is a chain: 1-2-3-4. Let's find the edge weights. \n\nFor this tree, the equations are:\n\nNode 1: x_12 = 1 mod 2.\n\nNode 2: x_12 + x_23 = 1 mod 2.\n\nNode 3: x_23 + x_34 = 1 mod 2.\n\nNode 4: x_34 = 1 mod 2.\n\nSolving:\n\nFrom node 1: x_12 = 1 → x_12 = 1.\n\nFrom node 2: 1 + x_23 = 1 → x_23 = 0.\n\nFrom node 4: x_34 = 1.\n\nFrom node 3: 0 + x_34 = 1 → 0 + 1 = 1 → ok.\n\nSo the edge weights are x_12 = 1 (so weight -1?), wait no: earlier we were using x_e as 0/1 for the parity. But the actual weight is -1 if x_e is 1, and +1 if x_e is 0. \n\nWait, earlier I was thinking of x_e as variables in GF(2), where x_e is 0 or 1, representing whether the edge has weight -1 (if x_e=1) or +1 (if x_e=0). \n\nSo the actual weight is (-1)^{x_e}.\n\nSo in the above example, the edge weights are:\n\nx_12 = 1 → weight -1.\n\nx_23 = 0 → weight +1.\n\nx_34 = 1 → weight -1.\n\nSo the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4. Sum is -1 + 1 + (-1) = -1. \n\nSo d(1,4) is -1. \n\nBut what about another tree structure? Let's think of another tree for n=4. \n\nSuppose the tree is 1-2, 1-3, 2-4. \n\nLet me solve the equations for this tree. \n\nNodes are 1, 2, 3, 4. \n\nEdges: e1 (1-2), e2 (1-3), e3 (2-4). \n\nEquations:\n\nNode 1: e1 + e2 = 1 mod 2.\n\nNode 2: e1 + e3 = 1 mod 2.\n\nNode 3: e2 = 1 mod 2.\n\nNode 4: e3 = 1 mod 2.\n\nFrom node 3: e2 = 1.\n\nFrom node 4: e3 = 1.\n\nFrom node 2: e1 + 1 = 1 → e1 = 0.\n\nFrom node 1: 0 + 1 = 1 → ok.\n\nSo the edge weights are:\n\ne1: 0 → +1.\n\ne2: 1 → -1.\n\ne3: 1 → -1.\n\nPath from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4. Sum is +1 + (-1) = 0. \n\nSo d(1,4) is 0. \n\nSo this tree contributes 0. \n\nSo depending on the tree structure, the value of d(1,n) varies. \n\nBut how to find the sum across all trees? \n\nPerhaps there's a pattern. Let me think about the contribution of each edge to the total sum. \n\nLet me think of the following idea: For each tree T, the value of d(1,n) is equal to the sum of the weights of the edges on the path from 1 to n. \n\nLet me denote this path as P_T. \n\nNow, for each edge e, let me compute how often e is present in P_T across all trees T, multiplied by the expected value of its weight in those cases. \n\nBut how to find this expected value?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight of each edge is determined by the system of equations, perhaps there's a relationship between the position of the edge in the tree and its weight. \n\nLet me think of the tree as a rooted tree (rooted at 1). For each edge e, which connects a node v to its parent u. \n\nLet me define for each node v (other than the root), a variable s_v, which is 1 if the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at v is odd, and 0 otherwise. Or something similar. \n\nBut this might not be directly applicable. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that for a rooted tree, the value of x_e for the edge from v to its parent u is determined by the equations. \n\nEarlier, we tried to derive that for non-root nodes, x_e_v = 1 + s_v mod 2, where s_v is the sum of x_e for edges to children of v. \n\nBut how can we find this recursively?\n\nLet me think recursively. Assume that for each subtree, we can compute s_v. \n\nFor a leaf node (excluding root), s_v is 0 (no children), so x_e_v = 1 mod 2. \n\nFor a node v with children, s_v is the sum of x_e for edges to children. \n\nBut how does this relate to the root? \n\nLet me think of the entire tree. The root has s_root = sum of x_e for edges to children. And for the root, this sum must be 1 mod 2. \n\nBut how does this relate to the rest of the tree?\n\nIt seems that the value of x_e for each edge depends on the structure of the subtree. \n\nBut how can this be generalized? \n\nLet me think of the following approach: For each edge e, which is part of the tree, the value of x_e is determined by the parity of the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the child of e. \n\nWait, let me think. Suppose we have an edge e connecting node u (parent) and node v (child). Let's say that the subtree rooted at v has k nodes. \n\nIf k is odd, then x_e is 1; else, x_e is 0? Or something like that. \n\nLet me test this hypothesis. \n\nIn the first example where the tree is a star with root 1 and children 2, 3, 4. For each edge (1-2), the subtree rooted at 2 has 1 node (odd), so x_e is 1. Similarly for others. Which matches the earlier result. \n\nIn the chain example 1-2-3-4, the edge between 2 and 3: the subtree rooted at 3 has 1 node (odd), so x_e is 1. But earlier we found that x_e for edge 2-3 was 0. So this contradicts the hypothesis. \n\nHmm. So that idea is incorrect. \n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the value of x_e depends on the parity of the size of the subtree. Let me think again. \n\nIn the chain example 1-2-3-4, the edge between 1 and 2 is part of the subtree rooted at 2, which has 3 nodes (2, 3, 4). Size",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the distances from node 1 to node n in all good edge-weighted trees, where each tree is defined by specific constraints on edge weights and vertex products. The solution involves leveraging combinatorial properties and modular arithmetic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: A tree is considered good if each edge has a weight of either +1 or -1, and for each vertex, the product of the weights of all incident edges is -1. This implies that each vertex must have an odd number of -1 edges incident to it.\n2. **Parity Constraints**: For a tree with n vertices, the sum of all vertex constraints (each requiring an odd number of -1 edges) results in an even total count of -1 edges. This is only possible if n is even.\n3. **Tree Counting**: Using Cayley's formula, the number of labeled trees on n vertices is $n^{n-2}$. For each tree, there is exactly one valid assignment of edge weights that satisfies the good tree conditions.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Given the constraints, we use modulo $998244353$ to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # We need to compute the answer as follows:\n    # For even n >= 2, the answer is (-1) * (n-1) * (n^(n-2)) mod MOD\n    # But wait, let's think again.
