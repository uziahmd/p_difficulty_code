Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads. Each road is a line equation. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home's block to university's block. A step is moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. So, adjacent blocks through a line segment (not just a point) are considered adjacent.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? Well, each block can be considered as a node in a graph, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent. Then the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between the home's block and the university's block.\n\nBut the problem is that there are potentially infinitely many blocks. So how can I model this without enumerating all possible blocks?\n\nWait, but maybe there's another approach. Since each road is a line, the arrangement of lines divides the plane into regions. The key insight here is that the adjacency between regions depends on the lines. But how can I represent the regions in a way that allows me to compute the shortest path?\n\nAlternative idea: Think of each region as being determined by the signs of the equations of the lines. For example, for each line, a point is either on one side or the other. So for each line, we can determine whether the home point is on the positive or negative side. Similarly for the university point. Then, the problem becomes similar to navigating through a grid where each line adds a dimension, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, but perhaps the movement between regions is equivalent to flipping the sign of one of the line equations. Because when you cross a line, you change the sign of that particular line's equation. So, the regions can be represented by a vector of signs for each line. But since there are n lines, each with two possibilities (positive or negative), there are 2^n possible regions. However, n can be up to 300, so 2^300 is way too big to handle directly. That's impossible.\n\nBut given that n is up to 300, we can't represent all possible regions. So this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the movement between regions is allowed if they share a common border (i.e., differ by exactly one line's sign), then the problem can be modeled as a BFS where each state is the set of signs (but again, with 300 lines, that's not feasible).\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the problem differently. The home and university are points not on any line. For each line, we can determine whether the home is on one side or the other. Similarly for the university. The question is: how many lines have different signs between home and university? Because each time you cross a line, you flip the sign for that line. So the minimal steps would be the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. Wait, no, that's not necessarily correct. Because if two lines cross, you can cross them in some order. But perhaps the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose that the home and university are in regions that are separated by k lines. Then, the minimal steps required is k. Because each step crosses one line. For example, if there's one line between them, you can cross it once. If there are two lines, you need to cross both, but maybe you can do it in two steps. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the regions as nodes in a graph where each node is connected to others if they share a common border. Then the minimal steps is the minimal number of lines that you need to cross to get from the home's region to the university's region. But how to compute that?\n\nBut how do I find the minimal number of lines that separate the home and university? Because each line that separates them contributes to the minimal steps. Wait, perhaps the minimal steps is equal to the number of lines that separate the home and university. Because each such line must be crossed once. But if two lines cross each other, perhaps you can cross them in a way that requires only one step? No, because crossing a line takes you from one region to another. So if two lines cross, the regions are divided in a way that crossing one line may require passing through another line's region. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, here's an example. Suppose there are two lines that cross each other, forming four regions. If the home is in one region and the university is in the opposite region (the one across both lines), then the minimal steps would be two. Because you need to cross both lines. Alternatively, if you cross one line first, then cross the other. But each step is crossing a line. So two steps.\n\nAnother example: if the home and university are in regions that are separated by three lines, then you need three steps. So the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nBut how do I compute the number of lines that separate the home and university?\n\nWait, for each line, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the line. If they are, then that line is a separator between the two regions. The minimal steps would be the number of such lines. Because each such line must be crossed once. Because if you have to cross a line to get from one region to another, and each such line is a separator, then the minimal steps is the number of separators.\n\nBut why is that correct?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the home and university are in regions that are separated by k lines. Then, the minimal steps required is k. Because each step can cross one line, and each line that separates the two regions must be crossed once. Because if you have two regions, the minimal path between them is crossing each of the separating lines once. But how can that be?\n\nFor example, imagine two lines that cross each other. The home is in one region, the university is in the opposite region. There are two lines separating them. So the minimal steps is 2. Which is correct. Now, suppose that there are three lines arranged in a way that the home and university are separated by three lines. Then, the minimal steps is 3.\n\nBut how can we know that the minimal steps is exactly the number of lines that separate the home and university?\n\nThis seems to be the case. Because each time you cross a line, you can flip the sign for that line. So the home and university are in regions that differ in exactly the lines that separate them. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate them.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nLet me take the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0, and 1x + 0y +0 = 0 → x=0.\n\nSo the home (1,1) is above y=0 (since y=1>0) and to the right of x=0 (x=1>0). The university is (-1,-1) which is below y=0 (y=-1 <0) and left of x=0 (x=-1 <0). So for each line, the home and university are on opposite sides. So for both lines, they are separated. So the count is 2. The output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, and x + y -3 = 0. Let's check for each line.\n\nFor x=0: home is x=1>0, university x=-1 <0 → opposite. So count +=1.\n\nFor y=0: same as above, count +=1.\n\nFor x + y -3 = 0. Let's plug in home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0. University (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. Both are on the same side. So this line does not separate them. So total count is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the answer is the number of lines that separate the home and university. So the problem reduces to counting the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nBut wait, how can this be? Because what if there are multiple lines that cross each other, but the home and university are separated by some lines but not others?\n\nBut according to the sample, this approach works. Let me think of another example.\n\nSuppose there are two parallel lines. Home is on one side of both, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, the number of separating lines is two. But to get from home to university, you need to cross both lines. So steps is two. Which matches the count.\n\nAnother example: three lines arranged in a way that home and university are separated by one line. Then steps is 1.\n\nSo this seems to hold. Therefore, the solution is to compute the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nFor each line, evaluate the sign of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If their product is negative, then the points are on opposite sides of the line, so count it.\n\nYes. Because if the product is negative, that means one is positive and the other is negative. So the line separates them.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each line, compute value1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i.\n\n- Compute value2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i.\n\n- If value1 * value2 < 0, then increment the count.\n\nThe answer is the count.\n\nWait, but why is this the case?\n\nBecause each such line is a separator between the home and university. So the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where two lines are crossed, but the minimal steps is less than the count? Or is that impossible?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that there are two lines that cross each other. The home is in a region, and the university is in a region that is separated by both lines. So the count is 2. But can you move from home to university in one step? No, because the two lines cross, so their regions are adjacent? No. Because to get from one region to another, you need to cross a line. If two lines cross, then the regions are divided in such a way that moving from one region to another requires crossing one line. But if the two lines are crossed, then the home and university regions are separated by two lines. So the minimal steps would be 2. So the count is correct.\n\nBut how does that work? Let me think of the two lines x=0 and y=0. The home is (1,1), and the university is (-1,-1). They are separated by both lines. So the minimal steps is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut if the home is (1,1) and the university is (-1, 1), then they are separated by the line x=0. The line y=0 does not separate them. So the count is 1. The steps is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo the answer is indeed the count of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nSo the problem reduces to this simple calculation.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university coordinates (x2, y2), read n lines, for each line, compute the value for home and university. Check if their product is negative. Count the number of such lines.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nWait, but what about the case when the home and university are in the same region? Then the count is zero. So the answer is zero steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut how can that happen? For example, if there are no lines, then the entire plane is one region. So the answer is zero steps.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, n can be 1. So for example, if there is one line, and home and university are on the same side of that line, then the answer is zero steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of the n lines:\n\n   a, b, c = coefficients.\n\n   val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n   val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n   if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n       count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but the sample input shows that in the first case, the answer is 2. Which is exactly the count of lines that separate them. So that works.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because each line that separates them must be crossed once. And each step allows you to cross exactly one line. So the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses each of these lines once, and no more?\n\nBecause each line that separates the home and university is part of the minimal path. For example, imagine that you have to cross each of those lines once. Since each crossing takes you from one region to another, and the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate them.\n\nThis seems to be the case. So this approach is correct.\n\nSo the code is very simple. Just count the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nLet me test this against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Two lines: y=0 and x=0.\n\nFor the first line (y=0): val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line (x=0): val1 = 1*1 + 0*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Three lines: x=0, y=0, x + y -3=0.\n\nFor the third line, val1 = 1 +1 -3 = -1. val2 = -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So no count. So total count is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are same region. So no lines separate them. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: one line. home is on one side, university on the other. Output is 1.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nWe need to read the input. Let's see.\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines, each with a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of the n lines:\n\n   a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n   val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n   val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n   if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n       count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the line is vertical or horizontal? No problem. The code handles all lines.\n\nSo this is the solution. It's very easy. The problem says it's a very easy question. So this is the correct approach.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let's implement it.\n\nNow, let's test for possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=0? But according to input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, no. The third line is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So no. So n is at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when a line is such that home and university are exactly on the line. But the problem statement says that neither home nor university is on any road. So the input ensures that val1 and val2 are not zero. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is as follows.\n",
