Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the blocks are structured. Each road divides the plane into regions. The key here is that moving between blocks requires crossing a road, but only if they share a common segment. So, two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by a single road (i.e., they share a part of that road). But how do I model this?\n\nThe main challenge is to model the blocks and their adjacency. However, directly modeling all blocks isn't feasible because there can be an exponential number of regions created by n lines. So, we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of considering the blocks, think about the regions in terms of their position relative to each line. For each line, a point is either on one side or the other. Since each line divides the plane into two half-planes, the position of a point relative to all lines can be represented as a binary string. But since there are n lines, this would be a binary vector of length n. However, two regions are adjacent if they differ by exactly one line. Because if two regions differ in exactly one line, then they are separated by that line, which implies they share a common boundary. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose two regions are separated by exactly one line. Then, they are adjacent. Because the line is the boundary between them. So, if you cross that line, you move from one region to another. Therefore, the adjacency between regions can be modeled as two regions being connected if their binary representations differ in exactly one bit (i.e., one line's sign). But wait, maybe not exactly. Because each line is a road. So, for each line, the region is on one side or the other. So, each region is uniquely determined by the sign of each line's equation evaluated at that point. So, the home and the university are points not lying on any line, so for each line, their value (a_i x + b_i y + c_i) is non-zero. Therefore, for each line, we can compute the sign (positive or negative) of that value. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of steps needed to change the sign vector of the home point to that of the university point, where each step allows flipping exactly one bit (since each step corresponds to crossing a road, which changes the sign of exactly one line). Wait, no. Because when you cross a road, you change the sign of exactly that road's equation. So, the regions adjacent to each other are those that differ in exactly one line's sign. So, the problem becomes a graph where each node is a possible sign vector, and edges exist between vectors that differ in exactly one position. Then, the problem is to find the minimum number of steps (edge traversals) between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector.\n\nBut wait, that's only true if the regions are connected in such a way. However, perhaps the actual adjacency is more complex. For example, two regions could be separated by multiple roads, but that's not possible. Because each time you cross a road, you flip one bit. So the minimal steps between two regions is the number of differing bits between their sign vectors. Wait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because if two regions differ in k bits, then the minimal steps is k. Because you can flip each differing bit one by one. But is that allowed? Because each step is moving across a road, which flips exactly one bit. So, the minimal steps between the home and the university is the hamming distance between their sign vectors. \n\nBut wait, that seems too simple. Let me check with the example given.\n\nTake the first example input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 (which is y=0), and 1x + 0y +0 =0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor the first road (y=0): 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 >0. So sign is +.\n\nFor the second road (x=0): 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 =1>0. Sign is +. So the sign vector is [+, +].\n\nFor university (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. Sign is -.\n\nSecond road: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. Sign is -.\n\nSo the sign vector is [-, -]. The hamming distance between [+,+] and [-,-] is 2. Which matches the output of 2. \n\nIn the second example, the input is:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. Let's compute the sign vectors.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFirst road x=0: 1>0 → +.\n\nSecond road y=0: 1>0 → +.\n\nThird road x+y-3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\n\nSo sign vector is [+, +, -].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road x=0: -1 <0 → -.\n\nSecond road y=0: -1 <0 → -.\n\nThird road x+y-3 = -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -.\n\nSign vector is [-, -, -]. Hamming distance is 2 (the first two bits differ). So the answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the answer is indeed the hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university. \n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which flips one bit. So, the minimal steps is the number of differing bits. Because each differing bit can be flipped one by one. \n\nBut why can't there be a case where two differing bits can be fixed with fewer steps? For example, if two bits differ, but there's a path that crosses two roads, but maybe some other way? Well, the hamming distance is the minimal number of steps. Because each step can fix exactly one differing bit. So, if there are k differing bits, you need at least k steps. And since you can flip each one individually, it's possible. Therefore, the minimal steps is the hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor the home point and the university point, compute for each road whether the point is on the positive or negative side. Then, count how many roads have different signs between the two points. That's the answer.\n\nWait, that's so simple. But how can that be? Because the problem says that moving between blocks requires that they share a common border. But according to this approach, even if two regions differ in two bits, you can cross them in two steps. But how does that work?\n\nLet me think of a scenario. Suppose there are two roads, x=0 and y=0. The home is in (+,+), the university is (-,-). The minimal steps is 2. Which is correct, because you have to cross x=0 and then y=0. Or cross y=0 then x=0. So the answer is 2. \n\nAnother example: suppose home is (+, +), university is (+, -). Then the answer is 1 step. Because you cross the second road. \n\nSo this approach seems correct. Therefore, the solution is to compute for each road, the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. For each road, if the signs differ, increment the count. The total count is the answer.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each differing sign indicates that the two points are on opposite sides of that road. So, to get from home to university, you need to cross that road. But each crossing is a step. However, if two roads are crossed, then you need two steps. \n\nBut how does this account for the fact that crossing a road may not be possible if there are other roads? For example, imagine that two points are on opposite sides of a road, but there's another road that blocks the way. But according to the problem statement, the roads are infinite lines. So, any two regions that differ in exactly one sign are adjacent. Because the road is a line, and the regions on either side of it are adjacent. Therefore, regardless of other roads, crossing that road is possible. \n\nWait, but other roads may intersect this road. But the problem states that the movement is allowed between two blocks if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, if two regions are separated by a road, then they share a common border (the entire road, except for intersections with other roads). But the problem says that the movement is allowed if the common border has non-zero length. So, even if the road is intersected by other roads, there are segments of the road that are part of the border between the two regions. Hence, the two regions are adjacent. Therefore, the minimal steps is indeed the hamming distance between the sign vectors.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. For each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) for the home point. Similarly compute for the university point. \n\n2. For each road, check if the signs of these two values are different. If yes, increment the count.\n\n3. Output the count.\n\nBut wait, how to compute the sign? For each road, for the home point, compute the value. If it's positive, then the sign is +, else -. Similarly for the university. If the two signs are different, then it contributes to the count.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the value is zero? However, the problem says that neither home nor university is on any road. So for all roads, the computed values are non-zero. So we don't need to worry about that.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n roads. For each road, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. For each road, check if (val1 * val2) < 0. If so, increment the count. Output the count.\n\nWait, that's all? Because if val1 and val2 have different signs, then their product is negative. So for each road, check if (val1 * val2) < 0. The total count is the answer.\n\nYes! Because that's exactly the condition that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. So, for each such road, the two points are in regions that differ in that road's sign. Therefore, the hamming distance is the number of roads where this is true.\n\nThis seems extremely simple. But why didn't the problem mention that this is the case? Because the problem seems to be about regions and their adjacency, but the solution is just counting the number of roads separating the two points. \n\nBut why is that correct? Let me think again. Because each road that separates the two points must be crossed once. And each such road contributes exactly one step. So, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nYes. Because each such road must be crossed once. And each crossing is a step. So the answer is the count of roads that separate the two points.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads to cross to get from the home to the university. Each road that separates them must be crossed once. But if two points are separated by k roads, then you need to cross each of them once. \n\nBut how can you be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads? Because the roads are arranged in such a way that you can cross them in any order. For example, if two roads are crossed, you can cross them in sequence. \n\nSo the answer is indeed the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nThis seems to be the case. So the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are y=0 and x=0.\n\nFor the first road (0,1,0): val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1. 1 * -1 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road (1,0,0): val1 = 1*1 + 0*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nRoads are x=0, y=0, x + y -3=0.\n\nHome (1,1):\n\nFor x=0: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 → val1=1. University (-1,-1): val2 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nFor y=0: same as above. product -1 → count +=1.\n\nFor x + y -3 =0: val1 = 1+1-3 = -1. val2 is -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So no increment. So total count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each a, b, c in roads:\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's it. So this is the solution.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is read from stdin. How to read the input? Let me check the input format.\n\nThe input is given as follows:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines, each with a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as x1, y1.\n\nRead the second line as x2, y2.\n\nRead third line as n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nThen process each line.\n\nBut in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin. However, sometimes for multiple lines, it's easier to read all at once.\n\nBut for the code, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's the code. Let me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work. But why is this problem considered \"very easy\"? Because it's really just a matter of checking for each line whether the two points are on opposite sides. \n\nBut what about the case where there are multiple roads that are overlapping? Well, the problem states that no two roads are the same. So, each line is unique. But even if two lines are parallel, the code still works. \n\nYes. So the code is correct. This is the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes. A point (home or university) lies on one side of each road. If two points lie on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move between the blocks containing these points.\n2. **Sign Check**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at the home and university coordinates. If the signs of these values are different, it indicates that the points are on opposite sides of the road, thus requiring a step to cross it.\n3. **Counting Steps**: The minimum number of steps required is the count of roads where the home and university points lie on opposite sides.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Equations**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Signs**: If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the road, thus incrementing the step count.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed as the result, representing the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
