His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on the given points from two tours. The key here is understanding how the rankings are determined. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The teacher knows that Vasya's total points are at least x. But since the data is just lists of points for each tour without names, we need to consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. For each such pair, we need to determine what rank Vasya could get. But since the actual assignment of which a_i pairs with which b_j is arbitrary, we need to find the best and worst possible positions he can have.\n\nThe best possible rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are arranged to be worse. The worst possible rank is when his total is as low as possible (but still meeting x), and others are arranged to be better than him as much as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the best and worst positions.\n\nFor the best possible rank: We want Vasya's total to be as high as possible. So, we should take the maximum possible a_i + b_j that's >=x. Then, count how many participants have a total higher than that. But wait, no—because the best rank would be when Vasya's total is the highest possible, so that he is first. However, there might be other participants with the same total. But since the jury can assign positions arbitrarily, in the best case, Vasya can be placed first even if others have the same total. Wait, the problem says that if two or more have the same sum, the jury can assign places according to their choice. So for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya is placed as high as possible. So, for the best case, we need to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (which is the maximum a_i + b_j >=x). Then, the best rank is 1 if there's no one else with a higher sum. But if others have the same sum, then the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can assign it to him.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the best possible rank? Let me think again. The best possible rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible, and then the number of people with a higher sum is as small as possible. So, for the best case, we can choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Then, count how many people have a sum strictly greater than that. Then the best rank is that count + 1. Because if there are k people with higher sums, then Vasya can be placed k+1th. But if there are people with same sum, the jury can arrange them to be before or after. So, for best case, we can arrange that Vasya is placed first among those with the same sum. So the best possible rank is the number of people with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1. But how do we find that?\n\nBut to maximize Vasya's sum, we need to find the maximum a_i + b_j that is >=x. Then, for that sum, count the number of participants who have a sum strictly greater than that. Then the best possible rank is that count + 1. But how do we find the maximum sum possible for Vasya?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. Since the problem states that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So for the best case, we need to find the maximum possible sum (a_i + b_j) that is >=x. Once we have that, then the best possible rank is determined by how many people have a sum higher than that.\n\nBut how do we compute that maximum sum? Well, it's the maximum of all a_i + b_j where a_i + b_j >=x. But since we can pair any a_i with any b_j, the maximum sum possible is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. Wait, no. Because for example, if the maximum a_i is 5, and the maximum b_j is 6, then their sum is 11. But perhaps there's another pair that gives a higher sum. Wait, no. The maximum sum possible is the maximum a_i plus maximum b_j. Because that's the maximum possible sum of any pair. So to get the best possible rank, we need to take the maximum possible sum, which is max_a + max_b. But wait, that may not be >=x. So, in that case, we need to find the maximum possible sum that is >=x. For example, suppose x is 10. Suppose max_a is 5, max_b is 6. Then their sum is 11 >=x. So that's the best possible. But if x is 12, then the maximum sum is 11, which is less than x. But the problem says that there's at least one pair that meets the condition. So that scenario can't happen. So the problem says that there exists i,j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So for the best case, we can take the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j, and then compute the best rank.\n\nSo, the steps for best rank:\n\n- Find the maximum possible sum s_max = max(a_i + b_j) where a_i + b_j >=x. Wait, but how do we find that? Well, the maximum possible sum is the maximum a_i plus maximum b_j. Because that's the maximum possible sum. So, even if that sum is less than x, but the problem says that there's at least one pair with sum >=x. So perhaps that's not possible. For example, if x is 10, and the maximum a_i is 5, maximum b_j is 5. Then the sum is 10, which is equal to x. So that's acceptable. But if x is 11, then the maximum sum is 10, but that's less than x. However, the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So that scenario can't happen. Therefore, the maximum possible sum is at least x. So for the best case, we can take the maximum possible sum (max_a + max_b) and proceed.\n\nOnce we have s_max, then the best rank is the number of participants who have sum > s_max plus 1. Because those participants have higher sum, and Vasya's sum is s_max. So in the best case, the jury can place him first among those with the same sum.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of participants who have sum > s_max?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the participants' a and b are not paired. So for each participant, their sum is a_i + b_i? No, no. Wait, no. The problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but they are in arbitrary order. So the actual pairing of a_i and b_j is unknown. So, for example, the actual participants have some a_i and some b_j, but the teacher doesn't know which a_i was paired with which b_j. So when considering the possible scenarios, we can pair the a's and b's in any way possible. But for the best and worst cases, we need to find the best and worst possible positions Vasya can have, given that there exists some pairing where his sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have. So, the actual way of pairing a_i and b_j for other participants can vary, and we need to find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya depending on how the pairs are made.\n\nWait, but for the best possible position, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and other participants' sums are as low as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to model this is that Vasya's total is a_i + b_j, for some i and j. And the other participants are assigned pairs (a_k, b_l) where k != i and l != j? No, that's not necessarily the case. Because the problem says that each participant must have participated in both tours, so each participant has exactly one a and one b. So the actual pairing is a permutation of the b array. For example, the real pairing is that for each participant, there's an a_i and a b_p, where p is a permutation of 1..n.\n\nBut the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i is paired with which b_j. So, for the purpose of finding the best and worst possible ranks, we can choose any possible pairing (as long as each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa), and then see what rank Vasya can have in that scenario.\n\nBut how to model that? Because the problem requires us to find the best and worst possible ranks across all possible pairings where there exists at least one pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >=x. Wait, but the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So, in the scenario we are considering, there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is >=x. But for the purposes of the problem, the teacher needs to consider all possible pairings that could have happened (since the actual pairing is unknown), and find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya in any such pairing.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because for the best possible rank, we can choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and other participants' sums are as low as possible. For example, for the best case, we can pair Vasya's a_i with the maximum possible b_j, and pair other a's with the minimal possible b's. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to find for the best case, the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (so that he is as high as possible), and then count how many participants can have a higher sum than that. For the worst case, find the minimum possible sum that Vasya can have (but still >=x), and count how many participants can have a higher sum than that, and then add 1.\n\nBut how to compute these numbers?\n\nLet me think again. For the best possible rank, we want to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and then others are arranged so that as few as possible have a higher sum. For example, if Vasya's sum is S, then the best possible rank is 1 + the number of participants who have sum strictly greater than S. So to minimize that number, we need S to be as high as possible. So the maximum possible S is the maximum possible a_i + b_j (which is max_a + max_b). But then, how many participants can have sum greater than this maximum? None, because it's the maximum. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1. But that's only if there's at least one pair that gives this sum. Which there is, because the maximum a_i and maximum b_j would form that pair.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the maximum sum is when you pair the maximum a_i with the maximum b_j. However, when considering the other participants, their sum is the sum of their a_i and their b_j. But in this scenario, when we are trying to find the best possible rank, we can arrange the pairings for the other participants to have as low as possible sum. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is that the actual pairing is fixed, but we don't know which one. The teacher has to find the best and worst possible ranks that Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings (including those where Vasya's sum is at least x). So, for example, in the first sample input, all a_i are 1 and all b_j are 1. So in any pairing, each participant's sum is 2. Therefore, Vasya's rank can be 1 (if the jury gives him first) or 5 (if the jury gives him last). So the best is 1 and worst is 5.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, we need to find the scenario where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged to have as few as possible higher sums. For the worst possible rank, we need to find the scenario where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others are arranged to have as many as possible higher sums.\n\nSo how to compute these?\n\nLet me think about the best possible rank. To get the best possible rank, we need to maximize Vasya's sum. Let's say that Vasya's sum is S. Then, the best possible rank is 1 + the number of participants whose sum is strictly greater than S. But how do we compute the maximum possible S? Well, the maximum possible S is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. Because that's the maximum possible sum that can be achieved by any pair.\n\nOnce we have that S, then the question is: how many participants can have a sum greater than S? But since S is the maximum possible sum, none. So the best possible rank is 1. However, this is only true if there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is S. But since the pairing is arbitrary, we can choose to pair the maximum a_i with the maximum b_j for Vasya. Then, the rest of the pairings can be done in a way that others' sums are as low as possible. But in that scenario, the sum of others would be their a_i + their b_j. However, for the purpose of calculating the best possible rank, the number of participants with sum strictly greater than S is zero. Hence, the best possible rank is 1. \n\nBut in the first sample input, the maximum sum is 2. All participants have sum 2. So the number of participants with sum greater than S is zero. Hence, best possible rank is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo that seems to work. But how to compute the number of participants that can have a sum greater than S?\n\nWait, but S is the maximum possible sum. So in any pairing, the maximum sum of any participant is S. So the number of participants with sum greater than S is zero. Therefore, best rank is 1.\n\nBut that seems to suggest that the best possible rank is always 1. Which is not the case. Wait, no. Because what if there are multiple pairs that sum to S. For example, if there are two a_i's that are max_a and two b_j's that are max_b. Then, in the pairing, two participants could have sum S. But in that case, the best rank is 1, because the jury can assign Vasya to be first.\n\nSo yes, the best possible rank is always 1. But that contradicts the sample input. Wait, no. In the first sample input, the best possible rank is 1. Which is correct. So why is the sample output 1 5? Because the best is 1. So the first part of the output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but why in the second sample input, the best possible rank is 1. Let's look at the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2:\n6 7\n4 3 5 6 4 4\n8 6 0 4 3 4\n\nSo the a array is [4,3,5,6,4,4], and the b array is [8,6,0,4,3,4]. The maximum a is 6, maximum b is 8. So maximum sum is 6+8=14. So if Vasya's sum is 14, then no one else can have a higher sum. So best possible rank is 1, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this suggests that the best possible rank is always 1. But how can that be? What if there's a case where the maximum sum is not achievable? For example, if the maximum a is 5, maximum b is 5, but x is 9. So the maximum sum is 10, which is >=x. So Vasya can have 10. Then the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut what if there are multiple pairs that can give the maximum sum. For example, suppose there are two a_i's of 5 and two b_j's of 5. So maximum sum is 10. If Vasya is one of those pairs, then others can have sum 10 as well. But the best possible rank is 1, since the jury can assign him to be first.\n\nSo yes, the best possible rank is always 1. But why does the first sample input have the best rank as 1? Because that's correct. So why is the problem asking for the best possible rank? It seems that the best possible is always 1. But that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the actual sum of Vasya's two tours is a_i + b_j for some i and j. So, for the best possible rank, the teacher wants to find the best possible scenario where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged to have as few as possible higher than him.\n\nBut in the case where the maximum sum is S, and Vasya's sum is S, then others can't have a higher sum. So the best possible rank is 1. So regardless of other possibilities, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut that would mean that the answer for the best possible rank is always 1. Which seems to be the case in the sample input. But why is the problem even asking for the best possible rank then?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again. Suppose there are two participants. Suppose x is 5, and the a array is [3, 3], and the b array is [3, 3]. So each participant's sum can be 6. So Vasya's sum is 6. The best possible rank is 1. But if there's another participant, but their sum is also 6. Then the best possible rank is 1. So the answer for best is 1. Which seems to be correct.\n\nBut what if there's a scenario where the maximum sum is S, but Vasya's sum is not S. For example, if x is 5, and the maximum sum is 6, but Vasya's sum could be 5 (which is allowed). But in that case, the best possible rank would be when he has 6. So the teacher can choose the scenario where Vasya's sum is 6. So the best possible rank is 1. Hence, regardless of the situation, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo that suggests that the best possible rank is always 1. Which seems to be the case. Then why is the problem asking for the best possible rank? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the note in the first sample input: \"In the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.\" So in that case, the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5. So the first part of the output is 1. So the code for best possible rank is always 1. But why is that?\n\nBut then why is the problem giving that as an example? Because it's possible. So according to this reasoning, the best possible rank is always 1. Which seems to be the case. Therefore, the first part of the output is always 1. But that seems counterintuitive. What if there are other participants with higher sums than Vasya's?\n\nWait, no. Because in the best scenario, the teacher can choose the pairing where Vasya has the maximum possible sum. So in that scenario, there are no other participants with higher sums. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1. So regardless of the input, the best possible rank is 1. That's a very important insight.\n\nSo that simplifies the problem. Now, the main challenge is to compute the worst possible rank.\n\nNow, the worst possible rank. How to compute that.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to find a scenario where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and as many participants as possible have a sum higher than his sum. So the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1. But how to compute that.\n\nSo, to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (which is >=x), and then find how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than that. However, the problem is that the pairing of the other participants can be chosen to maximize the number of participants with sum higher than Vasya's sum.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think. Let's say that Vasya's sum is s_min, which is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Then, the worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have sum > s_min, plus 1.\n\nBut how to find s_min. Well, the minimal possible sum is x (if possible). But perhaps there's no pair that gives exactly x. But the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So the minimal possible sum is the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some a_i + b_j.\n\nWait, but to get the worst possible rank, we need to choose the minimal possible s (>=x) for Vasya. Because that way, the number of participants with sum higher than s is maximized.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFind the minimal possible s (s_min) such that s >=x and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = s.\n\nOnce we have that s_min, then we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than s_min. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number.\n\nTo maximize the number of participants with sum > s_min, we need to pair the a's and b's in such a way that as many as possible of them have sum > s_min. However, Vasya's sum is s_min, so we need to reserve one pair (a_i, b_j) that sums to s_min. The rest can be arranged to have as high as possible sum.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible number of participants with sum > s_min.\n\nThis seems like a problem of matching a_i and b_j such that as many as possible pairs have a_i + b_j > s_min, and at least one pair (for Vasya) has a_i + b_j = s_min.\n\nBut how to find that maximum number.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s_min is equal to the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with a_i + b_j > s_min, given that we have to leave at least one pair (for Vasya) that sums to s_min.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nBut perhaps the approach is to find the minimal s_min (the minimal possible sum that is >=x), and then compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > s_min. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to find s_min. Well, the minimal s_min is the minimal value >=x that can be achieved by some a_i + b_j. But how to find that.\n\nBut perhaps instead of finding s_min, we can think of it as follows: for the worst possible case, we need to choose the minimal possible sum s that is >=x. Then, the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s.\n\nBut how to find s. Well, the minimal possible s is the minimal value that is >=x and is present in the set of all possible a_i + b_j. However, since the problem allows any pairing (so that there exists a pair with sum >=x), we can choose s to be the minimal possible such value. However, for the worst case, we need to choose the minimal possible s that is >=x, because that allows more participants to have higher sums.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal s that is >=x. Well, the minimal s is the minimal value between x and the maximum possible sum. But how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal possible s that is >=x. Let's think of all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) and find the minimal s that is >=x. However, with n up to 1e5, checking all O(n^2) pairs is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s >=x that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j).\n\nWait, but for the worst case, we need to find the minimal possible s (>=x) that can be achieved. Because that would allow the maximum number of participants to have sum higher than s.\n\nBut how to find that minimal s. Well, the minimal s is the minimal value between x and the maximum possible sum. Let me think: for example, if there exists a pair with sum exactly x, then that's the minimal s. Otherwise, the minimal s is the minimal value greater than x that can be achieved by some pair.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal s is x, if there exists a pair with sum >=x. But the problem says that there is at least one pair with sum >=x. So for the worst case, we can choose s_min as the minimal possible sum that is >=x. So to find s_min, we can find the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j).\n\nBut again, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut perhaps, for the worst case, the minimal s is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. However, given that the pairs can be chosen arbitrarily, we need to find the minimal possible s (>=x) that can be achieved by any pair. Once that is found, the next step is to find how many pairs can be formed with sum > s. Because in the worst case, the other participants are arranged to have as many as possible sums >s.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by the following approach:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible sum s for Vasya (s >=x), and then find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum > s. Then, the worst rank is that number +1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n- Find the minimal s >=x that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j).\n\n- Then, find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed such that a_i + b_j > s. However, we need to ensure that there is at least one pair (Vasya's) that has sum exactly s. So the maximum number of participants with sum > s is equal to the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >s, given that we have to leave one pair (for Vasya) with sum exactly s.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nBut perhaps, the way to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is to find the maximum possible number of pairs that can be formed with sum >s, and subtract 0 if there is at least one pair with sum exactly s. Because we can choose to use one of those pairs as Vasya's.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the first sample input. All a_i are 1, all b_j are 1. x is 2. The minimal s is 2. Now, how many pairs can have sum >2? None. So the maximum number is 0. Hence, worst possible rank is 0+1=1? But the sample output says 5. Wait, this is conflicting. So clearly, my reasoning is wrong here.\n\nWait in the first sample input, the worst possible rank is 5. How?\n\nIn that case, the minimal s is 2. Now, the maximum number of participants with sum >2 is zero. So the worst possible rank is 0+1=1. But the sample output says 5. So clearly, my reasoning is incorrect.\n\nSo I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have. The worst possible place is when the jury arranges the participants in such a way that Vasya's position is as low as possible.\n\nBut how is that possible? For example, in the first sample input, all participants have sum 2. So the worst possible rank is 5 (since the jury can put Vasya in the last position). So the worst rank is 5. But according to the previous reasoning, it would be 0+1=1. Which is wrong. So my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see. My mistake was in thinking that the worst possible rank depends on the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum. However, in the first sample input, all participants have the same sum. So the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum is zero. But the worst possible rank is 5, which is the number of participants with sum equal to Vasya's sum (5) plus zero (those with higher sum) plus 1? No. Wait, the problem says that if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can assign places as they choose. So in the worst case, the jury can assign Vasya the last possible position among those with the same sum. So the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus the number of participants with sum equal to Vasya's sum (including himself) ?\n\nNo. Wait, if there are k participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum, and m participants with sum equal to Vasya's sum (including himself), then the worst possible rank is k + m. Because the jury can arrange all those with higher sums to come first, and then arrange Vasya to be last among those with equal sums. So the rank is k + m.\n\nBut how to calculate that.\n\nSo for the worst possible rank, it's:\n\nnumber of participants with sum > s (where s is Vasya's sum) + the number of participants with sum == s (including Vasya) ?\n\nNo. Wait, the rank is determined by the number of people who have a higher sum than Vasya plus 1. But if there are people with the same sum, the jury can choose to place Vasya after them. So in the worst case, the rank is the number of people with higher sum plus the number of people with same sum (including Vasya) ?\n\nNo. For example, if there are 5 people with sum equal to Vasya's sum, then the worst possible rank is 5. Because the jury can place Vasya last among them. So the rank is 5. Which is the number of people with sum equal to or higher than Vasya's sum. But how to express that.\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is the number of people with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus the number of people with sum equal to Vasya's sum, but since the jury can arrange them in any order, the worst possible rank is the number of people with sum >= Vasya's sum. But that would be the case if the jury puts all the higher ones first and then Vasya last. But that would be the worst possible rank.\n\nWait, no. Let's say there are k participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum, and m participants with sum equal to Vasya's sum. Then the worst possible rank for Vasya is k + m. Because the jury can arrange all k participants with higher sum first, and then arrange Vasya to be the last of the m participants with equal sum. Hence, his rank is k + m.\n\nSo the worst possible rank is (number of participants with sum > s) + (number of participants with sum == s). But how to compute this.\n\nBut for this, we need to choose s as the sum for Vasya, and then find the maximum possible value of (k + m), where k is the number of participants with sum > s, and m is the number of participants with sum == s.\n\nBut how to choose s to maximize this value.\n\nBut since s must be >=x, and we want to maximize k + m, we need to choose s such that as many participants as possible have sum >=s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst possible rank, we want to choose s as small as possible (>=x), because that will allow more participants to have sum >=s. For example, if s is as small as possible, then more participants have sum >=s.\n\nSo the approach for the worst case is:\n\nFind the minimal possible s that is >=x (call it s_min), and then compute the number of participants with sum >= s_min. But how to compute this.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s_min >=x that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). Once s_min is determined, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >=s_min. Because the jury can arrange Vasya to be the last among those participants.\n\nBut how to compute the number of participants with sum >=s_min. But wait, how is that possible? Because the participants' sums depend on how the a and b arrays are paired. So for example, the pairing can be chosen in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum >=s_min.\n\nWait, but for the worst case, we want to maximize the number of participants with sum >=s_min. Because that would give the worst possible rank. So how to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s_min, given that s_min is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nThis seems very complex. Let's think of the first sample input. s_min is 2. How many participants can have sum >=2? All of them. So the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample input, the worst possible rank is 5. Let's see why.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=6, x=7\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nThe minimal s_min >=7 is 7. For example, 4+3=7, or 3+4=7, etc. Now, how many participants can have sum >=7?\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed with sum >=7. But we must have exactly one pair for Vasya, and the rest can be arranged to have sum >=7.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number.\n\nThis seems like a classic problem of matching two arrays to maximize the number of pairs that satisfy a certain condition. For example, in the case of finding the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j >=s.\n\nThis is similar to the problem where you have two arrays and you want to pair them to maximize the number of pairs that meet a condition. For example, the classic greedy approach is to sort one array and the other in reverse, and then greedily match them.\n\nSo for the worst case scenario, once we have s_min, the minimal possible sum >=x, we need to find the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=s_min. This will give us the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s_min, including Vasya. Hence, the worst possible rank is that number.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number of pairs.\n\nSo, the steps for the worst case are:\n\n1. Find the minimal s_min >=x that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j).\n\n2. Find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed with sum >=s_min. Let's call this count 'cnt'.\n\n3. The worst possible rank is cnt.\n\nBecause, in this scenario, the jury can arrange Vasya to be the last among these 'cnt' participants, hence his rank is cnt.\n\nBut how to find s_min and then compute cnt.\n\nBut first, how to find s_min. The minimal s >=x that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). How to find this.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, checking all possible pairs is O(n^2), which is not feasible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nBut perhaps we can find the minimal s_min as the minimal value between x and the maximum possible sum. Wait, but how to find the minimal s_min that is >=x and is achievable by some pair.\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate all possible pairs and find the minimal one that is >=x. But with n up to 1e5, this is impossible. So we need a way to find this minimal s_min.\n\nAlternatively, since the minimal s_min is the minimal value >=x that can be achieved by any pair, we can think of it as follows: the minimal s_min is the minimal value between x and the maximum possible sum, but how to find that.\n\nBut perhaps, we can find the minimal s_min by using binary search. For example, we can check whether there exists a pair with sum >=x and sum <= some value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the minimal s_min is the minimal value >=x that is achievable by any pair. So, the minimal s_min is the minimal value in the set {a_i + b_j | a_i + b_j >=x}.\n\nBut",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours.

This is because we can always choose the highest possible sum for Vasya by pairing the maximum values from both tours, ensuring no one else has a higher sum.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**:\n   - To determine the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimum possible sum that Vasya can have while still meeting the threshold. This involves checking all possible pairs of scores from the two tours to find the smallest valid sum.\n   - Once this minimum valid sum is determined, we calculate the maximum number of participants who can have a sum greater than or equal to this value.
