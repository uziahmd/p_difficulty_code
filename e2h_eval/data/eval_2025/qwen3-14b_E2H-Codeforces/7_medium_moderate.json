The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nFrom the problem description, the snowflake is built as follows:\n\n1. Start with one vertex.\n2. Connect it to k new vertices (k > 1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices.\n3. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (i.e., the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. \n\nWait, so the process is iterative. Let me think about the structure. Let's take an example. For k=4, the smallest snowflake would have:\n\nInitial step: 1 node. Then connect to 4, making total 5 nodes. Now, each of those 4 nodes is a leaf. Then, each of them is connected to 4 new nodes. So each of the 4 nodes adds 4 new nodes. So total nodes after this step would be 5 + 4*4 = 5 + 16 = 21. But wait, the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input. For example, when n=13, the output is YES. Let's see how that can happen.\n\nLet me think again about the construction steps. The initial step is 1 node. Then, adding k children. Then, each leaf (which are all the nodes added in the first step) must be connected to k new nodes. But this step has to be done at least once. So the minimal steps would be:\n\nFirst step: 1 node. Then add k nodes. Now, the total is 1 + k.\n\nThen, step two: each of the k leaves gets k new nodes. So each of those k nodes adds k children. So total nodes after this step is 1 + k + k * k = 1 + k + k².\n\nBut the problem says that this step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the snowflake can be constructed in different ways. For example, maybe after the first expansion (step 2), you can do more expansions. But how?\n\nSo the general idea is that the snowflake is built by expanding layers. Each expansion step adds new nodes to all the current leaves. Each expansion step is done at least once.\n\nSo the structure is like a tree where each node has exactly k children, except for the leaves. Wait, no. Wait, the initial node has k children. Then, each of those children (which are leaves) get k children. Then, those new nodes are leaves, and perhaps we can do another expansion step. But the problem says that the step of connecting the leaves to k new nodes must be done at least once. So the minimal case is that after the initial step, we perform at least one expansion.\n\nSo the number of nodes depends on the number of expansion steps. Let's model this.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as a tree. Let's consider the number of nodes after m expansion steps. Let's define the expansion steps as follows:\n\n- Step 0: Only the root node. So nodes count is 1.\n- Step 1: Add k children to the root. Now, nodes count is 1 + k.\n- Step 2: For each leaf (the k nodes from step 1), add k children. So each of those k nodes adds k children. So total nodes added here is k * k. Total nodes is 1 + k + k².\n- Step 3: Each of the leaves (the nodes added in step 2) is now a leaf. Each of them has k children. The number of leaves in step 2 is k². So adding k² * k nodes. Total nodes is 1 + k + k² + k³.\n- And so on, until step m.\n\nBut the problem requires that the expansion step (step 2 and beyond) is done at least once. So the minimal number of steps is 1 (so the total nodes is 1 + k + k²?), or wait:\n\nWait, the initial step is step 0 (root). Then, the first expansion (step 1) is adding k children. Then, the second expansion (step 2) is adding k children to each of the leaves. So for the snowflake to be valid, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal number of expansions is 1. Which would mean that the total nodes is 1 + k + k²? Or maybe the first expansion is required. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, so the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf is done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children to the root) is mandatory. Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf is done once (so the total nodes is 1 + k + k^2). Or maybe the step is done once, but that step is after the initial step. So the minimal structure is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWait, but the sample input includes n=13. Let's see. For example, if k=3, then 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 +9 =13. So yes, that's why n=13 is a YES.\n\nSo the snowflake can be constructed with any number of expansions steps. Let's say that the expansion steps are done m times. Let's clarify:\n\nLet me think of the construction as follows:\n\n- The initial node (level 0).\n- Then, level 1: k nodes (children of root).\n- Then, for each expansion step, every node in the previous level (which are all leaves) gets k children. So each expansion step adds a new level.\n\nSo the total number of nodes after m expansion steps is:\n\nsum_{i=0}^m (k^i) ?\n\nWait, no. Because for m expansion steps, the initial step (the first expansion) is adding level 1. Then, the next expansion adds level 2, etc. Wait, the initial node is level 0. Then:\n\nAfter the initial step (adding k children), the total nodes is 1 + k.\n\nThen, the first expansion step (which is required to be done at least once) adds k * k nodes. So total nodes becomes 1 + k + k².\n\nIf we do another expansion step (second expansion), then we add k² * k = k³ nodes. So total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo in general, the total number of nodes after m expansion steps is sum_{i=0}^m k^i. Wait, sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). But wait, for example, when m=0, sum is 1. When m=1, sum is 1 +k. When m=2, sum is 1 +k +k². Which matches the earlier examples.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the expansion steps (the ones after the initial step) must be done at least once. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe initial step is to connect the root to k new nodes. Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf must be done at least once. So the minimal case is m=1 expansion steps. Which would make the total nodes 1 +k +k². But if you do m expansion steps, where m >=1, then the total nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i. Wait, but the initial step (adding k children) is part of the process. So the expansion steps are the steps after the initial step. Or perhaps the initial step is considered as the first expansion step?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-express the construction rules.\n\nConstruction rules:\n\n- Start with one node.\n\n- Then, add k new nodes connected to the root. So this is step 1.\n\n- Then, each leaf (those k nodes) must be connected to k new nodes. This step must be done at least once. So this is step 2.\n\nSo the minimal snowflake is constructed with step 1 and step 2. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k².\n\nBut then, if you perform more steps (like step 3), which is adding k children to each leaf of the previous step. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k² + k³ + ... + k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps (with m ≥1).\n\nSo for any valid snowflake, the number of nodes n must be equal to (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1), where m ≥1 and k ≥2.\n\nWait, because sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But for the snowflake to be valid, m must be ≥1. Because the expansion steps (after the initial step) must be done at least once. Wait, but the initial step is adding k nodes (so m=1?), or m=0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of expansion steps is m ≥1. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥1. Because:\n\nm=1: sum is 1 +k → but according to the problem statement, the expansion step (adding k children to leaves) must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children) is required. Then, the expansion step (adding k children to leaves) must be done once. So that would be m=2?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-express the entire process.\n\nLet me think again. The construction process:\n\nStart with 1 node (level 0). Then, connect it to k nodes (level 1). Now, the leaves are level 1. Then, perform the expansion step (at least once) by adding k children to each leaf. So for each node in level 1, add k children. These are level 2. Now, the number of nodes is 1 +k +k*k = 1 +k +k².\n\nIf we perform another expansion step, then each node in level 2 (which are leaves) get k children. So adding k^3 nodes, making total 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the total number of nodes after m expansion steps (where m ≥1) is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i ? No. Let me think:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nInitial step (no expansion steps): 1 node.\n\nFirst expansion step: adding k children to root (level 1). Now, the total is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step (adding to leaves) must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children) is not considered an expansion step. The expansion steps are the steps where we add k children to each leaf. So the first expansion step is adding k² nodes (the level 2). Thus, the minimal case is when there is one expansion step. So the total nodes is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥2? No, let me think again.\n\nLet me model the number of expansion steps as t, where t ≥1. Each expansion step adds a new level. The first expansion step adds level 2 (each of the level 1 nodes adds k children). So for t expansion steps, the total nodes is sum_{i=0}^{t+1} k^i? No. Let's think for t=1 expansion steps:\n\nsum is 1 +k +k². Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So for t expansion steps, the sum is sum_{i=0}^{t+1} k^i? No, perhaps the number of terms is t+1? Wait, no. For t expansion steps:\n\nOriginal node (level 0) → 1 node.\n\nAfter adding level 1 (initial step): 1 +k nodes.\n\nThen, each expansion step adds a new level. So t expansion steps would add t levels (level 2, level 3, ..., level t+1). The number of nodes added in each level is k^level_number.\n\nWait, level 0 has 1 node (k^0).\n\nlevel 1 has k nodes (k^1).\n\nlevel 2 has k^2 nodes.\n\nlevel 3 has k^3 nodes.\n\n...\n\nlevel m has k^m nodes.\n\nSo the total number of nodes after m levels is sum_{i=0}^m k^i.\n\nBut according to the problem's construction rules, the initial step (level 1) is required. Then, the expansion steps (adding levels beyond level 1) must be done at least once. So the total number of levels m must be ≥ 2. Because level 0 is the root, level 1 is added initially, then level 2 is added during the first expansion step.\n\nThus, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2. Because m is the maximum level. For example, m=2 gives sum 1 +k +k².\n\nBut how does that relate to the number of expansion steps? Well, the expansion steps are the steps that add level 2, level 3, etc. So for m levels, there are m-1 expansion steps (since level 1 is added in the initial step). But the problem says that the expansion steps (adding to leaves) must be done at least once. So m-1 ≥1 → m ≥2. Which matches the earlier conclusion.\n\nSo the possible values of n are numbers that can be written as S = (k^m - 1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2. Wait, because sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Wait, no. The formula is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). For example, sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m ≥2, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But the problem says that the expansion steps must be done at least once. Which corresponds to m ≥ 2 (since m is the maximum level). So the total number of nodes is S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where k ≥ 2 and m ≥1? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf m is the maximum level, then the sum is sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). And for the snowflake to be valid, the expansion steps must be done at least once. Which requires that m ≥2 (because level 1 is added in the initial step, and level 2 is added in the first expansion step). So m ≥2. Thus, the total number of nodes is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥2 and k ≥2.\n\nWait, but for example, when m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². Which equals (k^3 -1)/(k-1). Yes. So for m=2, the formula is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k².\n\nBut the problem says that the expansion steps must be done at least once. So m must be ≥2. So the possible values of n are numbers that can be expressed as (k^{d} -1)/(k-1), where d ≥3 and k ≥2. Because m+1 =d. So d = m+1 ≥3.\n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nLet d be the exponent such that n = (k^d - 1)/(k-1), where d ≥3 and k ≥2. Because m+1 =d, and m ≥2 implies d ≥3.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in this form for some integers k ≥2 and d ≥3.\n\nBut also, there's another possibility. What if the expansion steps are done multiple times, but the total nodes are not of the form (k^d -1)/(k-1)? No, because the sum is always of that form. For example, if you have m levels, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for any valid snowflake, n must be expressible as (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥2 and d ≥3.\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple expansion steps, but the expansion steps are done with different k? No, because k is fixed. Once you choose k, the expansion steps are all adding k children per leaf. So k is fixed for the entire snowflake.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for a given n, whether there exists integers k ≥2 and d ≥3 such that n = (k^d -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut how do we check this for a given n?\n\nLet's think about the possible values of d. Since d ≥3, and k ≥2.\n\nFor each n, we can iterate over possible d (from 3 up to log_2(n)+1, since for k=2, the minimal value for d=3 is (2^3-1)/(2-1) =7. So for n=7, it's possible. For larger d, the value grows exponentially. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible d is around 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18).\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck if there exists a d ≥3 such that there exists a k ≥2 where (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the equation:\n\nn = (k^d -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nSo for fixed d, we can try to find if there exists a k ≥2 such that this sum equals n.\n\nFor example, for d=3, the equation becomes 1 +k +k² =n. We can solve for k.\n\nSimilarly for d=4: 1 +k +k² +k³ =n.\n\nBut since d can be up to around 60, and for each d, we can perform a binary search for k.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n, check for all possible d (from 3 up to max_d) whether there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible d?\n\nWell, for d ≥3 and k ≥2, the minimal value of the sum for a given d is when k=2, which is (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1. So for a given n, the maximum possible d is such that 2^d -1 ≤n. So d_max is floor(log2(n+1)).\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So for each n, we can loop d from 3 to 60, and for each d, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nNow, for each d, how to find k?\n\nThe sum for given d and k is S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1} = (k^d -1)/(k-1).\n\nWe need to find k such that S =n.\n\nFor fixed d, this is a strictly increasing function of k. Because as k increases, S increases.\n\nSo for each d, we can perform a binary search on k between 2 and some upper limit.\n\nWhat's the upper limit for k? For a given d, the sum S is at least 1 +2 + 2² + ... + 2^{d-1} = 2^d -1. So if n is less than that, then no solution for this d. Otherwise, the upper bound for k can be found by considering that for k ≥2, S increases with k. So for example, for a given d, the maximum possible k is such that S <=n. Since S increases with k, for a given d, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound can be found as follows:\n\nSince S = 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} < k^{d-1} + ... +k^{d-1} (d terms) = d *k^{d-1}.\n\nSo for S =n, we have d*k^{d-1} >n → k^{d-1} >n/d → k> (n/d)^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nBut perhaps for binary search purposes, we can set the upper bound as n^(1/(d-1)) +1. Because when k is larger than that, S will be larger than n. For example, for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². For large k, this is ~k². So for n, the upper bound for k can be sqrt(n). So for binary search, we can set low=2, high= some value like n^(1/(d-1)) +1.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and d up to 60, the exponents can be handled with logarithms or binary search.\n\nSo the steps for each n:\n\nCheck if n is 1: then no (since the minimal is for d=3, k=2: 1+2+4=7).\n\nCheck for each d from 3 to max_d (say 60):\n\n   perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound to see if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and d?\n\nBut for large exponents, calculating k^d could be problematic due to overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, and for d up to 60, even for k=2, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is manageable with Python's big integers.\n\nBut during the binary search, when we compute the sum, we can compute it incrementally and check if it exceeds n. For example, for given k and d, compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nBut for large d and k, this can be expensive. However, since d is small (up to 60), and for each binary search step, this is manageable.\n\nBut there's a better way. For example, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\ns = (k^d - 1) // (k - 1)\n\nBut we have to be careful with integer division. However, since we know that for k ≥2, the sum is exactly equal to that expression.\n\nBut calculating k^d could be a problem for very large d and k, but since n is up to 1e18, and for a given d, the maximum possible k is something like n^(1/(d-1)), which for d=3 and n=1e18 is 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nBut even better, during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n. For example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut this would be O(d) per check, which is acceptable for small d (up to 60).\n\nSo the algorithm for each n:\n\nif n is 1 → no.\n\nelse:\n\n   for d in 3 to max_d:\n\n      low = 2\n\n      high = ?\n\n      find if there exists a k such that compute_sum(k, d) == n.\n\n      if yes, return yes.\n\n   if none found, return no.\n\nBut what is the max_d?\n\nThe maximum possible d is when k=2, and the sum is 2^d -1 ≤n. So d_max = floor( log2(n+1) )\n\nBut for n=1e18, log2(n) is about 60. So we can loop d from 3 up to 60.\n\nBut for some n, even for d=3, the sum may be larger than n. So for each d, we can check if the minimal possible sum (for k=2) is less than or equal to n. If not, skip this d.\n\nSo for each d, compute the minimal sum for k=2: s_min = 2^d -1. If s_min >n → skip this d. Else, proceed to binary search for k.\n\nBut how to compute the upper bound for k?\n\nWell, for a given d, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≤n. Since for k ≥2, the sum increases with k, we can binary search between 2 and some upper bound.\n\nThe upper bound can be found as follows. Since 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} < k^{d} (since for k ≥2, 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} < k^{d-1} + ... +k^{d-1} } (d terms) = d *k^{d-1} < k^d for k ≥d). So for k ≥d, the sum is less than k^d. So for sum =n, we have k^d >n → k> n^{1/d}.\n\nSo the upper bound can be set to n^(1/(d-1)) + 1. For example, for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². For k^2 < sum <k^2 +k +1. So for sum =n, k^2 <n →k < sqrt(n). So upper bound for k can be sqrt(n) +1. Similarly for higher d.\n\nBut in code, for a given d, the upper bound can be calculated as something like n ** (1/(d-1)) + 2. But since in Python, taking roots for big numbers can be done via binary search, perhaps it's easier to use binary search for k from 2 to some upper limit.\n\nAlternatively, since for a given d, the sum increases with k, we can binary search k between 2 and upper_bound, where upper_bound can be set as n (but that's too big). However, since for k ≥2, the sum for d is at least 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} (since 1 + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1}).\n\nSo for k^{d-1} ≤n →k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}. So upper bound can be set as n^{1/(d-1)} + 1. But how to compute that in Python?\n\nWell, we can compute it via taking the integer part of n ** (1/(d-1)) and adding 2. However, for large exponents, this can be tricky. But in practice, for binary search, even if the upper bound is too large, the binary search will still work, albeit with more steps.\n\nSo, for code:\n\nfor each test case n:\n\n   if n ==1 → output NO\n\n   else:\n\n      for d in 3 to 60:\n\n         if 2^d -1 >n → break (since for higher d, it's even larger)\n\n         else:\n\n             low =2\n\n             high = 2 (initial guess?)\n\n             # find upper bound for k:\n\n             # find upper bound as something like n^(1/(d-1)) + 2\n\n             # but how?\n\n             # Alternatively, start with high=2, and double until compute_sum(high, d) >n.\n\n             # this is called exponential search.\n\n             # find high such that compute_sum(high, d) >n.\n\n             # then perform binary search between low and high.\n\n             # this way, we don't have to compute the exact upper bound.\n\n             # let's implement this.\n\n             # first, find the upper bound for k.\n\n             high =2\n\n             while compute_sum(high, d) <=n:\n\n                 high *=2\n\n             # now, binary search between low=2 and high.\n\n             # perform binary search between low and high.\n\n             # during binary search, check if any k in this range gives sum ==n.\n\n             # So:\n\n             left = 2\n\n             right = high\n\n             found = False\n\n             while left <= right:\n\n                 mid = (left + right) //2\n\n                 s = compute_sum(mid, d)\n\n                 if s ==n:\n\n                     found = True\n\n                     break\n\n                 elif s <n:\n\n                     left = mid +1\n\n                 else:\n\n                     right = mid -1\n\n             if found:\n\n                 return YES\n\n      after checking all d, if no found, return NO.\n\nBut how to implement compute_sum(mid, d)?\n\nBut for large d and mid, the compute_sum function may take O(d) time, which is acceptable since d is up to 60 and t is 1e4.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18 and d up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nSample input:\n\nTest case n=1: output NO.\n\nn=2: output NO.\n\nn=3: output NO.\n\nn=6: output NO.\n\nn=13: YES (for d=3, k=3. 1+3+9=13.)\n\nn=15: YES? Let's see. For example, d=3, k=2: 1+2+4=7. No. d=3, k=3 is 13. d=3, k=4 is 1+4+16=21. So no. What about d=4, k=2: sum is 1+2+4+8=15 → yes. So for n=15, yes.\n\nAnother sample input is 255. Let's see: 255 is 2^8 -1 = 255. So for d=8, (k^d -1)/(k-1) = 255. For k=2: (2^8 -1)/1 =255. So d=8, which is ≥3. So yes.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000. Output is NO. So for this n, there is no k and d.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing the compute_sum function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, for very large exponents, this could be slow. However, since d is up to 60, and for each test case, the number of d's is up to 60, and for each d, binary search steps are log2(high), which for high up to say 1e9 is manageable.\n\nNow, for each test case, we need to loop through d from 3 up to max_d. What is the max_d? Well, for k=2, the minimal sum for d is 2^d -1. For n up to 1e18, 2^60 is about 1e18. So d can go up to 60.\n\nSo in code, for each n, loop d from 3 to 60:\n\nBut for some d, 2^d -1 could be larger than n. So for example, for n=7, d can be up to 3 (since 2^3 -1 =7). For d=4, 2^4-1=15>7, so we can break.\n\nBut in code, for each d in 3 to 60:\n\n   compute the minimal possible sum for k=2, which is 2^d -1. If this is larger than n, then for higher d, it will be even larger. So we can break the loop here.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor d in range(3, 61):\n\n    min_sum = 2**d -1\n\n    if min_sum >n:\n\n        break\n\n    # else proceed to check for this d.\n\nBut wait, 2^d can be very big. For d=60, 2^60 is 1e18, which is manageable in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, for d=60, 2^60-1 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,975 which is larger than 1e18 (which is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000). So for n=1e18, 2^60-1 is larger than n. So the loop for d would break when d reaches 59, since 2^59-1 is 576460752303423487, which is less than 1e18.\n\nBut for code, perhaps we can compute the maximum possible d as up to 60, and for each d, check if 2^d-1 <=n. If not, break.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nRead t test cases. For each n:\n\nif n is 1: print NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   flag = False\n\n   for d in 3 to 60:\n\n       min_sum = 2^d -1\n\n       if min_sum >n:\n\n           break\n\n       # Now, find if there exists a k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i =n.\n\n       # perform the binary search for k.\n\n       # find upper bound for k.\n\n       # first, find upper bound via doubling.\n\n       low_k = 2\n\n       high_k = 2\n\n       while compute_sum(high_k, d, n) <=n:\n\n           high_k *=2\n\n       # Now binary search between low_k and high_k.\n\n       left = 2\n\n       right = high_k\n\n       while left <= right:\n\n           mid = (left + right) //2\n\n           s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n           if s ==n:\n\n               flag = True\n\n               break\n\n           elif s <n:\n\n               left = mid +1\n\n           else:\n\n               right = mid -1\n\n       if flag:\n\n           break\n\n   if flag:\n\n       print(\"YES\")\n\n   else:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\nBut how to implement compute_sum?\n\nWait, the compute_sum function for a given k and d, returns the sum of 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}, but stops early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo in Python:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut note that in the code above, the loop runs for d steps. For example, for d=3, it adds 1, then k, then k^2. So the sum is 1 +k +k², which is correct.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case n=13:\n\nCheck for d=3:\n\nmin_sum for d=3 is 2^3 -1 =7 <=13.\n\nNow, find k.\n\nInitially, high_k starts at 2. compute_sum(2,3,13) is 1+2+4=7 <=13. So high_k doubles to 4. compute_sum(4,3,13) is 1+4+16=21>13. So binary search between 2 and 4.\n\nleft=2, right=4.\n\nmid=3: compute_sum(3,3,13) is 1+3+9=13 → yes. So returns yes.\n\nThus, for n=13, answer is yes.\n\nAnother sample input is n=15. For d=4, min_sum is 2^4 -1 =15. So check for d=4. compute_sum(2,4,15) is 1+2+4+8=15 → yes. So returns yes.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6. Let's see:\n\nCheck for d=3: min_sum is 7>6 → break. So no possible d. Hence output is no.\n\nAnother sample input is n=255. For d=8, min_sum is 2^8-1=25",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and our task is to check if such a structure can exist for the given $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A valid snowflake graph can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Specifically, for integers $ k \\geq 2 $ and $ d \\geq 3 $, the number of vertices $ n $ must be expressible as $ \\frac{k^d - 1}{k - 1} $.\n2. **Iterative Check**: For each test case, iterate over possible values of $ d $ (from 3 to 60) since $ 2^{60} $ is slightly more than $ 10^{18} $. For each $ d $, check if there exists an integer $ k \\geq 2 $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $.\n3. **Binary Search**: For each $ d $, use binary search to find a suitable $ k $ that satisfies the geometric series sum equation. This involves checking if the sum of the series up to $ d $ terms equals $ n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(d):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return float('inf')\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef is_snowflake_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_d = 60\n    for d in range(3, max_d + 1):\n        # Calculate minimal sum for k=2\n        min_sum = (2**d) - 1\n        if min_sum > n:\n            break\n        # Now find if there exists a k >= 2 such that sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i == n\n        # Find upper bound for k using exponential search\n        low_k = 2\n        high_k = 2\n        while True:\n            s = compute_sum(high_k, d, n)\n            if s > n:\n                break\n            high_k *= 2\n        # Binary search between low_k and high_k\n        left = 2\n        right = high_k\n        found = False\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n            if s == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif s < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_snowflake_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Validity**: For each number $ n $, the function `is_snowflake_possible` checks if it can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with parameters $ k \\geq 2 $ and $ d \\geq 3 $.\n3. **Geometric Series Sum Calculation**: The helper function `compute_sum` calculates the sum of the geometric series up to $ d $ terms and checks if it exceeds $ n $ early to avoid unnecessary computations.\n4. **Binary Search for $ k $**: For each $ d $, we use binary search to efficiently determine if there exists a $ k $ such that the sum of the series equals $ n $.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the snowflake graph within the constraints, leveraging mathematical properties and efficient search techniques.",
