The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such graphs.\n\nFirst, let's recap the construction rules. The snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, every vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the previous step) get each connected to k new vertices. This process must be done at least once. So the steps are:\n\n1. Start with 1 node.\n2. Add k nodes connected to the root. Now total nodes is 1 + k.\n3. Then, for each of the k nodes added in step 2, add k new nodes. Each of these new nodes is connected to their parent. So each of those k nodes now has k children. The total nodes now is 1 + k + k*k.\n4. But the process of adding layers (step 3) must be done at least once. Wait, the description says that step 3 is done at least once. Wait, the original problem says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf (those with only one connection) is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake for k=4 would be:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then add 4 children (total 5). Then each of those 4 nodes gets 4 children. So total nodes is 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? But the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the construction.\n\nWait looking at the example input: when n=13, output is YES. Let's think. How can 13 be formed?\n\nLet me think about the possible structures.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as a tree. Because each step adds new nodes connected to existing leaves. So the snowflake is a tree. Let's model the number of nodes as a function of the steps taken.\n\nThe snowflake is built in layers. Let me think of the process as follows:\n\n- The root is level 0.\n- Level 1: k nodes connected to the root.\n- Then, each node in level 1 has k children. So level 2 has k * k nodes.\n- Then, each node in level 2 has k children. So level 3 has k^3 nodes.\n- And so on.\n\nBut the process requires that the step of adding children to leaves (the step where each leaf gets k new children) is done at least once. So the snowflake must have at least two layers beyond the root. Wait, no. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes to the root. Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf (which are the ones from the first step) is done at least once. So the minimal case is when after adding the first layer (k nodes), we do the step once, which adds k children to each of the k nodes. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k * k. For example, if k=2, then 1+2 + 2*2 = 1+2+4=7 nodes. But according to the example input, n=6 gives a NO. Let's check that. For example, if n=6, can it be achieved?\n\nIf k=2 and we have 1 + 2 + 2*2 = 7 nodes, which is more than 6. If k=3, then 1+3+3*3 = 13, which is the example case where n=13 is YES. So for n=6, maybe there's another possibility. Wait, perhaps the construction can be done with different numbers of layers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the step of adding k children to each leaf is done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children to the root) is required, and then the step of adding k children to each leaf (from the previous step) is done once or more times. So the total number of layers is at least 2.\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k children to the root (level 1). Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf (level 1 nodes) is done once (so level 2 is added). Then, perhaps you can do more steps. So the total number of nodes is:\n\nLet me think of the number of layers. Suppose we have m layers. The first layer (after the root) is level 1, then level 2, etc. The construction must have at least two layers (since the step is done at least once). So for example, if m=2 layers (levels 1 and 2), then the total nodes is 1 + k + k*k. If m=3 layers, then the total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But wait, no. Because after adding level 1 (k nodes), then adding level 2 (each of the level 1 nodes has k children, so k*k nodes). Then, the next step would be to add level 3: each of the level 2 nodes (which are leaves) get k children. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But the process of adding the layers (steps) must be done at least once. So the minimal is m=2 layers (so the total is 1 + k + k^2). \n\nSo the snowflake's total nodes can be represented as 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1}) ), where m is the number of layers added after the initial step. Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, each step adds a new layer. The first step (after the initial) adds level 2. The second step adds level 3, etc. So for m steps (where m ≥1), the total number of nodes is:\n\nTotal = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m} ) ? No. Let me see:\n\nLet me consider m as the number of times the step is performed. The step is: take all current leaves (those with only one connection) and add k children to each. The initial step (adding the first layer) is mandatory. Then, the step of adding children to leaves must be done at least once. So:\n\nLet me model the total nodes as follows:\n\nLet's say that the process is done for t levels. Let me think of the construction as follows:\n\n- The root (level 0).\n- Level 1: k nodes.\n- Level 2: each node in level 1 has k children. So k * k nodes.\n- Level 3: each node in level 2 has k children. So k^3 nodes.\n- ...\n- Level d: k^d nodes.\n\nBut the process requires that the step of adding children to leaves is done at least once. So the number of levels (layers) after the root is at least 2. Because the initial step (adding level 1) is required, and then the step of adding level 2 (the first step) is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d, where d ≥ 2?\n\nWait, no. Because the initial step is adding level 1 (k nodes). Then, the step of adding children to leaves (the level 1 nodes) is done once, which adds level 2. Then, if we do another step, we add level 3. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{t} where t is the number of layers added. But the first step (adding level 1) is part of the construction. So the total number of layers is t+1? Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the total number of nodes as:\n\nTotal = 1 + k * ( (k^m - 1) / (k - 1) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The initial step is adding k nodes (level 1). Then, for each step (say, m steps), each leaf (which are the nodes from the previous step) gets k children. So the total number of nodes is:\n\nAfter 0 steps (only the initial step): 1 + k.\n\nAfter 1 step (adding level 2): 1 + k + k * k.\n\nAfter 2 steps (adding level 3): 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because each step adds a new level. The first step (after the initial) adds level 2, which is k^2 nodes. The second step adds level 3, which is k^3 nodes. So the total nodes after m steps (where m ≥ 1) is:\n\nTotal = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^{m+1} ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nInitial step (before any steps): 1 node. Then, adding level 1 (k nodes) gives 1 + k.\n\nThen, the first step (adding level 2) adds k * k nodes. So total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n\nSecond step adds level 3: k^3 nodes. Total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nSo the total after m steps (m ≥ 1) is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1}? No. Wait, for m steps after the initial step. Wait, the initial step (adding level 1) is required. Then, the steps (adding new levels) are done m times, where m ≥ 1. So for m=1, the total is 1 +k +k^2. For m=2, it's 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the formula is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i - k^0 (since the sum from i=0 to m+1 is 1 +k + ... +k^{m+1}, but the root is 1, and the rest is sum from i=1 to m+1 of k^i). Wait, no. The sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nWait, the total number of nodes is 1 (root) plus the sum for each level. Level 1 has k^1, level 2 has k^2, ..., level (m+1) has k^{m+1} ?\n\nNo, because the initial step is adding level 1 (k nodes). Then, for each step (m steps), adding level 2 (k^2), level 3 (k^3), etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1} ?\n\nNo, for m steps. Let's say m is the number of times the step is done. For example, the first step (m=1) adds level 2. So total nodes is 1 +k (level 1) + k^2 (level 2). Which is 1 + k + k^2. For m steps, the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i ?\n\nWait, sum from i=1 to m+1 is k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1}. Adding 1 gives total nodes. So the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i = sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i.\n\nBut sum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So for the total nodes, it's (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1), where d is m+1. Wait, no. Let me compute:\n\nsum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So if the total nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i, then that's the formula. So for example, when d=2 (sum from 0 to 2: 1 +k +k^2), which is the case when m=1 (the first step after initial).\n\nBut the problem requires that the steps (adding children to leaves) are done at least once. Which implies that m ≥ 1. Therefore, d = m+1 ≥ 2. So the total number of nodes is (k^{d} -1)/(k-1) where d ≥ 2. Wait, because sum_{i=0}^d k^i is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). Wait, no, the formula is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) for the sum from i=0 to d. So if the total nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i, then the formula is that. So for example, when d=2, sum is 1 +k +k^2 = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). Which is correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if there exists integers k>1 and d ≥ 2 such that n = (k^{d} - 1)/(k-1). Because that's the formula for the sum of the geometric series from 0 to d terms. Wait, but d here is the maximum exponent. So for example, when d=2, the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Which is indeed (k^3 -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo the problem is to check whether n can be written in the form (k^d -1)/(k-1), where k>1 and d≥2. However, there's another possibility. What if the construction stops before adding all the layers? For example, maybe the snowflake is built with some layers but not all. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the construction process is that each time, you add new layers. Once you add a new layer, you can stop. For example, the snowflake could be built with 1 +k nodes (the initial step and no further steps). But according to the problem statement, the step of adding new children to leaves must be done at least once. Which means that the initial step (adding k children to the root) is required, but then you must perform the step of adding children to leaves once. So the minimal case is when you have 1 +k +k^2 nodes. Therefore, the formula for n is (k^d -1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 2. Because for d=2, the formula is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. Which matches the minimal case. So the problem reduces to checking if n can be written in this form for some k>1 and d≥2.\n\nBut wait, what about if the construction is stopped after adding the first layer (k nodes)? According to the problem statement, the step of adding children to leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is required. Then, the step of adding children to leaves (the k nodes) must be done once. So the minimal number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Therefore, n cannot be 1 +k (like 1 +k = 2, which would be for k=1, but k must be >1). So for example, n=2 is impossible.\n\nSo the problem is to check if n can be expressed as (k^d - 1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and d≥2. However, there's another possibility. For example, suppose that after adding the first layer (k nodes), you add some layers, but not all. Wait, but according to the problem's construction, each time you add a layer, you add all the children for all leaves. So the process is that you add layers until you decide to stop. So the total nodes is the sum of the geometric series up to some d ≥ 2. Therefore, the formula holds.\n\nThus, the problem becomes: for a given n, check if there exists integers k>1 and d≥2 such that n = (k^d -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. For each test case n, we need to check if there exists some d ≥2 and k>1 such that n equals that formula.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of d. Since for each d, we can iterate through possible d's, and check if n can be written in that form.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to find an efficient way.\n\nFirst, note that for each d ≥2, the possible k's are bounded. For example, for a fixed d, the value of (k^d -1)/(k-1) increases with k. So for a given d, we can find if there exists a k such that the equation holds.\n\nMoreover, for each d, the minimal value of (k^d -1)/(k-1) is when k=2. For example, when d=2, (2^2 -1)/(2-1) =3. When d=3, (2^3-1)/1=7, etc. So for each d, the minimal possible value is 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{d-1} }? Wait, no. Wait the formula is (k^d -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} }, right? Because the sum of a geometric series with d terms. Wait, for example, if d=2, then sum is 1 +k. Which is (k^2 -1)/(k-1). Yes.\n\nWait, earlier analysis said that the formula is (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some d≥2. But according to the construction, the formula is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m} where m is the number of layers. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the formula. Let me recheck.\n\nLet me take the case where the snowflake has layers up to level m. For example, the root (level 0), then level 1 (k nodes), level 2 (k^2 nodes), ..., level m (k^m nodes). So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut according to the problem's construction, the step of adding children to leaves is done at least once. Which requires that m ≥ 1. Because the initial step adds level 1 (k nodes), then the step of adding children to leaves (level 1) is done once, adding level 2 (k^2 nodes). So m is the maximum level. Thus, for the snowflake to be valid, m must be ≥1. Hence, the total number of nodes is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), with m ≥1. Which implies that the exponent is (m+1) ≥2. So the formula is (k^d -1)/(k-1) where d ≥2. So yes, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and d≥2.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check if there exists any pair (k, d) where k≥2, d≥2, such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for a given n, whether such k and d exist.\n\nHow can we approach this?\n\nLet me think for each possible d ≥2, check if there exists a k such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nFor each d, we can compute the possible k's.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to find all possible d's up to a certain maximum.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible d for a given n?\n\nWell, for d=2, the minimal value is (2^2 -1)/(2-1) =3. For larger d, the minimal value is (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1. For example, d=3, minimal is 7; d=4, 15, etc. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible d is log_2(n+1). For example, for n=1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So for each n, we can iterate d from 2 up to log2(n)+1, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck for all possible d from 2 up to 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18), and for each d, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nIf for any d and k, this holds, return YES. Else, return NO.\n\nNow, how to check for a given d and n, whether there exists a k such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nLet me denote f(k, d) = (k^d -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nWe can note that for fixed d, f(k, d) is strictly increasing in k. So for each d, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there exists a k ≥2 such that f(k, d) =n.\n\nBut for large d, even for k=2, f(k, d) can be very big. So for each d, the maximum possible k is such that f(k, d) ≤n. But since f(k, d) increases with k, we can binary search for k in [2, ... upper_bound].\n\nBut how to compute f(k, d) for large k and d? For example, when d=60 and k=2, f(k, d) is 2^60 -1, which is about 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, we can handle this.\n\nBut during the binary search, we need to compute f(k, d) and check if it equals n. However, for large k and d, this can overflow. But since Python handles big integers, that's not a problem.\n\nBut how to compute f(k, d) efficiently?\n\nNote that f(k, d) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} = (k^d -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut calculating this directly may be computationally intensive for large exponents. However, since d is up to 60, and for each binary search step, it's manageable.\n\nBut another approach is to compute the sum incrementally. For example, for a given k and d, compute the sum step by step, and if during the computation the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nThis is important to avoid overflows (but in Python, it's not a problem, but for efficiency, it's better to break early).\n\nSo for a given d and k, compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nBut for each term, we can compute it incrementally, and if at any point the sum exceeds n, we can stop and return that it's too big.\n\nSo for example, for a given k and d, start with sum =0, and for i in 0 to d-1:\n\nsum += k^i.\n\nBut computing k^i for i up to 60 is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum is (k^d -1)/(k-1), we can compute it directly, but again, for large k and d, it's possible that k^d is very big, but since we can check if it's equal to n, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut for the purposes of checking equality, perhaps using the formula is better.\n\nBut let's proceed with the approach of checking for each d from 2 up to log2(n)+1, and for each d, perform a binary search on k.\n\nBut what is the range of k for each d?\n\nFor a fixed d, the minimal k is 2. The maximum possible k is such that f(k, d) ≤n.\n\nWe can find the upper bound for k as follows: since f(k, d) is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} (since all terms are positive). So for k ≥2, k^{d-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nThus, for binary search, the upper bound can be set as n^(1/(d-1)) +1.\n\nBut since d can be up to 60, for each d, the upper bound for k is small.\n\nSo for each d, we can perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound.\n\nLet me outline the steps for checking a given n:\n\nFor each d in 2 to max_d:\n\n   compute the minimal possible value of f(k, d) for k=2. If that's larger than n, skip this d.\n\n   else, perform binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound] to see if there exists a k such that f(k, d) =n.\n\nBut how to compute the upper bound for k for a given d?\n\nWell, since f(k, d) is increasing with k, the maximum possible k for which f(k, d) ≤n is when k is such that k^{d-1} ≤n → k ≤n^(1/(d-1)).\n\nBut since for d≥2, d-1 ≥1. So for example, for d=2, the upper bound is sqrt(n) (since f(k, 2) =k+1. So k+1 ≤n →k ≤n-1. But for d=2, the upper bound can be n-1, but that's a lot. However, in practice, for d=2, f(k, 2) =k+1. So for a given n, we can check if n-1 is ≥2, and if (n-1) is a valid k. So for d=2, the equation is k+1 =n →k =n-1. So we just need to check if n-1 ≥2 →n≥3. So for d=2, the answer is yes if n-1 ≥2 (i.e., n≥3) and also check if (k^d -1)/(k-1) equals n. Which for d=2, it's (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. So for d=2, the condition is that n =k+1, so k =n-1. So for d=2, we can directly check if n-1 ≥2 (i.e., n≥3) and then check if (n-1) is ≥2. But wait, since k must be ≥2. So for d=2, the equation is n =k+1. So k =n-1 must be ≥2 →n-1 ≥2 →n≥3. So for any n≥3, if we can find that for d=2, the answer is yes. But wait, no! Because for example, n=3: k=2, d=2 → (2^2-1)/(2-1)=3 → yes. For n=4: k=3, d=2 →3+1=4 → yes. So for any n≥3, the answer would be yes? But according to the sample input, when n=3, the output is NO. Wait, this contradicts. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample input includes:\n\nInput for n=3: output is NO.\n\nWait, but according to this reasoning, for d=2, n=3 would be allowed. But according to the sample, n=3 is not a valid snowflake.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because the construction requires that the step of adding children to leaves is done at least once. For the case of d=2, the formula is (k^d -1)/(k-1) = (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. Which is the case where the snowflake has 1 +k nodes. But according to the construction rules, the step of adding children to leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children) is required, and then the step of adding children to leaves (the k nodes) must be done once. Which would add k^2 nodes. So the total would be 1 +k +k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. So for d=3. \n\nWait, this suggests that my earlier analysis was wrong. Oh no! So there's a mistake in the formula.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the formula is (k^d -1)/(k-1) for d≥2. But according to the problem's construction, the minimal case is when the step is done once. Which adds level 2 (k^2 nodes). So the total is 1 +k +k^2 = (k^3 -1)/(k-1) → which corresponds to d=3. So the formula is (k^d -1)/(k-1) where d ≥3?\n\nBut then why in the sample input, n=13 is YES. Let's see:\n\nFor k=3 and d=3: (3^3 -1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 = 26/2=13 → yes. Which matches the sample input. So for n=13, it's YES.\n\nBut for n=3, according to this formula, we need to find d≥3 and k≥2 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =3. Let's see:\n\nFor d=3: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k^2 +k +1 =3. So solving for k: k^2 +k +1 =3 →k^2 +k -2=0 →k=(-1 ± sqrt(1+8))/2 → ( -1 +3)/2 = 1. So k=1, which is invalid. So no solution for d=3.\n\nFor d=2: the formula would be (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1 =3 →k=2. But according to the problem's construction, this would correspond to d=2, but according to the construction rules, the step must be done at least once. Which would require that d≥3. So the formula is (k^d -1)/(k-1) where d≥3. Hence, the earlier analysis was wrong. The formula should have d≥3, not d≥2.\n\nThis explains why the sample input for n=3 returns NO. Because the minimal possible value for d≥3 is when k=2, d=3: (2^3-1)/1 =7. So for n=3, it's impossible.\n\nSo what's the correct formula?\n\nLet me re-express the construction steps. The initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step of adding children to leaves is done at least once. That step adds k children to each of the current leaves (which are the k nodes from the first step). So after that step, the total nodes is 1 +k +k*k = 1 +k +k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. So this corresponds to d=3. Hence, the formula is (k^d -1)/(k-1) with d≥3.\n\nSo the correct condition is that n can be written as (k^d -1)/(k-1) where k≥2 and d≥3.\n\nAh! That's the mistake in the earlier analysis. The minimal d is 3, not 2. Hence, for the problem, we need to check for d≥3.\n\nSo for the sample input n=3, which is less than the minimal value for d≥3 (which is 7 for k=2, d=3), the answer is NO.\n\nSo this changes the approach. Now, for each n, we need to check if there exists k≥2 and d≥3 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nSo now, for the case of d=2, it's not allowed. Hence, the previous thinking about d≥2 is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct approach is to check for d≥3.\n\nSo for the sample input:\n\nn=13: d=3, k=3 → (3^3-1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 = 13 → YES.\n\nn=6: Let's see. Are there any k and d≥3 such that the formula equals 6?\n\nCheck for d=3:\n\nk^3 -1/(k-1) =k² +k +1 =6 →k² +k -5=0 → roots are [-1 ± sqrt(21)]/2. Not integer. So no.\n\nFor d=4: (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =6. Let's try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15>6. k=1 is invalid. So no solution. Hence, n=6 is NO, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=6 is NO. So the code needs to check for d≥3.\n\nNow, the problem becomes: for a given n, check if there exists k≥2 and d≥3 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nSo the approach is similar to before, but with d starting from 3.\n\nNow, let's rework the algorithm.\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck for all possible d ≥3, up to a maximum value (like log2(n)+1), and for each d, perform a binary search on k to find if there exists a k≥2 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nNow, for each d, what's the maximum possible value of d?\n\nFor d=3, the minimal value is (2^3-1)/(2-1) =7.\n\nFor d=4, it's 15.\n\nFor d=5, 31.\n\nAnd so on. For a given n, the maximum d is such that 2^d -1 ≤n. For example, for n=1e18, the maximum d is around 60.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n:\n\nIf n is 1: output NO (since the snowflake must have at least 1 +k +k^2, which for k≥2 is 1+2+4=7).\n\nIf n is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nIterate d from 3 up to log2(n) +1 (say up to 60), and for each d, check if there exists a k≥2 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nIf any of these checks pass, output YES. Else, output NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nLet's think about how to check for each d.\n\nFor a given d, the function f(k) = (k^d -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing in k. So for each d, we can binary search on k.\n\nBut how to compute f(k) efficiently and without overflow?\n\nIn Python, since integers are arbitrary precision, we don't have to worry about overflow. However, for performance, we need to compute f(k) efficiently, and also avoid unnecessary computations.\n\nBut for each k and d, the formula can be computed as follows:\n\ndef compute_f(k, d):\n    # returns (k^d -1) // (k-1)\n    if k == 1:\n        return d  # but k >=2\n    total = 0\n    power = 1\n    for _ in range(d):\n        total += power\n        power *=k\n    return total\n\nWait, but this is equivalent to sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i. Which is the same as (k^d -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut for large d and k, this loop may take O(d) time. However, since d is up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, compute using the formula (k^d -1) // (k-1). But for large exponents, this may be computationally expensive. However, for small exponents, it's manageable.\n\nBut for binary search purposes, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nSo during the binary search for k, for a given d, we can compute the sum step by step and check if it exceeds n. If during the computation the sum exceeds n, we",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem's construction rules. The snowflake graph is built in such a way that it must have at least three layers, starting from a root node with $ k $ children, followed by each leaf node (from the previous layer) getting $ k $ children, and this process must be done at least once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph is constructed such that the total number of vertices can be represented by the formula $ \\frac{k^d - 1}{k - 1} $ where $ k > 1 $ and $ d \\geq 3 $.
