Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to pair left and right boots based on their colors. The colors can be specific letters or question marks which are wildcards. The goal is to find the maximum number of compatible pairs. And then output those pairs with their indices.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to think about how to maximize the pairs. Let's think about the approach.\n\nThe key is to match the boots in a way that uses as many compatible pairs as possible. Since question marks can match anything, they can be used flexibly. But how to manage them optimally?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nFirst, for each left boot and right boot, we can try to pair them if their colors are compatible. But since each boot can be used once, we need a way to track which ones are already paired.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, we need an efficient algorithm. Brute force checking all possibilities isn't feasible.\n\nAn idea: process the pairs in a way that first matches the specific colors, then use the question marks to fill in the gaps.\n\nFor example, for each color (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. Then, for each color, the number of pairs is the minimum of left count and right count. But then, after that, the remaining left and right boots (which are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched) can be paired using the question marks.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used to pair with any other boots. So maybe the optimal approach is:\n\n1. Match all specific color pairs where left and right have the same color. For example, if there's a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with color 'a', pair them.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently? Because if we just iterate through each left and right, we might end up with overlapping pairs.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a greedy approach. Let's first count for each color (excluding '?') the number of left and right boots. For each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Then, subtract these from the counts, and then handle the question marks.\n\nBut then, after that, the remaining left and right boots would be either question marks or colors that couldn't be matched. However, the question marks can be paired with any remaining boots. But how to calculate that?\n\nWait, the problem is that the question marks can be used both as left and right. For example, a left '?' can pair with a right 'a', or a right '?' can pair with a left 'b', or even two question marks.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\n- First, for each color c (not '?'), pair as many left c with right c as possible. Let's collect these pairs.\n\n- Then, collect the remaining left and right boots. These are:\n\n   - Left boots that are either '?' or have colors that had more left than right (or vice versa) in step 1.\n\n   - Similarly for right boots.\n\n- Now, the remaining left and right boots can be paired using the question marks. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that after step 1, we have some left question marks and right question marks, plus some other left and right boots that couldn't be matched. For example, suppose there are x left '?'s and y right '?'s. Also, there are some left boots with specific colors (say, 'a') that couldn't find matching right boots (because there were more left 'a's than right 'a's). Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut the question marks can pair with any of these. So, the maximum number of pairs possible would be the sum of:\n\n- The pairs from step 1.\n\nPlus the minimum between the number of remaining left boots (including '?') and remaining right boots (including '?'), but considering that each can be paired with any.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because the remaining left and right boots may have specific colors. For example, if there are some left boots with color 'a' (unmatched), and some right boots with color 'b' (unmatched), but no question marks. Then, they cannot be paired. However, if there are some question marks, they can pair with them.\n\nSo the second part is to pair the remaining left and right boots. How?\n\nLet me think of the remaining left boots as a list of colors (could be specific or '?'), and same for the right. The maximum number of pairs is the minimum of the total number of left and right remaining boots. But how to pair them?\n\nBut how to pair them optimally. For example, if there are left boots with specific colors and right boots with specific colors. But since they can't be matched, but if there are question marks, they can be used to pair with them.\n\nSo perhaps, after",

The colors can be specific letters or question marks ('?'), which are wildcards that can match any color. The solution involves a greedy approach to first pair specific colors and then use question marks to fill in remaining pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Specific Color Pairs**: First, we count the number of left and right boots for each specific color (excluding '?'). For each color, we pair as many left boots with right boots as possible.\n2. **Handle Remaining Boots with Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots using question marks.
