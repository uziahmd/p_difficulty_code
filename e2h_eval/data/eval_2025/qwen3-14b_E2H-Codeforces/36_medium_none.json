The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about calculating the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the conditions required for such a configuration to exist. \n\nFirst, the signal coverage needs to be such that every town from 1 to n is covered exactly once. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower. \n\nLet me think about what kind of tower placements allow this. For example, if there are two adjacent towers, say at positions i and i+1, then their signal ranges can't overlap in a way that covers the same town. But maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, the example given for n=2: when towers are built in 1 and 2. Then each can have power 1. That covers 1 (from 1) and 2 (from 2). Towns 0 and 3 are not covered. So that works. \n\nAnother example: if there's a single tower in position 2 (for n=5), then it can have power 2. That would cover towns 1, 2, 3. But then towns 4 and 5 need to be covered. Wait, but if there's only that tower, then towns 4 and 5 are not covered. So that's invalid. So the tower arrangement must be such that there's a way to partition the towns into ranges covered by each tower, with each tower covering a contiguous block of towns, and their ranges not overlapping except on the edges.\n\nWait, maybe the valid tower arrangements are those where the towers form a structure similar to a partition of the interval [1, n] into segments where each segment is covered by exactly one tower, and the tower is placed in the middle of the segment. Because for a segment of length m, the tower must be placed in the center, and have a power that covers exactly that segment. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the towers must be arranged in such a way that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain spacing. For example, if we have towers at positions i and j, then the distance between them must be such that their coverage doesn't overlap in a way that causes overlapping coverage on towns. \n\nLet me think about the constraints again. Each town must be covered exactly once. So, for a tower at position i with power p, it covers towns from i-p+1 to i+p-1. Wait, no. The signal reaches cities c where |c - i| < p. So the range is (i - p + 1) to (i + p - 1)? Or maybe i-p+1 to i + p - 1? Let me see. For example, if p is 2, then |c - i| < 2 means c can be i-1, i, or i+1. So the range is from i-1 to i+1. Which is length 3. So the radius is p-1. So for a tower at i with power p, the range is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). But the signal power can be chosen as needed. \n\nBut how to model the possible configurations of towers that allow such a setup. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a valid configuration for the first k towns, then adding something for the next. \n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as tiling the line with intervals. Each tower must be responsible for a certain interval of towns. For example, if a tower is placed at position i, then the interval it covers must be such that the left neighbor of i (if any) is not covered by this tower, and the right neighbor is not covered either. Wait, but the tower's coverage must end at some point. \n\nWait, for the coverage to be exact, each tower's coverage must be exactly the towns that are assigned to it. So for a tower at position i, the coverage must start at some position a and end at some position b. And the next tower's coverage must start at b+1. \n\nMoreover, since the tower's coverage is symmetric around its position, perhaps the coverage of a tower must be such that it spans from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). But for the coverage to end exactly at some point, maybe the tower's coverage must be such that the next tower is placed at a distance that allows their ranges to not overlap. \n\nAlternatively, considering that for a tower at position i, the maximum reach to the left is i - p + 1, and to the right is i + p - 1. To ensure that the coverage of this tower ends at exactly some town, perhaps the tower's coverage must be such that the next tower is placed exactly at i + p. Because then, the coverage of the first tower ends at i + p - 1, and the next tower starts at i + p. So their ranges don't overlap. \n\nSo for example, if there's a tower at i, and another at j > i, then the coverage of i must end before j starts. Which would require that j - i > p_i, where p_i is the power of the tower at i. But since p_i can be chosen, this suggests that for the tower at i, the maximum reach to the right is i + p_i - 1. So to have the next tower at j, we must have j >= i + p_i. But since p_i can be chosen, the minimal requirement is that j >= i + 1. But that's always true. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, the problem allows us to choose the power for each tower. So the question is: given the set of towers, can we assign power to each so that:\n\n- Each town is covered exactly once.\n\n- The towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nSo perhaps the towers must form a structure where they can be paired in such a way that each tower's coverage is exactly a certain range, and these ranges are non-overlapping and cover all towns 1..n.\n\nThis seems similar to a tiling problem. Let's think of each tower as covering a certain number of towns. For example, a tower can cover a single town (power 1), or two towns (power 2, covering itself and adjacent), etc. However, the way they are placed must allow for non-overlapping coverage.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the valid tower placements as those that can be partitioned into intervals, each of which is covered by exactly one tower. For each such interval, the tower must be located in the middle, such that the coverage extends exactly to the ends of the interval.\n\nFor example, if an interval of length m (number of towns covered) is covered by a tower at position i. Then, the tower's power must be such that it covers exactly the entire interval. Let's think about the interval from a to b (inclusive). The tower must be located at some position i within this interval. The power p must be such that i - p + 1 = a and i + p - 1 = b. Solving these equations gives:\n\na = i - p + 1\n\nb = i + p - 1\n\nAdding both equations: a + b = 2i → i = (a + b)/2. So the tower must be placed exactly in the middle of the interval. Also, subtracting the equations: b - a = 2(p - 1) → p = (b - a)/2 + 1. Since p must be an integer, this implies that the length of the interval (b - a + 1) must be such that (b - a) is even. Wait, let's compute:\n\nThe length of the interval is (b - a + 1). Let's denote L = b - a + 1. Then, b - a = L - 1. So from earlier, p = (L - 1)/2 + 1 = (L + 1)/2. Therefore, L must be odd. Because (L + 1) must be even. So L must be odd. So for a tower to cover exactly an interval of length L, which is odd, and the tower is placed at the center. \n\nSo for example, if the interval is of length 1 (a single town), then L=1. Then p = (1 + 1)/2 = 1. So the tower is placed at that town, and has power 1. If the interval is length 3 (towns a, a+1, a+2), then L=3, p=(3+1)/2=2. The tower is placed at a+1, and has power 2. This covers a, a+1, a+2. \n\nSo this suggests that the entire set of towns from 1 to n must be partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, each covered by a tower at their center. Moreover, the tower must be present at that center. \n\nSo for the tower arrangement to be valid, the set of towers must include exactly the centers of these intervals. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets of towns {1..n} that can be partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, with each interval's center being present in the subset. \n\nBut how do we model this? It seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let's think about dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. \n\nLet me think: for the first i towns, the number of valid ways to arrange towers such that they can be partitioned into intervals as described. \n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty set). \n\nFor dp[i], we can consider that the last interval ends at i. The length of this interval must be odd. Let's say the last interval has length k (k is odd). Then, the center of this interval is at position i - (k-1)/2. Let's call this position j. So the interval is from j - (k-1)/2 to j + (k-1)/2. Which is exactly the interval of length k. \n\nSo for example, if k=1, the interval is just j, and the length is 1. So for the last interval of length k, the center is j, and we must have a tower at j. Then, the previous part of the arrangement must be valid up to j-1. \n\nSo the recurrence is: dp[i] = sum_{k is odd, j = i - (k-1)/2 >= 1} dp[j-1] * 1 (since the tower at j must be present, and others in the interval are not necessarily present, but the rest of the configuration is handled by the dp). Wait, no. Because the other towns in the interval may or may not be present, but the only requirement is that the centers are present. \n\nWait, no. The subset of towers must include exactly the centers of the intervals. So for the interval of length k (odd) ending at position i, the center is j. So in the subset of towers, j must be present. However, the other towns in the interval (those not being centers) can be either present or not, as long as they are not centers of other intervals. But wait, no. Because the entire set of towns is partitioned into intervals. So any town that is not a center of an interval must not be present in the tower set. Because if they were present, they would have to be the center of some interval, but since they are not in the centers, that's not allowed. \n\nWait, no. Because the towers are built in towns 1..n with probability 1/2. But the problem says that after building the towers, we need to assign signal powers. So the subset of towers that are built must be exactly the centers of the intervals. Because otherwise, if there's a tower that is not a center of any interval, then that tower would have to be part of some coverage, but since the coverage is partitioned into intervals, that tower would be part of an interval. But if it's not the center, then it's impossible. \n\nTherefore, the subset of towers must be exactly the centers of the intervals. So for the entire configuration to be valid, the towers must be exactly the centers of the intervals. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S of {1..n} such that S can be partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, where each interval's center is in S. \n\nBut how do we count such subsets? Let's think recursively. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid subsets for the first i towns. \n\nFor the first i towns, the last interval could be of length 1, 3, 5, ..., up to i (if i is odd). For each possible length k (odd), the center is at position i - (k-1)/2. Let's call this position j. Then, the number of ways for this case is dp[j-1]. Because the first j-1 towns must form a valid configuration, and then we add this interval. \n\nBut since the subset S must contain exactly the centers of the intervals, the choice of the subset is determined by the intervals. So each such partition corresponds to exactly one subset S (the centers). Therefore, dp[i] is the sum over all possible valid k (odd) of dp[j-1], where j is the center of the interval of length k ending at i. \n\nSo for example, dp[0] = 1. For dp[1], the only possible interval is length 1, so j=1. dp[1] = dp[0] = 1. For dp[2], possible intervals are of length 1 (ending at 2, j=2) and length 3 (but that would require i=2, which is not possible as length 3 would end at 2, requiring starting at 2- (3-1)/2 = 2-1=1. So the interval is 1-2, which is length 2, but that's even. Wait, no. Wait, the length of the interval must be odd. So for k to be odd, the length is k. For example, if the last interval is length 1 (k=1), then the center is at i. For k=3, the interval must end at i. So the starting position is i - (k-1)/2 = i - 1. So the interval is i-1 to i, which is length 2, which is even. That's impossible. So that's invalid. \n\nAh, so for the interval of length k (odd), the starting position is j - (k-1)/2, and the ending position is j + (k-1)/2. So the total length is (j + (k-1)/2) - (j - (k-1)/2) + 1 = k-1 +1 = k. So for the interval to end at position i, we have j + (k-1)/2 = i. Solving for j, j = i - (k-1)/2. And the starting position is j - (k-1)/2 = i - (k-1)/2 - (k-1)/2 = i - (k-1). \n\nSo the interval starts at i - (k-1) and ends at i. The length is k. Which must be odd. \n\nSo for example, if k=1, then the interval starts and ends at i. So j = i - 0 = i. The interval is [i, i], length 1. \n\nIf k=3, then the interval starts at i - 2, ends at i. Length is 3. So the starting position is i-2. The center is j = i-1. \n\nSo for the interval to end at position i, the possible values of k are odd numbers such that the starting position is ≥1. \n\nSo for dp[i], the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k is odd, 1 ≤ k ≤ i, and i - k + 1 ≥ 1} dp[i -k] \n\nWait, because the starting position is i - (k-1) = i -k + 1. For that to be ≥1, we need i -k +1 ≥ 1 → i -k ≥ 0 → k ≤ i. So for each odd k such that k ≤ i, we can take the value dp[i -k]. \n\nWait, let's think again. The interval starts at i -k +1 and ends at i. So the previous part is up to (i -k) (since the interval starts at i -k +1). So the recurrence is dp[i] = sum_{k is odd} dp[i -k], where k ranges over all odd numbers such that i -k ≥ 0. \n\nWait, but how does that relate to the previous j-1? Because the previous part is up to j-1, where j is the center. Wait, maybe my previous analysis was wrong. \n\nLet me re-express this. For a given i, and choosing an interval of length k (odd) ending at i. The center of this interval is j = i - (k-1)/2. The previous part of the configuration is up to j-1. So dp[i] should be sum over all possible k (odd) of dp[j-1], where j is the center. \n\nBut j = i - (k-1)/2. Let's express k in terms of j and i. Since k is the length of the interval, and j is the center, then k = 2*(i - j) + 1. Because the distance from j to i is (i-j), which is (k-1)/2. So k-1 = 2*(i-j) → k = 2*(i-j)+1. \n\nBut k must be odd. So for each possible j, where j can be from 1 to i (as long as the interval starts at 1 or higher). \n\nBut how to express this in terms of dp[i]? Let's think of j as varying. For each possible j, the interval is from j - (i-j) to i. Which is j - (i-j) = 2j -i. This must be ≥1. \n\nSo 2j - i ≥ 1 → 2j ≥ i +1 → j ≥ (i+1)/2. \n\nSo for each j ≥ ceil( (i+1)/2 ), and such that the interval starts at 2j -i ≥ 1. \n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's return to the earlier idea. For each i, dp[i] = sum_{k odd} dp[i -k]. But wait, for example, when k=1, then i -k = i-1. So dp[i] += dp[i-1]. When k=3, then i -k = i-3. So dp[i] += dp[i-3]. And so on. \n\nBut what's the base case? For i=0, dp[0] = 1. For i=1, the sum is for k=1 (i-k=0). So dp[1] = dp[0] = 1. For i=2, the possible k's are 1 (i-k=1) and 3 (which is larger than i=2, so not allowed). So dp[2] = dp[1] = 1. For i=3, possible k's are 1 and 3. For k=1: dp[2] = 1. For k=3: i-k = 0 → dp[0] = 1. So dp[3] = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nLet me check this against the sample input. For example, when n=2, the valid subsets are those that can be partitioned into intervals. The sample says that the answer is 1/4. The total number of possible subsets is 2^2 =4. The valid ones are those where the subset is {1,2}. Because that can be partitioned into two intervals of length 1 (each). So how many valid subsets are there? According to dp[2] =1. So the answer is 1 / 4, which matches the first sample. \n\nYes! Because dp[2] is 1, which represents the number of valid subsets. So the total number of valid subsets is dp[n], and the probability is dp[n] / 2^n. \n\nSo our problem reduces to computing dp[n], then compute dp[n] * inv(2^n) mod 998244353. \n\nNow, the key is to compute dp[i] efficiently. \n\nThe recurrence is dp[i] = sum_{k is odd, k ≤i} dp[i -k]. \n\nBut since k can be any odd number up to i, we can note that this is equivalent to dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] - dp[i-2 - ... ? Wait, no. Let me think of the sum for i. \n\nFor example, the sum over all odd k's. Let's note that for each i, the sum is equal to dp[i-1] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-5] + ... until the index is ≥0. \n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently? \n\nLet me think of the recurrence for dp[i]. Let's note that for any i, the sum of dp[i -k] for all odd k is equal to the sum of dp[i -1] + dp[i-3] + ... \n\nBut let's think about the relation between dp[i] and dp[i-1]. For example, if we look at the sum for dp[i], and compare it with dp[i-1]. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\ndp[i] = sum_{m} dp[i - (2m + 1)] for m such that 2m + 1 ≤i. \n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, for each i, the sum is over all odd numbers k, which is the same as all numbers of the form 2m + 1. \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the sum for dp[i] is equal to the sum of dp[i-1] (when k=1) plus the sum for dp[i-2] (when k=3, which is 2m+1 where m=1, but i-3 = i-1 -2). Wait, perhaps there's a way to express dp[i] in terms of previous dp values. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] - dp[i-2 - ... ? No. \n\nAlternatively, consider that for each i, the sum over all odd k is equal to dp[i-1] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-5] + ... \n\nSimilarly, for dp[i-1], the sum is dp[i-2] + dp[i-4] + ... \n\nSo if we add dp[i-1] to the sum for dp[i-1], but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, notice that dp[i] = sum_{j} dp[j], where j = i -k, and k is odd. Which is equivalent to j = i - (2m + 1) for m ≥0. So j can be written as i - 2m -1. So j must be less than i, and ≥0. \n\nBut this seems like the same as saying that dp[i] is the sum of dp[j] for all j < i where i-j is odd. \n\nWait, because k is odd, i -j = k → i-j is odd. So for each j < i, if i-j is odd, then dp[j] contributes to dp[i]. \n\nSo dp[i] = sum_{j=0}^{i-1} [if (i-j) is odd then dp[j] else 0]. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nLet's think about the parity. Let's split the sum into even and odd indices. \n\nFor example, let's consider that for each i, dp[i] is equal to the sum of dp[j] for all j < i where j has opposite parity to i. Because i-j is odd iff i and j have different parities. \n\nYes! Because if i is even and j is odd, then i-j is odd. Similarly if i is odd and j is even. \n\nSo dp[i] = sum_{j < i, j has parity different from i} dp[j]. \n\nThat's a crucial observation. Now, this simplifies the recurrence. \n\nLet me think. For example, for i even, dp[i] = sum of dp[j] where j is odd and <i. For i odd, dp[i] = sum of dp[j] where j is even and <i. \n\nSo we can track the sum of dp's for even and odd indices. \n\nLet me define:\n\neven_sum[i] = sum of dp[j] for j up to i where j is even.\n\nodd_sum[i] = sum of dp[j] for j up to i where j is odd.\n\nBut maybe even better, let's track the cumulative sums for even and odd. \n\nLet me think. For each i, if i is even, then dp[i] = sum of all dp[j] where j is odd and <i. Which is the same as the sum of all odd dp's up to i-1. Similarly, if i is odd, then dp[i] = sum of all even dp's up to i-1. \n\nSo let's define:\n\nprev_even = sum of dp[j] for even j < current i.\n\nprev_odd = sum of dp[j] for odd j < current i.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\nif i is even:\n\ndp[i] = prev_odd\n\nelse:\n\ndp[i] = prev_even\n\nThen, after computing dp[i], we can update prev_even and prev_odd accordingly. \n\nLet me test this with previous examples. \n\nBase case: dp[0] = 1. \n\nFor i=0, which is even. But when i=0, it's the base case. \n\nNow, for i=1 (odd):\n\ndp[1] = sum of even dp's up to 0. Which is dp[0] =1. So dp[1] =1. \n\nThen, for i=2 (even):\n\nsum of odd dp's up to 1. Which is dp[1] =1. So dp[2] =1. \n\nFor i=3 (odd):\n\nsum of even dp's up to 2. Which is dp[0] + dp[2] =1 +1=2. So dp[3] =2. \n\nWhich matches our previous calculation. \n\nFor i=4 (even):\n\nsum of odd dp's up to 3. Which is dp[1] + dp[3] =1 +2=3. So dp[4] =3. \n\nLet's see what dp[4] would be according to the original recurrence. \n\nOriginal recurrence for dp[4] is sum of dp[4 -k] for all odd k ≤4. The possible k are 1,3. \n\nFor k=1: 4-1=3 → dp[3]=2. \n\nFor k=3: 4-3=1 → dp[1]=1. \n\nTotal sum 2+1=3. Which matches. \n\nYes! So this approach works. \n\nSo now, the problem becomes manageable. We can compute dp[i] using these even and odd sums. \n\nWe can track two variables: even_sum and odd_sum. \n\nInitially, dp[0] =1. \n\nFor i=0, which is even, the even_sum is 1, and odd_sum is 0. \n\nThen, for i=1:\n\nit's odd, so dp[1] = even_sum (which is 1). Then, since i is odd, we add dp[1] to odd_sum. \n\nFor i=2:\n\neven, dp[2] = odd_sum (which is 1). Then add dp[2] to even_sum. \n\nFor i=3:\n\nodd, dp[3] = even_sum (which is 1 + 1 = 2). Then add to odd_sum. \n\nAnd so on. \n\nThus, the recurrence can be computed with O(1) per step, leading to O(n) time. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize dp[0] =1. \n\n- even_sum =1 (since dp[0] is even index 0), odd_sum=0. \n\n- For i from 1 to n:\n\n   if i is even:\n\n      dp[i] = odd_sum\n\n   else:\n\n      dp[i] = even_sum\n\n   then, if i is even:\n\n      even_sum += dp[i]\n\n   else:\n\n      odd_sum += dp[i]\n\nBut wait, the even_sum and odd_sum are cumulative sums of dp[j] for even and odd j, respectively. \n\nYes. \n\nOnce we compute dp[n], the number of valid subsets is dp[n], and the total number of possible subsets is 2^n. \n\nSo the probability is dp[n]/(2^n). \n\nNow, the problem is to compute this fraction modulo 998244353. \n\nBut since the modulus is a prime (998244353 is a known prime), we can compute the modular inverse of 2^n mod MOD. \n\nSo steps for code:\n\n1. Precompute dp up to n.\n\n2. Compute pow(2, n, MOD), then compute its modular inverse.\n\n3. Multiply dp[n] by the inverse mod MOD.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is manageable. \n\nNow, let's test with the sample inputs. \n\nSample Input 1: n=2. \n\ndp[0] =1, even_sum=1, odd_sum=0.\n\ni=1 (odd): dp[1] = even_sum (1). Then, odd_sum becomes 0 +1=1. \n\ni=2 (even): dp[2] = odd_sum (1). even_sum becomes 1 +1=2. \n\ndp[2] is 1. 2^2=4. 1/4 mod MOD is 748683265, which matches the first sample. \n\nSample Input 2: n=3. \n\ndp[3] is 2. 2^3=8. 2/8 = 1/4 → same as sample 2. \n\nSample Input 3: n=5. \n\nLet's compute dp[5]. \n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\ndp[0] =1. even_sum=1, odd_sum=0.\n\ni=1 (odd): dp[1] = even_sum=1. odd_sum becomes 1. \n\ni=2 (even): dp[2] = odd_sum=1. even_sum becomes 1+1=2. \n\ni=3 (odd): dp[3] = even_sum=2. odd_sum becomes 1 +2=3. \n\ni=4 (even): dp[4] = odd_sum=3. even_sum becomes 2 +3=5. \n\ni=5 (odd): dp[5] = even_sum=5. odd_sum becomes 3+5=8. \n\nSo dp[5] =5. 2^5=32. 5/32 is the answer, which matches the third sample's note (the real answer for n=5 is 5/32). \n\nYes! So the code seems correct. \n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n. \n\nCompute dp array up to n. \n\nBut since n can be up to 2e5, we need to compute this efficiently. \n\nIn Python, for n up to 2e5, it's manageable. \n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nInitialize dp as a list of size n+1. \n\nBut since for each i, we only need the previous even_sum and odd_sum, we can avoid storing the entire dp array. Wait, no. Because for each i, we need to compute dp[i], and then add it to even_sum or odd_sum. So we can track even_sum and odd_sum, and compute dp[i] on the fly. \n\nWait, yes. Because for each i, dp[i] depends only on even_sum or odd_sum. So we can track even_sum and odd_sum as variables, and compute dp[i] as follows. \n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize:\n\ndp_0 = 1. \n\neven_sum = 1 (since 0 is even)\n\nodd_sum = 0\n\nThen, for i from 1 to n:\n\nif i is even:\n\n   current_dp = odd_sum\n\nelse:\n\n   current_dp = even_sum\n\nthen, if i is even:\n\n   even_sum += current_dp\n\nelse:\n\n   odd_sum += current_dp\n\nBut wait, for i=1, which is odd, current_dp is even_sum (which is 1). Then, since i is odd, we add current_dp to odd_sum. \n\nYes. \n\nBut how to track the current_dp for each i? Because for the next steps, we need to know the value of dp[i] for the current i. \n\nBut since we need to compute dp[n], we can store the dp values in a list, or just keep track of the current_dp for each step. However, since for the code, we need to compute dp[n], which is the value after processing i=n, we can track it. \n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can track the current_dp for each i. Let me think. \n\nLet me write code in pseudocode:\n\nmod = 998244353\n\nn = input\n\nif n ==0:\n\n    ... but n starts from 1.\n\nInitialize even_sum =1, odd_sum=0\n\nif n ==0: answer is 1/(2^0) =1 ?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, n≥1. \n\nSo for i from 1 to n:\n\n   if i is even:\n\n      dp_i = odd_sum\n\n   else:\n\n      dp_i = even_sum\n\n   if i is even:\n\n      even_sum += dp_i\n\n   else:\n\n      odd_sum += dp_i\n\n   (we can keep track of dp_i, but for the final answer, we need dp[n])\n\nSo after processing i= n, the dp_i is the value of dp[n]. \n\nYes. \n\nSo for example, for n=5, the loop runs from 1 to 5. \n\nLet me simulate:\n\nInitialize even_sum=1, odd_sum=0.\n\ni=1 (odd):\n\ndp_i = even_sum (1). \n\nodd_sum becomes 0 +1 =1. \n\ni=2 (even):\n\ndp_i = odd_sum (1). even_sum becomes 1+1=2. \n\ni=3 (odd):\n\ndp_i = even_sum (2). odd_sum becomes 1+2=3. \n\ni=4 (even):\n\ndp_i = odd_sum (3). even_sum becomes 2+3=5. \n\ni=5 (odd):\n\ndp_i = even_sum (5). odd_sum becomes 3 +5=8. \n\nThus, dp[5] is 5. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code can be written with variables even_sum and odd_sum, and track the current dp_i. \n\nOnce we have dp_n, we need to compute (dp_n) * inv(2^n) mod MOD. \n\nNow, to compute 2^n mod MOD, we can use pow(2, n, MOD). \n\nTo compute the inverse, since MOD is a prime, we can compute pow(2, MOD-2, MOD) raised to the n-th power? Or compute pow(2, n, MOD) and then take its inverse. \n\nWait, inv(2^n) mod MOD is equal to pow(2, n*(MOD-2), MOD) ?\n\nNo. The inverse of 2^n mod MOD is equal to (pow(2, n, MOD))^(MOD-2) mod MOD. \n\nSo in code, we can compute pow_2n = pow(2, n, MOD). Then inv_pow_2n = pow(pow_2n, MOD-2, MOD). \n\nThen the answer is (dp_n * inv_pow_2n) % MOD. \n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is manageable. \n\nNow, let's code this. \n\nEdge cases: when n=1. \n\nFor n=1:\n\ni runs from 1 to 1. \n\ni=1 is odd. dp_i = even_sum (1). \n\nThen, odd_sum becomes 0 +1 =1. \n\ndp_n is 1. \n\nprobability is 1/(2^1) = 1/2. \n\nWhich would be 499122177 mod MOD. \n\nAnother test case. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, coding in Python:\n\nRead n from input. \n\nHandle n=0? Well, according to problem statement, n≥1. \n\nInitialize even_sum and odd_sum. \n\nThen loop from 1 to n:\n\nfor each i in 1..n:\n\n   if i is even:\n\n      current_dp = odd_sum\n\n   else:\n\n      current_dp = even_sum\n\n   if i is even:\n\n      even_sum += current_dp\n\n   else:\n\n      odd_sum += current_dp\n\n   (keep track of current_dp, but for the final answer, we need the current_dp when i =n)\n\nBut wait, for each i, after computing current_dp, we need to track it. However, for the final answer, we need the current_dp for i=n. \n\nSo during the loop, we can keep a variable that holds the current_dp for each i, and after the loop, the last current_dp is dp[n]. \n\nSo code:\n\nmod = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n ==0:\n    print(1)\nelse:\n    even_sum = 1  # dp[0]\n    odd_sum",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building radio towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, while each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: The problem can be reduced to counting valid configurations of towers using dynamic programming. We define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The key observation is that each valid configuration can be partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, where each interval's center must have a tower. This leads to a recurrence relation where `dp[i]` depends on previous values of `dp` for even and odd indices.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By maintaining cumulative sums for even and odd indices, we can efficiently compute `dp[i]` in linear time.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle division by powers of 2.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    even_sum = 1  # dp[0] is 1, which is even index (0)\n    odd_sum = 0\n    dp_n = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            current_dp = odd_sum\n        else:\n            current_dp = even_sum\n        \n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            even_sum += current_dp\n        else:\n            odd_sum += current_dp\n        \n        if i == n:\n            dp_n = current_dp\n    \n    # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n    pow_2n = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    # Compute inverse of pow_2n\n    inv_pow_2n = pow(pow_2n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    result = (dp_n * inv_pow_2n) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: We start with `even_sum` initialized to 1 because `dp[0]` (which is 1) corresponds to an even index.\n2. **Loop Through Towns**: For each town from 1 to n, we determine the current value of `dp[i]` based on whether `i` is even or odd using cumulative sums of previous values.\n3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: After computing `dp[n]`, we calculate the modular inverse of `2^n` using Fermat's Little Theorem, which allows us to handle division under modulo arithmetic efficiently.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is obtained by multiplying `dp[n]` with the modular inverse of `2^n` modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, adhering to the constraints and providing the correct result within acceptable time limits.",
