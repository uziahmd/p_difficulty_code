The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. The sequences can be up to 1000 characters each. But n can be as big as 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible because it would take O(n) time, which is not feasible for n up to 2e9. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nThe key here is to find patterns or cycles that repeat so that we can calculate the number of losses in bulk.\n\nLet me think about how the moves are determined. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo for each round, we can compute the moves of both players. Then determine who wins, if anyone.\n\nBut since n is up to 2e9, we can't check each round individually. So we need to find the number of rounds where each player loses, but in a way that uses the periodicity of the sequences.\n\nLet me think about the total number of possible unique pairs of moves. Since each sequence repeats every m and k steps, respectively, the combined pattern will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because LCM(m, k) is the least common multiple of m and k. So after LCM(m, k) rounds, the pattern of moves for both players repeats.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n- Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length. Then, in each period of period_length rounds, we can compute how many times each player loses. Then, multiply that by the number of full periods in n rounds, and then add the result from the remaining rounds (n % period_length).\n\nBut what's the maximum possible period_length? Since m and k are up to 1000, their LCM can be up to 1000*1000 = 1e6. Which is manageable. Because even for 1e6 rounds, checking each round once is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to period_length-1, compute the moves of A and B for that round, determine who wins, and count the number of losses for each player in this period.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods is total_periods = n // period_length.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are remainder = n % period_length.\n\n5. Multiply the counts from one period by total_periods, and then add the counts from the first 'remainder' rounds of the next period.\n\nThis approach would be O(period_length) time, which is acceptable since period_length is up to 1e6.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need to compute GCD first. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, it's okay. So for m and k, which are positive, compute GCD, then LCM.\n\nNow, for each round in the period, I need to compute the moves of A and B. For example, for round i (0-based?), the move for A is A[i % m], and for B is B[i % k].\n\nOnce I have the moves for each round, I can determine who wins. For each pair (a, b), determine if a beats b, or vice versa, or draw.\n\nSo, for each such pair, I can compute whether Nikephoros (A's player) loses, or Polycarpus (B's player) loses, or neither.\n\nSo, for each round in the period, I can accumulate the number of losses for each player.\n\nOnce I have the counts for one period, multiply by total_periods, and then process the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how to handle the remaining rounds? For example, if the remainder is r, then we need to process the first r rounds of the period.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute the total number of periods and the remainder.\n\nThen, for the full periods, multiply the per-period counts by total_periods.\n\nFor the remainder, process each of the first r rounds of the period, adding the counts.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each of the period_length rounds, the number of losses for each player.\n\nBut how to compute the per-round outcome?\n\nLet me create a helper function that takes a and b (the moves of A and B) and returns which player loses, if any.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a is 'R' and b is 'S', then A wins, so B loses. So Nikephoros (A's player) is not losing, so Polycarpus (B) gets a loss. So for the counts, Nikephoros's loss count increases by 0, and Polycarpus's by 1.\n\nWait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So in each round, if there's a winner, the loser is the one who gets a spot. So for each round, we have to check if A wins, B wins, or draw.\n\nSo:\n\nIf A's move beats B's move: then B loses, so Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nIf B's move beats A's move: then A loses, so Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nElse, no change.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we can determine the outcome.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nWe can have a helper function that returns (a_wins, b_wins) as booleans. But perhaps more straightforwardly, for a given a and b, check the outcome.\n\nFor example:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a is R and b is S) or (a is S and b is P) or (a is P and b is R): then A wins, B loses.\n\nelse: B wins, A loses.\n\nSo, for each pair, we can check these conditions.\n\nSo, for each round in the period, we can compute the outcome.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute the per_period_nik (number of times Nikephoros loses in one period) and per_period_poly (same for Polycarpus).\n\nThen, total_periods = n // period_length\n\nremainder_rounds = n % period_length\n\ntotal_nik = total_periods * per_period_nik\n\ntotal_poly = total_periods * per_period_poly\n\nThen, for the first remainder_rounds rounds in the period, compute how many times each loses and add to total_nik and total_poly.\n\nBut how to compute per_period_nik and per_period_poly?\n\nWe can loop over i from 0 to period_length - 1:\n\nfor each i, compute a_move = A[i % m], b_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen check the outcome, and increment per_period_nik and per_period_poly accordingly.\n\nBut for period_length up to 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nNow, the problem is that for n up to 2e9, and period_length up to 1e6, the total computation is O(1e6) which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplementing the helper function to check who wins.\n\nLet me think about the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)  # no loss for either\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, b loses. So Nikephoros (A) is not losing, so Polycarpus (B) gains a loss.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, a loses. Nikephoros (A) gains a loss.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nSo for each a and b, returns (nik_loss, poly_loss) for that round.\n\nSo, during the per-period calculation, we can accumulate the sum for each of the period_length rounds.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string, B string.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute GCD of m and k.\n\nThen LCM is m * k // GCD.\n\nBut need to compute GCD. In Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. However, note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nBut for Python versions, since in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists. So assuming that's okay.\n\nSo:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nperiod_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nThen, compute per_period_nik and per_period_poly.\n\nInitialize per_period_nik = 0, per_period_poly = 0.\n\nfor i in range(period_length):\n\n    a_idx = i % m\n\n    b_idx = i % k\n\n    a = A[a_idx]\n\n    b = B[b_idx]\n\n    nik_loss, poly_loss = get_outcome(a, b)\n\n    per_period_nik += nik_loss\n\n    per_period_poly += poly_loss\n\nThen, total_periods = n // period_length\n\nremainder = n % period_length\n\ntotal_nik = total_periods * per_period_nik\n\ntotal_poly = total_periods * per_period_poly\n\nThen, process the remainder rounds:\n\nfor i in range(remainder):\n\n    a_idx = i % m\n\n    b_idx = i % k\n\n    a = A[a_idx]\n\n    b = B[b_idx]\n\n    nik_loss, poly_loss = get_outcome(a, b)\n\n    total_nik += nik_loss\n\n    total_poly += poly_loss\n\nThen, output total_nik and total_poly.\n\nWait, but what if the remainder is zero? Then, the remainder loop is skipped, which is correct.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo period_length is 12.\n\nThen for each of 12 rounds, compute the outcome.\n\nBut the sample has 7 rounds. So total_periods = 7 // 12 = 0, remainder =7.\n\nSo we process the first 7 rounds of the period.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → B (S) loses? Wait, the sample says in the first sample, the rounds are:\n\nLet me check the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nn is 7.\n\nA is RPS (so sequence is R, P, S, R, P, S, R, ... )\n\nB is RSPP (sequence R, S, P, P, R, S, P, P, ... )\n\nSo for each round from 0 to 6 (since 7 rounds):\n\nRound 0: i=0 → A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. No loss.\n\nRound 1: i=1 → A[1%3]=P, B[1%4]=S → P vs S. S is beaten by P? Wait, the rules: scissors beat paper. So if B is S (scissors) and A is P (paper), then B wins. So A loses. So Nikephoros (A) gets a loss. So in the sample explanation, the first round is round 0? Or maybe the rounds are 1-based?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nIn the first sample the game went like this:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses.\n\nWait, but according to the input, the first round (i=0?) would be R vs R. Then i=1 would be P vs S.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the first round is R-R (draw), then the second round is P vs S. So the rounds are 0-based or 1-based?\n\nIn the code, when i ranges from 0 to n-1, for the rounds. So for the first sample, n is 7. So rounds 0 to 6.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the rounds are numbered 1 to 7. So the code is using 0-based index.\n\nBut the sample's explanation shows that for 7 rounds, the first round is R-R (draw), then P vs S (second round), etc.\n\nSo in the code, for the first sample, the remainder is 7 rounds. So the code loops for i in 0..6 (7 rounds).\n\nSo in that case, the code would compute for each of the first 7 rounds in the period.\n\nNow, let's check the code's calculation for the first sample.\n\nBut the code's per_period_nik and per_period_poly would be calculated for 12 rounds. However, since n is 7, which is less than 12, the total_periods is 0, and remainder is 7.\n\nSo the code would process 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, Nikephoros has 3 losses and Polycarpus has 2.\n\nSo let's simulate those 7 rounds.\n\nRound 0:\n\nA: R (i=0 mod 3 is 0)\n\nB: R (i=0 mod 4 is 0)\n\nDraw. No loss.\n\nRound 1:\n\ni=1: A is 1 mod 3 → P. B is 1 mod 4 → S. P vs S. S beats P? Wait:\n\nRules: scissors (S) beats paper (P). So B's move is S, which beats A's P. So A loses. So Nikephoros (A) gets a loss. So nik +=1.\n\nIn the sample explanation, this is the second round (the first round was draw, second round P vs S, Nikephoros loses. So yes, that's the first loss for Nikephoros.\n\nRound 2: i=2. A is 2 mod 3 → S. B is 2 mod 4 → P. S vs P. S beats P. So B's move is P. So A's move S beats B's P. So B loses. So Polycarpus (B) gets a loss. So poly +=1.\n\nSample explanation says third round (i=2) is S vs P. Polycarpus loses. So that's correct.\n\nRound 3: i=3. A is 3 mod 3 → 0 → R. B is 3 mod 4 → 3 → P. R vs P. P beats R. So B wins. A loses. So Nikephoros gets another loss. So nik +=1. (Total nik now 2.)\n\nSample explanation's fourth round: R vs P. Nikephoros loses. Correct.\n\nRound 4: i=4. A: 4 mod 3 is 1 → P. B: 4 mod 4 is 0 → R. P vs R. R beats P. So B wins. A loses. Nik +=1 (total 3). Sample's fifth round: P vs R. Nikephoros loses. Correct.\n\nRound 5: i=5. A: 5 mod 3 is 2 → S. B: 5 mod 4 is 1 → S. S vs S: draw. No loss. Sample's sixth round: S vs S. Draw.\n\nRound 6: i=6. A: 6 mod 3 → 0 → R. B: 6 mod 4 → 2 → P. R vs P. B wins. A loses. Nik +=1 (total 4? Wait, but according to the sample explanation, the total is 3 for Nikephoros.)\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait sample explanation says:\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R-R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P-S → Nikephoros loses (so +1).\n\nRound 3: S-P → Polycarpus loses (so +1 for poly).\n\nRound 4: R-P → Nikephoros loses (so +1).\n\nRound 5: P-R → Polycarpus loses (so +1 for poly).\n\nRound 6: S-S → draw.\n\nRound 7: R-P → Nikephoros loses (so +1).\n\nSo total for Nikephoros: 3 losses (rounds 2,4,7). For Poly: 2 (rounds 3,5).\n\nBut according to the code's calculation for the first 7 rounds (i=0 to 6):\n\nRound 0: 0 → draw.\n\nRound 1: i=1 → Nikephoros loses (1).\n\nRound 2: i=2 → poly loses (1).\n\nRound 3: i=3 → Nikephoros loses (2).\n\nRound 4: i=4 → Nikephoros loses (3).\n\nRound 5: i=5 → draw.\n\nRound 6: i=6 → Nikephoros loses (4).\n\nSo according to that, the code would calculate 4 for Nikephoros and 1 for Poly. But sample says 3 and 2. So something's wrong here.\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping of rounds. Let me re-examine the sample explanation.\n\nThe sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo the first line is n=7.\n\nA is \"RPS\" (so m=3: R, P, S).\n\nB is \"RSPP\" (k=4: R, S, P, P).\n\nSample explanation:\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses.\n\nRound 3: S - P. Polycarpus loses.\n\nRound 4: R - P. Nikephoros loses.\n\nRound 5: P - R. Polycarpus loses.\n\nRound 6: S - S. Draw.\n\nRound 7: R - P. Nikephoros loses.\n\nSo total 3 losses for Nikephoros (rounds 2,4,7) and 2 for Poly (rounds 3,5).\n\nBut according to the code's processing for i from 0 to 6 (7 rounds), which rounds are these?\n\nLet me reindex:\n\ni=0 → round 1 (the first round).\n\ni=1 → round 2.\n\ni=2 → round 3.\n\ni=3 → round 4.\n\ni=4 → round 5.\n\ni=5 → round 6.\n\ni=6 → round 7.\n\nSo for each i in 0-6, which corresponds to rounds 1-7.\n\nNow let's recompute the outcomes for each i:\n\ni=0:\n\nA: 0 mod 3 → 0 → R.\n\nB: 0 mod 4 → 0 → R. Draw. (no loss)\n\ni=1:\n\nA: 1 mod 3 → P.\n\nB: 1 mod 4 → S. P vs S. S beats P → B wins. So Nikephoros loses. (nik +1)\n\ni=2:\n\nA: 2 mod 3 → S.\n\nB: 2 mod 4 → P. S vs P. S beats P. So A wins, B loses. So Poly gets +1.\n\ni=3:\n\nA: 3 mod 3 → 0 → R.\n\nB: 3 mod 4 → 3 → P. R vs P. P beats R. B wins. Nikephoros loses. (nik +1 → total 2)\n\ni=4:\n\nA: 4 mod 3 → 1 → P.\n\nB: 4 mod 4 → 0 → R. P vs R. R beats P. B wins. Nikephoros loses. (nik +1 → total 3)\n\ni=5:\n\nA: 5 mod 3 → 2 → S.\n\nB: 5 mod 4 → 1 → S. Draw. No loss.\n\ni=6:\n\nA: 6 mod 3 → 0 → R.\n\nB: 6 mod 4 → 2 → P. R vs P. B wins. Nikephoros loses. (nik +1 → total 4)\n\nWait, according to this, the code would compute for the first 7 rounds (i=0 to 6) that Nikephoros has 4 losses and Poly has 1. But the sample says 3 and 2. So there's a discrepancy here. Where is the mistake?\n\nLooking back at the sample explanation:\n\nRound 5: P - R. Polycarpus loses. So in this case, B's move is R, and A's move is P. P vs R: R beats P. So B wins. So A loses. So Nikephoros gets a loss. But according to the sample explanation, in round 5, Polycarpus loses. That's conflicting.\n\nWait the sample explanation says for round 5:\n\n\"P - R. Polycarpus loses.\"\n\nWait, let me recheck the sample explanation:\n\nThe sample explanation says:\n\nIn the first sample the game went like this:\n\nR - R. Draw. \n\nP - S. Nikephoros loses. \n\nS - P. Polycarpus loses. \n\nR - P. Nikephoros loses. \n\nP - R. Polycarpus loses. \n\nS - S. Draw. \n\nR - P. Nikephoros loses. \n\nSo for round 5 (the fifth round), the moves are P (A) vs R (B). According to the rules, R beats P. So B wins. Hence, A (Nikephoros) loses. So the sample explanation says that Polycarpus loses here. That's a contradiction. Wait, why?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nIn the fifth round, P - R. Polycarpus loses. But that's impossible. Because R beats P. So the winner is B (Polycarpus), so the loser is A (Nikephoros). So the sample explanation must have a typo here? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation is that the first element is Nikephoros's move, the second is Polycarpus's. So for example, in the fifth round, the moves are P (Nikephoros) and R (Polycarpus). Then R beats P, so Polycarpus wins. Thus Nikephoros loses. So the sample explanation says \"Polycarpus loses\" here. That's wrong. So there's a mistake in the sample explanation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is written with the opposite meaning. Maybe the first part of the note is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nThe note says:\n\nIn the first sample the game went like this: \n\nR - R. Draw. \n\nP - S. Nikephoros loses. \n\nS - P. Polycarpus loses. \n\nR - P. Nikephoros loses. \n\nP - R. Polycarpus loses. \n\nS - S. Draw. \n\nR - P. Nikephoros loses. \n\nThus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nLet me recheck each of these rounds.\n\nRound 1: R-R. Draw. Correct.\n\nRound 2: P vs S. Nikephoros (P) vs Polycarpus (S). S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. Correct.\n\nRound 3: S vs P. Nikephoros's move is S, Polycarpus's is P. S beats P. So Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses. So Polycarpus gets a loss. Correct.\n\nRound 4: R vs P. Nikephoros's R vs Polycarpus's P. P beats R. So Polycarpus wins. Nikephoros loses. Correct.\n\nRound 5: P vs R. Nikephoros's P vs Polycarpus's R. R beats P. So Polycarpus wins. Nikephoros loses. So the sample explanation says Polycarpus loses here. Which is wrong. It should be Nikephoros loses. So that's a mistake in the sample explanation?\n\nBut according to the sample output, the answer is 3 and 2. So let's see:\n\nIn the sample explanation, for the 7 rounds:\n\nNikephoros loses in rounds 2, 4, 7 → 3 times.\n\nPoly loses in rounds 3, 5 → 2 times.\n\nBut according to the actual outcome of round 5, Nikephoros loses, not Poly. So the sample explanation must have a typo. Perhaps the fifth round's explanation is reversed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser. If Polycarpus wins, then Nikephoros is the loser. If it's a draw, no one.\n\nSo for each round, the loser is the one who gets a red spot. So for the fifth round, if Nikephoros loses, then his count increases by 1. So according to the sample explanation, in round 5, Polycarpus loses, which would mean that Nikephoros wins. But according to the moves, that's not the case.\n\nSo perhaps the sample explanation has a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the move analysis.\n\nLet me recheck round 5. The fifth round's moves are P (A) and R (B). So:\n\nA's move is P (paper), B's move is R (rock). Rock beats paper. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. Hence, Nikephoros's count increases by 1. But the sample explanation says that Polycarpus loses here. Which would imply that B's move lost. So that's a contradiction. How can this be?\n\nWait, maybe the sample explanation's round 5 is actually B's move being P and A's being R? Or perhaps I have the order of the moves wrong.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"In the first sample the game went like this: R - R. Draw. P - S. Nikephoros loses. S - P. Polycarpus loses. R - P. Nikephoros loses. P - R. Polycarpus loses. S - S. Draw. R - P. Nikephoros loses.\"\n\nLet's look at the fifth round: P - R. So the first is Nikephoros's move, second is Polycarpus's.\n\nSo P (Nikephoros) vs R (Polycarpus). R beats P. So Nikephoros loses. Hence, the sample explanation says Polycarpus loses here, which is wrong. But according to the sample output, the total for Nikephoros is 3, and for Poly is 2. Let's count based on the sample explanation.\n\nSample explanation's losses:\n\nNikephoros: rounds 2,4,7 → 3.\n\nPoly: rounds 3,5 → 2.\n\nBut according to the actual outcomes, in round 5, Nikephoros loses. So that would be a fourth loss for Nikephoros. So the sample explanation must have an error. However, the sample output is given as 3 2. So there's some inconsistency here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the code logic. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nLet me re-examine the sample input and the code's calculation.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nLet me re-calculate all 7 rounds manually.\n\nRound 0 (i=0):\n\nA: R, B: R → draw. No loss.\n\nRound 1 (i=1):\n\nA: P, B: S → S beats P → B wins. So Nikephoros loses → +1.\n\nRound 2 (i=2):\n\nA: S, B: P → S beats P → A wins. B loses → +1 for Poly.\n\nRound 3 (i=3):\n\nA: R, B: P → P beats R → B wins. Nikephoros loses → +1 (total 2).\n\nRound 4 (i=4):\n\nA: P, B: R → R beats P → B wins. Nikephoros loses → +1 (total 3).\n\nRound 5 (i=5):\n\nA: S, B: S → draw. No loss.\n\nRound 6 (i=6):\n\nA: R, B: P → B wins. Nikephoros loses → +1 (total 4).\n\nSo according to this, total for Nikephoros is 4, and Poly is 1. But the sample output is 3 2. This contradicts.\n\nBut the sample output says 3 2. So there's a problem here. Where is the error?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indexes. Let me check the sequences again.\n\nA is RPS → indexes 0: R, 1: P, 2:S.\n\nB is RSPP → indexes 0: R, 1:S, 2:P, 3:P.\n\nFor i=0 to 6 (7 rounds):\n\ni=0 → A[0%3=0] = R, B[0%4=0] = R → draw.\n\ni=1 → A[1%3=1] = P, B[1%4=1] = S → P vs S. S beats P → B wins. Nikephoros loses. So +1.\n\ni=2 → A[2%3=2] = S, B[2%4=2] = P → S vs P. S beats P → A wins. B loses → +1 for Poly.\n\ni=3 → A[3%3=0] = R, B[3%4=3] = P → R vs P. P beats R → B wins. Nikephoros loses → +1 (total 2).\n\ni=4 → A[4%3=1] = P, B[4%4=0] = R → P vs R. R beats P → B wins. Nikephoros loses → +1 (total 3).\n\ni=5 → A[5%3=2] = S, B[5%4=1] = S → draw. No loss.\n\ni=6 → A[6%3=0] = R, B[6%4=2] = P → R vs P. P beats R → B wins. Nikephoros loses → +1 (total 4).\n\nSo according to this, the totals would be 4 and 1. But the sample output is 3 2. This suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem or the code.\n\nBut the sample says that the output is 3 2. So where is the error?\n\nLet me re-examine the sample explanation again. The sample explanation says:\n\nRound 5: P - R. Polycarpus loses.\n\nBut according to the moves, that would be P (A) vs R (B). R beats P → B wins. So A loses. So the sample explanation says that Polycarpus (B) loses, which is wrong. So that must be a mistake in the sample explanation. Or perhaps I have the sequences wrong.\n\nWait the sample input is:\n\nThe first input line is 7.\n\nSecond line is RPS → A is \"RPS\".\n\nThird line is RSPP → B is \"RSPP\".\n\nSo the B sequence is R, S, P, P.\n\nSo for i=4:\n\ni=4 → B's index is 4 mod 4 = 0 → B's move is R. So for i=4, A is P (i=4%3=1), B is R (i=4%4=0). P vs R → R beats P → B wins. So Nikephoros loses → +1.\n\nBut the sample explanation says for round 5 (which is i=4?), that the moves are P-R, and Polycarpus loses. That's incorrect.\n\nBut the sample output is 3 and 2. So how can that be achieved?\n\nLet me think of another possibility. Perhaps the code is using the wrong indices. For example, maybe the rounds are 1-based, and the code is using 0-based. Let me try to re-calculate the rounds with i starting from 1 to 7.\n\nLet me assume that the rounds are 1-based. So for n=7, rounds 1 to 7.\n\nFor round 1:\n\ni=1 → A[ (1-1) % m ] → i-1=0 → same as before.\n\nSo the code is correct in using 0-based indexes for the rounds.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that in the sample explanation, the rounds are not aligned with the code's processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the code's calculation of the per-round outcomes.\n\nLet me re-examine the code's helper function.\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)  # no loss for either\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, b loses. So Nikephoros (A) is not losing, so Polycarpus (B) gains a loss.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, a loses. Nikephoros (A) gains a loss.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for the case where a is P and b is R:\n\na is P, b is R. Are they equal? No.\n\nIs (a == 'R' and b == 'S')? No. (a == 'S' and b == 'P')? No. (a == 'P' and b == 'R')? Yes. So this condition is true. So a wins, b loses. So return (0, 1). Wait wait no! Wait, a is P, b is R. According to the rules, R beats P. So b (R) beats a (P). So the code's condition says that a wins. But this is not correct.\n\nOh! Here's the mistake! The condition is checking if a wins. But in this case, a is P, b is R. The condition (a == 'P' and b == 'R') is true, which means that a wins. But in reality, R beats P. So this is wrong.\n\nOh no! This is the critical mistake. The helper function is incorrect.\n\nThe condition for a winning is:\n\nif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R').\n\nBut that's not correct. Because:\n\nRock beats scissors: R beats S → a wins.\n\nScissors beat paper: S beats P → a wins.\n\nPaper beats rock: P beats R → a wins.\n\nYes. So the condition is correct. But in the case where a is P and b is R, then a wins. But according to the rules, P beats R. So yes, a wins. So in this case, a wins, and b loses.\n\nBut in our previous example, for i=4, A's move is P, B's move is R. So a is P, b is R. So a wins, so B loses. So Nikephoros (A) does not lose. So the code would return (0, 1). But earlier analysis said that B wins. But that's wrong.\n\nWait, this is the core mistake. Earlier analysis was wrong. Let me re-examine.\n\nWhen a is P and b is R: paper beats rock. So a wins. So B loses. So Nikephoros (A) doesn't lose. So the code returns (0, 1). So for the round where A is P and B is R, the code would add 0 to Nikephoros's count and 1 to Poly's count.\n\nThis changes everything. So earlier analysis was wrong because I thought that R beats P, but in fact P beats R. So the code is correct, but my manual calculation was wrong.\n\nLet me redo the manual calculation for the sample input.\n\nLet's go back to the rounds.\n\nRound 0: R vs R → draw. No loss.\n\nRound 1: P vs S → P beats S? No. S beats P. So the code's condition is (a == 'P' and b == 'S') → no. Wait, the code checks:\n\nif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') → no.\n\nelif (a == 'S' and b == 'P') → no.\n\nelif (a == 'P' and b == 'R') → no. So the else clause is triggered. So the code returns (1, 0), meaning that B wins, A loses. Which is correct. Because S beats P. So in this case, the code returns (1, 0). So Nikephoros loses, so +1 to his count.\n\nSo",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds. The challenge is to efficiently compute the result given the potentially large number of rounds, up to 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Strategy**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros uses sequence A and Polycarpus uses sequence B. The moves repeat cyclically.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute the results for one full cycle and then extrapolate for the entire number of rounds.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By determining the number of losses in one cycle, we can multiply this by the number of complete cycles in the total rounds and then handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period_length = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_period_nik = 0\n    per_period_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(period_length):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a = A[a_idx]\n        b = B[b_idx]\n        nik_loss, poly_loss = get_outcome(a, b)\n        per_period_nik += nik_loss\n        per_period_poly += poly_loss\n    \n    total_periods = n // period_length\n    remainder = n % period_length\n    \n    total_nik = total_periods * per_period_nik\n    total_poly = total_periods * per_period_poly\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a = A[a_idx]\n        b = B[b_idx]\n        nik_loss, poly_loss = get_outcome(a, b)\n        total_nik += nik_loss\n        total_poly += poly_loss\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the two move sequences A and B.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of sequences A and B is calculated to determine the period after which the move sequences repeat.\n3. **Outcome Calculation for One Period**: For each round within one period (determined by the LCM), the outcome is calculated and accumulated.\n4. **Scaling Up**: The results from one period are multiplied by the number of complete periods in the total rounds.\n5. **Handling Remaining Rounds**: Any remaining rounds after the complete periods are processed individually to accumulate the final counts.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging periodicity, ensuring that the solution runs in a time complexity proportional to the LCM of the sequence lengths, which is feasible even for large inputs.",
