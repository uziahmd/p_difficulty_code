The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about simulating a game of rock-paper-scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each of n rounds, we need to determine who wins each round and count the number of times each gets pinched (i.e., loses a round). The challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round step by step.\n\nFirst, let's think about the approach. Since directly simulating each round for n up to 2e9 is impossible due to time constraints, we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can calculate the total number of wins in bulk.\n\nThe sequences A and B are cyclic. So, for each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nThe key idea here is to find out how many times each possible pair of moves (a, b) occurs over the n rounds, then calculate the number of wins for each player based on these pairs.\n\nBut how do we compute the counts of each (a, b) pair efficiently?\n\nLet me think: the combined cycle length of both sequences is the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = l. So, every l rounds, the combination of moves from both players repeats. Therefore, the pattern of wins over l rounds will repeat.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it l. Then, the total number of full cycles is q = n // l, and the remaining rounds are r = n % l.\n\n2. For each full cycle, compute the number of times Nikephoros wins (countA) and Polycarpus wins (countB). Multiply these by q to get the total for all full cycles.\n\n3. Then, simulate the remaining r rounds to compute any additional wins.\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of red spots for each player.\n\nBut how to compute countA and countB for one full cycle (l rounds)?\n\nWell, for each of the l rounds, we can compute the moves of A and B. Then, check who wins each round and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut since l could be up to m*k, and m and k are up to 1000 each, then l can be up to 1e6. For n up to 2e9, this would be manageable because even if we have to process 1e6 rounds once, that's acceptable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k.\n\n- For each round in 0 to l-1:\n\n   - Find the move of A: A[i % m]\n\n   - Find the move of B: B[i % k]\n\n   - Determine who wins this round (if any), and add to countA and countB accordingly.\n\n- Then, total_full_cycles = n // l\n\n   totalA = countA * total_full_cycles\n\n   totalB = countB * total_full_cycles\n\n- Then, process the remaining r = n % l rounds similarly, adding to totalA and totalB.\n\nSo, the main problem is to compute the LCM of m and k. How to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So, first compute the GCD.\n\nNow, how to compute the GCD of two numbers. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which they are here, it's fine.\n\nBut wait, for m and k, which are lengths of the sequences, they are positive integers. So, compute GCD(m, k), then LCM is (m * k) // GCD(m, k).\n\nOnce we have that, proceed.\n\nNow, for each of the l rounds in the cycle, we can compute the moves for A and B, check the outcome, and accumulate counts.\n\nNow, the next part is determining who wins a given pair of moves. Let's create a helper function for that.\n\nFor example, if a is 'R' and b is 'S', then A wins. If a is 'S' and b is 'R', then B wins. So, for each pair (a, b), we can determine the result.\n\nWe can represent the outcome as follows:\n\nIf a == b: no one wins.\n\nElse:\n\n- if (a beats b) then Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus gets a spot)\n\n- else, Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros gets a spot)\n\nSo, for each pair (a, b), we can check:\n\nif a is 'R' and b is 'S' → A wins.\n\nif a is 'S' and b is 'P' → A wins.\n\nif a is 'P' and b is 'R' → A wins.\n\nElse, if it's not a draw, then B wins.\n\nSo, perhaps a helper function:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # A wins, so B gets a spot\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # B wins, A gets a spot\n\nWait, but the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So, for each round, if A wins, then B gets a spot. If B wins, then A gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each round, depending on the winner, increment the respective count.\n\nSo, in the helper function, returning 1 means A wins, so B's count increases. Returning -1 means B wins, so A's count increases. 0 means nothing.\n\nSo, during the processing of each round in the cycle, for each (a, b), we check the result and add to the counts.\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, multiply by the number of full cycles, then process the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead string A and string B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute l = LCM.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to l-1:\n\n   a_move = A[i % m]\n\n   b_move = B[i % k]\n\n   determine the winner and accumulate countA and countB.\n\nBut wait, for the full cycle, how many times does each pair occur? Well, in the l rounds, each possible pair of positions in A and B cycles through all possibilities, because l is the LCM. So, for example, for m=2 and k=3, LCM is 6. So, the sequences for A would be 0,1,0,1,0,1 and for B 0,1,2,0,1,2. So, each combination of positions in A and B will be covered once per LCM period.\n\nSo, for each of the l rounds, we can compute the moves and check the outcome.\n\nOnce that's done, the total for full cycles is multiplied by q = n // l.\n\nThen, for the remaining r = n % l rounds, we need to process them similarly.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nCompute the counts for one full cycle (countA_cycle, countB_cycle).\n\ntotalA = countA_cycle * q\n\ntotalB = countB_cycle * q\n\nThen, process the first r rounds of the cycle, adding to totalA and totalB.\n\nBut how to process the first r rounds?\n\nWell, for i in 0 to r-1:\n\n   same as before, compute a and b moves, and check the outcome.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\ndef compute_rounds(n, A, B):\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        while b:\n\n            a, b = b, a % b\n\n        return a\n\n    g = gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // g\n\n    # compute countA_cycle and countB_cycle\n\n    countA_cycle = 0\n\n    countB_cycle = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        # determine outcome\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B gets a spot\n\n            countB_cycle += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A gets a spot\n\n            countA_cycle += 1\n\n    # Now, compute how many full cycles and remainder\n\n    q, r = divmod(n, lcm)\n\n    totalA = countA_cycle * q\n\n    totalB = countB_cycle * q\n\n    # process the remaining r rounds\n\n    for i in range(r):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            totalB += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            totalA += 1\n\n    return totalA, totalB\n\nWait, but the problem says that the first sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\" (length 3), B is \"RSPP\" (length 4). LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo, for each of the 12 rounds in the cycle, we compute the counts.\n\nBut the sample has 7 rounds. So, q = 7 // 12 = 0, r =7. So, process the first 7 rounds.\n\nWhich would be the same as the example.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the output is 3 2. Let's check:\n\nIn the example, Nikephoros has 3 losses (so totalA is 3) and Polycarpus has 2 (totalB is 2). Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the first number is the number of red spots on Nikephoros, which is the number of times he lost. Because when he loses, he gets pinched. So, for each round that Nikephoros loses, his count increases. Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo in the code above, when A wins, B gets a spot (so totalB increases). When B wins, A gets a spot (so totalA increases). So the code returns (totalA, totalB) which is (number of times Nikephoros lost, number of times Polycarpus lost). Which matches the required output.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the second sample input?\n\nSample Input:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds in the cycle:\n\nEach round, A's move is R, B's move is R. So all draws. So countA_cycle and countB_cycle are zero. Then, for n=5, which is less than 8, q=0, r=5. All rounds are draws. So totalA and totalB are zero. Output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that case.\n\nNow, the problem is that for large values of n, say 2e9, and LCM(m, k) being up to 1e6, the code would loop over 1e6 steps once, which is acceptable.\n\nBut what about when m and k are 1000 each, then LCM can be up to 1e6. So, for each test case, the code will run O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the code for the helper functions. Also, note that in Python, the input is read as follows:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nThe second line is the sequence A.\n\nThird line is the sequence B.\n\nWait, the input format is:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A as a string.\n\nThe third line contains sequence B as a string.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, the code reads n as 7, A as 'RPS', B as 'RSPP'.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n from input. Then read A and B.\n\nBut in Python, reading from stdin can be done with input(). However, sometimes when the input is provided via a list, but in practice, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    ... process ...\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read correctly. For example, sometimes after reading the first line, there might be leading/trailing whitespaces, but the problem says that the input is given correctly.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut also, note that in the code, the function to compute GCD is needed. However, in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists, but it returns the absolute value. However, since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nBut to avoid importing math, perhaps implement the GCD function.\n\nAlternatively, use math.gcd.\n\nBut for code correctness, let's implement the GCD function.\n\nWait, but for code efficiency, perhaps better to use math.gcd. But in code submission, perhaps it's better to use math.gcd.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut in code, the code can compute the GCD as:\n\ng = math.gcd(m, k)\n\nBut for Python versions, but assuming that it's allowed.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        return math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    g = gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // g\n\n    # compute counts for one cycle\n\n    countA_cycle = 0\n\n    countB_cycle = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B gets a spot\n\n            countB_cycle += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A gets a spot\n\n            countA_cycle += 1\n\n    q, r = divmod(n, lcm)\n\n    totalA = countA_cycle * q\n\n    totalB = countB_cycle * q\n\n    # process remaining r rounds\n\n    for i in range(r):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            totalB += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            totalA += 1\n\n    print(totalA, totalB)\n\nBut wait, in the code, the function 'gcd' is defined inside main, but perhaps using math.gcd is better. Also, the code uses math.gcd, but in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers. However, in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists. So, assuming that the code is allowed to use that.\n\nBut in the code above, the code defines a gcd function that calls math.gcd. However, perhaps we can directly compute it as:\n\ng = math.gcd(m, k)\n\nBut for code brevity, perhaps that's better.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // g\n\n    ... rest of the code ...\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the first sample:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nm = 3, k =4. GCD(3,4) is 1. LCM is 12.\n\nThen, for i from 0 to 11:\n\nLet's compute each round:\n\ni=0:\n\nA[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nB[0%4] = B[0] = R → draw. No change.\n\ni=1:\n\nA[1%3] = A[1] = P\n\nB[1%4] = B[1] = S → P vs S. S beats P? Wait:\n\nThe condition for A winning is (a is R and b is S) or (a is S and b is P) or (a is P and b is R). So here, a is P, b is S. So none of the conditions. So B wins. So A gets a spot. So totalA increases by 1.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\na is P, b is S. According to the rules, scissors (S) beats paper (P). So B's move (S) beats A's move (P). So B wins. Therefore, A gets a spot (totalA increases by 1).\n\nSo in this round, the code adds 1 to totalA.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the first round is R-R (draw), then in the second round (i=1?), the sample says P vs S. Let me check the sample explanation:\n\nThe sample says:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (because S beats P). So Nikephoros (A) loses, so his count increases by 1. So in the code, this is added to totalA.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for the first sample, the code's countA_cycle and countB_cycle for the 12 rounds would be calculated. Let's see:\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, the code for the first sample would process 7 rounds. Since LCM is 12, q=0, r=7. So the code loops through 0 to 6 (7 rounds).\n\nLet me compute each of these rounds:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 6:\n\ni=0:\n\nA[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. No change.\n\ni=1:\n\nA[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S → A's move is P, B's S. B wins. So totalA +=1.\n\ni=2:\n\nA[2%3] = S, B[2%4] = P → S vs P. A's move S beats P. So B gets a spot. So totalB +=1.\n\ni=3:\n\nA[3%3=0] → R, B[3%4=3] → P. R vs P. P beats R. B wins. So totalA +=1.\n\ni=4:\n\nA[4%3=1] → P, B[4%4=0] → R. P vs R. P beats R. A wins. So B gets a spot. totalB +=1.\n\ni=5:\n\nA[5%3=2] → S, B[5%4=1] → S. Draw. No change.\n\ni=6:\n\nA[6%3=0] → R, B[6%4=2] → P. R vs P. B wins. totalA +=1.\n\nSo after 7 rounds:\n\ntotalA is 1 (i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) → totalA = 3?\n\nWait:\n\nLet me recheck each step:\n\nFor i in 0 to 6 (7 rounds):\n\nRound 0: 0 → no change.\n\nRound 1: i=1 → totalA +=1 → totalA is 1.\n\nRound 2: i=2 → totalB +=1 → totalB is 1.\n\nRound 3: i=3 → totalA +=1 → totalA is 2.\n\nRound 4: i=4 → totalB +=1 → totalB is 2.\n\nRound 5: i=5 → no change.\n\nRound 6: i=6 → totalA +=1 → totalA is 3.\n\nSo totalA is 3, totalB is 2 → which matches the sample output. So code returns 3 2.\n\nYes. So the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when n is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling very large n. For example, n=2e9, and m and k are 1000. Then LCM is 1e6. So the code loops 1e6 steps once, which is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for loops can be slow. However, 1e6 steps are acceptable for Python, even with 1e6 iterations.\n\nBut what about when m and k are 1000 each, then LCM can be up to 1e6. So, for each test case, the code would process 1e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\nCase where all rounds are draws. Then output is 0 0.\n\nCase where m=1 and k=1. Then LCM is 1. So for n=1, check the single round.\n\nAnother case: when n is exactly equal to LCM. So q=1, r=0. So the code would process the full cycle once.\n\nAnother case: when one of the sequences is longer than the other.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut need to make sure that the code reads the input correctly. For example, when reading the input, sometimes after reading the first line (n), the next lines may have leading or trailing spaces. But the problem says that the input is given correctly, so using strip() is safe.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // g\n\n    countA_cycle = 0\n\n    countB_cycle = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            countB_cycle += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            countA_cycle += 1\n\n    q, r = divmod(n, lcm)\n\n    totalA = countA_cycle * q\n\n    totalB = countB_cycle * q\n\n    for i in range(r):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            totalB += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            totalA += 1\n\n    print(totalA, totalB)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nWait, but why do we use sys.stdin.readline() for the A and B strings? Because sometimes, the input may have leading or trailing whitespaces, but according to the problem statement, the input strings are correct. However, using strip() is safe.\n\nBut for example, if the input for A is 'RPS\\n' (with a newline), then using readline().strip() would remove any leading/trailing whitespace, including the newline. So, that's correct.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces. However, according to the problem statement, the input strings consist only of R, P, S. So, perhaps the code should read the lines as they are, but the problem says that the input is correct. Therefore, using strip() is safe.\n\nBut perhaps, for example, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem description, the input is given correctly. So, maybe the code should not use strip()? For example, if the input is given as:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen, the second line is 'RPS' and third line is 'RSPP'. So, using readline().strip() would read them correctly.\n\nBut if the input is given with leading or trailing spaces, like:\n\n7\n\n RPS \n\n RSPP \n\nThen, the code would read 'RPS' and 'RSPP' correctly, because strip() removes leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is given correctly, so perhaps the code can read the lines as:\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nB = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, test the code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nOutput: 3 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='R', B='S'. Then, A's move is R, B's S. A wins. So B gets a spot. So output is 0 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='S', B='R'. B wins. So output is 1 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, A='R', B='S'. Then, first round: R vs S → A wins. B gets 1. Second round: A is R again, B is S again. A wins again. So totalB is 2. Output is 0 2.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible due to the potentially enormous number of rounds, so we use an optimized approach based on cycles and least common multiples (LCM).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cycles**: Each player's move sequence is cyclic. The combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every LCM of the lengths of their respective sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two move sequences. This gives the length of the repeating cycle.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each cycle, determine how many times each player wins. This allows us to compute the number of wins for a full cycle of rounds.\n4. **Full and Remaining Rounds**: Calculate the number of full cycles within the total number of rounds and handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // g\n    \n    countA_cycle = 0\n    countB_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            countB_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            countA_cycle += 1\n    \n    q, r = divmod(n, lcm)\n    totalA = countA_cycle * q\n    totalB = countB_cycle * q\n    \n    for i in range(r):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            totalB += 1\n        else:\n            totalA += 1\n    \n    print(totalA, totalB)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially given large input sizes.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences determines the cycle length after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round in the cycle, determine the winner and accumulate the counts of wins for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds. Multiply the cycle win counts by the number of full cycles and add the results from the remaining rounds to get the final counts.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging cycle detection and mathematical properties, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
