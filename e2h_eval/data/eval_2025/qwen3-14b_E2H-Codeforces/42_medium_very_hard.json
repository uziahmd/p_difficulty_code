Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. The two progress bars are calculated differently: one for the current file, and one for the total data copied so far.\n\nLet me break down the problem. \n\nSo, for each byte copied (each x in each file i), we calculate two percentages. Both are floored to integers. The first is (100 * x) // a_i, where a_i is the size of the current file. The second is (100 * (sum of previous files' sizes + x)) // total_sum, where total_sum is the sum of all a's.\n\nOur task is to find all values from 0 to 100 that appear as both percentages at the same time during the copying process.\n\nHmm. How do I model this?\n\nFirst, the approach would be to simulate each byte copied and check for each moment if the two percentages are equal. But since the files can be up to 1000 bytes, and there are up to 100 files, the total number of bytes is up to 100*1000 = 100,000. For each byte, we compute both percentages and track when they match.\n\nBut wait, for each byte, there's a moment after it's copied. So, for example, when the first byte is copied, the progress bars update. So for each byte x in each file i, we have to consider the state after copying that byte.\n\nBut simulating each byte might be feasible here. Let's think about the constraints. For n=100 and each a_i=1000, total bytes is 100,000. For each of these, we compute two percentages. That's manageable in Python, even with loops. Because 1e5 iterations are acceptable for Python's speed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the total_sum of all a_i.\n- Iterate through each file, and for each byte in the file, compute the current percentage (for the current file) and the total percentage (for the total data copied so far).\n- For each such moment, check if both percentages are equal. If yes, add that value to a set of results.\n- Finally, output the sorted list of those values.\n\nBut wait, how do I track the total data copied so far? Let's think:\n\nFor each file i, before processing it, the total data copied is sum_prev = a_1 + ... + a_{i-1}. Then, for each x in 1..a_i (since each byte is copied one by one), the total data copied is sum_prev + x. So for each x in 1..a_i, we can calculate the current progress for the file (x/a_i) and the total progress (sum_prev + x)/total_sum.\n\nBut also, note that the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. So we need to include that. Wait, the problem says that initially both bars show 0%. So 0 is definitely part of the answer unless there's no other moment where they match. But according to the first example, 0 is included.\n\nSo how do we capture the initial state? Well, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. But according to the problem description, the progress bars update after each byte. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. However, the first byte copied will trigger an update. So the initial 0% is a valid moment. Therefore, we need to check if 0 is present in the result. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that after copying each byte, the progress bars are updated. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is not considered as per the problem's formal description. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"In the beginning of the copying both progress bars show 0 percent.\"\n\nSo the initial state is considered. So the question is whether there exists a moment when both are equal. The initial moment is such a moment. So 0 is always present. But in the sample input 1, the output includes 0. So how do I include that?\n\nWait, the problem says that the values are updated after each byte. So the initial 0% is before any bytes are copied. But the first byte's copying leads to the first update. But the initial state is a moment where both are 0. So we need to include that. However, the problem says \"after copying each byte\" the progress bars are updated. So the initial 0% is before any bytes are copied. So the initial moment is considered as a valid moment. So how do I capture that?\n\nIn our simulation, perhaps we need to check the initial state (before any bytes are copied). But according to the formal description:\n\nAfter copying byte x of file i, the first bar shows floor(100x / a_i). But for the initial moment, before any bytes are copied, x is 0. So for that moment, both progress bars are 0. So we need to include that.\n\nBut in our simulation, how do we capture this? Because for each byte, we process the state after that byte is copied. But the initial state (0 bytes copied) is not captured by any of those steps. So we need to add 0 to the possible answers, unless there's some other condition. Wait, but what if the initial state is the only time when both are 0? Then 0 should be included. So how do I handle that?\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a set of valid percentages.\n- Add 0 to the set, because initially both are 0.\n- Then, simulate each byte being copied, and for each, compute the two percentages and check if they are equal. If so, add to the set.\n- At the end, collect all the numbers in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other moments when the percentages are 0. For example, during the copying of the first byte, if the first file is large enough, the first progress bar would be 0 (since 100*1 / a_i is 0 if a_i is larger than 100). But the total progress bar would be 100 * 1 / total_sum. Which could be 0 as well. So in that case, the 0 would be added again. But since we are using a set, duplicates are handled automatically.\n\nBut the initial 0 is already in the set. So the plan is to include 0 in the set, and then check all the other moments.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the initial state is considered. However, in the first example, the output includes 0. So adding 0 to the set is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the simulation steps.\n\nLet me take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n1\n6\n\nSo there's one file of size 6. The total sum is 6.\n\nThe initial state is 0% for both. Then, after each byte is copied (from 1 to 6), the progress bars are:\n\nFor the first bar: (100 * x)/6, floored.\n\nFor the second bar: (100*(x))/6, floored. So they are always equal. Hence, all the percentages during the copying are same for both bars. So the output includes 0, 16 (since 100*1/6 is 16.666... floored to 16), etc., up to 100 (when x=6, 100*6/6=100).\n\nSo the output includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nSo, the initial 0 is included. Now, how do I capture that in code?\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\nInitialize a set with 0.\n\nThen, for each file, for each byte x in 1 to a_i:\n\nCompute current percentage for the current file (current_p = (100 * x) // a_i)\n\nCompute total_p = (100 * (sum_prev + x)) // total_sum\n\nIf current_p == total_p, then add to the set.\n\nBut wait, the sum_prev is the sum of all previous files. So for the first file, sum_prev is 0. For the second file, sum_prev is a_1, etc.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a)\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}\n\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n        current_p = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_sum\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            add to result\n\n    sum_prev += current_file_size\n\nWait, but for each x in the current file, we have to compute the total_bytes_so_far as sum_prev (the sum of all previous files) plus x. Because sum_prev is the sum of the previous files, and x is the current byte in the current file.\n\nYes. So this loop would cover all the moments after each byte is copied. And the initial 0 is added to the set.\n\nBut what about the moment when all bytes are copied? For example, after the last byte is copied, the total_p is 100 * total_sum / total_sum = 100, which is floored to 100. Similarly, current_p is (100 * a_i) / a_i = 100. So that's added. But the code above would capture that, because when x is a_i, which is the last byte of the current file.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the initial 0 is added, and then during the processing of the first file, when x=1, the current_p is 100*1//6=16, and total_p is 100*1//6=16. So that's added. Then for x=2, 200//6=33, etc. So all the percentages are added.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if all files are size 1? Let's say n=2, a=[1,1]. Total sum is 2.\n\nInitial 0 is added.\n\nFor first file:\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_p = 100*1//1 = 100.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(0+1))/2 = 50. So 100 != 50, so nothing added.\n\nThen sum_prev becomes 1.\n\nFor the second file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_p is 100*1//1 = 100.\n\ntotal_p is (100*(1+1))/2 = 100. So 100 is added. So the result set would be {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: when a file is 0? No, the problem says a_i is at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when the total_sum is 1. For example, n=1, a_1=1. Then total_sum is 1. So for each x (only 1), current_p is 100, total_p is 100. So the result is {0, 100}.\n\nBut wait, the initial 0 is added. Then after x=1, both are 100. So the output would be 0, 100.\n\nAnother case: when during the copying of a file, the same percentage is achieved multiple times. But the set handles duplicates.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case where during the copying of a byte, the two percentages are equal, but that value is already in the set. Since we are using a set, it's handled.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n, then the list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set called result with 0.\n\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor each file in a:\n\n    current_file_size = file\n\n    for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n        current_p = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_sum\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            add to result\n\n    sum_prev += current_file_size\n\nOnce all bytes are processed, collect the elements in the result set, sort them, and print them separated by newlines.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 2, the output includes 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. Let me see why.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nTotal sum is 600.\n\nThe initial 0 is added.\n\nNow, during the first file (size 100):\n\nsum_prev is 0. For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x)/100 = x. So for x=1, current_p is 1. total_p is (100*(0+x))/600 = (x)/6. So for x=1, total_p is 0. So 1 != 0. So nothing added. For x=6, total_p is 6/6 = 1. So current_p is 6. So 6 == 1? No. Wait, current_p is (100 * x)/100 = x. For x=6, current_p is 6. total_p is (100 * (0 + 6 )) / 600 = 600/600 = 1. So 6 != 1. So no match here.\n\nWait, but when does the current_p and total_p match?\n\nLet me think for the first file. For each x in 1..100:\n\ncurrent_p = x (since 100x/100 = x).\n\ntotal_p = (100 * x) / 600 = x / 6, floored.\n\nSo when is x == floor(x/6)?\n\nOnly when x is 0, which is not in the loop here. So for x from 1 to 100, current_p is x, and total_p is floor(x/6). So they can only be equal when x = floor(x/6). Which would require x=0, which isn't in the range. So during the first file, no matches except maybe when x is 0 (initial state).\n\nSo during the first file, no new values are added. Then, when the first file is done, sum_prev becomes 100.\n\nThen, the second file is 500 bytes. For x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x)/500 = x/5, floored.\n\ntotal_p is (100*(100 + x )) / 600 = (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nWe need to find when x//5 == (100*(100 + x )) // 600.\n\nLet me take some examples. For example, when x is 500:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * 500)/500 = 100. total_p = (100*(100 + 500 )) / 600 = (60000)/600 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nBut what about other values?\n\nLet me see for x = 595. Wait, but the second file is 500 bytes. So x can be up to 500.\n\nLet me think of when the total_p is 95. Let's compute:\n\ntotal_p = floor( (100*(100 + x )) / 600 )\n\nWe want this to be 95. So:\n\n95 <= (100*(100 +x )) / 600 < 96\n\nMultiply all by 600:\n\n95*600 <= 100*(100 +x ) < 96*600\n\nDivide by 100:\n\n95*6 <= 100 +x < 96*6\n\n570 <= 100 +x < 576\n\nSubtract 100:\n\n470 <= x < 476\n\nSince x is between 1 and 500, this is possible. So x ranges from 470 to 475.\n\nFor these x values, total_p is 95. Now, what is the current_p for these x?\n\ncurrent_p = floor( (100x)/500 ) = floor( x / 5 )\n\nFor x in 470-475:\n\nx/5 is 94, 94.2, 94.4, 94.6, 94.8, 95. So floor is 94 for x=470-474, and 95 for x=475.\n\nSo for x=475, current_p is 95 and total_p is 95. So that's a match. Hence, 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for other values. For example, when x=475, it's added. So the sample output includes 95, 96, etc. \n\nSo the code would capture these cases.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nFirst, read input. The input is given as:\n\nIn the first line, n.\n\nSecond line: n integers a_1 ... a_n.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given in the problem, the input examples are given as lists like ['1\\n6', ...]. But in reality, the input is read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute total_sum = sum(a)\n\nInitialize result = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor each file in a:\n\n    current_file_size = file\n\n    for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n        current_p = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_sum\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            result.add(current_p)\n\n    sum_prev += current_file_size\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list.\n\nThen, print each element in the sorted list, each on a new line.\n\nWait, but the sample outputs for the first input is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100' — which is the numbers sorted. So the code should collect the elements in the set, sort them, and output them with newlines.\n\nBut what about the case when the same value is added multiple times? The set handles that.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nBut what about when the total_sum is zero? No, since a_i >= 1, sum is at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when n=1, a_1=1. Then total_sum is 1.\n\nThe initial 0 is added. Then for x=1:\n\ncurrent_p = 100*1//1 = 100.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(0+1))//1 = 100. So 100 is added. So the result is {0, 100}.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a=[1,1]. The total_sum is 2. Initial 0 added.\n\nFor first file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_p is 100*1//1 = 100. total_p is (100*1)/2 = 50. Not equal. So no addition.\n\nsum_prev becomes 1.\n\nSecond file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_p is 100*1//1 = 100. total_p is (100*(1+1))/2 = 100. So 100 is added. So the result is {0, 100}.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=1, a=[100]. Then total_sum is 100. For each x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x)/100 = x. total_p is (100x)/100 = x. So all x's from 1 to 100 are added. Plus 0. So the result is 0, 1, 2, ..., 100. But wait, but the problem says that the percentages are floored. But in this case, since x is integer, (100x)/a_i is exactly x, so floor is x. So for each x, current_p and total_p are same. So all values from 0 to 100 are present. But according to the code, the initial 0 is added, and then for x=1 to 100, current_p and total_p are same. So all the numbers from 0 to 100 are in the set. So the output is 0,1,...,100.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the output is 0,16,33, etc. Which makes sense because for a single file of 6 bytes, each x gives current_p and total_p same, but they are not all integers. For example, when x=1, 100*1/6 is 16.666..., floored to 16. So the code adds 16. But for the case of a single file of 100 bytes, the code adds all integers from 0 to 100.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the code may have to handle the case where total_sum is zero? No, since a_i >= 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then a list. Then proceed as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor file_size in a:\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n        if current_p == total_p:\n            result.add(current_p)\n    sum_prev += file_size\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the output is:\n\n0\n16\n33\n50\n66\n83\n100\n\nWhich matches the code. Let's check for the first sample input:\n\nn=1, a=[6], total_sum=6.\n\nsum_prev starts at 0.\n\nfile_size is 6. For x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_p = (100x)//6.\n\ntotal_bytes is 0 + x = x. total_p = (100x) // 6. So same as current_p. So for x=1, 100*1//6 = 16, added. x=2: 200//6=33. etc. So the result set will have 0,16,33,50,66,83,100. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's check the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\ntotal_sum = 600.\n\nsum_prev starts at 0.\n\nFirst file is 100. For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_p = (100x)/100 = x.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(0 +x )) // 600 = (100x)//600 = x//6.\n\nSo current_p is x, total_p is x//6. So when is x == x//6? Only when x is 0. So no additions during this loop.\n\nsum_prev becomes 100.\n\nSecond file is 500. For x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_p = (100x) // 500 = x//5.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nSo when is x//5 == (100*(100 +x )) // 600 ?\n\nLet me think for x=475:\n\ncurrent_p = 475//5 = 95.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(100 + 475 )) // 600 = 100*575 // 600 = 57500 // 600 = 95.833... floored to 95. So yes, 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x=476:\n\ncurrent_p = 476//5 = 95.2 → 95.\n\ntotal_p = 100*(100+476) = 100*576 = 57600 → divided by 600 → 96. So 95 vs 96 → no match.\n\nSo x=475 is added.\n\nOther values:\n\nFor example, when x=500:\n\ncurrent_p is 500//5 = 100.\n\ntotal_p is (100*(100 +500 )) // 600 → (60000)/600 = 100. So added.\n\nAlso, when x= 595? No, because the file is 500 bytes. So x can't be more than 500.\n\nSo during the second file, the code adds 95, 100, and others?\n\nLet me think about when total_p is 99.\n\nWe need (100*(100 +x )) // 600 = 99.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n99 ≤ (100*(100 +x )) / 600 < 100 → multiply by 600:\n\n99*600 ≤ 100*(100 +x) < 100*600 → divide by 100:\n\n99*6 ≤ 100 +x < 600 → 594 ≤ 100 +x < 600 → 494 ≤ x < 500.\n\nx ranges from 494 to 499 (since x is integer).\n\ncurrent_p is x//5.\n\nFor x=494: 494//5 = 98.8 → 98. So 98 vs 99? No.\n\nFor x=499: 499//5 is 99.8 → 99. So current_p is 99. total_p is 99. So yes. So for x=499, current_p=99, total_p=99. So added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 495:\n\nx=495 → 495//5 = 99. So total_p is (100*(100 + 495 )) // 600 = 100*595 // 600 = 59500 // 600 = 99.166... → 99. So current_p is 99, total_p is 99. So added.\n\nSo for x from 495 to 499, current_p is 99, and total_p is 99. So 99 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 500, total_p is 100, current_p is 100.\n\nThus, the code would capture 95, 99, 100, etc. So the sample output for the second input includes 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. How?\n\nWell, perhaps there are other values. For example, when x is 594? No, but in the second file, x is up to 500. So let's think about when total_p is 96.\n\nLet me compute for total_p =96.\n\nWe have:\n\n96 ≤ (100*(100 +x )) / 600 < 97 → multiply by 600:\n\n96 * 600 ≤ 100*(100 +x) < 97 * 600 → divide by 100:\n\n96 * 6 ≤ 100 +x < 97 * 6 → 576 ≤ 100 +x < 582 → 476 ≤ x < 482.\n\nSo x ranges from 476 to 481.\n\ncurrent_p is x//5.\n\nFor x=476: 476//5 = 95.2 → 95. total_p is 96. Not equal.\n\nx=480: 480//5 = 96. total_p is (100*(100+480 ))//600 = 58000//600 = 96.666... → 96. So current_p is 96, total_p is 96. So added.\n\nSo for x=480, it's added. So 96 is in the set.\n\nSimilarly, for x=481:\n\ncurrent_p is 481//5 = 96.2 → 96. total_p is (100*(581 )) // 600 = 58100//600 = 96.833... → 96. So yes. So added.\n\nThus, the code would add 96. Similarly for 97, 98, etc.\n\nSo the sample output for the second input is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you do integer division with //, it truncates towards negative infinity. However, since all the numbers here are positive, it's equivalent to floor division. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the third sample input:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998\n\nSample Output: 0 50 99 100.\n\nLet me think why.\n\nTotal_sum is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nThe initial 0 is added.\n\nNow, during the first file (1000 bytes), for x from 1 to 1000:\n\ncurrent_p = (100x)/1000 = x/10. So for x=500, current_p is 50.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(0 +x )) / 2002 → (100x)/2002. Let's see when this equals 50.\n\n(100x)/2002 = 50 → x = (50 * 2002)/100 = 1001. So x=1001, but the first file is 1000 bytes. So during the first file, there's no x that makes total_p equal to 50. However, during the first file, for x=1000, total_p is (100*1000)/2002 = 100000 / 2002 ≈ 49.95... → floored to 49. So current_p is 100*1000//1000 = 100. So no match here.\n\nBut during the first file, the total_p is (x * 100)/2002. For x=1000, that's 100000 / 2002 ≈ 49.95 → 49. So no match with current_p of 100. So during the first file, no matches except maybe 0.\n\nThen, after the first file, sum_prev is 1000. Next is the second file (size 2). For x=1 and 2:\n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_p = 100*1//2 = 50.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(1000 +1 )) // 2002 = 100100 // 2002. Let's compute that:\n\n2002 * 50 = 100100. So 100100 // 2002 is exactly 50. So current_p is 50, total_p is 50. So 50 is added.\n\nSo that's why 50 is in the output.\n\nThen, x=2: current_p is (100*2)//2 = 100. total_p is (100*(1000+2 ))//2002 = 100200//2002. 2002 * 50 = 100100. 100200 - 100100 = 100. So 100200//2002 = 50. So current_p is 100, total_p is 50. Not equal. So no addition.\n\nsum_prev becomes 1000+2=1002.\n\nThird file is 2 bytes. For x=1 and 2:\n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_p is (100*1)//2 = 50.\n\ntotal_p is (100*(1002 +1 ))//2002 = 100300 // 2002. Let's compute 2002 * 50 = 100100. 100300 - 100100 = 200. So 50 + 200/2002 → 50.099... → floored to 50. So current_p is 50, total_p is 50. So 50 is added again (but already in the set). \n\nFor x=2: current_p is 100. total_p is (100*(1002+2 ))//2002 = 100400//2002. 2002*50 = 100100. 100400-100100=300. 300/2002 is 0.149... So total_p is 50. current_p is 100. Not equal.\n\nsum_prev becomes 1002+2=1004.\n\nFourth file is 998 bytes. For each x from 1 to 998:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x) // 998.\n\ntotal_p is (100*(1004 +x )) // 2002.\n\nWe need to find when these are equal.\n\nAt the end of the fourth file, when x=998:\n\ntotal_bytes = 1004 + 998 = 2002. total_p = 100 * 2002 / 2002 = 100. current_p is (100 * 998) // 998 = 100. So added.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps when x is 997:\n\ntotal_bytes = 1004 + 997 = 2001. total_p = (100 * 2001)/2002 = 200100 / 2002 ≈ 99.95... → 99. current_p is (100*997)/998 = 99.7 → 99. So 99 is added.\n\nSo in the output, 99 and 100 are present. Also 0 and 50.\n\nSo the output is 0, 50, 99, 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. Now, write the Python code accordingly.\n\nBut note that in Python, when you do integer",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The two progress bars represent the percentage of the current file copied and the percentage of the total data copied so far, both rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Read the input values for the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Total Size Calculation**: Compute the total size of all files combined to determine the overall progress.\n3. **Progress Tracking**: Simulate the copying process byte by byte for each file. For each byte copied, calculate the current progress percentage for the file being copied and the overall progress percentage.\n4. **Set of Valid Percentages**: Use a set to collect all valid percentages where both progress bars show the same value. This ensures uniqueness and efficient lookup.\n5. **Edge Cases Handling**: Include the initial state (0%) before any bytes are copied as a valid entry.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nresult = {0}\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor file_size in a:\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n        if current_p == total_p:\n            result.add(current_p)\n    sum_prev += file_size\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of files and their respective sizes.\n- **Total Size Calculation**: The total size of all files is computed once to avoid repeated calculations.\n- **Simulating Copying Process**: For each byte copied in each file, the current progress percentage for the file and the overall progress percentage are calculated.\n- **Checking for Matches**: Each time both progress percentages match, the value is added to a set to ensure it is only counted once.\n- **Output**: The valid percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the progress of each byte copied and ensures that all valid percentages are captured, providing the correct solution within the constraints.",
