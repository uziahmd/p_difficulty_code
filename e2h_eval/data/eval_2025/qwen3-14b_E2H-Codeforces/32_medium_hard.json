    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. So when I remove one element, I want to minimize that difference. \n\nFirst, let's think about the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). But when we remove one element, the new max and min could be different. For example, if the original array has elements [1, 3, 3, 7], removing 7 makes the new max 3 and min 1, so instability is 2. If we remove 1, then the new array is [3,3,7], instability is 4. So the best choice here is to remove the 7.\n\nSo the key idea is that for each element in the array, when we remove it, the new instability is the max of the remaining elements minus the min of the remaining elements. We need to find the minimum of all these possibilities.\n\nBut calculating this for every element directly would be O(n^2), which isn't feasible for n up to 1e5. Because for each element, if I have to compute the max and min of the array without that element, that would take O(n) per element, leading to O(n^2) time. Which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let's think about the sorted array. Because when the array is sorted, the max and min are the first and last elements. Wait, no. If the array is sorted, then the original max is the last element and the original min is the first. But when you remove an element, the new max and min depend on which element you remove.\n\nWait, but if the array is sorted, then for each position i, removing the element at position i would leave the new max as the max of the elements except a[i]. Similarly for min. But how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the array is sorted. Let's say the original array is sorted as a_sorted. Then for each element, when we remove it, the new min and max would be:\n\nIf the element removed is not the first or last element, then the new min is still the first element (since the array was sorted), and the new max is the last element. But if we remove the first element, then the new min is the second element, and the max is the last. Similarly, if we remove the last element, the new max is the second last, and the min is the first.\n\nSo, in the sorted array, for each index i:\n\n- If we remove the first element (i=0), the new min is a_sorted[1], and max is a_sorted[-1]. So instability is a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1].\n- If we remove the last element (i = n-1), the new instability is a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0].\n- For any other element (i not 0 or n-1), the instability is a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0], because removing any element in between doesn't affect the min or max.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So if the array is sorted, then the only cases where removing an element affects the instability are when you remove the first or last element. Otherwise, the instability remains the same as the original (max - min). But wait, that's not true. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5], and you remove 3, the instability is 5-1=4, which is same as original. But if you remove 4, the instability is still 5-1=4. So yes, only when you remove the first or last element, the instability changes. So in this case, the minimum instability after removing one element would be the minimum between:\n\noriginal_instability (when removing any element except first or last), or the instability when removing first element, or removing last element.\n\nWait, but what if there are duplicates? Like in the first example, the array is [1,3,3,7]. When sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. If you remove the first element (1), the instability is 7-3=4. If you remove the last element (7), instability is 3-1=2. If you remove any of the middle elements (the 3s), then the instability is 7-1=6. So in this case, the minimal is when you remove the last element. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]) and (a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]).\n\nBut what if the array has multiple elements and removing some element in the middle could lead to a better instability?\n\nWait, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The original instability is 5-1=4. If I remove 5, the instability is 4-1=3. If I remove 1, it's 5-2=3. If I remove 2, the instability is 5-1=4. So the minimal is 3. So in this case, the answer is min( (a_sorted[-2]-a_sorted[0]), (a_sorted[-1]-a_sorted[1]) ), which is 4-1=3 and 5-2=3. So min is 3.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is achieved by removing either the first or the last element.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]) and (a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]).\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause when you remove any element except the first or last, the instability remains the same as the original (max - min). But when you remove the first element, the new instability is (max of the rest) - (min of the rest) = a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]. Similarly, when you remove the last element, it's a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0].\n\nSo the minimal possible instability is the minimum between those two options. Because for all other elements, the instability is the original (which is a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0]). So if the original instability is larger than either of the two options, then the minimal is the minimum between the two options. But if the original instability is smaller than both options, then the answer is the original instability.\n\nWait, but that's not possible. Because the original instability is a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0]. If you remove any element except the first or last, the instability is the same as original. So for example, if the original instability is 5, but removing the first element gives instability 4, and removing the last gives 3, then the minimal is 3. But if the original instability is 3, and removing the first gives 4, and removing last gives 5, then the minimal is 3 (by removing any element in the middle).\n\nSo the overall answer is the minimum between (original instability) and (a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]) and (a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]).\n\nWait, no. Because the original instability is a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0]. When you remove any element except the first or last, the instability is the same as original. So the minimal possible instability is the minimum between the original instability (if you remove an element in the middle), or the two options (removing first or last). So the answer is the minimum between the original instability, (a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]), and (a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]).\n\nWait, but the original instability is (a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0]). So, if you remove any element except the first or last, the instability is the same. So the minimal possible is the minimum between (a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0]) (if you remove an element in the middle), and (a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]) (if you remove first element), and (a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]) (if you remove last element). So the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the original instability is 5. Let's say removing the first element gives 4, and removing the last gives 3. Then the answer is 3. But if the original instability is 5, then the minimum between 5,4,3 is 3. So the answer is correct.\n\nAnother example: if the array is [1, 1, 1, 1]. The original instability is 0. Removing any element would leave instability 0. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3]. Original instability is 2. If you remove 1, the instability is 3-2=1. If you remove 3, the instability is 2-1=1. If you remove 2, the instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is 1. Which is min between (original instability (2), (a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]) = 2-1=1, and (a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1])=3-2=1. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute the original instability (max - min) which is a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0].\n\n- Then, the possible candidates for the minimal instability are:\n\n   a) the instability when removing the first element: a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]\n\n   b) the instability when removing the last element: a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]\n\n   c) the original instability (if you remove any other element)\n\nSo the answer is the minimum between (a), (b), and (original instability).\n\nWait, but the original instability is (a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0]). So the answer is the minimum between (a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0], a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1], a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]).\n\nBut why do we consider the original instability as a candidate? Because if we remove an element in the middle, the instability remains the same as the original. So the minimal possible could be the original instability, if it's less than the other options.\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 3, 5, 7]. Original instability is 6. If you remove the first element, instability is 7-3=4. Remove last element: 5-1=4. But if you remove any other element, like 3, the instability is 7-1=6. So the minimal is 4, which is the minimum between 6,4,4.\n\nSo in this case, the answer is min(6,4,4) = 4.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the original instability.\n\nCompute option1: a[-1] - a[1]\n\noption2: a[-2] - a[0]\n\nthen the answer is min(original_instability, option1, option2).\n\nWait, but why not consider other elements? Like, if the array is [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]. Original instability is 5. If you remove the 4, the instability is 6-1=5. But if you remove 5, the instability is 6-1=5. But if you remove the 2, the instability is 6-1=5. So the original instability is same as when you remove any element except first or last. So the answer is the min between original (5), option1 (a[-1] - a[1] = 6-2=4?), and option2 (a[-2] - a[0] = 5-1=4). So the answer is 4.\n\nYes. So in this case, the answer is min(5,4,4)=4.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is of size 2?\n\nLike the example given in the input: [1, 100000]. Then, when you remove one element, the array is of size 1, so instability is 0. So in this case, the code would sort the array as [1, 100000]. Then, original_instability is 99999. option1 is a[-1] - a[1] which is 100000 - a[1], but a[1] is 100000. So 100000 - 100000 = 0. option2 is a[-2] - a[0] = 1 -1 = 0. So the answer is min(99999, 0, 0) = 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works for all n >= 2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- If n == 2, then the answer is 0 (since after removing one element, the array has one element, so instability is 0).\n\nWait, but for n=2, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Then option1 is a[-1] - a[1] (which is a[-1] - a[-1] = 0), option2 is a[-2] - a[0] (a[0] - a[0] = 0). So the answer is min(original_instability, 0, 0) = 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can handle that.\n\nSo the code plan is:\n\nRead n, read the array.\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute original_instability = a[-1] - a[0]\n\noption1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\noption2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nresult = min(original_instability, option1, option2)\n\nOutput result.\n\nWait, but what about when n is 3? For example, array [1, 2, 3]. original_instability is 2. option1 is 3 - 2 = 1. option2 is 2 -1 = 1. So the result is min(2,1,1) = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,3,3,7]. original_instability is 6. option1 is 7 - 3 =4. option2 is 3 -1 = 2. So min(6,4,2) is 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    original = a[-1] - a[0]\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    res = min(original, option1, option2)\n\n    print(res)\n\nWait, but what about if the array has more than two elements and removing some element in the middle would lead to a better instability?\n\nWait, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 100]. The original instability is 99. If we remove 100, the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. So the answer is min(99, 98, 4) = 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut according to our code, option1 is a[-1] - a[1] = 100 - 2 = 98. option2 is a[-2] - a[0] = 6 -1 =5. So the code would compute min(99, 98, 5) =5. Wait, but the actual answer is 4. What's wrong here?\n\nOh! Oh no! Because in this case, the code's approach is wrong. Because the code is considering only the options of removing the first element, the last element, or any other element. But in this example, the best option is to remove the last element (100), which gives instability 5-1=4. But according to the code, option2 is a[-2] - a[0] = 6 -1=5. So the code would return min(99, 98,5) =5. But the actual answer is 4. So the code is wrong here.\n\nWait, why? Because in this case, the array is sorted as [1,2,3,4,5,6,100]. So when you remove the last element (100), the new array is [1,2,3,4,5,6], whose instability is 6-1=5. Which is indeed what option2 is. But the code says that the answer is 5. But the user thought that the answer would be 4. But that's not the case. So what's wrong with the user's reasoning here?\n\nAh, the user made a mistake. Because the instability when removing the last element is a[-2] - a[0], which is 6-1=5. So the code is correct. So why did the user think that the answer would be 4? Because they thought that the new array would be [1,2,3,4,5,6], which has max 6 and min 1. So instability is 5. So the code is correct. So the code returns 5 as the answer, which is correct. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct. Because the code considers the options of removing first or last elements, and the original instability. But in this case, the code returns 5 as the answer. So the code is correct.\n\nSo what's the problem here?\n\nWait, the code is correct. So why did I think that the answer would be 4? That was a mistake. Because the array after removing 100 is [1,2,3,4,5,6], which has instability 6-1=5. So the code's calculation is correct.\n\nSo the code works correctly.\n\nAnother example: suppose the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 100]. The original instability is 99. If you remove 100, the instability is 7-1=6. If you remove 1, it's 100-3=97. But what if you remove 7? Then the array becomes [1,3,4,5,6,100]. The instability is 100-1=99. Which is worse. So the best option is to remove 100, leading to instability 6. But according to the code, option2 is a[-2] - a[0] = 7-1=6. So the code returns min(99, 97, 6) = 6. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo why in the earlier example with [1,3,3,7], the code gives the correct answer? Because when you remove the last element, the instability is a[-2] - a[0] =3-1=2, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct. So this approach works.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array, then compute the minimum between the original instability, the instability when removing the first element, and the instability when removing the last element.\n\nThus, the code can be written in Python as follows.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7\n\nAfter sorting: [1,3,3,7]\n\noriginal instability is 7-1=6.\n\noption1 is 7 - a[1] = 7-3=4.\n\noption2 is a[-2] - a[0] =3-1=2.\n\nso min(6,4,2) is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 100000\n\nsorted array [1, 100000]. n=2, so output 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1,2,3]. Output is min(2, 3-2=1, 2-1=1) → 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1,1,1]. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=5, [1,2,3,4,5]. The original instability is 4. option1 is 5 - 2 =3. option2 is 4-1=3. So min(4,3,3) →3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then the list. Sort it. Then check for n==2. Else compute the three options.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    original = a[-1] - a[0]\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(original, option1, option2))\n\nWait, but what about when n is 3? For example, the array [1, 3, 5]. Then the options are:\n\noriginal: 5-1=4.\n\noption1: 5 - a[1] =5-3=2.\n\noption2: a[-2] - a[0] =3-1=2.\n\nso min(4,2,2) is 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: [1, 2, 4, 5]. Original instability is 5-1=4. option1 is 5 - 2 =3. option2 is 4-1=3. So min is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut what about when the array has multiple elements and the best option is to remove an element in the middle? For example, let's say the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. The original instability is 99. If we remove 100, the instability is 4-1=3. If we remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. If we remove 2, the instability is 100-1=99. So the code's option2 is a[-2] - a[0] =4-1=3. So the code returns min(99, 98,3) →3. Which is correct.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nSo the code works for all cases.\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element.
