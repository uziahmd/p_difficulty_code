Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The main challenge is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. Directly replacing each occurrence in the string for every query would be too slow, especially if the substitutions are done naively. Because if each substitution replaces a digit with a long string, and there are many such substitutions, the string could become huge, leading to time and memory issues.\n\nHmm. So what's the approach here? Let me think. Since each substitution is applied in order, and each substitution replaces a particular digit with another string, perhaps we can model this with some kind of replacement rules that track how each digit is transformed through the queries.\n\nWait, but the substitutions are done in sequence. For example, if a query replaces '2' with '00', and then later a query replaces '0' with '5', then the original '2's would first become '00', and then each '0' would be replaced by '5', resulting in '55' for each original '2'.\n\nSo the key idea here is that each substitution affects the current state of the digits. However, if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can track how each digit is transformed. Wait, no, because the substitutions are applied in the order given. So the first query is applied first, then the second, etc.\n\nBut directly simulating the substitutions is not feasible for large strings. For example, if the initial string is 1e5 characters, and each substitution replaces a digit with a string of length 1e5, then after a few substitutions, the string would be way too big to handle directly.\n\nTherefore, we need a way to represent the transformations without actually expanding the entire string. Let's think about dynamic programming or some kind of memoization approach where for each digit, we track what it gets replaced with after all substitutions.\n\nWait, but substitutions can overwrite previous ones. For example, if there's a query that replaces '2' with 'a', then later a query that replaces '2' with 'b', then the second query overrides the first. So, for each digit, we need to track the latest substitution that applies to it.\n\nBut how do we handle substitutions that depend on other substitutions? Like, suppose we have a substitution that replaces '2' with '3', and then a substitution that replaces '3' with '4'. Then, any original '2's would first become '3's, then those '3's would become '4's. So the final result for the original '2's is '4's.\n\nSo, the problem is that substitutions can be chained. Therefore, when processing a substitution for a digit, we need to consider that the replacement string may contain digits that themselves have been substituted in previous steps. Therefore, we can't just track the final replacement for each digit as a static value, because substitutions can change over time.\n\nWait, but the substitutions are processed in order. So, for example, when a substitution for 'd' is processed, we need to replace all instances of 'd' in the current string with the replacement string. But the replacement string can contain digits that have their own substitutions. However, when the substitution is applied, the replacement is done immediately. So, for example, if we first replace '2' with '3', then replace '3' with '4', then the original '2's would first become '3's, then those '3's would become '4's. So the order of processing substitutions matters.\n\nBut how to model this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent each digit's expansion as a function. Let's think of each digit as being replaced by a certain string, which itself may be expanded further. However, since substitutions are processed in order, we can track for each digit, the current expansion rule. When a substitution is applied, we update the expansion rule for that digit. However, when expanding a digit, we need to expand it according to the current rules.\n\nBut how to compute the final value of the entire string modulo 1e9+7?\n\nLet me think: the final string is built by expanding each original character through the substitutions. However, the order of substitutions is important. So, for example, if we have a substitution for 'd' that replaces it with a string, and then later a substitution for another digit that replaces a part of that string, the later substitution will affect the string.\n\nBut if we can model the expansion for each digit as a function that returns the current expansion, then we can compute the value of the entire string by processing each original character, expanding it into its current expansion, and then combining those expansions.\n\nBut how to compute the value mod 1e9+7 efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's say that for each digit d, we track a value that represents the expansion of d. However, since the expansion can be a string, but we need to compute the numeric value mod MOD, perhaps we can track for each digit d, the value of its expansion as a number mod MOD, and also the length of the expansion (since when appending digits, the position matters for the modulus).\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think of each substitution as building a tree of replacements. For example, if we have a substitution that replaces '2' with '3', and then '3' is replaced with '4', then the expansion of '2' is '4'.\n\nBut when processing substitutions, we can track for each digit, the current expansion as a string. However, since the string can be very long, we need a way to compute the numeric value mod MOD without storing the entire string.\n\nSo perhaps, for each digit, we can track two things:\n\n- The value of the expansion as a number mod MOD.\n\n- The length of the expansion (number of digits) mod (MOD-1), because when you append a number, the contribution to the overall value depends on the position. Wait, but since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime, and since we're dealing with exponents of 10, maybe we can precompute powers of 10 mod MOD.\n\nBut let's think about how to compute the value of a string s as a number mod MOD. Let's say we have a string s, and we want to compute its value mod MOD. We can process each character from left to right, and for each digit, compute current_value = (current_value * 10 + int(digit)) % MOD.\n\nNow, suppose we have two strings, A and B. If we concatenate them, the value is (value(A) * 10^len(B) + value(B)) mod MOD. So, if we can track for each expansion, both its value mod MOD and the length of the expansion, then we can combine them.\n\nTherefore, for each digit d, we can track:\n\n- val[d] = the value of the expansion of d mod MOD.\n\n- len[d] = the length of the expansion of d.\n\nThen, when a substitution comes in for digit d, replacing it with a string t, we can compute the new val[d] and len[d] based on t's expansion.\n\nWait, but t can contain digits that have their own expansions. So, for example, when processing a substitution \"d -> t\", we need to process the string t, expanding each of its characters according to their current expansions, and then compute the combined value and length for the entire t.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a substitution query \"d -> t\". For each character in t, we can get the current expansion of that character (say, for character c in t, we have val[c] and len[c]). Then, the string t's expansion is the concatenation of each character's expansion. So, the value of t's expansion is computed by combining all those expansions.\n\nFor example, if t is \"ab\", and a's expansion is value Va and length La, and b's expansion is Vb and length Lb, then the value of t's expansion is (Va * 10^Lb + Vb) mod MOD. And the length is La + Lb.\n\nSo, for the substitution query, when replacing d with t, we need to compute the value of t's expansion (which is built from the current expansions of the characters in t) and set val[d] and len[d] accordingly.\n\nThis seems manageable. Because each substitution can be processed by evaluating the replacement string t, considering the current expansions of each character in t. And then, for the current digit d, we update val[d] and len[d] to the computed values.\n\nBut how to compute the value of t's expansion? Let's take the string t, and process each character in order. For each character in t, we can calculate the contribution to the total value.\n\nLet me think of this as a process. Let's say we have a variable current_val and current_len. Initially, current_val is 0 and current_len is 0. Then, for each character c in t:\n\n- We get the expansion of c: (v, l) = (val[c], len[c]).\n\n- Then, the current_val becomes (current_val * pow(10, l, MOD) + v) % MOD.\n\n- current_len becomes current_len + l.\n\nSo, for the entire string t, the value is current_val and length is current_len.\n\nSo, when a substitution is processed for digit d, we need to compute the value of the replacement string t as per the current expansions of the characters in t, and then assign val[d] = current_val and len[d] = current_len.\n\nThis seems like a viable approach. Because for each substitution, processing the replacement string t takes O(len(t)) time. And since the sum of len(t) across all queries is 1e5, the total processing time for all substitutions is acceptable.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, we need to process the original string s. For each character in s, we get its expansion (val[c], len[c]), and then compute the value of the entire string by combining all those expansions in order.\n\nFor example, the original string is s = c1 c2 c3 ... cn. Each ci is expanded into (vi, li). The total value is computed by combining these expansions sequentially. Starting with 0 and 0 length. For each expansion (vi, li):\n\ntotal_val = (total_val * pow(10, li, MOD) + vi) % MOD\n\ntotal_len += li\n\nOnce all characters are processed, the total_val is the answer, except if the total_len is zero (i.e., the string is empty, which is treated as zero). Also, note that leading zeros are ignored when converting to a number, but according to the problem statement, the leading zeros are not removed from the string. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\nWait, but the problem says that when you represent s as a decimal number, you ignore leading zeros. However, the actual string s after substitutions may have leading zeros, but the numeric value is computed as if leading zeros are removed. For example, if the string is \"00123\", the number is 123. However, if the string is empty, it's considered zero.\n\nBut how does this affect our calculation? Because our current approach computes the numeric value of the string as it is, including leading zeros. But according to the problem, leading zeros should be ignored. So, for example, the string \"00123\" would be treated as 123, but our approach would compute (0*10^5 + 0*10^4 + 1*10^3 + 2*10^2 + 3) mod MOD, which is 123. So that's correct. Because leading zeros contribute nothing to the numeric value. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the string is \"00123\", the value is 123, but according to our calculation, it would be 0*10^5 + 0*10^4 + 1*10^3 + 2*10^2 + 3. Which is 123. So our approach already correctly handles leading zeros. Because the way we compute the value is exactly the same as the numeric value of the string, ignoring leading zeros. Because leading zeros would be added as 0s, but when you compute the value, they contribute nothing. For example, \"00123\" is 0*10^5 + 0*10^4 + 1*10^3 + 2*10^2 + 3*10^0 = 123. So our approach is correct.\n\nBut what if the entire string is \"000\"? Then the value is 0, which is correct. And if the string is empty, we return 0, which is handled by checking if total_len is zero. Because in that case, the total_val would be 0 (since initial value is 0 and len is 0). So that's okay.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the powers of 10 mod MOD. Wait, but for each substitution step, when combining the expansions, we need to compute pow(10, l, MOD), where l is the length of the expansion of a character. However, l can be up to very large numbers. But since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime, and we need to compute 10^l mod MOD. However, for l up to, say, 1e5 * 1e5 (but that's impossible, since each substitution's t can be up to 1e5 in total length, and for each query, we process the t's characters, so the maximum possible len[d] for any digit is O(1e5) per substitution. But even then, for each substitution, when we process the t string, we need to compute pow(10, l, MOD), where l is the length of the expansion of a character. However, if we have to compute this for arbitrary exponents, we can't precompute all possible powers. So during the substitution processing, when we need to compute pow(10, l, MOD), we can compute it on the fly using pow(10, l, MOD). But since l can be up to something like 1e5 * 1e5 (if substitutions are done recursively), but in Python, pow is efficient even for large exponents.\n\nWait, but for each substitution processing, when building the value of the replacement string t, for each character in t, we have to compute the contribution. For example, when processing the first character in t, we have current_val and current_len. Then, when adding the next character, we need to multiply current_val by 10^len(c) and add the value of c. So, for each step, we need to compute 10^len(c) mod MOD.\n\nBut len(c) is the length of the expansion of the current character. Which can be up to very large numbers. However, in Python, pow(10, exponent, MOD) is efficient, even for large exponents. So during the substitution processing, whenever we need to compute 10^l mod MOD, we can compute it as pow(10, l, MOD).\n\nBut wait, for each substitution, when we process the replacement string t, we process each character in t. For each of these characters, we get their expansion's length (len[c]), and compute 10^len[c] mod MOD. Then multiply the current_val by that, add the expansion's value, etc.\n\nSo the steps for processing the substitution queries are:\n\nInitialize for each digit d (0-9), val[d] and len[d]. Initially, val[d] is d (mod MOD) and len[d] is 1. Because before any substitution, each digit is itself.\n\nThen, for each query in order:\n\n- The query is di -> ti. So for the digit di, we need to replace it with ti. To compute the new val[di] and len[di], we process the string ti as follows:\n\n   - Initialize current_val = 0, current_len = 0.\n\n   - For each character c in ti:\n\n      - Get the value of c's expansion: v = val[c], l = len[c].\n\n      - Compute the multiplier = pow(10, l, MOD).\n\n      - current_val = (current_val * multiplier + v) % MOD.\n\n      - current_len += l.\n\n   - Then, set val[di] = current_val, len[di] = current_len.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, process the original string s:\n\nInitialize total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\nFor each character c in s:\n\n   v = val[c], l = len[c]\n\n   multiplier = pow(10, l, MOD)\n\n   total_val = (total_val * multiplier + v) % MOD\n\n   total_len += l\n\nIf total_len == 0: output 0\n\nElse: output total_val\n\nWait, but what if the total_len is zero? That would only happen if all characters in the original string were replaced with empty strings. For example, if the original string was '123' and all digits were replaced with empty strings. Then the total_len is zero, and the answer is zero.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the empty string is considered as zero. So yes, in that case, output zero.\n\nBut in our code, if the total_len is zero, the total_val would be zero (because initially it's zero, and we don't add anything). So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nOriginal string is '123123'\n\nn=1, query is 2->00.\n\nProcessing the substitution:\n\nInitially, for each digit, val is digit, len is 1.\n\nFor the query '2' -> '00':\n\nProcess the ti string '00'.\n\nFor each character in '00':\n\nFirst character is '0'. Its val is 0, len is 1.\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0, current_len 0.\n\nAfter first '0':\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. current_len = 1.\n\nSecond character is '0'. val is 0, len is 1.\n\nmultiplier = 10^1 mod MOD = 10.\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0. current_len = 2.\n\nSo the new val[2] is 0, len[2] is 2.\n\nThen, processing the original string '123123'.\n\nEach character:\n\n1: val is 1, len 1.\n\n2: val is 0, len 2.\n\n3: val 3, len 1.\n\nThen the string is processed as follows:\n\nStart with total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\nFirst character is '1' (v=1, l=1):\n\nmultiplier = 10^1 mod MOD = 10.\n\ntotal_val = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1. total_len = 1.\n\nSecond character is '2' (v=0, l=2):\n\nmultiplier = 10^2 mod MOD = 100.\n\ntotal_val = 1 * 100 + 0 = 100. total_len = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThird character is '3' (v=3, l=1):\n\nmultiplier = 10^1 = 10.\n\ntotal_val = 100 * 10 + 3 = 1003. total_len = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nFourth character is '1' (v=1, l=1): multiplier is 10^1=10. total_val = 1003 *10 +1 = 10031. len=5.\n\nFifth character is '2' (v=0, l=2): multiplier is 10^2=100. total_val = 10031 * 100 + 0 = 1003100. len=5+2=7.\n\nSixth character is '3': multiplier 10^1=10. total_val = 1003100 *10 +3 = 10031003. len=8.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 10031003. Then mod 1e9+7 is 10031003, which is less than MOD, so output is 10031003.\n\nAnother sample: the third input example:\n\nInput is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'\n\nSo original string is '222', then two queries: first replace 2 with 0, then replace 0 with 7.\n\nLet's process the substitutions:\n\nInitially, for each digit, val is digit, len is 1.\n\nFirst query: 2->0.\n\nProcessing ti '0'.\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0, current_len 0.\n\nProcessing '0' (val is 0, len 1):\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. current_len = 1.\n\nSet val[2] = 0, len[2] = 1.\n\nSecond query: 0->7.\n\nProcessing ti '7'.\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0, current_len 0.\n\nProcessing '7' (val is 7, len 1):\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10^1 +7 =7. current_len =1.\n\nSet val[0] =7, len[0]=1.\n\nNow, processing the original string '222'.\n\nEach '2' has val 0, len 1.\n\nProcessing the three '2's:\n\nStart with total_val=0, total_len=0.\n\nFirst '2' (v=0, l=1):\n\nmultiplier is 10^1=10. total_val = 0 *10 +0 =0. total_len=1.\n\nSecond '2': multiplier 10^1=10. total_val = 0*10 +0=0. total_len=2.\n\nThird '2': same. total_val =0*10 +0=0. total_len=3.\n\nBut wait, the sample output is 777. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, no! Because after the first substitution, 2 is replaced with 0. Then, the second substitution replaces 0 with 7. But the substitution for 0 is done after the substitution for 2. So when the substitution for 2 is processed, the replacement is '0', which is the original 0. But then, when the substitution for 0 is processed, the replacement for 0 is 7. So during the processing of the original string, each 2 is replaced with 0, and then each 0 is replaced with 7. But how does that happen?\n\nBecause during substitution processing, when we process the query 2->0, the replacement for 2 is '0'. But during that processing, the current val[0] is 0 (original value). Then, when the query 0->7 is processed, we update val[0] to 7 and len[0] to 1. So when the original string is processed, the '2's have their expansion as 0 (from the first substitution), but that 0 is now replaced by 7, because during the processing of the original string, the expansion of 2 is computed as the value of '0' (the replacement string), which is processed as per the current val[0], which is 7.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the substitution processing. When the first substitution is processed (2->0), we process the ti string '0'. At that time, the val[0] is 0, len[0] is 1. So the current_val for the ti string is computed as 0 (value of '0') and len is 1. So val[2] becomes 0, len[2] becomes 1.\n\nThen, the second substitution is 0->7. Now, when processing this query, the ti string is '7'. So during processing, for the ti string '7', we look at each character (only '7'), which has val[7] =7, len[7]=1. So the current_val is 7, len is 1. So val[0] is updated to 7, len[0] to 1.\n\nNow, when processing the original string '222', each '2' is replaced with the expansion of 2, which is val[2] =0, len[2] =1. But that expansion is the string '0' (from the first substitution). However, during the processing of the original string, when we compute the value of the expansion of '2', which is 0, but that 0 is now replaced by 7. Wait no, no. The expansion of 2 is stored as val[2] =0, len[2] =1. But that 0 is the value of the expansion of the string '0' (from the first substitution). However, when the substitution for 0 was processed, the val[0] was updated to 7. So when the expansion of '0' is processed, it's now 7. But during the processing of the substitution for 2, the expansion of '0' was computed as val[0] =0 (before the second substitution). So the val[2] is 0, which represents the value of the expansion of '0' at the time of the first substitution. But after that substitution, when the 0 is replaced with 7, the val[2] remains 0, because the substitution for 2 was done earlier. So this seems like a problem.\n\nWait, this suggests that our approach is incorrect. Because when we process the substitution for 2, we compute the value of the replacement string (which is '0') at that moment. However, later substitutions for other digits (like 0) do not affect the val[2], because val[2] was already computed based on the previous state of val[0].\n\nBut in reality, the substitution for 2 is processed first. The replacement for 2 is '0', but then later, the substitution for 0 is '7', which would cause the expansion of 2 to be '7' instead of '0'.\n\nBut according to our approach, the expansion of 2 is fixed once the substitution is processed. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, this indicates that our approach is wrong. Because the substitution for 2 is processed once, and the replacement string is evaluated at that time. However, if after that substitution, another substitution changes the expansion of the digits in the replacement string, the expansion of 2 would not be updated automatically.\n\nIn the example above, after substituting 2 with '0', the expansion of 2 is the value of '0' at that time (which is 0). Then, when 0 is substituted with '7', the expansion of 0 is updated, but the expansion of 2 is not automatically updated. So, in the original string, each 2 is replaced with '0', which is now replaced with '7'? Or is the substitution for 2 done once, and the replacement string is '0' as it was at the time of substitution.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, substitutions are applied in order. For example, if you first replace 2 with 0, then replace 0 with 7, then the original 2's are first replaced with 0's, and then those 0's are replaced with 7's. So the final expansion of the original 2 is 77 (since the replacement for 2 is 0, which is then replaced with 7).\n\nBut according to our approach, the expansion of 2 is stored as 0 (the value of '0' at the time of substitution). However, the expansion of '0' is now 7. So when processing the original string, the expansion of 2 is 0, which is not correct. Because the replacement for 2 is '0', which is then replaced with 7. So the expansion of 2 should be 7, not 0.\n\nSo our approach is incorrect. What's wrong here?\n\nThe problem is that our approach evaluates the replacement string once, at the time of the substitution, and stores the value and length of that expansion. However, if later substitutions change the expansion of digits that were part of the replacement string, then the stored value for the original digit is not updated. Hence, this approach does not account for future substitutions that affect the replacement string.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect. How can we fix this?\n\nWe need a way to dynamically track the expansion of each digit, taking into account that substitutions can change the expansion of other digits. However, this seems challenging.\n\nAlternative idea: For each digit, track a function that represents the expansion. However, since substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution can override previous ones, perhaps we need to model the expansion in a way that allows for dependencies on other digits.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think again. Suppose that when we process a substitution for digit d, replacing it with string t. At that moment, the expansion of t is determined by the current expansion of each character in t. However, if later substitutions change the expansion of any character in t, then the expansion of d would not automatically change. So this approach is not sufficient.\n\nBut in reality, the substitution for d is applied once. So when you replace d with t, the replacement is done immediately. So, for example, if you replace d with t, then later replace some character in t with another string, that doesn't affect the existing replacement of d. Because the replacement of d was already done, and the t is replaced once. Wait, no. The substitutions are applied sequentially. So, for example:\n\nOriginal string is 'd'.\n\nFirst substitution: replace d with t. Now, the string becomes t.\n\nSecond substitution: replace some character in t (say, 'a') with u. Now, the string becomes t with 'a's replaced by u.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the substitutions are applied in sequence. So each substitution replaces all occurrences of the specified digit in the current string. So, if the first substitution replaces d with t, and the second substitution replaces a with u, then the current string (which is t) has any a's replaced with u.\n\nThus, the substitution for d is applied once. Any subsequent substitutions apply to the current string, which includes the replacements made by previous substitutions.\n\nSo, our initial approach is incorrect because it assumes that the expansion of d is fixed once the substitution is processed. However, in reality, after the substitution for d is processed, the replacement string t is part of the current string, and subsequent substitutions may modify parts of that t.\n\nSo the problem is that the initial approach treats the expansion of a digit as a static value, but in reality, the expansion depends on the current state of other substitutions.\n\nThis seems like a major issue. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of trying to track the expansion of each digit, we need to model the current state of the string as a sequence of operations. However, since the string can be very large, we cannot store it directly.\n\nAlternative idea: Represent each digit as a node in a graph, where each substitution defines a transformation. For example, when we process a substitution for d, we can define that d is now replaced by the expansion of t, which may include other digits. But when a substitution for d is processed again, it overrides the previous one.\n\nBut how to compute the final value of the original string?\n\nLet me think of the substitutions as a series of mappings. For example, after all substitutions, each digit d is mapped to a certain expansion. However, this expansion may involve other digits that have their own mappings. So, to compute the expansion of d, we need to recursively expand all the digits in its expansion.\n\nBut this sounds like a recursive approach. However, since substitutions can create cycles (e.g., d1 → d2, d2 → d1), we need to avoid infinite recursion. But the problem says that substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution replaces all occurrences of a digit in the current string. So, for example, if we have a substitution d → d, it would replace all d's with d, which has no effect. But if we have substitutions that form a cycle, like d1 → d2, d2 → d1, then the expansion of d1 would be d2's expansion, which is d1's expansion, leading to infinite recursion. However, in practice, the problem allows this, but we need to find a way to compute the value.\n\nBut how can we handle this?\n\nMaybe we can memoize the expansion of each digit, using dynamic programming. For example, for each digit d, we can compute its expansion as follows:\n\nIf there is no substitution for d, then it's the digit itself.\n\nOtherwise, the expansion is the expansion of the replacement string t. Which is the concatenation of the expansion of each character in t.\n\nThis way, the expansion is computed recursively. However, we need to memoize the results to avoid recomputation and detect cycles.\n\nBut how to compute this for the purpose of calculating the value mod MOD and the length?\n\nLet me think. For each digit d, we can compute two values:\n\n- The value of the expansion of d mod MOD.\n\n- The length of the expansion of d.\n\nThese can be computed recursively. For example:\n\ndef compute_val(d):\n\n    if d is already computed, return cached value.\n\n    if there is no substitution for d, then val is d, len is 1.\n\n    else:\n\n        t is the replacement string for d.\n\n        for each character c in t:\n\n            compute_val(c) and get its value and length.\n\n        compute the value of the concatenation of these expansions.\n\nSimilarly for the length.\n\nBut how to handle this during the substitution processing? Because substitutions are processed in order. So, when a substitution is processed for d, it replaces the previous substitution for d. So, the replacement string for d is fixed at the time of substitution. However, the replacement string may contain other digits that have substitutions applied after the substitution for d.\n\nFor example, substitution for d is processed first, which uses the current expansion of other digits. Then, a substitution for another digit e is processed, which may affect the expansion of d's replacement string.\n\nWait, but no. Because the substitution for d was processed earlier. So, the replacement string for d is fixed at that time. However, the replacement string may contain digits that are later substituted. For example:\n\nOriginal string is 'd'.\n\nSubstitution 1: d → 'e'.\n\nSubstitution 2: e → 'f'.\n\nThen, the original string is replaced with 'e', then 'f'.\n\nBut according to our initial approach, when substitution 1 is processed, the replacement string 'e' is evaluated. At that time, e's expansion is e (since no substitution for e has been processed yet). So the expansion of d is e's expansion, which is e. Then, substitution 2 processes e → 'f', which changes e's expansion to f. However, the expansion of d is still e's previous expansion (e), not f. Thus, the initial approach would compute the expansion of d as e, not f. Which is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the substitutions are applied in sequence. So the first substitution replaces d with e. Then the second substitution replaces e with f. So the original string d becomes e, then becomes f. So the final expansion of d is f.\n\nBut according to our initial approach, the expansion of d is e, which is incorrect. Hence, the initial approach is wrong.\n\nThis shows that the initial approach is flawed. It does not account for substitutions that happen after a substitution for a digit. The replacement string for a digit is evaluated at the time of substitution, but if later substitutions change the expansion of digits in that replacement string, the expansion of the original digit is not updated.\n\nThus, we need a way to dynamically compute the expansion of a digit, taking into account all substitutions that have been applied up to the current time.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nOne possible solution is to represent for each digit d, the current substitution rule. When we need to compute the value of d's expansion, we recursively compute the expansion of the substitution string, using the current substitution rules for each digit in the substitution string.\n\nBut this requires that during the computation of the expansion, we can dynamically access the current substitution rules. However, since substitutions are processed sequentially, and each substitution overrides the previous one for the same digit, we can track for each digit d, the current substitution rule (either a string or None, if no substitution has been applied).\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n- For each digit d, maintain a mapping to its substitution string (or None if not substituted).\n\n- When processing the original string, for each character, we compute its expansion recursively, using the current substitution rules.\n\nHowever, this would require us to compute the expansion of the entire string recursively, which may be very slow for large strings. But with memoization, it might be manageable.\n\nBut how to compute the value mod MOD and the length?\n\nLet me think of this as a memoization problem. For each digit d, we can memoize the computed value and length of its expansion. When we need to compute the expansion of d, we first check if it's already computed. If not, we compute it based on its substitution rule.\n\nBut how to handle the substitution rules. Let's think:\n\nInitially, for each digit d, the substitution rule is None. So the expansion is the digit itself.\n\nWhen a substitution is processed for d, we set the substitution rule for d to the string ti.\n\nWhen computing the expansion of d, we check if the substitution rule is None. If so, it's the digit. Otherwise, we need to compute the expansion of the substitution string ti, which involves expanding each character in ti, and combining them.\n\nThis seems like a",
