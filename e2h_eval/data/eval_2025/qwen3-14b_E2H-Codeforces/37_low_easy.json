    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem says that given an array a of distinct integers, I have to construct a permutation b of a such that for every non-empty subset S of indices (with size between 1 and n-1), the sum of elements in positions S for array a is different from the sum of elements in positions S for array b. If no such permutation exists, output -1.\n\nHmm. Wait, the condition is that for every subset S (non-empty, not all elements), the sum of a's elements on those positions is different from the sum of b's elements on those positions. Wait, no. Wait the problem says: \"the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different\". Oh right, so for each subset S, sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i.\n\nWait, but since b is a permutation of a, the sum of all elements in a and b are the same. But for subsets S that are not the entire array, their sums can vary. So the problem requires that for any subset S (non-empty, not all elements), the sum of the subset in a is not equal to the sum of the same subset in b.\n\nBut how can we arrange the permutation b such that this holds?\n\nLet me think about what this implies. Let's consider that for each subset S, sum_S(a) != sum_S(b). But since b is a permutation of a, the sum of the entire array is the same for both a and b. However, for subsets that are not the entire array, their sums could be different.\n\nBut how can we ensure that for all subsets S (of size between 1 and n-1), the sum of a's subset is different from the sum of b's subset?\n\nThis seems like a very strict condition. How can we find such a permutation?\n\nLet me think of small examples. For example, the first sample input is n=2, a=[1,2]. The output is [2,1]. Let's check why this works.\n\nIn this case, the only subset S that is allowed is {1} and {2} (since n=2, subsets of size 1). For the original array a, the sum of {1} is 1, and for b, it's 2. These are different. Similarly, for subset {2}, sum in a is 2, in b it's 1. So they are different. Hence, the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo for n=2, swapping the elements works. But why? Because for any subset of size 1, the sum in a and b are different. So in this case, the permutation is such that each element is in a different position than in a. But for larger n?\n\nLet me think about another example. Take n=3. Suppose a is [1, 2, 3]. Let's try to find a permutation b. What if we reverse the array? So b is [3,2,1]. Now, let's check some subsets.\n\nTake subset {1} in a: sum is 1. In b, sum is 3. Different. Subset {2}: sum is 2 vs 2. Oh wait, same! That's a problem. So this permutation would not work because for subset {2}, the sum in a and b is same. So this permutation is invalid.\n\nSo how to avoid that? Maybe arrange the permutation such that for each element, its value is different in the same position. But that's impossible because the permutation is a rearrangement. Wait, no. For example, if the permutation is such that for each element, it's placed in a different position. But that's only possible if there's a derangement. However, even if there's a derangement, that doesn't necessarily ensure that all subsets have different sums.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to arrange the permutation such that for each element, the value in position i in b is different from the value in position i in a. Because if that's true, then for subsets consisting of a single element, their sums will differ. But what about larger subsets?\n\nWait, suppose that for all i, b[i] != a[i]. Then for any subset S which is a singleton, the sum will differ. But for larger subsets, maybe there's a possibility that sum_S(a) equals sum_S(b). For example, if S has two elements, and in a, the elements are x and y, and in b, they are y and x. Then sum_S(a) = x + y, sum_S(b) = y + x. Which is same. So that would violate the condition. Therefore, just having a derangement is not sufficient.\n\nSo this approach is not sufficient. So what's the correct way to approach this problem?\n\nLet me think again. The problem requires that for every",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct a permutation `b` of the given array `a` such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set), the sum of elements in those positions in `a` is different from the sum of elements in those positions in `b`. If no such permutation exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key requirement is that for any subset of indices (excluding the full set), the sum of elements at those indices in `a` and `b` must differ. This means that even for single-element subsets, the values at corresponding positions in `a` and `b` must differ.\n\n2. **Derangement Insight**: A derangement is a permutation where no element appears in its original position. This ensures that for any single-element subset, the sums will differ. However, ensuring this for all subsets is more complex.\n\n3. **Brute Force with Pruning**: Given the constraint that `n` can be up to 22, generating all permutations (which is 22! possibilities) is computationally infeasible. Instead, we use backtracking with pruning to find a valid permutation efficiently.\n\n4. **Early Termination**: During the permutation generation, we check if the current partial permutation satisfies the condition for all subsets up to that point. If not, we prune that branch early.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    # Precompute all subsets of size 1 to n-1\n    all_subsets = []\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        for subset in itertools.combinations(range(n), k):\n            all_subsets.append(subset)\n    \n    # We need to find a permutation b of a such that for every subset S in all_subsets,\n    # sum(a[i] for i in S) != sum(b[i] for i in S)\n    \n    # Try all permutations of a, but since n can be up to 22, this is impossible.\n    # So instead, use backtracking with pruning.\n    \n    # For small n (up to 22), but with pruning, maybe it's manageable?\n    # But 22! is way too big.
