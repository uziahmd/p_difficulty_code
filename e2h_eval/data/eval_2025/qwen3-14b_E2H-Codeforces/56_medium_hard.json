Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The key point here is that any two line segments (from a spaceship to its assigned base) must not cross each other. So, the challenge is to find a perfect matching where all the connecting lines are non-intersecting.\n\nHmm, since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible perfect matchings. For example, if R equals B, then we can generate all permutations of the bases and check for each permutation if the lines don't cross. But wait, how do I check if two line segments cross?\n\nWait, the problem states that no three points are colinear. So, any two line segments can either cross or not, but there's no case where they share a point (since all points are unique). So for two line segments (A-B and C-D), they cross if the lines intersect at a point that's inside both segments. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check if R equals B. If not, output No. Because a perfect matching requires R=B. Oh right! The problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So R must equal B. Wait, the input has R and B. So first, if R != B, then output No. Because you can't have a perfect matching otherwise. Oh right! So the first check is whether R equals B. Otherwise, output No.\n\nBut looking at the sample input: first example is 3 3, which is okay. Second example is 2 1, which is R=2, B=1, so output No. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo first, check if R != B. If so, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for R = B, we need to check if there exists a perfect matching (permutation) between the spaceships and bases such that all connecting lines don't cross.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each spaceship is assigned to a unique base). For each permutation, check if all the line segments between spaceship i and base permutation[i] don't cross each other.\n\nBut how do I check if any two line segments cross?\n\nSo for a given permutation, we have to check all pairs of line segments. For each pair (i,j), check if their line segments cross. If any pair does cross, this permutation is invalid.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nFor each permutation of the bases (since there are R! possibilities, which for R=10 is 3.6 million, but since R is up to 10, perhaps it's manageable? Let's think: 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking all pairs of lines. For each pair, check if they cross. How many pairs? For R=10, it's 10*9/2 = 45 pairs. For each pair, check if they cross. So total operations are about 3.6 million * 45 = around 163 million operations. That's acceptable for Python? Maybe, but perhaps there's a smarter way. However, given the constraints (R and B up to 10), it's manageable.\n\nSo the main problem is to generate all permutations of the bases, and for each permutation, check if all the line segments between the spaceship and base in the permutation are non-crossing.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments cross?\n\nI need a function that takes two line segments (each defined by two points) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nSo, how to implement that?\n\nThe standard way to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\nFirst, check if the orientation of A, B, C and A, B, D are different, and similarly for C, D, A and C, D, B. Also, handle cases where points are colinear. However, the problem says that no three points are colinear, so we don't have to worry about that. Wait, the note says that no three points are on the same line. So, the line segments can't have overlapping points, and any two line segments can't have three points colinear. So, for two line segments AB and CD, they can't have any three points colinear. Therefore, if AB and CD intersect, they must do so at a single point, and that point is not an endpoint of either segment. Because if the lines intersect at an endpoint, then that would imply that three points (the endpoint and two others) are colinear. Wait, for example, if AB and CD share a point. Suppose A is C. Then the line segments would share a point. But according to the problem statement, all points are unique. So no two points are same. So the line segments can't share endpoints. So, the only way two line segments can intersect is if their lines cross each other at a single point that's not an endpoint of either segment.\n\nTherefore, for the problem, two line segments AB and CD cross if and only if the orientation of A, B, C is different from the orientation of A, B, D, and the orientation of C, D, A is different from the orientation of C, D, B.\n\nSo, the standard method for checking if two line segments intersect is to compute orientations. So, the function to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect can be implemented using orientation checks.\n\nSo, the steps for the function:\n\nImplement a helper function to compute the orientation of three points. The orientation can be:\n\n- 0 if colinear\n- 1 if clockwise\n- 2 if counter-clockwise\n\nBut since the problem says that no three points are colinear, we can ignore the 0 case. So, for our problem, the orientations will always be 1 or 2.\n\nThe orientation can be computed via the cross product. For three points p, q, r:\n\nval = (q.x - p.x)*(r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y)*(r.x - p.x)\n\nIf val is 0, colinear. Else, positive or negative. So, for the purpose of orientation, we can return 1 if val >0, else 2 (if val <0).\n\nSo, for two line segments AB and CD:\n\nCheck if the orientations of (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) are different, and the orientations of (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) are different. If both conditions are true, then the line segments intersect.\n\nSo, the code for checking intersection between two line segments.\n\nOnce that's implemented, for a given permutation, we can check all pairs of line segments.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read R points for spaceships, then B points for bases.\n\nThen, generate all possible permutations of the B bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships). For each permutation, check if all line segments between spaceship i and base permutation[i] do not cross with any other line segment.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Otherwise, output No.\n\nBut wait, how to generate the permutations? For example, if R = B = 3, then the permutation is a list of the bases in some order. So, for each spaceship (in order 0..R-1), assign the base in the permutation's position. So, the permutation is of length R, where each element is a base.\n\nSo, in Python, for the bases, we can generate all possible permutations of the list of bases. For example, if the bases are stored as a list, then itertools.permutations(bases, len(bases)) would generate all possible orderings.\n\nNow, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments.\n\nSo, for each permutation, create a list of line segments (spaceship_i, base_permutation_i). Then, for each pair of line segments (i,j), check if they cross. If any pair crosses, reject the permutation.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead input:\n\nFirst line is R and B.\n\nThen R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, the first line is 3 3. Then three lines for spaceships, then three lines for bases.\n\nBut in the input, the first example's input is given as a list, but in actual code, we need to read from stdin.\n\nSo, in code, read R and B. Then read R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nThen, read R and B. If R != B, print 'No'.\n\nElse, read the R spaceships and B bases.\n\nThen, for each permutation of the bases:\n\nCheck if all pairs of line segments in the permutation's assignment do not cross.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies this, output 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\nNow, the key part is implementing the check for two line segments crossing.\n\nLet me think about the code for that.\n\nImplement a function called do_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2) which returns True if the line segments p1q1 and p2q2 intersect.\n\nWhere p1 and q1 are points (tuples or lists) representing the endpoints of the first segment, and similarly for p2 and q2.\n\nSo, the code for the function:\n\ndef ccw(p, q, r):\n    # returns 1 if counter-clockwise, -1 if clockwise, 0 if colinear\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val > 0:\n        return 1\n    elif val < 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    # Check if the segments p1q1 and p2q2 intersect\n    # Using the orientation method\n    # Since no three points are colinear, we don't need to handle that case\n    # So, check if the orientations are different\n    o1 = ccw(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = ccw(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = ccw(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = ccw(p2, q2, q1)\n    \n    # If the orientations are different for both pairs, then they intersect\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nWait, but this is the standard way to check if two line segments intersect. However, there's a possibility that the segments are collinear but overlapping. But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, for two line segments, if they are collinear, then any two points from them would form a line with three points. But the problem says that no three points are colinear. Therefore, the line segments cannot be collinear. Because if two line segments are collinear, then for example, p1, p2, and q1 would be colinear. But the problem states that no three points are colinear. So that's impossible. Therefore, the segments can't be collinear. So, the above function should work.\n\nBut wait, what if two line segments share an endpoint? For example, p1 is p2. But according to the problem statement, no two points coincide. So, that can't happen. So, all points are unique. Therefore, the line segments can't share endpoints. So, the function segments_intersect returns True only when the two line segments properly cross each other, not when they share an endpoint.\n\nThus, this function should correctly detect if two line segments cross.\n\nSo, in the code, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments. For example, for a permutation of bases, the line segments are (spaceship[0], base_perm[0]), (spaceship[1], base_perm[1]), etc. For each pair of line segments (i, j) where i < j, check if they intersect. If any pair does, then the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for each permutation:\n\nvalid = True\n\nfor i in 0 to R-1:\n\n   for j in i+1 to R-1:\n\n       if segments_intersect(spaceship[i], base_perm[i], spaceship[j], base_perm[j]):\n\n           valid = False\n\n           break\n\n   if not valid:\n\n       break\n\nif valid:\n\n   return Yes\n\nSo, the code proceeds to check all permutations.\n\nNow, considering that for R=10, there are 10! = 3,628,800 permutations. For each permutation, checking 10*9/2 = 45 pairs. For each pair, checking the segments_intersect function. So, for each permutation, 45 checks.\n\nIn Python, this may be feasible for small R (up to 10), but perhaps for R=10, it's tight. However, given that the constraints are small, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n\n(0,0)\n\n(2,0)\n\n(3,1)\n\nBases:\n\n(-2,1)\n\n(0,3)\n\n(2,2)\n\nSo, the sample says that connecting in order is possible. Let's see:\n\nAssign spaceship 0 to base 0 (-2,1), spaceship 1 to base 1 (0,3), spaceship 2 to base 2 (2,2). Let's check if any two lines cross.\n\nLine 1: (0,0) to (-2,1). Line 2: (2,0) to (0,3). Line 3: (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck between line 1 and line 2. Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute.\n\np1 = (0,0), q1 = (-2,1)\n\np2 = (2,0), q2 = (0,3)\n\nCompute o1 = ccw(p1, q1, p2) → ( (-2-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) ) → (-2*0 - 1*2) = -2 → -1. So o1 is -1.\n\no2 = ccw(p1, q1, q2) → p1 is (0,0), q1 is (-2,1), q2 is (0,3). So:\n\n(q1.x - p1.x) is -2 - 0 = -2. (q1.y - p1.y) is 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n(r.x - p1.x) is 0 - 0 = 0. (r.y - p1.y) is 3-0=3.\n\nval = (-2)*(3) - (1)*(0) = -6 - 0 = -6 → -1. So o2 is -1. So o1 and o2 are same. So (o1 != o2) is false. So the segments do not cross. So the first pair doesn't cross.\n\nThen line 1 and line 3: (0,0) to (-2,1) and (3,1) to (2,2). Let's check. \n\np1 is (0,0), q1 is (-2,1). p2 is (3,1), q2 is (2,2).\n\nccw(p1, q1, p2) → ( (-2 - 0) * (1 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(3 - 0) ) → (-2)*1 - 1*3 → -2 -3 = -5 → -1. o1 is -1.\n\nccw(p1, q1, q2) → ( -2 -0 )*(2 -0) - (1 -0)*(2 -0) ?\n\nWait, p1 is (0,0), q1 is (-2,1), q2 is (2,2). So the calculation for ccw(p1, q1, q2):\n\n(q1.x - p1.x) is -2 - 0 = -2. (q1.y - p1.y) is 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n(q2.x - p1.x) is 2 - 0 = 2. (q2.y - p1.y) is 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nval = (-2)*(2) - (1)*(2) = -4 - 2 = -6 → -1. So o2 is -1. So o1 and o2 are same. So again, no intersection.\n\nBetween line 2 and line 3: (2,0) to (0,3) and (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck if they cross.\n\np1 is (2,0), q1 is (0,3). p2 is (3,1), q2 is (2,2).\n\nCompute o1 = ccw(p1, q1, p2) → (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) → (-2)*(1) - 3*(1) → -2 -3 = -5 → -1.\n\no2 = ccw(p1, q1, q2) → (0-2)*(2-0) - (3-0)*(2-2) → (-2)*(2) -3*(0) → -4 → -1. So same again. So no cross. Hence, the permutation is valid.\n\nSo the sample input returns yes.\n\nIn the second example, R=2, B=1. So output is No.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nWe need to read the input. For example, in the first sample input, the input is given as:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two separate inputs? Or perhaps the first input is for the first test case and the second is for the second test case. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as per the problem. For example, the first sample input shows two test cases. However, the problem's input format is unclear. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers R and B. Then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nBut the sample input shows something like:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nBut perhaps this is a list of two test cases, but the actual code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is as per the first paragraph. So, the code should read from stdin a single test case. However, the sample shows two test cases. But perhaps that's just an example of the input format for the problem. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nOutput:\n\n['Yes', 'No']\n\nBut this is probably a way to represent two test cases. However, the actual code should read from standard input, which would be a single test case. Or perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? But the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that the input is given as per the first paragraph. The sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's part of the example. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code should process a single test case. But the sample shows two test cases. This is confusing. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user says that the input is given as follows. For example, the first sample input is given as a list of strings. But in reality, the code should read from stdin. So, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement isn't clear. However, looking at the sample input and output, it's likely that the code is supposed to process a single test case. Because the problem says that the input is given as per the first paragraph. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases until EOF. However, the problem's note says that the sample input is given as a list, but that's probably for the purpose of the example. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSample Output: Yes\n\nSecond test case input:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSample Output: No\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So, the code should read R and B, then read R lines of spaceships, then B lines of bases. So, for each test case.\n\nBut how many test cases are there? The problem says that the code should read from stdin. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's sample shows two test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains R and B. So, perhaps the code should process a single test case. However, the sample shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input format is not clear. However, looking back at the problem's sample input and output, the user provided the input as a list of two test cases, and the output as a list of two outputs. However, in reality, the code should process one test case. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of two test cases, but in reality, the code should read a single test case. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nThe first line is 3 3, then 3 lines for spaceships, then 3 lines for bases. Then another test case. But in programming competition, the code would read until EOF. So, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original statement says that the code should read input from stdin. So, perhaps the code should read all test cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should output 'Yes' or 'No' for the given input. So, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, but the code's output is two lines. So, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how to know?\n\nLooking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe first input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWhich is two test cases. The output is ['Yes', 'No'].\n\nSo, the code needs to process multiple test cases, each with their own input. However, the problem's input format is not clear. But given that the sample shows multiple test cases, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input format says that the first line contains R and B. So, perhaps the code should read until EOF, processing each test case.\n\nBut how to read the input? Let's assume that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of R and B followed by R lines of spaceships and B lines of bases.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, perhaps the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process each test case accordingly.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample shows two. So, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the problem's sample input, the input is given as two separate test cases. However, the code is supposed to read from stdin. So, for example, the code may read lines until there's no more input.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. Because the problem says that the input is given as per the first paragraph. But the sample shows two test cases. However, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of two test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. For example, the code could read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process each test case.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as two separate test cases. The output is two separate answers. So, the code should process multiple test cases. So, the code should read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to parse that? Let's think.\n\nEach test case starts with R and B. Then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo, the code should process each test case in turn.\n\nSo, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into tokens, and process each test case accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(data):\n\n        R = int(data[ptr])\n\n        B = int(data[ptr+1])\n\n        ptr +=2\n\n        if R != B:\n\n            print(\"No\")\n\n            # skip the rest of the data for this test case\n\n            # skip R + B points\n\n            ptr += 2 * (R + B)\n\n            continue\n\n        # Read R spaceships\n\n        spaceships = []\n\n        for _ in range(R):\n\n            x = int(data[ptr])\n\n            y = int(data[ptr+1])\n\n            spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n\n            ptr +=2\n\n        # Read B bases\n\n        bases = []\n\n        for _ in range(B):\n\n            x = int(data[ptr])\n\n            y = int(data[ptr+1])\n\n            bases.append( (x, y) )\n\n            ptr +=2\n\n        # Now process this test case\n\n        # Generate all permutations of bases\n\n        found = False\n\n        for perm in permutations(bases):\n\n            # Check if all segments in this permutation are non-crossing\n\n            valid = True\n\n            for i in range(R):\n\n                for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n                    # check if segment between spaceships[i] and perm[i] intersects with segment between spaceships[j] and perm[j]\n\n                    if segments_intersect(spaceships[i], perm[i], spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n\n                        valid = False\n\n                        break\n\n                if not valid:\n\n                    break\n\n            if valid:\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n        if found:\n\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"No\")\n\nBut this code reads all data into a list of tokens. Then, for each test case, reads R and B, then reads R * 2 and B * 2 tokens.\n\nBut this is assuming that the input is given as a sequence of integers, with each line's numbers separated by whitespace. So, for example, the input is read as a list of tokens, split by whitespace.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case's input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich would be split into tokens as [3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, -2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 2].\n\nThen the next test case is 2 1, etc.\n\nThis approach should work.\n\nBut the code needs to handle the case where R and B are not equal, and skip the rest of the data for that test case.\n\nBut what if the input is given with multiple test cases, and each test case's data is read properly?\n\nNow, the code for segments_intersect and ccw.\n\nBut the code for the functions is as discussed earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut in Python, permutations returns tuples of the elements. For example, if bases is a list of tuples, then permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input:\n\nIn the first test case, R=3, B=3. So, the code generates all permutations of the bases. For each permutation, check if the segments don't cross.\n\nNow, the code for the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut in the code, the function segments_intersect is called with four points: p1, q1, p2, q2.\n\nBut in the code, the function is written as:\n\ndef ccw(p, q, r):\n\n    # returns 1 if counter-clockwise, -1 if clockwise, 0 if colinear\n\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n\n    if val > 0:\n\n        return 1\n\n    elif val < 0:\n\n        return -1\n\n    else:\n\n        return 0\n\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n\n    # Check if the segments p1q1 and p2q2 intersect\n\n    # Using the orientation method\n\n    # Since no three points are colinear, we don't need to handle that case\n\n    # So, check if the orientations are different\n\n    o1 = ccw(p1, q1, p2)\n\n    o2 = ccw(p1, q1, q2)\n\n    o3 = ccw(p2, q2, p1)\n\n    o4 = ccw(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # If the orientations are different for both pairs, then they intersect\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n\n        return True\n\n    else:\n\n        return False\n\nBut this code is not correct. Because the condition (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4) is necessary and sufficient for the segments to intersect. But perhaps I should check if the orientations are different. Let me check.\n\nThe standard condition for two segments AB and CD to intersect is that:\n\n- Points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nWhich is equivalent to (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4).\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the functions should be included.\n\nPutting it all together, the code would look like:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef ccw(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val > 0:\n        return 1\n    elif val < 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    o1 = ccw(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = ccw(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = ccw(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = ccw(p2, q2, q1)\n    return (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4)\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(data):\n        R = int(data[ptr])\n        B = int(data[ptr+1])\n        ptr +=2\n        if R != B:\n            print(\"No\")\n            # Skip the rest of the data for this test case\n            ptr += 2*(R + B)\n            continue\n        # Read R spaceships\n        spaceships = []\n        for _ in range(R):\n            x = int(data[ptr])\n            y = int(data[ptr+1])\n            spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n            ptr +=2\n        # Read B bases\n        bases = []\n        for _ in range(B):\n            x = int(data[ptr])\n            y = int(data[ptr+1])\n            bases.append( (x, y) )\n            ptr +=2\n        # Check for possible permutation\n        found = False\n        for perm in permutations(bases):\n            valid = True\n            for i in range(R):\n                for j in range(i+1, R):\n                    if segments_intersect(spaceships[i], perm[i], spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                if not valid:\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                found = True\n                break\n        print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the code, the permutations are generated for the bases. But bases is a list of B elements. So, when R = B, it's okay. For example, if R=3, B=3, then permutations(bases) is all possible orderings of the B elements, which is 3! permutations.\n\nBut for the code, the 'perm' is a tuple of the B elements, and for each i in 0..R-1, perm[i] is the base assigned to spaceship i.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe code would generate permutations of the bases, which are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)] in some order. One of the permutations is the same as the order in which the bases are read. For that permutation, the code checks all pairs of segments. As discussed, they do not cross. So, 'found' becomes True, and output 'Yes'.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nIn this case, R=2, B=1. So, R != B, output 'No'.\n\nSo, the code would output 'No'.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle the sample cases correctly.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple test cases?\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nSpaceships: (0,0), (2,2)\n\nBases: (0,1), (2,1).\n\nPossible permutations: [(0,1), (2,1)] and [(2,1), (0,1)].\n\nCheck for the first permutation:\n\nSegments (0,0)-(0,1) and (2,2)-(2,1). These are vertical lines, but they are parallel. They don't cross.\n\nSo, output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother test case where the segments cross:\n\nSpaceships: (0,0), (2,2)\n\nBases: (1,1), (3,3).\n\nPermutations: only one possible (since B=2, R=2). Assign (0,0) to (1,1), and (2,2) to (3,3). The segments are from (0,0) to (1,1), and (2,2) to (3,3). These are parallel and don't cross. So output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother test case where the segments cross:\n\nSpaceships: (0,0), (3,3)\n\nBases: (1,2), (2,1).\n\nCheck permutations. Let's take the permutation [(1,2), (2,1)].\n\nSegments: (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute.\n\np1 = (0,0), q1 = (1,2)\n\np2 = (3,3), q2 = (2,1)\n\nccw(p1, q1, p2) → (1-0)*(3-0) - (2-0)*(3-0) → (1)(3) - 2*3 → 3 -6 = -3 → -1.\n\nccw(p1, q1, q2) → (1-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) → 1*1 - 2*2 → 1-4 = -3 → -1. So o1 and o2 are same. So the segments don't cross.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-c",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base and vice versa, and no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect in the 2D plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If not, output \"No\" immediately as a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For valid cases where R equals B, generate all permutations of the bases. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of bases to spaceships.\n3. **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation, check if any pair of connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. This is done using the cross product method to determine the orientation of points, which helps in checking if two line segments intersect.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef ccw(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val > 0:\n        return 1\n    elif val < 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    o1 = ccw(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = ccw(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = ccw(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = ccw(p2, q2, q1)\n    return (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4)\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(data):\n        R = int(data[ptr])\n        B = int(data[ptr+1])\n        ptr += 2\n        if R != B:\n            print(\"No\")\n            ptr += 2 * (R + B)\n            continue\n        spaceships = []\n        for _ in range(R):\n            x = int(data[ptr])\n            y = int(data[ptr+1])\n            spaceships.append((x, y))\n            ptr += 2\n        bases = []\n        for _ in range(B):\n            x = int(data[ptr])\n            y = int(data[ptr+1])\n            bases.append((x, y))\n            ptr += 2\n        found = False\n        for perm in permutations(bases):\n            valid = True\n            for i in range(R):\n                for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                    if segments_intersect(spaceships[i], perm[i], spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                if not valid:\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                found = True\n                break\n        print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into tokens for easier processing.\n2. **Checking Validity**: For each test case, we first check if the number of spaceships and bases are equal. If not, we skip further processing for that test case.\n3. **Permutations and Intersection Check**: For valid cases, we generate all permutations of bases and check each permutation for non-intersecting lines. The `segments_intersect` function uses the cross product method to determine if two line segments intersect by checking their orientations.\n4. **Output Result**: If any permutation is found where no lines intersect, we print \"Yes\"; otherwise, we print \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible assignments efficiently given the constraints (R and B up to 10), leveraging permutations and geometric checks to determine the solution.",
