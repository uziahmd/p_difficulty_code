The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of his sequence. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of his sequence. Then, for each round, determine who wins, and increment their respective counts.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. That would take way too long. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, the key is to find the number of rounds where Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Let's think about how to compute this efficiently.\n\nFirst, let's note that the sequences A and B repeat periodically. So the pattern of moves between the two players will repeat after some period. The period would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so the same moves will be repeated again.\n\nSo, the idea is to compute the number of rounds in each full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, and then multiply by the number of such full cycles in n rounds. Then, handle the remaining rounds after those full cycles.\n\nBut first, let's calculate the LCM of m and k. How to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a * b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but that returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nOnce I have the LCM, let's call it T. Then, the total number of full cycles is q = n // T, and the remainder is r = n % T. For each full cycle, I can compute how many times Nikephoros loses (countA) and Polycarpus loses (countB). Then, multiply these by q. Then, process the first r rounds of the next cycle.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n2. For each of the T rounds, simulate the moves and count how many times each loses. Let's call these per_cycle_A and per_cycle_B.\n3. The total number of full cycles is q = n // T. So total_A += q * per_cycle_A, same for B.\n4. Then, process the remaining r = n % T rounds, adding to the totals.\n\nBut wait, what if T is larger than n? Then q is zero, and we just process the first n rounds. So this approach works regardless.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute per_cycle_A and per_cycle_B. For that, we need to simulate T rounds. But since m and k are up to 1000, T could be up to 1000*1000 = 1e6. Which is manageable, because even for T=1e6, processing each of the T rounds is O(T) time, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the plan is feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Read n, A, B. m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n- Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n\n- Compute for each of the T rounds, what the moves are for A and B. Then compare them, and count how many times each loses.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round in the T rounds?\n\nFor each round i in 0..T-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen, compare a_move and b_move. Determine who wins.\n\nSo for each such pair, we can compute whether Nikephoros (A) loses, or Polycarpus (B) loses, or it's a draw.\n\nSo for each of the T rounds, we can compute the number of losses for each. Then multiply by q (number of full cycles), and add the number from the remaining r rounds.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the number of losses in the first r rounds of the cycle.\n\nSo, let's proceed with code steps.\n\nFirst, compute the GCD and LCM.\n\nBut wait, in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor, but for Python 3.5 and above, math.gcd exists. Also, since m and k can be up to 1000, their product is up to 1e6, so LCM can be up to 1e6.\n\nSo",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both Nikephoros and Polycarpus after playing rock-paper-scissors for `n` rounds, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when `n` is very large (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Patterns**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The key insight is that the pattern of moves repeats every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to break the problem into manageable cycles.\n2. **Efficient Simulation**: Instead of simulating all `n` rounds directly, which is infeasible for large `n`, we simulate one full cycle of moves determined by the LCM of the sequence lengths. We then use this cycle to compute the number of losses for each player over all rounds.\n3. **Handling Large Values**: By calculating the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds, we can efficiently compute the total number of losses using the results from one cycle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full cycle of T rounds\n    countA = 0  # number of times Nikephoros loses\n    countB = 0  # number of times Polycarpus loses\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            countB += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            countA += 1\n    \n    # Number of full cycles\n    q = n // T\n    # Remaining rounds\n    r = n % T\n    \n    totalA = q * countA\n    totalB = q * countB\n    \n    # Process the remaining r rounds\n    for i in range(r):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            totalB += 1\n        else:\n            totalA += 1\n    \n    print(totalA, totalB)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read, including the number of rounds `n` and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is calculated to determine the cycle length after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For one full cycle (determined by the LCM), we simulate each round to count how many times each player loses.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles and the remaining rounds are calculated. The losses from full cycles are multiplied by the number of cycles, and the remaining rounds are simulated separately.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses for each player is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle large values of `n` efficiently by leveraging the repeating nature of the move sequences, reducing the complexity from O(n) to O(LCM(m, k)), which is feasible given the constraints.",
