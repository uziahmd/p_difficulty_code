The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The input gives me n, then the sequences A and B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), I need to determine what move each player makes. Then check who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round step by step is impossible. Need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, and compute the number of wins in each cycle, then multiply by the number of cycles and add the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think: For each round, the move of Nikephoros is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo the problem is to find for each round from 0 to n-1, the moves of each player, determine who wins, and count the losses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't iterate through all rounds. So we need to find the number of times each possible pair of moves occurs over the n rounds, then calculate the total losses based on that.\n\nBut how do we find the number of times each (a, b) pair occurs?\n\nThe sequences A and B are cyclic. So the combined sequence of moves for both players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so the pattern of their moves will repeat.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call this period_length. For example, if m=3 and k=4, LCM(3,4)=12. So in each period of 12 rounds, the same pairs of moves occur again.\n\nThen, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period_length, and the remaining rounds are remainder = n % period_length.\n\nFor each full period, we can precompute how many times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Then multiply those counts by total_periods. Then, for the remaining remainder rounds, compute the counts directly.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length.\n\n2. Precompute for each of the period_length rounds, what the moves are for A and B, and for each round, determine who wins. Then sum up the number of times Nikephoros loses (count_n) and Polycarpus loses (count_p) in one period.\n\n3. Multiply count_n and count_p by total_periods.\n\n4. Then, process the remaining remainder rounds (from 0 to remainder-1) and add their contributions to the totals.\n\nBut how do I compute the LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So first, compute the GCD of m and k. Then compute LCM.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each round in the period_length, the moves. But since m and k can be up to 1000, period_length can be up to 1e6 (since 1000 * 1000 = 1e6). Which is manageable because even for 1e6 rounds, processing them once is feasible.\n\nSo for example, if m and k are 1000 each, LCM could be up to 1e6, and processing 1e6 rounds is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length.\n\nCompute for each round in 0..period_length-1:\n\nA_move = A[round % m]\n\nB_move = B[round % k]\n\nCheck who wins, and increment count_n and count_p accordingly.\n\nOnce we have the counts per period, multiply by total_periods (number of full periods in n rounds), then process the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the number of full periods and the remainder.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e9. So for example, if period_length is 1e6, then total_periods could be up to 2e9 / 1e6 = 2000. So the total processing is manageable.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute GCD(m, k), then LCM.\n\nCompute period_length = LCM(m, k).\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results for a very large number of rounds (up to 2 billion) without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. This means their move sequences repeat after certain intervals. The combined sequence of moves for both players will repeat every Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their individual sequences.\n2. **Period Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This gives the period after which the combined sequence of moves repeats.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period, determine the moves of both players and count the losses for each player.\n4. **Full Periods and Remainder**: Calculate how many full periods fit into the total number of rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute GCD\n    gcd = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // gcd\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one period\n    count_n = 0\n    count_p = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            count_p += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            count_n += 1\n    \n    total_periods = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    total_n = count_n * total_periods\n    total_p = count_p * total_periods\n    \n    # Process the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_p += 1\n        else:\n            total_n += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_n} {total_p}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is calculated to determine the period after which the move sequences repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within one period, the moves of both players are determined. The outcome of each round is checked to update the loss counts for each player.\n4. **Handling Full Periods and Remainder**: The number of full periods and the remaining rounds are computed. The loss counts from full periods are multiplied by the number of periods, and the remaining rounds are processed individually to get the final counts.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the move sequences, ensuring that the solution is computed in a feasible time frame.",
