The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task to the next, considering the order of the tasks. Since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the order given.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. For each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time taken to get from the current position to the next task's position. But since the ringroad is circular, moving clockwise, the distance between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nFor example, if she's at position current and needs to go to position next, the time taken is (next - current) mod n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Wait, because if current is 3 and next is 2 in a 4-house setup, moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. So the formula for the distance between current and next (when moving clockwise) is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Or more simply, (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is less than current, then the distance is (n - current + next). For example, current is 3, next is 2: n=4. 4-3 +2 = 3. Which is correct. So the formula for the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Alternatively, (next - current) % n? Let's check. For next=2, current=3: (2-3) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So yes, (next - current) % n gives the correct distance. But wait, when next is larger than current, say current=1, next=3, n=4. (3-1) mod 4 is 2, which is correct. So yes, that formula works.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that movement is clockwise, so the time between current and next is (next - current) if next is >= current, else (next - current + n). Which is equivalent to (next - current) % n if the mod is positive. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator can return negative results. Wait, no. Wait, in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So (next - current) % n would give the correct number of steps. So that's the way to compute the distance between two consecutive positions.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Start at position 1.\n\n- For each task in the order given, compute the time needed to get from the current position to the task's position, add that to the total time, then update the current position to the task's position.\n\nBut wait, the tasks may have multiple consecutive entries. For example, if the tasks are [3, 3, 3], then after the first task, the next tasks are already in the same position, so no time is added. So the code needs to process each task in order, and for each step, compute the distance from the previous position to the current task's position.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nfor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n   compute distance between current_position and a_i.\n\n   add that distance to total_time.\n\n   set current_position = a_i.\n\nSo that's the plan. Now, the problem is to implement this correctly.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, tasks are [3,2,3]\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance from 1 to 3: (3-1) = 2. So total time is 2. Current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. So total time is 2+3=5. Current position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3 is 1. Total time is 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nAnother sample input is '4 3\\n2 3 3'. Output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2. Distance is 1. Time is 1. Position is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3. Distance is 1. Time becomes 2. Position is 3.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance is 0. Time remains 2. So output is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read n and m, then the list of a_i's.\n\nBut note that the input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m, the second line has m integers.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'] — but that's probably for testing. So for the code, the input is read from stdin. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and m, second line is m integers.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be something like:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen process as per the steps.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nWe can read the inputs via input().split().\n\nBut in some cases, the second line may have leading or trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace is okay.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a as list of integers.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each num in a:\n\n   distance = (num - current) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current = num\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nWait, but wait: (num - current) mod n?\n\nYes. Because for example, when current is 3, num is 2, n is 4. (2-3) is -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result when the denominator is positive. So yes.\n\nBut let's check with some examples.\n\nAnother example: current is 4, num is 1, n=4. (1-4) is -3 mod 4 is 1. Which is correct, since moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, what about the edge cases?\n\nCase when n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then the time is 0. Because she starts at 1, and the task is already there.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a = [1, 2]. Then the first step is 0 (current is 1, move to 1). Then from 1 to 2: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. So total time is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a = [2, 1]. So first step is (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Then from 2 to 1: (1-2) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1. Total time is 2.\n\nWhich is correct. Because moving from 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (another step).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list of a's.\n\nBut in Python, for reading inputs, sometimes when using multiple test cases, but in this problem, the input is a single test case. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as two lines. So for example, the first sample input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be read as n=4, m=3, and the list is [3,2,3].\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead first line as n and m.\n\nRead second line as list of m integers.\n\nThen process as per the steps.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when the list is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. Because in the input constraints, m is 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: (3-1) mod 4 = 2 → total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod 4 → -1 mod4 = 3 → total 5. current is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1 → total 6. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: 4 3, a is [2,3,3]. Let's see:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst num 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1 → total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond num 3: (3-2) mod4 =1 → total 2. current 3.\n\nThird num 3: (3-3) mod4 =0 → total 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, what about when the same house is repeated multiple times? Like a = [1, 1, 1]. Then the code would add 0 for each step after the first. So the total is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a = [5, 1]. The first step is (5-1) mod5 =4 → total 4. Then from 5 to 1: (1-5) mod5 = -4 mod5 = 1. So total is 4+1=5. Which is correct: moving from 1→5 is 4 steps (clockwise), then 5→1 is 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key challenge is to compute the time taken to move between consecutive tasks in the given order, considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and moves clockwise. Each move between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. The movement between two houses can be calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n2. **Task Order**: Each task must be completed in the given order. For each task, we compute the time required to move from the current position to the task's house.\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: The distance between two houses `current` and `next` on a ringroad with `n` houses is calculated as `(next - current) % n`. This ensures that moving from a higher-numbered house to a lower-numbered one (clockwise) is correctly handled.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of task positions.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `total_time` initialized to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task position in the list:\n   - Calculate the time required to move from the current house to the task's house using modulo arithmetic.\n   - Update the total time and current position after each task.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total accumulated time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle circular movements, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(m), which is suitable given the problem constraints.",
