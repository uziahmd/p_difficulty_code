The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise. How many steps? Well, since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Then she does task 1. Then task 2 is at 2. But she's currently at 3. So moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Then task 2 is done. Then task 3 is at 3 again. She's at 2, so moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach here is to track Xenia's current position and accumulate the time taken to move from her current position to the next task's house, considering the clockwise direction.\n\nBut how to compute the steps between two positions?\n\nLet's think: For two positions current and next, the number of steps needed to move clockwise from current to next is (next - current) mod n if next >= current? Wait, no. Because if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - current + next) steps. For example, n=4, current=3, next=2: steps are 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) mod 4? Let's see: (2 -3) = -1, mod 4 is 3. So yes. So the formula for steps between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). But that's equivalent to (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is less than current, then (next - current) is negative, and mod n would give the correct positive value. For example, (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 which is 3. So yes, the number of steps is (next - current) % n. But wait, if next is equal to current, then the steps are zero.\n\nWait, but in the case where current is 3 and next is 3, the steps are zero. So the formula (next - current) mod n would be zero. Correct.\n\nSo the steps between current and next is (next - current) mod n. But wait, in the first example, when moving from 1 to 3, (3-1) mod 4 is 2, which is correct. Then moving from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod 4 is 3, which is correct. Then from 2 to 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1. Correct. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize current position as 1 (since she starts there).\n- For each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n   - Compute the steps from current to a_i using the formula (a_i - current) % n.\n   - Add that to the total time.\n   - Update current to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the steps between them would be zero. So that's handled correctly by the formula.\n\nSo for example, in the second example input: 4 3, tasks are [2,3,3]. Let's see:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps (2-1) mod 4 = 1. Total time is 1. Now current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: steps (3-2) mod 4 = 1. Total time is 2. Now current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps (3-3) mod 4 = 0. Total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nYes. So this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read n and m, then the list of a_i's. Then process each a_i in order, accumulating the steps.\n\nBut wait, what about the initial position? Let's make sure that the initial position is 1, and then for each task in order, compute the steps from current to a_i, add to total, then set current to a_i.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the list of m integers as a list.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each a in the list:\n\n   delta = (a - current) % n\n\n   total_time += delta\n\n   current = a\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nWait, but let's test with the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, list is [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond a is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3. total becomes 2+3=5. current is 2.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1. total is 5+1=6. Correct.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 4 3, list [2,3,3]. Let's see:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst a is 2: (2-1) mod 4 =1 → total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond a is 3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1 → total 2. current 3.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-3)=0 → total 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then steps is (1-1) mod 2 =0. So total is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Steps from 1 to 1: 0. Then from 1 to 2: (2-1) mod 2 =1. Total 1.\n\nAnother case: n=5, current is 5, next is 1. Steps (1-5) mod5 = (-4 mod5)=1. Which is correct: moving clockwise from 5 to 1 is 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead input. The first line has n and m. The second line has m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as two separate examples. But the problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the user provided two examples, but the code is supposed to handle one input at a time. So the code should read the first line as n and m, then the second line as the list of m integers.\n\nSo in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and m.\n\nRead the second line, split into m integers.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list a.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? Well, according to the constraints, m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]. The code gives 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]. Code gives 1+1+0=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Output is 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut note that in Python, the modulo operation can return negative results if the numerator is negative. Wait, no. In Python, the modulo returns a result with the same sign as the denominator. For example, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So (num - current) can be negative, but mod n will give the correct steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nRead input:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nLet me check for the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nThe code processes 3, 2, 3.\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst delta (3-1) mod4 = 2. total 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nNext delta (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4 = 3. total 5.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nNext delta (3-2) mod4 = 1. total 6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nFirst delta (2-1) mod4 = 1. total 1.\n\ncurrent 2.\n\nNext (3-2) mod4 =1. total 2. current 3.\n\nNext (3-3) mod4=0. total 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time taken to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time.\n2. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise from one house to another can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. The formula `(next_house - current_house) % n` gives the number of steps required to move clockwise from the current house to the next house.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in the sequence, compute the steps needed from the current position to the task's house, accumulate the total time, and update the current position to the task's house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n    total_time += delta\n    current = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The second line contains `m` integers representing the sequence of tasks.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task in the sequence:\n   - Calculate the number of steps required to move from the current house to the task's house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n   - Add the calculated steps to the total time.\n   - Update the current position to the task's house.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
