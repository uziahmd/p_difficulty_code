    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe plate is divided into w rows and h columns. The gilded rings are added starting from the edge. The first ring is the outermost layer, then each subsequent ring is two cells inward. Each ring is one cell thick. The i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring takes away two cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle would be 4 less in both width and height. Because for example, the first ring is around the original rectangle. Then the next ring is 2 cells in from each edge, which would make the inner rectangle's width and height reduced by 4 (since 2 from each side).\n\nBut how do we calculate the number of cells in each ring?\n\nFor a rectangle of size W x H, the perimeter (the border cells) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) minus 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait, let me think again. For example, a 3x3 rectangle. The perimeter cells are the outermost layer. How many cells? The total cells in the perimeter would be 3*4 - 4 (since each side has 3 cells, but the corners are counted twice). Wait, 3*4 would count each corner twice. So subtracting 4 (the four corners) gives 3*4 - 4 = 8. Which matches the first example input where 3x3 with 1 ring gives 8 cells. So that formula seems right.\n\nSo for a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in its border is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because 2*(W + H) counts each side once, but subtracts 4 because the four corners are counted twice. Wait, maybe another way: the perimeter is (W * 2) + (H - 2)*2. Because top and bottom are W cells each, and the left and right are (H-2) each (since top and bottom are already counted). So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2W + 2H -4 = 2(W + H) -4. Yes.\n\nSo for each ring i, we need to calculate this perimeter for the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all these perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each subsequent ring, the dimensions of the rectangle must be at least 3x3? Or maybe not. Because the problem says that k is given such that it's valid. The constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3, you can have one ring. For a 7x7, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So two rings. Let me check: first ring is 7x7, then next is 7-4*(2-1) = 3. So 3x3. So that's valid. So the formula for the i-th ring is that the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). But for each i, this must be valid. So the problem ensures that for the given k, each of these rectangles is at least 3x3? Or perhaps even smaller? Wait, no. Because for example, if the original w and h are 5 and 5, and k is 1. Then the first ring is 5x5. The next ring would be 5-4=1, but that's 1x1. But since k is given as floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ), for min(w,h)=5, (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the problem ensures that for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions of the rectangle for the i-th ring are at least 3x3? Or maybe not. Wait, let's take the case when w and h are 7 and 7, and k is 2. Then for i=1, the rectangle is 7x7. For i=2, it's 7-4*(2-1) = 3, so 3x3. Which is valid. So for each i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). But for that rectangle, the width and height must be at least 3? Well, the problem says that the input k is valid. So the code doesn't need to check that. So the code can just compute for each i from 1 to k, the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum them all.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each ring from 1 to k:\n\n   - Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute perimeter: 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   - add to total.\n\nBut wait, let me check the example.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So current_w and current_h are 3 and 3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So current_w is 7, current_h is 9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9 - 2) = 2*14 = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example is 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9: 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring: i=2, current_w is 7 - 4*(1) = 3, current_h is 9 -4*(1) = 5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k. Then for each i in 1..k, compute current_w and current_h, then compute 2*(current_w + current_h - 2), sum all those.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Well, according to the problem statement, the input k is such that it's valid. So the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me think for example: if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, current_w is 3, current_h is h (which is >=3). So the code is okay.\n\nAnother example: if w=7, h=7, k=2. Then for i=2, current_w is 7 - 4*(1) = 3, current_h is same. So perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then compute the sum.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single line with three integers. For example, in the sample input, the three examples are given as ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2'].\n\nBut the code should read from stdin. So for each test case, read a line, split into w, h, k.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three integers. So in the code, perhaps the code reads a single line, splits into three parts.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the sum as explained.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the current_w or current_h is less than 3? Well, according to the problem statement, the input k is valid. So the code doesn't need to handle that. So this code should work.\n\nLet me test another example. Suppose w=7, h=7, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=7. perimeter is 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. i=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. total is 24+8=32. So for input 7 7 2, output is 32.\n\nAnother example: input 5 5 1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. So output is 16.\n\nAnother example: input 5 5 2. Let's see. For i=1, current_w=5, current_h=5. perimeter 2*(5+5-2)= 16. For i=2, current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. But then perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0. So total is 16 + 0 = 16. But according to the problem's constraints, k is floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). For w=5, h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code will not receive such input. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is added starting from the edge of the plate and moving inward, with each subsequent ring being two cells away from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each gilded ring is formed by the border cells of an inner rectangle. The first ring is the outermost layer, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. The width and height of each subsequent inner rectangle decrease by 4 units (2 units from each side) compared to the previous one.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is equivalent to the perimeter of the corresponding inner rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is calculated as `2 * (w + h - 2)`.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the corresponding inner rectangle, calculate its perimeter, and accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the adjusted width and height of the inner rectangle by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from the original dimensions.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)` and sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the given constraints.",
