The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, right. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is calculated as 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's border would be 2*(3+3-2) = 8 cells. Which matches the first example input where 3 3 1 gives 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), I need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w', h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the previous. Wait, the first ring is the edge. The second is two cells in, so that would require that the dimensions are big enough. For example, for the second ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(1)) by (h - 4*(1)), because i starts at 1. So for i-th ring, it's 4*(i-1) subtracted from each dimension.\n\nBut how do I make sure that each ring is valid? Well, the problem says that k is given such that it's allowed. So the input ensures that for the given w, h, and k, all rings are possible. So I don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the plan is: for each of the k rings, calculate the perimeter of the current rectangle, add them all up.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\nsum += perimeter\n\nWait, but let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So i=1:\n\ncurrent_w = 3 - 0 =3, current_h same. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9, perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring: i=2, subtract 4*(1) from each dimension. So 7-4=3, 9-4=5. Then perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the third example. So that seems right.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k. Then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i, the current_w and current_h, compute the perimeter, sum all.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then compute the sum.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for another case. Let's say k=2, and the dimensions are 7 and 9. As in the third example. So yes, 28 + 12=40. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if k is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nWhat about when the dimensions are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1), the current_w and current_h are valid? Well, the problem says that k is given such that it's allowed. So for example, for w and h being 3, k can be 1. For 7 and 9, k can be up to floor( (min(7,9)+1)/4 ) = floor( (7+1)/4 ) = 2. Which matches the third example.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nLet me test another case. Let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\nFirst ring: 5x5. perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Second ring: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, that's a problem. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle. But if the rectangle is 1x1, then the border is zero? Because the perimeter would be 2*(1+1-2) = 0. So adding that. So for example, if k=2, then the sum would be 16 + 0 = 16?\n\nBut according to the problem's constraints, the k is up to floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For w=5, h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the input would not allow that. So in the code, the input is guaranteed to have valid k. So in that case, when the code is given k=2, the code would process it, but the problem says that the input is valid.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code should work. Let me check the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Which is correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as written.\n",
