There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays the second game, the other player (player 3) has zero games played. The difference is 1 (since the winner has already played 1 game). So that's allowed. So the answer is 2. For n=4, the sample says the answer is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play three games? Let's see. Let's imagine the structure. If the winner plays three games, that would require that each time they play, their opponent has either the same number of games or differs by one. Let's think: for example, the first game, the winner plays against someone (say player 2), then in the next game, they have to play against someone who has either 0 or 1 games. Suppose they beat player 3 in the second game. Then for the third game, they need an opponent who has either 1 or 2 games. But the remaining players would be player 4, who hasn't played yet. So the difference would be 2 (the winner has 2 games, the opponent has 0). Which is not allowed. Hence, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of games possible for the winner, given the constraints on how the matches are arranged.\n\nLet me think about the general approach. The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by how many times they can be matched against opponents with the required game counts.\n\nThis seems similar to building a binary tree structure. Because in a knockout tournament, each game eliminates one player, so the total number of games is n-1. But the question is about the maximum number of games the winner can have. \n\nWait, but the structure of the tournament affects this. For example, in a standard single-elimination tournament with n players, the winner plays log2(n) games if n is a power of two. But when n isn't a power of two, the winner might have to play more games? Or maybe not. Wait, no. For example, if there are 3 players, the winner plays two games. For 4 players, it's two games. For 5 players, perhaps the winner can play three games?\n\nWait, let's think. Let's take n=5. How can we arrange the matches so that the winner plays as many games as possible?\n\nLet me think. Let's say the winner plays in each round against opponents that have as many games as possible. Let's imagine the process:\n\nThe first game, the winner plays against someone. They have 0 games each. So that's allowed. After winning, they have 1 game. Next, they need to play against someone who has either 0 or 1 games. Suppose they play against another player who has 0 games. Then after that, the winner has 2 games. Now, for the third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. Let's see: how many players are left? Let's think about the structure. Initially, there are 5 players. The first game between winner and player 2. Then, the winner plays against player 3. Then, the winner needs to play against someone else. But the other players would be player 4, 5, and maybe others. Wait, but each game eliminates someone. So after the first two games, two players have been eliminated (player 2 and 3). But the winner has played two games. Now, the next game requires that the opponent has either 1 or 2 games. Let's say the winner plays against someone who has 1 game. How can that happen? Maybe that player had to play once before. For example, maybe there was a previous match between player 4 and 5, where one of them lost. So the winner (player 1) would play against the winner of that match (say player 4). Then, player 4 has 1 game. The difference is 2-1 = 1, which is allowed. So the winner can play a third game. Then, after that, the winner has 3 games. But then, how many players are left? After three games, the winner would have beaten three players, so there are 5 - 3 = 2 players left (the winner and the last one). But then, the next game would require that the opponent has either 2 or 3 games. But the other player has only 1 game (if they were in a previous match). Wait, maybe this is getting complicated. Let me try to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is equal to the floor of log2(n) ? Or maybe something else. Let's look for a pattern.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nn | output\n2 → 1\n3 → 2\n4 → 2\n5 → ?\nLet's think for n=5. What is the maximum possible?\n\nIf the answer is 2, then the sample for n=3 would be 2, which is correct. But maybe for n=5, the answer is 3?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is the largest k such that the sum of the first k numbers is less than or equal to n-1. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea. The maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the (k+1)th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to n. Because each time the winner plays a game, they have to have opponents that have played either the same number of games or one less. So, for the winner to play k games, they must have opponents in each round that are structured in a way that allows that.\n\nWait, maybe this is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, let's think recursively. Let's say that to have a winner play k games, the number of players required is the sum of the players needed for each of the previous steps. For example, for the first game, you need 2 players. For the second game, the winner has to have played one game, and the opponent can have 0 or 1. If the opponent has 0, then you need another 2 players. But perhaps the total is 2 + 1 = 3. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nLet me think of f(k) as the minimum number of players required to have a winner play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, in the first game, he plays against someone. Then, for the next game, he needs to have an opponent who has played 0 or 1 games. To maximize the number of games, the opponent should have played 1 game. So that requires that there's another player who has played 1 game. Which implies that that player has already played once. So, for the second game, the winner has to have played once, and the opponent has played once. So to get that, the opponent must have been in a previous match. So, the number of players required for the winner to play k games would be f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, for the winner's k-th game, he has to have an opponent who has played k-1 games (so that the difference is 0). But that opponent must have come from a subtree where they played k-1 games. But to get that, perhaps the structure is like a Fibonacci tree. \n\nWait, for example:\n\nFor k=1, the minimum number of players is 2 (two players play once).\n\nFor k=2, the winner plays two games. The first game is against one player. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played 1 game. So that requires that there's another player who has played one game. Which would require that there's a prior match. So the total players would be 2 (for the first game) + 1 (the opponent for the second game, which requires that he has played once. But that requires another match. So for example, the opponent for the second game must have played once, which requires that he had a match. So the total players would be 2 (from the first match) + 2 (for the opponent's match) - 1 (since the opponent is part of the initial players). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, thinking recursively: To have a winner play k games, the first game is against someone. Then, the winner has to play k-1 more games. For each of those, the opponent must have played either k-2 or k-1 games. But to maximize, the opponent would have played k-1 games. So the opponent must have a path of k-1 games. So the total number of players required would be f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because the first game requires f(1) players, and then the second part requires f(k-1) players. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nLet me consider that for the winner to play k games, he must have played in the first game, then in the second, etc. Let's imagine that for each game the winner plays, the opponent must have a certain number of games. So for the first game, the opponent has 0 games. For the second game, the opponent has 1 game. For the third game, the opponent has 2 games. And so on. So the number of players required for each step is the sum of the players required for each of these steps. \n\nFor example, the first game requires 1 opponent. The second game requires that the opponent has 1 game, which requires that he has played once. So that requires that there's a subtree where that opponent has played once. So the number of players required for that is f(1) (the opponent's subtree) plus the winner's subtree. Wait, maybe the total number of players required for the winner to play k games is the sum of the players required for each of the previous steps. \n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let's think:\n\nf(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)\n\nWith base cases f(1)=2, f(2)=3.\n\nWait, for k=1, the minimum number of players is 2. For k=2, the minimum is 3. For k=3, it's 3 + 2 = 5. For k=4, 5 + 3 = 8. And so on. So the sequence is 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. Which is the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 3. \n\nSo, for example, if n is 5, then the maximum k is 3. Because f(3) is 5. So the answer for n=5 is 3. \n\nBut let's check this with the sample input. For example, n=3: the maximum is 2, which matches f(2)=3. So yes. For n=4, the maximum k is 2 because f(2)=3 and f(3)=5. Since 4 is between 3 and 5, the maximum k is 2. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k such that f(k) ≤ n, where f(k) is the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, f(4)=8, etc.\n\nSo the approach is: generate this sequence until the value exceeds n, then take the largest k for which f(k) ≤n.\n\nBut how do we compute this for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think. Let's generate the sequence step by step. For example, starting with a=2 (k=1), b=3 (k=2), then next term is 5 (k=3), then 8 (k=4), then 13, etc. For each term, we check if it's <=n. The maximum k is the largest index where the term is <=n.\n\nSo for example, for n=10, the sequence terms are 2,3,5,8,13. 13 is larger than 10, so the maximum k is 3 (since 8 is <=10). Wait, but the sample input for n=10 gives output 4. Wait wait, sample input for n=10 is output 4. Wait according to this approach, the answer would be 3. But sample says 4. So there's a contradiction here. So my reasoning is wrong. \n\nWait what's the sample input for n=10? The output is 4. So according to that, the maximum number of games is 4. Which suggests that for n=10, the maximum k is 4. But according to the previous logic, the f(4) is 8. Which is <=10. Then f(5) is 13>10. So the maximum k would be 4. Which would be correct. Oh right! Because the sequence is f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, f(4)=8, f(5)=13. So for n=10, the maximum k is 4, since f(4)=8 ≤10, and f(5)=13>10. So the answer is 4. Which matches the sample. So the sample for n=10 is correct. \n\nSo the approach is to find the maximum k such that f(k) ≤n, where f(k) is the sequence defined by f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(k) = f(k-1)+f(k-2).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k for which this holds.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate the sequence until the term exceeds n. Then the maximum k is the index of the last term that is <=n.\n\nFor example, for n=2, the sequence starts with 2, which is f(1). So the answer is 1.\n\nFor n=3, the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the sequence is 2,3,5. So 5 is larger than 4, so the maximum is 2.\n\nFor n=5, the maximum is 3, since 5 is <=5.\n\nFor n=10, the maximum is 4 (since 8<=10, and next term is 13>10).\n\nSo the answer is the k for which f(k) is the largest possible <=n.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: generate the sequence until the next term exceeds n, and track the maximum k.\n\nNow, how to implement this for n up to 1e18?\n\nWell, the sequence grows exponentially. So even for n=1e18, the number of steps is around O(log n), which is manageable.\n\nLet me code this.\n\nLet's think about the steps:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nprev_prev = 2 (f(1))\n\nprev = 3 (f(2))\n\nk starts at 2.\n\nThen, for each step, compute next term as prev + prev_prev.\n\nCheck if next term is <=n. If yes, increment k, and update prev_prev and prev. Else, break.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the initial steps.\n\nFor example, for n=2:\n\nWe start with prev_prev = 2 (k=1), prev=3 (k=2). But 3 is larger than n=2, so the maximum k is 1.\n\nSo the code needs to handle that.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nInitialize:\n\nif n < 2: not possible (since n >=2 per input constraints)\n\nElse:\n\nmax_k = 0\n\nWe can track the sequence as follows:\n\na = 2 (f(1)), b = 3 (f(2)), current_k = 2.\n\nif n >=2, then max_k is at least 1.\n\nif n >=3, then max_k is at least 2.\n\nThen, while the next term (a + b) is <=n:\n\ncurrent_k +=1\n\na, b = b, a + b\n\nSo, for example, for n=10:\n\nInitial a=2, b=3, current_k=2.\n\nnext term is 2+3=5 <=10 → current_k becomes 3, a=3, b=5.\n\nnext term is 3+5=8 <=10 → current_k becomes 4, a=5, b=8.\n\nnext term is 5+8=13 >10 → stop. So the answer is 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n ==1: impossible (but input is n≥2).\n\nInitialize a=2, b=3, k=2.\n\nif n <2: impossible.\n\nelse:\n\nif n >=2, then the answer is at least 1.\n\nif n >=3, then answer is at least 2.\n\nthen, while True:\n\ncompute next = a + b.\n\nif next <=n:\n\nk +=1\n\na, b = b, next\n\nelse:\n\nbreak.\n\nthen return k.\n\nWait, but let's check for n=2:\n\nInitially, a=2, b=3, k=2.\n\nnext = 2+3=5>2 → break. So the answer is 2? But for n=2, the answer is 1. So there's a problem here.\n\nAh, because the code starts with k=2, but for n=2, the maximum k is 1.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe initial values are:\n\nf(1) = 2 → corresponds to k=1.\n\nf(2) = 3 → corresponds to k=2.\n\nSo, for n=2, the maximum k is 1. Because f(1)=2 ≤n, and f(2)=3>n.\n\nSo the code should start with a=2 (f(1)), and check if n is >= a. Then, for each step, check if the next term is possible.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nInitialize:\n\nmax_k = 0\n\nif n >=2:\n\nmax_k =1\n\nif n >=3:\n\nmax_k =2\n\nthen, compute the next terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nInitialize a = 2 (f(1)), b = 3 (f(2)), and current_k = 2.\n\nif n < a: then the maximum is 0? But n is ≥2.\n\nWait, for n=2, the maximum is 1.\n\nSo, the code can be:\n\nstart with current_k = 1 if a <=n.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should:\n\nstart with a=2 (f(1)), current_k=1.\n\nthen check if a is <=n. If yes, then proceed.\n\nthen compute next terms.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\na = 2 (f(1)), b = 3 (f(2)), k = 1 (the current maximum k is 1, since a is f(1)).\n\nWait, no. Because if n is 2, then the maximum k is 1. If n is 3, then k is 2. So the code needs to check whether the next terms can be added.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nInitialize:\n\ncurrent_k = 1 (since f(1)=2 is the first term).\n\na = 2 (f(1)), b = 3 (f(2)).\n\nif n >= b:\n\ncurrent_k = 2.\n\nthen, compute next terms.\n\nSo the code:\n\ncurrent_k = 1\n\na = 2\n\nb = 3\n\nif n >= a:\n\n    if n >= b:\n\n        current_k = 2\n\n        while True:\n\n            next_val = a + b\n\n            if next_val <=n:\n\n                current_k +=1\n\n                a, b = b, next_val\n\n            else:\n\n                break\n\n    else:\n\n        pass\n\nelse:\n\n    # n < a, which is 2. But since n >=2, this is only possible for n=2.\n\n    # for n=2, current_k is 1.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is:\n\nInitialize a = 2 (f(1)), b = 3 (f(2)), current_k = 1.\n\nif n >= a:\n\n    current_k = 1\n\n    if n >= b:\n\n        current_k = 2\n\n        while True:\n\n            next_val = a + b\n\n            if next_val <=n:\n\n                current_k +=1\n\n                a, b = b, next_val\n\n            else:\n\n                break\n\n    else:\n\n        pass\n\nBut this seems messy. Alternatively, start with current_k=1, and then check if the next term (b) is <=n. If yes, then current_k increases to 2, and proceed.\n\nLet me code this in steps.\n\nInitialize a=2, b=3, current_k=1.\n\nif n >= a:\n\n   current_k = 1\n\n   if n >=b:\n\n       current_k = 2\n\n       while True:\n\n           next_val = a + b\n\n           if next_val <=n:\n\n               current_k +=1\n\n               a = b\n\n               b = next_val\n\n           else:\n\n               break\n\n   else:\n\n       pass\n\nBut for example, for n=2, the code will check n >=a (2 >=2 is true). Then, check if n >=b (2 >=3 is false). So current_k remains 1. Which is correct.\n\nFor n=3: check n >=a (yes). Then n >=b (3 >=3 yes). current_k is 2. Then compute next_val = 2+3=5. 5>3, so break. So current_k is 2. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: after initializing, current_k is 2. next_val is 5, which is <=5. So current_k becomes 3. a becomes 3, b becomes 5. Then compute next_val = 3+5=8>5. Break. So current_k is 3. Which is correct.\n\nFor n=10:\n\nAfter initializing current_k=2, a=2, b=3.\n\nnext_val = 5 (2+3). 5<=10 → current_k=3, a=3, b=5.\n\nnext_val=3+5=8 <=10 → current_k=4, a=5, b=8.\n\nnext_val=5+8=13>10 → break. So current_k=4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n is 1: impossible (but input is n≥2).\n\nInitialize a = 2, b =3, current_k =1.\n\nif n >= a:\n\n   current_k =1\n\n   if n >=b:\n\n       current_k =2\n\n       while True:\n\n           next_val = a +b\n\n           if next_val <=n:\n\n               current_k +=1\n\n               a, b = b, next_val\n\n           else:\n\n               break\n\n   else:\n\n       pass\n\nelse:\n\n   # n < a (but since n is >=2, this is only possible when n=2)\n\n   current_k =1\n\nBut how to code this in Python?\n\nLet me code this:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(0) # but input is n≥2\n\nelse:\n\n    a = 2\n\n    b = 3\n\n    current_k = 1\n\n    if n >= a:\n\n        current_k = 1\n\n        if n >= b:\n\n            current_k = 2\n\n            while True:\n\n                next_val = a + b\n\n                if next_val <=n:\n\n                    current_k +=1\n\n                    a, b = b, next_val\n\n                else:\n\n                    break\n\n    print(current_k)\n\nWait, let's test for n=2.\n\nn=2:\n\na=2, b=3.\n\nn >=a is true. current_k=1. n >=b is 2 >=3? No. So the code doesn't enter the inner if. So current_k remains 1. Which is correct.\n\nFor n=3: the inner if is entered. current_k becomes 2. Then, next_val is 2+3=5>3. So loop breaks. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nn=4: the inner if is entered. current_k is 2. next_val is 5>4. So loop breaks. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nn=5: next_val is 5, which is <=5. current_k becomes 3. a becomes 3, b becomes 5. Then next_val is 3+5=8>5. So output is 3.\n\nn=10: current_k is 2. Then next_val 5, 8, then 13. So current_k increases to 3, then 4, then breaks. Output 4. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=8. The sequence is 2,3,5,8. So current_k would be 4. Because next_val is 5 (a=2, b=3) → 5 is <=8. current_k becomes 3. a=3, b=5. next_val is 3+5=8 → current_k becomes 4. a=5, b=8. next_val is 5+8=13>8. So output is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code seems to work.\n\nBut what about when n is exactly the next_val?\n\nYes, like n=5. It is handled correctly.\n\nBut what about when n is larger than the last term?\n\nFor example, n=13. The sequence is 2,3,5,8,13. So current_k would be 5. Let's see:\n\nInitially, current_k is 2. Then:\n\nnext_val = 2+3=5 <=13 → current_k=3, a=3, b=5.\n\nnext_val = 3+5=8 <=13 → current_k=4, a=5, b=8.\n\nnext_val=5+8=13 <=13 → current_k=5, a=8, b=13.\n\nnext_val=8+13=21>13 → break. So output is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about n=1? According to the problem statement, n is between 2 and 1e18. So the code can assume that n is ≥2.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n is 2, returns 1.\n\nElse:\n\nproceed with the steps.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    a = 2\n    b = 3\n    current_k = 1\n    if n >= a:\n        current_k = 1\n        if n >= b:\n            current_k = 2\n            while True:\n                next_val = a + b\n                if next_val <= n:\n                    current_k += 1\n                    a, b = b, next_val\n                else:\n                    break\n    print(current_k)\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code enters the 'if n >=a' block (since 2 >=2). Then checks if n >=b (2 >=3 is false). So current_k remains 1. Which is correct.\n\nTesting for n=2, output is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, output is 2. Correct.\n\nn=4, output is 2. Correct.\n\nn=5, output is 3. Correct.\n\nn=8, output is 4. Correct.\n\nn=10, output is 4. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves understanding the structure of the tournament and leveraging a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The key constraint is that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This leads us to consider a sequence where each term is the sum of the previous two terms, starting from 2 and 3. This sequence helps determine the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n2. **Fibonacci-like Sequence**: We generate a sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a specific number of games. The sequence starts with 2 (for 1 game) and 3 (for 2 games), and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: By iterating through this sequence, we determine the maximum number of games the winner can play without exceeding the given number of players `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    a = 2\n    b = 3\n    current_k = 1\n    if n >= a:\n        current_k = 1\n        if n >= b:\n            current_k = 2\n            while True:\n                next_val = a + b\n                if next_val <= n:\n                    current_k += 1\n                    a, b = b, next_val\n                else:\n                    break\n    print(current_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the first two terms of our sequence, `a = 2` (representing 1 game) and `b = 3` (representing 2 games).\n2. **Iterative Check**: We check if the current number of players `n` can support the next term in the sequence. If it can, we update our current maximum number of games (`current_k`) and move to the next term.\n3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when the next term in the sequence exceeds the number of players `n`, ensuring we do not exceed the available players.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using a linear traversal through the generated sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
