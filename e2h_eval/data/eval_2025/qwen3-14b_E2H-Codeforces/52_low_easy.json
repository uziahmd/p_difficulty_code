Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The conversion rate is 'b' used candles to make one new one. And this new candle can be used again, so it's a loop.\n\nThe example given is 4 and 2. Let's think through that. He starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, he has 4 used ones. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So he lights those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 used ones. He can make 2/2 = 1 new candle. That adds another hour. Now he has 1 used candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 hours. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 used, make 6/3=2 new. Now 2 hours. Then 2 used, but 2 < 3, so no more. Wait, but the sample output is 8. Wait 6 + 2 = 8? Oh right. But wait, in that case, after the initial 6, he makes 2 new. Those burn for 2 hours. Then he has 2 used. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. So total is 6+2=8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitially, the total hours is 'a' because each candle burns for an hour. Then, the number of used candles is 'a'.\n\nThen, while the number of used candles is >= b, we can make new candles. Each time, we take as many as possible (divided by b), add that number to the total hours, and then the used candles become the number of new candles made (since each new candle will burn once, adding to the hours, and then become used again).\n\nWait, but when you make new candles, you need to subtract the used ones that were used to make them. For example, if you have 4 used, and b is 2, you make 2 new. So the used count becomes 0 (since all 4 were used to make 2 new). Then those 2 new are burned, adding 2 hours, and then they become 2 used. Then you can make 1 new, etc.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nused_candles = a\n\nwhile used_candles >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used_candles // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    # The used_candles now are the remainder from the division, plus the new_candles that are now burned?\n\nWait, no. Because the new_candles are made from the used_candles. So when you make new_candles, you consume (new_candles * b) used candles. Wait, no. Because for each new candle, you need b used ones. So the number of new candles is floor(used_candles / b). Then, the remaining used candles is used_candles % b. Then, after burning the new_candles, those become used again.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nused = a\n\ntotal = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new \n\nSo this loop continues until used is less than b.\n\nYes. Let's test this with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal starts at 4. used is 4.\n\nloop:\n\n4 >= 2: yes.\n\nnew = 4//2 = 2. total becomes 4+2=6. used is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nloop again: 2 >=2. new=2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7. used is 0 +1 =1. Now loop ends.\n\nWhich gives 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal starts at 6. used is 6.\n\nloop:\n\n6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. used is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3, so loop ends. So total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. used is",
