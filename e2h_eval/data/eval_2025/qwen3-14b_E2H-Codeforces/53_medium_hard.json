    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm, how do I check all possible substrings and see which ones appear at least twice?\n\nThe brute force way would be to check all possible substrings of the string, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length among those that have at least two occurrences.\n\nBut since the string can be up to 100 characters long, the number of possible substrings is O(n²), which for n=100 is 10^4. For each substring, we can check if it appears again elsewhere. But how to efficiently do that?\n\nLet me think: For each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once we find the maximum such L, return it.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1.\n   For example, for a string of length N, the maximum possible L is N-1 (since you need two occurrences, but for example, if the string is \"aa\", then L=1 is possible).\n   Wait, for a string of length N, the maximum possible L where a substring can appear twice is floor(N/2). Wait, no. For example, in \"aaaaa\", the substring of length 3 \"aaa\" appears multiple times. But the maximum possible L is N-1 only if the first N-1 characters are same as the last N-1. But in general, for the maximum possible L, it's up to N-1.\n\nBut for the problem, we can check all possible lengths starting from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1. For each length L, check all possible substrings of length L, and see if any of them occurs at least twice. Once we find the largest L where this is true, return it.\n\nSo for example, for the input string 'ababa', len is 5. We check L=4 first. Are there any substrings of length 4 that appear twice? The substrings are 'abab' (positions 0-3) and 'baba' (positions 1-4). Neither appears more than once. Then check L=3. The substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). So 'aba' appears twice. So return 3.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate L from max possible down to 1, and for each L, check all possible substrings of length L, and see if any of them occurs at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nFor each L in range (from len(s)-1 down to 1):\n\n   For each starting index i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n       check if this substring appears again in the string (at least once more)\n\nIf any such substring is found, return L as the maximum.\n\nBut how to check if the substring appears again? For each substring, we can check all other positions in the string (excluding the current one) to see if there's another occurrence.\n\nBut for a given substring, we can collect all the starting indices where it occurs, and check if the count is >=2.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking existence, perhaps for each substring of length L, we can check if it appears again in the string.\n\nBut for each L, the steps would be:\n\n- Generate all substrings of length L, and collect their occurrences.\n\n- For each unique substring, check if it occurs at least twice.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAn alternative is, for each L, generate all substrings of length L, and store their positions. Then check if any of them has at least two entries.\n\nBut for each L, we can loop through all possible starting positions i, and collect the substrings. For example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are at i=0, 1, 2. So for each i, we can take s[i:i+L], and for each of these, check if it's present in the list of substrings before (i.e., if we've seen it before).\n\nWait, but for the same L, if we process the substrings and check if they have been seen before, then once a duplicate is found, we can immediately return that L as the maximum.\n\nSo here's an idea: For each L starting from the maximum possible down to 1:\n\n   Create a set to store the substrings we've seen so far for this L.\n\n   For each starting index i from 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substring is already in the set, then return L as the answer.\n\n       else, add it to the set.\n\n   If after checking all substrings for this L, none are found, proceed to check L-1.\n\nWait, but this approach would miss cases where the same substring occurs more than once, but not in the order of checking. For example, if the first occurrence is at i=0, then the second occurrence is at i=2. When processing i=0, we add it to the set. When processing i=2, we check if it's in the set. Since it's not, we add it. But in reality, there are two occurrences. So this approach is wrong.\n\nAh, right. Because when you check for each substring, you need to check whether it has been seen before in previous positions. So for example, for the substring at position i, if any previous substring (for the same L) is equal to it, then we have a duplicate. So for each i, when we check the substring, if it's already in the set, then yes, there's a duplicate. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nSo for example, in the case of 'ababa' with L=3:\n\ni=0: substring 'aba' added to set.\n\ni=1: substring 'bab' added to set.\n\ni=2: substring 'aba' is already in the set. So return True. So the answer is 3.\n\nYes, that works. So this approach would work for checking if there's at least two occurrences of the same substring of length L.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor L in range (max_length down to 1):\n\n   seen = empty set\n\n   for i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in seen:\n\n           return L\n\n       else:\n\n           add substr to seen\n\n   if no duplicates found for this L, proceed to check L-1.\n\nSo, the first L where this condition is met is the maximum possible, so return it.\n\nBut wait, what about if there are multiple substrings of the same L that have duplicates? For example, if for L=3, there are two different substrings that each appear twice. But the first occurrence of a duplicate is found, then we return L.\n\nThis is correct, because we want the maximum L possible, and the first occurrence of any duplicate for that L would allow us to return early.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the maximum possible L to start checking from?\n\nThe maximum possible L is len(s) - 1. Because for example, if the string is \"aa\", len is 2. L can be 1. But for len(s) - 1, which is 1, the substring is \"a\" (positions 0-0 and 1-1). So the code would check for L=1, and find that the substring \"a\" occurs twice.\n\nBut for a string of length N, the maximum possible L where a substring can occur twice is N-1, but only if the first N-1 characters are same as the last N-1. For example, in \"aaaaa\", the substring of length 4 \"aaaa\" occurs twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So the code would check for L=4, and find that.\n\nSo the code should iterate L from len(s)-1 down to 1. For each L, check if there's any duplicate substring of that length. The first L where this is true is the answer.\n\nBut what about when the string is of length 1? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is non-empty. But for len(s) = 1, there's no possible substring that occurs twice. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the code needs to handle that.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nIf the length is less than 2, return 0.\n\nElse, for L in range (len(s)-1 down to 1):\n\n   check for duplicates as per the above method.\n\n   if found, return L.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, none are found, return 0.\n\nSo, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd'\n\nLength is 4. So check L=3, then 2, 1.\n\nFor L=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'abc' (0-2), 'bcd' (1-3). No duplicates. So proceed.\n\nL=2:\n\nsubstrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. No duplicates.\n\nL=1:\n\nsubstrings are 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. Each occurs once. So answer is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' (length 5). Check L=4:\n\nsubstrings are 'abab' (0-3), 'baba' (1-4). No duplicates. Proceed to L=3.\n\nCheck substrings of length 3:\n\ni=0: 'aba' added.\n\ni=1: 'bab' added.\n\ni=2: 'aba' is already in the set. Return 3. Which is correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' (length 3). Check L=2 first.\n\nCheck substrings of length 2:\n\ni=0: 'zz' added.\n\ni=1: 'zz' is already in the set. So return 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' (length 5). For L=4, check substrings:\n\ni=0: 'aaaa' added.\n\ni=1: 'aaaa' is already in the set. So return 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' (length 6). For L=4:\n\nsubstrings are 'aabb' (0-3), 'abba' (1-4), 'bbaa' (2-5). No duplicates. Then check L=3. Substrings:\n\ni=0: 'aab' added.\n\ni=1: 'abb' added.\n\ni=2: 'bba' added.\n\ni=3: 'baa' added.\n\nNo duplicates. Then L=2: check substrings of length 2. The substrings are 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. So when i=0, 'aa' is added. i=4: 'aa' is found again. So returns 2. But wait, there's a longer possible substring. For example, 'aa' occurs at positions 0-1, 4-5. Also, 'aab' occurs once, but maybe there's a longer substring. Wait, but for L=3, the code didn't find any duplicates. But for L=2, the answer is 2. However, there is also the substring 'aa' of length 2. But what about the substring 'aa' of length 2. So the code returns 2, but perhaps there is longer. Let me check.\n\nWait, for the string 'aabbaa', the substrings of length 3: 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa'. None of these are duplicates. So the maximum is 2. But for L=2, the code finds that 'aa' occurs at 0-1 and 4-5. So the answer is 2. But there's also 'aa' in positions 0-1 and 1-2? No, the substring at position 0 is 'aa', then position 1 is 'ab', etc. So the code correctly returns 2.\n\nAnother example: 'ababab' (length 6). For L=4: check substrings:\n\npositions 0-3: abab, 1-4: baba, 2-5: abab. So for i=0, add 'abab' to the set. Then i=1, add 'baba'. Then i=2: 'abab' is already in the set. So returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, the code would read the input string. Then, for each possible L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   for each i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       check if substr is in the set. If yes, return L.\n\n       else add to the set.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n < 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    max_len = 0\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but for the sample input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], the code would process each of them. Let's see for 'zzz' (length 3). For L=2, the code checks i from 0 to 3-2=1. So i=0: substr is 'zz' added. i=1: substr is 'zz', which is in seen. So returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about the case where the same substring occurs more than once but not consecutively? Like 'abba' (length 4). For L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'. No duplicates. But for L=1, substrings are 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'. So when i=0, 'a' added. i=1, 'b' added. i=2, 'b' is already in the set? No, because the first occurrence is i=1. Then when i=2, substr is 'b', which is in the set. So returns 1. But there is a substring 'b' that occurs twice. So the code returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about the string 'aaaaa' (length 5). For L=4, the code checks i=0: 'aaaa' added. i=1: 'aaaa' is in the set. So returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring occurs multiple times but not overlapping. For example, 'abcabc' (length 6). For L=3, the substrings are 'abc' (i=0), 'bca' (i=1), 'cab' (i=2), 'abc' (i=3). So when i=3, substr is 'abc' which is in the set (from i=0). So returns 3. Correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears more than once, but the code checks for L in the correct order. For example, the string 'aabbaa' (length 6). For L=3, the code checks all substrings, but no duplicates. Then L=2, which finds 'aa' at positions 0 and 4. So returns 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears multiple times but for different Ls. For example, the string 'ababab' (length 6). For L=4, the code returns 4. But for L=3, there are substrings 'aba', 'bab', 'aba', 'bab', etc. So for L=3, the code would find that 'aba' occurs at i=0 and i=2. So returns 3. But since the code starts with the largest L possible, it would return 4 first.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. Wait, the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first input line containing the string. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of strings. That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not the actual input. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nLooking back:\n\n## Example\n\n### Input\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWait, this suggests that the input is a list of strings, but the problem says that the first input line contains the string. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list for the purposes of the example, but the actual input is a single string. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. So the code must read a single string.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of strings, which may be a formatting error. For example, perhaps the sample input is actually three separate test cases, each with their own input and output. But the problem says that the code must read from stdin and output the answer. So for the code, the input is a single string, and the output is a single number.\n\nBut the sample shows that for input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nBut that's impossible if the code is supposed to read a single string. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual input. Maybe the actual input is a single string, and the sample input shows three separate test cases. But the code is supposed to process one string at a time.\n\nBut the user says that the code should read from stdin and output the desired output. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code must process each line as a separate input. But the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list for clarity, but the actual input is a single string.\n\nBut the code is supposed to read a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list to represent multiple test cases. However, the code provided by the user must process a single string.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input shows three strings, but the output shows three numbers. Which implies that the code must process multiple test cases. But the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nWhich suggests that the code must read a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list for the purpose of showing multiple examples, but in reality, the code must read one string per input.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement is ambiguous.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo, for example, the sample input is given as a list of three strings, and the output is a list of three numbers. So the code must read multiple lines of input, each being a string, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the original problem is that the code must process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the original problem statement's input description says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list for the sake of the example, but the actual code should read one string per line.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, the sample input shows that for the input list ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], the output is ['0', '3', '2']. Which suggests that the code must process multiple test cases, each given as a separate line.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, each with their own input line.\n\nBut given that the sample input is written as a list, but the code is supposed to read from stdin, perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each representing a separate test case.\n\nBut this is conflicting with the problem statement. So perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the actual code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of three strings, which suggests that the code must read multiple lines. This is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list to show that the code should handle multiple test cases, but the actual code should read multiple lines from stdin. For example, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that is not accurate. For example, perhaps the sample input is for a different problem, but the actual problem requires that the code reads a single string.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and output the desired outputs. For example, in the sample input, the code is given three strings and outputs three numbers. So the code must read multiple lines of input.\n\nBut this is conflicting with the problem statement. So how to resolve this?\n\nWell, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWhich suggests that the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. Which suggests that the code should read a single string.\n\nThis is a contradiction. However, given that the sample shows multiple test cases, perhaps the problem is intended to have multiple test cases, each on a separate line. So the code should read all lines from input, process each line as a string, and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string, implying that there's only one test case. So this is confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample shows multiple test cases, perhaps the code should process multiple lines of input. For example, the input is multiple lines, each being a string, and the output is multiple lines, each being the answer for that string.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each one, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nIn the original problem statement, the sample input is written as a list of strings, which may be a formatting mistake. For example, perhaps the actual input is three lines, each containing a string.\n\nAssuming that, the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly, and the actual code should process one string per input line.\n\nIn that case, the code would read each line from stdin, and for each line, output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the code would read three lines, each being 'abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz', and output 0, 3, 2.\n\nSo the code must read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? For example, using sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as the first line. However, given the sample, I think that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate. For example, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should read a single string from input. But the sample shows that the code should process multiple strings and output multiple answers.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, to resolve this, the code should read all lines from input, process each line as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is the first line. However, given the sample, this is likely a mistake, and the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, in the code, I will read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process it as a string.\n\nBut let's check the sample input. For example, the input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which may be a representation of three lines, each being one of the strings.\n\nSo the code should read each line, process it, and output the answer.\n\nThus, the code will be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    s = line.strip()\n    # process s and print the answer\n\nBut how to handle the case where the input is given as multiple lines. For example, in the sample input, the code would read three lines, and output three lines.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nSo, the code will process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem statement may have an error. However, given the sample, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, the code will read all input lines, process each as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nSo, the code will look like this:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        max_len = 0\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            print(0)\n\nBut wait, for each line, the code processes it. For example, for the sample input, the code would process each line and output the corresponding answer.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nInput lines are:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nOutput would be:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nBut in the code, for the case when the string is empty (n=0), it prints 0. However, the problem says that the string is non-empty. So perhaps that part is unnecessary.\n\nBut the problem says that the input string is non-empty. So the code can assume that.\n\nThus, the code can be adjusted:\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n < 2:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            print(0)\n\nBut wait, for n=1, the code prints 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nFor 'abcd', n=4. The code loops L from 3 down to 1.\n\nFor L=3: check substrings of length 3. No duplicates. Then L=2: check substrings. No duplicates. Then L=1: check substrings. All are unique. So the code prints 0.\n\nFor 'ababa', n=5. L starts at 4. For L=4, check substrings. No duplicates. Then L=3. For i=0, substr 'aba' added. i=1: 'bab' added. i=2: substr 'aba' is in seen, so print 3.\n\nFor 'zzz', n=3. L starts at 2. For i=0, substr 'zz' added. i=1: substr 'zz' is in seen. So print 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: 'aa' → output 1. Because substrings of length 1: 'a' occurs twice.\n\nTest case 2: 'a' → output 0.\n\nTest case 3: 'aaaaa' → output 4 (as discussed earlier).\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → output 0. Because the substrings of length 1 are 'a' and 'b', which occur once each.\n\nAnother test case: 'aab' → for L=2: substrings 'aa' (i=0), 'ab' (i=1). No duplicates. For L=1: 'a' occurs twice. So output is 1.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, reading from stdin and printing to stdout.\n\nThus, the final code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n < 2:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the input has multiple lines, including empty lines? Well, the problem says that the input string is non-empty. But for the code, if a line is empty (after stripping), then len(s) is zero, and it prints 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be non-empty. So perhaps the code can assume that each line is a non-empty string. However, the code handles that case anyway.\n\nThis code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which adds complexity to the solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read multiple lines of input where each line represents a separate string.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each string, check all possible substring lengths starting from the maximum possible length down to 1. This ensures that we find the longest valid substring first.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: For each length, use a set to track substrings of that length as we iterate through the string. If a substring is found again, it means it has appeared at least twice, and we immediately return that length as the result.\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the string length is less than 2 by directly returning 0 since no valid substring can exist.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n < 2:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads each line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and processes each string individually.\n2. **String Length Check**: If the length of the string is less than 2, it immediately outputs 0 since no valid substring can be found.\n3. **Substring Length Iteration**: The outer loop iterates from the maximum possible substring length (length of the string minus one) down to 1. This ensures we check longer substrings first.\n4. **Tracking Substrings**: For each length, a set is used to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is encountered again, it indicates that it has appeared at least twice, and we print the current length and exit the loop.\n5. **Efficiency**: By checking from the longest possible length downwards and using a set for quick lookups, the solution efficiently finds the longest valid substring without redundant checks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the longest repeating substring while handling all edge cases appropriately.",
