The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem statement is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the frog starts at position 0. It can jump either +a or -b. But the frog can't jump outside the interval [0, x] when calculating f(x). And we need to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(x) represents. For each x, f(x) is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach, given that all jumps stay within [0, x]. The frog doesn't have to reach all of them in one trip, but any reachable position counts as long as there's some path that gets there without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b, but can't go below 0 or above x. So for each x, the set of positions depends on how the frog can combine these jumps.\n\nBut considering that the frog starts at 0, and can make any number of jumps, but must stay within [0, x], perhaps the positions reachable are those that can be expressed as some combination of a and b steps, but adjusted for the constraints.\n\nWait, but the frog can only move forward (by a) or backward (by b). However, since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, maybe the positions are determined by the linear combinations of a and b, but constrained by the boundaries.\n\nBut how do I find which positions are reachable?\n\nLet me consider the case where the frog can move freely without constraints. Then, the positions reachable would be all numbers that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But since the frog starts at 0, maybe the positions are those that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a,b), but that's only if there are no constraints. However, with constraints on the positions (they must be between 0 and x), the problem becomes more complex.\n\nBut perhaps the key here is to find for each x, the set of positions that are reachable under the constraints. However, given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute this for each x individually. We need a mathematical formula or pattern that allows us to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nIn the first example, m=7, a=5, b=3. The output is 19. The explanation says that f(0) is 1, f(5) is 3, etc. Let's think why f(5) is 3. When x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5 (from 0+5), and then maybe 5-3=2. From 2, can it jump again? Like 2+5=7, but that's beyond x=5. So maybe only 0, 2, 5. Hence f(5)=3. Similarly, for x=7, the frog can reach positions like 0,5,2,7 (from 5+2?), but wait, maybe there's more possibilities. For example, from 2, you can add a (5) to get 7, which is allowed. Then from 7, you can subtract b=3 to get 4. Then from 4, subtract 3 to get 1. Then from 1, can't subtract 3 (would go to -2), but adding a (5) gives 6. From 6, subtract 3 gives 3. From 3, subtract 3 gives 0. So the positions reachable when x=7 would be 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions, hence f(7)=8. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the reachable positions are those that can be formed by moving forward and backward, but without going out of [0, x]. But how to model this?\n\nAnother example: when a=1 and b=2019. Then the frog can jump +1 or -2019. But for x being large enough, the frog can reach all positions from 0 upwards. Because adding +1 steps allows reaching any position. For example, if x is large enough, then the frog can reach any position >=0. Because starting from 0, adding 1s. But since the frog can also subtract 2019, but that would take it to negative numbers, which are not allowed. So in that case, the frog can only move forward. Hence, for any x, the positions reachable are 0, 1, 2, ..., x. Hence f(x) = x+1. Which explains the second example where the sum is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2. Which for m=1e9 would be a huge number, but the sample output shows that it's computed correctly.\n\nThird example: a=100000, b=1. The frog can't make any jumps. Because from 0, jumping +a would take it to 100000, but if x is 100, then that's allowed. Wait, but the third example input is m=100, a=100000, b=1. So the frog can't make any jumps. Because for any x, the frog can't jump forward (a=1e5 is larger than x=100, so the frog can't jump to 1e5). Also, jumping backward (from 0, subtracting 1 would take it to -1, which is invalid. Hence, the frog can't make any jumps. So for all x, the frog can only be at 0. Hence f(x)=1 for all x, so the sum is 101 (from 0 to 100 inclusive).\n\nSo, the problem seems to depend on whether the frog can reach positions beyond certain points. Let's think about the general case.\n\nThe key idea is that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the gcd of a and b. Because the steps are +a and -b. So the total displacement is a*k - b*l. The possible displacements are multiples of d. So the reachable positions must be congruent to 0 mod d.\n\nBut since the frog starts at 0, all reachable positions must be multiples of d. However, the constraints of staying within [0, x] may further restrict which multiples can be reached.\n\nBut how to find for a given x, the number of reachable positions?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the frog can reach any multiple of d that is between 0 and x, provided that it can be formed by some combination of steps that don't take it out of [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. For example, if a and b are coprime (d=1), then once x is sufficiently large, the frog can reach any integer between 0 and x.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where this becomes possible?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: The frog can reach any multiple of d up to x, provided that x is large enough. Then, for x >= some value, f(x) is equal to floor(x/d) + 1 (since 0, d, 2d, ... up to x).\n\nCase 2: For smaller x, the frog can't reach all multiples of d, so f(x) is less than that.\n\nBut how to determine when x is large enough?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= some value. For example, if the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= (some value), then for x >= that value, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find that value?\n\nThis seems similar to the classic coin problem where you want to find the largest amount that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b. But here, the frog can use both steps, but with the constraints of not going negative.\n\nWait, but since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the problem is different. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that it can be formed by some combination of steps. However, the frog can only reach positions that are reachable via steps that never leave [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d between 0 and x. So for example, if the frog can reach some position k, and then can add a steps (as long as it's within x), then the reachable positions would be all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how to find that threshold?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the frog can make forward jumps (adding a) and backward jumps (subtracting b). So the problem is similar to moving along the number line with steps of +a and -b, but with the constraint that you can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut for the purposes of f(x), we need to know all positions that are reachable, regardless of the path taken. So perhaps, the positions that are reachable are those that are multiples of d (gcd(a,b)) and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients (but considering that the path must not go outside [0, x]).\n\nWait, but that's complicated. Maybe there's a way to model this with BFS, but given that m can be up to 1e9, we need an O(1) or O(1) per test case solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer depends on whether a and b are coprime or not. Let's consider the case where d = gcd(a, b). Let's denote d = gcd(a, b), and a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since a and b are multiples of d, then the reachable positions must be multiples of d. So, the problem reduces to considering the problem with a' and b', where they are coprime.\n\nSo, for the original problem, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of reachable positions for the problem with a' and b' (coprime) multiplied by d. Wait, no. The positions are multiples of d. So, if for the new problem (with a' and b'), the reachable positions are all integers that are multiples of d, and for the original problem, the reachable positions are multiples of d. So perhaps, the problem can be transformed into the coprime case.\n\nSo, let's assume that a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is a linear combination of a and b. But given that the frog starts at 0, and can make any number of steps forward (a) or backward (b), but must not go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut for the case where the frog can reach any integer that is congruent to 0 mod d (which in this case is 1, since a and b are coprime), but that's not correct. Wait, if a and b are coprime, then their linear combinations can generate any integer. But the problem is that the frog can only move forward (a steps) or backward (b steps), but the path must not go out of [0, x].\n\nBut for example, if a=5 and b=3, which are coprime. Then, the frog can reach positions like 0, 5, 2 (5-3), 7 (5+2?), but how? Let's see. From 0, you can go to 5. From 5, you can subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, you can add 5 to get 7 (if x is big enough). From 7, subtract 3 to get 4. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1. From 1, add 5 to get 6. From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. From 3, subtract 3 to get 0. So in this case, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod 1 (so all integers), but only if they can be reached via the steps without going out of [0, x].\n\nSo for x >= 7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. But for smaller x, it can't reach all positions. For example, when x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. So f(5)=3.\n\nSo how do we model this for general a and b?\n\nLet me think about the problem again. Once the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k+a (if k+a <=x) and k-b (if k-b >=0). So the reachable positions form a graph where each node is a position and edges are the possible jumps.\n\nBut for large x, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (the gcd), but perhaps once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nBut how to find that threshold?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the ability to reach all positions beyond a certain point. For example, in the case where a and b are coprime, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of a and b is ab - a - b. However, that's for the case of non-negative combinations. But here, the frog can take any number of steps forward and backward, but the path must not go out of [0, x].\n\nWait, but the classic problem is for positive integers. Here, the frog can take steps forward and backward. So perhaps the reachable positions are all integers that are congruent to 0 mod d, and greater than or equal to some value.\n\nBut perhaps for the case where a and b are coprime, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions in [0, x]. For example, once x is larger than (a-1)*(b-1), which is the Frobenius number. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (the gcd) once x is large enough. Let's say that after some value, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Then, for x >= that value, f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each x, whether x is larger than a certain threshold. If yes, then f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1. Otherwise, it's some other value.\n\nBut how to compute that threshold?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= 0 and can be formed by some combination of steps. However, since the frog can take steps forward and backward, the problem is similar to being able to reach any multiple of d that is >= (some value), but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think again. Let's suppose that a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is a linear combination of a and b. But since the frog can only move forward or backward, the steps are +a or -b. However, the path must not go out of [0, x].\n\nBut for the purpose of f(x), the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (which is 1 in this case) and is between 0 and x, provided that there exists some way to reach it without leaving [0, x].\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where all positions up to x are reachable.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position that is reachable via some sequence of jumps, and for that, the position must be congruent to 0 mod d. But for the case where a and b are coprime, d=1, so all positions are allowed. However, the frog can't reach positions that are not reachable through the steps.\n\nBut how to find for a given x, the number of positions reachable.\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients for the forward steps and any number of backward steps, but ensuring that during the path, the frog never leaves [0, x].\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: For the frog to reach position k, there must exist some integer t such that k = t*a - s*b, where t and s are non-negative integers. However, during the process of getting to k, the frog must not have gone out of [0, x]. But this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that is >=0 and <=x, and also can be written as k = a * t - b * s, where t and s are non-negative integers. However, this ignores the path constraints. For example, even if such a k exists, the path to reach it might require going beyond x, which is not allowed.\n\nBut perhaps for x large enough, the path can be arranged to not go out of bounds. For example, if x is large enough that the frog can reach k by adding a steps first, then subtracting b steps as needed. For example, if the frog wants to reach k, it can first go to k + m*b, then subtract m*b steps. But this requires that k + m*b is within [0, x], which may not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of d that is in [0, x], provided that x is large enough. For example, once x is large enough that the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nLet me think about the example where a=5 and b=3. The gcd is 1. So, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7 except 4? No, earlier analysis said that for x=7, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. All positions from 0 to 7. So for x=7, which is larger than (5-1)*(3-1) = 8? No, 7 is less than 8. But in this case, the frog can reach all positions. Hmm, that contradicts the Frobenius number idea.\n\nSo perhaps the Frobenius number isn't directly applicable here.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=5. Frobenius number is 3*5 -3 -5 = 7. So the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of 3 and 5 with non-negative integers is 7. However, in our problem, the frog can take steps forward and backward. So, for example, to reach 7, the frog can start at 0, add 5 (to 5), then add 3 (to 8), but that's beyond x=7. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Wait, but the frog can't go beyond x. So if x=7, can the frog reach 7? Well, the frog could do 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 - 5 = 4. Not sure. Or maybe there's a way. This seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps, for the purposes of this problem, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d (which is 1 in this case) between 0 and x. So for x >= some value, f(x) = x + 1. But how to find that value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frog can reach all positions that are >= (some value) and are multiples of d. For example, once the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a, k + 2a, etc., as long as they are <=x. So, if the frog can reach some position in [0, a), then it can reach all positions beyond that by adding a steps. So the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of positions that the frog can reach in [0, a), and then for larger x, the number of reachable positions increases by 1 for each a steps.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nFor a given x, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and lies in [0, x], provided that there exists a way to reach it without stepping outside [0, x]. However, the number of such positions depends on whether the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nIf the frog can reach all positions from 0 to a, then for any x >= a, the frog can reach all positions up to x by adding a steps. But this is not necessarily true. For example, if the frog can reach 0 and a, then adding a steps would allow reaching 2a, but if the frog can't reach a, then this is not helpful.\n\nBut if the frog can reach all positions in [0, a), then it can reach any higher positions by adding a steps.\n\nWait, this is similar to the concept of the BFS for the frog's reachable positions. For example, if the frog can reach a position k in [0, a), then it can reach k + a, k + 2a, etc. So the total number of positions reachable would be the number of positions in [0, a) that are reachable, multiplied by the number of times you can add a steps to reach up to x.\n\nBut how to find the positions in [0, a) that are reachable?\n\nThis seems like a promising direction. Let's formalize this:\n\nLet’s assume that a and b are coprime. Let’s find all positions in [0, a) that are reachable. Once we have that, for any x >= a, the number of reachable positions is the number of positions in [0, a) that are reachable multiplied by floor((x - k)/a) + 1 for each k in that set. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, once the frog can reach all positions in [0, a), then for x >= a, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Because for any position p in [0, x], we can write p = q*a + r, where 0 <= r <a. Since r is in [0,a), and if r is reachable, then p can be reached by adding q steps of a.\n\nBut how to ensure that all positions in [0, a) are reachable?\n\nIf the frog can reach all positions in [0, a), then for x >= a, f(x) = x + 1. But how to find when this condition holds.\n\nBut for the case where a and b are coprime, the frog can reach all positions >= (a*b -a -b) + 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d (here d=1), and for which there exists a way to reach it via some steps. So the problem is to find for each x, the number of such positions in [0,x].\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe key observation is that for the frog to reach any position k in [0, x], it must be possible to express k as a linear combination of a and b, with coefficients that allow the path to stay within [0, x]. However, this is too vague.\n\nBut perhaps for large enough x, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d. Let's assume that d = gcd(a, b), and a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, a' and b' are coprime.\n\nOnce x is large enough, the frog can reach any multiple of d between 0 and x. Let's call this threshold T. Then, for x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nThe question is to find T.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nLet's consider the case when a and b are coprime. Let's assume that the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x, provided that x is large enough. What is the minimal x where this is true?\n\nIn the classic Frobenius problem, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative integers is ab -a -b. However, in this problem, the frog can take steps in both directions, so perhaps the frog can reach all positions beyond a certain value.\n\nFor example, in the case where a=3, b=5, the Frobenius number is 7. But for x=8, the frog can reach 8 by doing 3+5 (but that's 8). However, if the frog is allowed to take steps forward and backward, then for any position >= (a-1)*(b-1) + 1, the frog can reach it. Or perhaps not. This is unclear.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps we can proceed with the following approach:\n\nIf the frog can reach all multiples of d (which is the gcd) up to x, then for x >= some value, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1. For smaller x, it's something else.\n\nTo find this value, perhaps we can compute the minimal x such that the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Once we find that, for x >= this value, f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this minimal x?\n\nLet me think of the following: For the frog to be able to reach all multiples of d up to x, it must be able to reach every multiple of d in [0, x]. Let me consider the case where a and b are coprime (d=1). Then, the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions up to x is when x is large enough that the frog can reach all positions in [0, x].\n\nAssume that the frog can reach all positions from 0 to a-1. Then, for any x >= a, the frog can reach all positions up to x by adding a steps. Because for any position p >= a, it can be written as p = q*a + r, where r is in [0, a-1]. Since r is reachable, and the frog can add q steps of a to reach p. So the minimal x for which this holds is when all positions in [0, a-1] are reachable.\n\nBut how to find whether all positions in [0, a-1] are reachable?\n\nThis depends on the values of a and b. For example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3. The positions in [0, 5) are 0,1,2,3,4. The frog can reach 0, 2, and 5 (but 5 is not in [0,5)). Wait, but 5 is not in [0,5). So the frog can reach 0 and 2 in [0,5). Then, for x >= 5, can it reach all positions?\n\nNo, because for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. But for x=6, it can reach 0, 2, 5, 7 (no, x is 6, so 7 is out of range). From 5, subtract 3 to get 2, then add 5 to get 7 (invalid). So perhaps the frog can't reach 1, 3, 4, etc. So my earlier assumption is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the approach of checking whether positions in [0, a) are reachable is not sufficient. So what's the alternative?\n\nLet me think of the following: For the frog to reach a position k, it must be possible to reach it using forward and backward steps without going out of bounds. But this is very hard to model.\n\nPerhaps another way to look at this problem is to note that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients for the forward steps and any number of backward steps. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo d, and that is >=0 and <=x, provided that x is large enough. But how to find the minimal x where this is true.\n\nAnother observation: The frog can always reach 0. If it can reach a, then it can reach a + a, and so on. Similarly, if it can reach b, then it can subtract it from higher positions.\n\nBut for example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3. The frog can reach 5 (from 0 + a), and 2 (from 5 - b). From 2, adding a gives 7, which is allowed if x >=7. From 7, subtracting b gives 4, then subtracting again gives 1. From 1, adding a gives 6, which can be subtracted by b to get 3, and then subtract again to get 0. So for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. Hence, for x >=7, f(x) = x+1? No, because for x=7, f(x)=8 (the example says f(7)=8). But for x=8, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, 8 (from 7 + a is 12, which is beyond 8. So how to reach 8? From 5, add 3 (b) steps? No, the frog can only jump +a or -b. So from 5, adding a (5) would take it to 10, which is beyond 8. Subtracting b (3) would take it to 2. How to reach 8? Maybe from 2, add a (5) to get 7, then add a again to get 12 (too big). Or from 5, subtract b to get 2, then add a to get 7, then add a to get 12 again. So no, the frog can't reach 8 unless there's another way.\n\nWait, this seems like a contradiction. Earlier analysis said that for x=7, the frog can reach all positions up to 7. But for x=8, the frog can't reach 8. So the previous idea that once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that my earlier reasoning was wrong. So what's the correct way to model this?\n\nMaybe the problem is that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b, but with the constraint that during the path, it doesn't go out of bounds. However, this seems too vague to model.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Since the frog can only move forward (add a) or backward (subtract b), the positions it can reach are those that are reachable via a series of these steps. This is equivalent to the set of all integers that can be written as a * t - b * s, where t and s are non-negative integers, and during the sequence of steps, the frog never goes below 0 or above x.\n\nBut for the purposes of f(x), we're interested in the count of all such positions that are between 0 and x.\n\nThis seems like a very difficult problem to model for large x. Given the constraints of m up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to calculate this.\n\nLet me think about the cases where the frog cannot make any forward or backward jumps. For example, if a > x and b > x, then the frog can't make any jumps. So f(x) = 1. This is the case in the third example.\n\nOtherwise, if the frog can make some jumps, then we need to find the reachable positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that can be written as a * t - b * s, where t and s are non-negative integers, and there exists a path that reaches it without going out of [0, x].\n\nBut again, this is too vague.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is in the range [0, x], provided that x >= (some value). But what is that value?\n\nLet me consider the case where the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x if x >= max(a, b). But this is not true, as seen in the first example where a=5, b=3, and x=5. The frog can reach 0, 2, 5. So it can't reach 3 or 4, which are multiples of d=1. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: The frog can reach any position that is >= (a - b) or something like that. But this is not clear.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern for small values.\n\nFor the first example, a=5, b=3, d=1. The reachable positions for various x are:\n\nx=0: {0} → f(0)=1\n\nx=1: {0} → f(1)=1\n\nx=2: {0, 2} → f(2)=2? Wait, no, according to the example, f(2)=1. Wait, what's the example saying?\n\nIn the first example, the sample says that f(5)=3, f(7)=8. For x=2, the frog can jump from 0 to 5 (but that's beyond x=2, so not allowed. Or from 0, can it jump -b=3 to -3, which is invalid. So the only position is 0. Hence f(2)=1. So how does the frog reach 2? It can't. Wait, but earlier analysis said that for x=5, the frog can reach 2. But how?\n\nAh, for x=5, the frog can jump from 0 to 5 (allowed), then from 5, subtract 3 to get 2, which is allowed. So for x=5, 2 is allowed. But for x=2, the frog can't jump to 5, so it can't reach 2. Hence, for x=2, the frog can only be at 0. So f(2)=1.\n\nSo the frog can reach 2 only when x is >=5.\n\nSo the idea is that for certain positions, you need to have a large enough x to reach them.\n\nThis suggests that the number of reachable positions for x is the number of multiples of d that are reachable with the constraints of not going out of bounds.\n\nBut how to compute this for large x?\n\nThis seems very challenging. Let's think about the following: For the frog to be able to reach a position k, it must be possible to reach it by some combination of forward and backward jumps, without going out of [0, x]. But for the purposes of the sum, we need to compute this for all x from 0 to m.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the only feasible approach is to realize that the problem can be solved by considering the following:\n\nIf a == b, then the frog can jump forward by a or backward by a. But since it starts at 0, it can reach 0 and a (if x >=a), but also can jump back from a to 0. So for x >=a, the frog can reach 0 and a, but not any other positions. Hence, f(x) = 2 for x >=a.\n\nBut this seems like a special case.\n\nAlternatively, if b >= a, then the frog can't jump backward unless it has enough positions. For example, if b is larger than a, then the frog can't jump backward from 0, since that would take it to -b. So in this case, the frog can only jump forward, and thus can reach positions 0, a, 2a, ..., up to x. So for x >= a, f(x) = floor(x/a) + 1. But if b is smaller than a, then the frog can jump backward from positions >=b.\n\nThis suggests that the problem depends on whether the frog can jump backward (i.e., whether b is small enough).\n\nBut this seems to be the case for the second example where a=1 and b=2019. Since b is much larger than a, the frog can't jump backward from 0, but can only jump forward. So for any x, the frog can reach 0, 1, 2, ..., x. Hence f(x) = x+1.\n\nSo, this suggests that the key is whether the frog can make backward jumps. If the frog can't make any backward jumps (because b is too large), then it can only jump forward, and f(x) is floor(x/a) + 1. But if the frog can make backward jumps, then it can reach more positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nLet me think about the general case:\n\nCase 1: b > a. In this case, the frog can't make any backward jumps from 0, since subtracting b would take it to -b, which is invalid. But once the frog reaches a position >=b, it can make backward jumps. For example, if the frog jumps forward to a, then from a it can subtract b if a >=b. But if a < b, then this is not possible. So in this case, if a < b, then the frog can only jump forward, and f(x) = floor(x/a) + 1. But if a >= b, then the frog can jump backward from a.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's think of the following:\n\nIf the frog can't make any backward jumps (i.e., from any position, subtracting b would go below ",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line, given constraints on its jumps, and then compute the sum of these counts for all values from 0 to m. The solution involves understanding the reachable positions based on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the jump lengths and whether the frog can make backward jumps.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`. The key insight is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the gcd of `a` and `b`.\n2. **Special Cases**: If the frog cannot make any backward jumps (i.e., `b > x` for all considered `x`), it can only move forward, leading to a simple arithmetic progression of reachable positions.\n3. **General Case**: For large enough values of `x`, the frog can reach all multiples of the gcd of `a` and `b` within the range [0, x]. This allows us to compute the sum efficiently using arithmetic series formulas.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a //= d\n    b //= d\n\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check if the frog can make any backward jumps\n    # i.e., whether b <= x for some x in [0, m]\n    # If b > m, then the frog can't make any backward jumps\n    if b > m:\n        # The frog can only jump forward\n        # So f(x) is floor(x/a) + 1 for x >= 0\n        # But since a is now coprime with b (original a and b were divided by d)\n        # Wait, after dividing by d, a and b are coprime?\n        # Yes, since d was their gcd.\n        # So the original a and b are a*d and b*d, but here we have a and b as coprime.\n        # But in this case, since b > m, the frog can't make any backward jumps, so it can only jump forward\n        # So the number of reachable positions is floor(x/a) + 1\n        # But wait, the original a and b were divided by d.

But this may not hold. So perhaps the check should be on the original b.\n\n        # Wait, the original problem: the frog can't make a backward jump from position k if k - b_orig < 0. So for the frog to make any backward jump, there must be some position k where k >= b_orig. But if b_orig > m, then even the maximum x is m, so the frog can't make any backward jumps.

If the frog cannot make any backward jumps, it can only move forward, leading to a simple arithmetic progression of reachable positions. If it can make backward jumps, the solution assumes that for large enough values, the frog can reach all positions, using an arithmetic series formula for efficiency.

As per earlier analysis, this is not always true.
