Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending either a 0 or 1. After each append, we need to calculate the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. But there are some forbidden Morse codes that don't correspond to any letters.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly counts as a valid sequence. The problem says that each substring of S (after each modification) that represents a valid Morse code for a letter contributes to the count. However, since sequences can be multiple letters, like combining different substrings, but the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the note.\n\nIn the note, after S is \"111\", they list all possible sequences. For example, \"T\" is \"1\", \"M\" is \"11\", \"O\" is \"111\". Then \"TT\" is \"11\" which is M, so that's another sequence. So each time a substring of S corresponds to a valid Morse code, it's considered as one possible letter. And sequences are combinations of these letters. Wait, but how do sequences form?\n\nWait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So for example, if S has \"11\", then the substrings are \"1\" (which is T), \"1\" (the second one), and \"11\" (which is M). Each of these substrings represents a single letter. But sequences of letters would be combinations of these. For example, the first '1' and the second '1' could form a sequence of two letters (T followed by T), which is counted as a separate sequence. So the total number of sequences is the number of ways to split the string into parts where each part is a valid Morse code letter.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each such sequence is a collection of letters, each of which is represented by some substring of S. But how does that work? Or perhaps the question is about all possible substrings of S that represent a valid letter, and each such occurrence is counted as a single sequence. But that can't be right because the sample input shows that for S=111, there are 7 sequences. Let's see:\n\nIn the sample, after three 1s, S is \"111\". The substrings are:\n\nLength 1: positions 1, 2, 3 → each is \"1\" (valid). So 3 sequences.\n\nLength 2: \"11\" (positions 1-2), \"11\" (positions 2-3). Both are valid. So 2 more sequences.\n\nLength 3: \"111\" → valid. So 1 more.\n\nTotal 3+2+1=6. But the sample output says 7. Oh, but the note lists 7 entries. Wait, the note says the sequences are:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". That's 7. How does that come?\n\nAh, because each occurrence of a valid substring is considered as a possible sequence. But when you have overlapping possibilities, like splitting the string into different parts. For example, the entire string \"111\" can be split into \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" (three letters), or \"1\" + \"11\" (two letters), or \"11\" + \"1\" (two letters), or \"111\" (one letter). But how does that contribute to the count?\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the answer is the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So each sequence is a series of letters, and each letter is represented by a substring of S. But how does that translate into counting?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of possible ways to parse the entire string S into a sequence of valid Morse code letters. But that doesn't fit the sample. Because for S = \"111\", the possible parses are:\n\n- Three letters: T, T, T → one way.\n\n- Two letters: T and M, or M and T → two ways.\n\n- One letter: O → one way.\n\nTotal 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. But the sample says the answer is 7. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, looking back at the note. The example says that after appending three 1s, the answer is 7. The note lists 7 different sequences. Those sequences are:\n\nEach individual occurrence of a valid substring. So, for example, the first '1' is T, the second '1' is T, the third '1' is T. Then the first two '1's form M, the last two form M. The entire three form O. Then sequences like TT (which is two Ts), TM (T followed by M), MT (M followed by T), and TTT (three Ts). So how many sequences are there?\n\nEach valid substring is considered as a single-letter sequence. Then, sequences made by combining multiple valid substrings. But how to count all possible combinations?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem where, for each position in the string, we track the number of ways to parse up to that position. But the problem isn't about parsing the entire string, but rather all possible substrings that can be broken down into valid letters. Wait, no. Because the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So for example, any substring of S that is a valid Morse code letter is counted as one sequence. Also, any combination of such substrings that form a sequence of letters. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total number of valid Morse code substrings. But in that case, for the sample input with S=111, there are 3 (length 1) + 2 (length 2) + 1 (length 3) = 6 valid substrings. But the sample output says 7. So that's not matching.\n\nWait the sample output for the first input is 1, 3, 7. Let's look at the first input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAfter first append: S is '1'. Valid substrings: '1' → 1. So output 1.\n\nAfter second append: S is '11'. Valid substrings are:\n\n'1' (first), '1' (second), '11' → 3. So output 3.\n\nAfter third append: S is '111'. Valid substrings are:\n\nEach of the 3 length 1, 2 length 2, 1 length 3. Total 3+2+1=6. But the sample output says 7. So why?\n\nAh! Because the note says that there are 7 sequences. So perhaps the problem is not just counting the number of valid substrings, but the number of possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting the entire string into valid Morse code letters. But how?\n\nWait, the note says that for S=111, the sequences are:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\nSo that's 7 sequences. How are these formed?\n\nEach of these is a way to split the entire string into parts that are valid Morse code letters. For example:\n\n- \"T\" is a single letter (split into one part).\n\n- \"M\" is a split into one part (the first two characters).\n\n- \"O\" is a split into one part (all three characters).\n\n- \"TT\" is splitting into two parts (first character and second character).\n\n- \"TM\" is splitting into first character and the next two characters.\n\n- \"MT\" is splitting into the first two characters and the third character.\n\n- \"TTT\" is splitting into three parts (each single character).\n\nSo the total number of ways to split the entire string into valid Morse code letters. But in this case, the answer is 4 (as I thought before), but the note says 7. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the answer is the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So perhaps each individual valid substring is considered as a sequence (a single letter), and also any combination of valid substrings that form a longer sequence. For example, if there are two valid substrings that are adjacent, then combining them forms a longer sequence.\n\nBut how do you count all possible such combinations across all substrings of S?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as for every possible substring of S (not the entire string), check if it can be parsed into valid Morse code letters. Each such parsing contributes to the count. But that seems computationally heavy, especially for large m (up to 3000). However, given that m is 3000, and each step appends a character, the total length of S can be up to 3000. So for each step, the maximum length is 3000. So for each step, the number of substrings is O(n^2) where n is the current length. For n=3000, that's about 9 million per step. But multiplied by 3000 steps, that's 27 billion operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nSo there must be a smarter way to compute this. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, perhaps each such sequence is a sequence of letters, and each letter is represented by a substring of S. But the sequence is such that the concatenation of the Morse code representations of the letters is a substring of S. For example, if the sequence is \"T\" followed by \"M\", then the Morse code is \"1\" + \"11\" = \"111\", which is a substring of S (the entire S in the sample is \"111\"). So the problem is to count the number of such sequences, where their concatenated Morse code is a substring of S.\n\nBut how do we count that?\n\nFor example, the sample's S is \"111\". The possible sequences are:\n\n- All single letters whose Morse code is a substring. There are 3 (each '1') + 2 (each '11') + 1 (the '111') = 6. But the sample says 7. So where is the seventh?\n\nAh, the note lists \"TTT\" as a sequence. The Morse code for that is \"1\"+\"1\"+\"1\" = \"111\", which is a substring. So this is counted as one sequence. So the total number of sequences is the number of ways to split any substring of S into valid Morse code letters. So for each possible substring of S (call it T), we count the number of ways to split T into valid Morse code letters. Then sum all those counts over all possible substrings T of S.\n\nWait, that would make sense. For example, in the sample S = \"111\", the substrings are:\n\nSubstrings of length 1:\n\nEach of the three '1's. Each can be split in exactly one way (as a single letter). So 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nSubstrings of length 2:\n\nEach of the two '11's. Each can be split in one way (as a single letter). So 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nSubstrings of length 3:\n\nThe entire string. It can be split in four ways: as one letter (O), or as two letters (T and M, or M and T), or as three letters (T, T, T). So 4 ways.\n\nTotal sum is 3+2+4=9. But the sample says 7. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps my understanding is still wrong.\n\nWait the sample says that after three 1s, the answer is 7. But according to this approach, it would be 3 + 2 + 4 = 9. Which contradicts. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully:\n\n\"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nSo each such sequence is a sequence of letters, and the concatenation of their Morse code representations is a substring of S. So for example, the sequence \"T\" (Morse \"1\") is represented by any occurrence of \"1\" in S. The sequence \"TT\" (Morse \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\") is represented by any occurrence of \"11\" in S. Similarly, the sequence \"TTT\" is represented by any occurrence of \"111\" in S. Also, the sequence \"TM\" is represented by any occurrence of \"111\" in S (since \"1\"+\"11\" = \"111\").\n\nBut the problem is to count all such sequences. Each sequence is uniquely determined by the concatenation of their Morse codes. So for each substring T of S, we count the number of ways to split T into valid Morse code letters. Then, the total number of sequences is the sum over all substrings T of S of the number of ways to split T into valid letters.\n\nBut in the sample, the total would be:\n\nFor S = \"111\", substrings are:\n\nAll substrings:\n\nLength 1:\n\n[1], [1], [1]. Each can be split in 1 way. So 3.\n\nLength 2:\n\n[1,1], [1,1]. Each can be split in 1 way (as a single letter). So 2.\n\nLength 3:\n\n[1,1,1]. Split into:\n\n- 1 way as one letter (O).\n\n- 2 ways as two letters (split after first, or after second).\n\n- 1 way as three letters (split after each).\n\nTotal 4 ways.\n\nSo sum is 3 + 2 + 4 = 9. But the sample says 7. So this is conflicting. Therefore, my understanding is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts each unique sequence of letters once, regardless of how many times it appears. But that also doesn't fit the sample. For example, the sample lists 7 unique sequences, which matches the output.\n\nBut how do we get 7 from the above scenario?\n\nLet me think again. The note says that the answer is 7. The sample output after three steps is 7. The seven sequences are:\n\n1. T (from any single '1')\n\n2. M (from any '11')\n\n3. O (from '111')\n\n4. TT (from '11' as two Ts)\n\n5. TM (from '111' as T followed by M)\n\n6. MT (from '111' as M followed by T)\n\n7. TTT (from '111' as three Ts)\n\nSo the count is 7. But according to the previous approach, the sum would be 3 (for the single letters) + 2 (for the two-letter substrings) + 4 (for the three-letter substring) = 9. But the actual count is 7. So clearly, the problem is not counting all possible splits of all substrings. Instead, it's counting each unique sequence once, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is counting the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any substring of S. For example, in the sample, the sequences are T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT. That's 7 unique sequences. But how?\n\nBut then, how do we count that? For example, if there are two different substrings that can be split into the same sequence of letters, it's only counted once. But that seems unlikely given the sample's explanation. Because in the sample, the three '1's in the string are all the same letter, but they are counted as separate occurrences of the sequence \"T\". However, the sample's note lists \"T\" as one of the sequences. So perhaps the problem is counting the number of unique sequences, but that doesn't fit the sample's explanation. For example, the sample's note says that \"TT\" is counted once, even though there are two possible substrings of length 2 (each '11'), but each of those substrings can be split into \"TT\" once. So that would contribute two occurrences of the sequence \"TT\", but the note counts it once. But the sample output is 7, which suggests that each unique sequence is counted once. However, that's not the case in the note's example, because the sample says that \"TT\" is one of the sequences, but there are two substrings (each of length 2) that can be split into \"TT\". However, the sample output is 7, which implies that each unique sequence is counted once. But the sample says that \"TT\" is counted once. So that seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid letters. In other words, for each possible way to split any substring into valid letters, the resulting sequence is counted once if it hasn't been counted before. But this seems complicated and unlikely given the sample's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply counting the number of valid Morse code substrings. For example, in the sample:\n\nAfter three 1s, the valid Morse code substrings are:\n\nEach '1' (3), each '11' (2), and '111' (1). Total 6. But the sample output is 7. So that's not matching.\n\nWait the sample output for the first case is 7. Let's look at the note again. It says that the sequences are:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\nThat's seven sequences. So each of these is a distinct sequence of letters. But how many times do they appear in the string?\n\nFor example, \"T\" appears three times (each single '1'), but they are considered as one unique sequence. Similarly, \"TT\" appears once (as the first two '1's split into two Ts), but the same for the second two '1's. But the problem counts each occurrence as a separate sequence? No, because the sample output is 7, which is the number of unique sequences. However, the sample's explanation counts each occurrence of a sequence as a separate entry. For example, \"TT\" is counted once, but there are two different substrings (the first two 1s and the last two 1s) that can be split into \"TT\". But in the note, it's listed as one sequence. So that's not matching.\n\nI'm really confused here. Let's look back at the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nSo for example, if there's a substring that is \"11\", which is M, then that's one sequence (M). If another substring is \"11\", then that's also M. But since the problem says \"non-empty sequences\", perhaps each occurrence of a valid substring is considered as one sequence. So for example, in the first sample, after three 1s, the total number of valid substrings is 3 (single 1s) + 2 (two 1s) + 1 (three 1s) = 6. But the sample output is 7. So where is the seventh?\n\nAh! Wait, the sample output for the first case is 7, but the note says that the answer is 7. But according to the sample input, after three steps, the answer is 7. So maybe the problem is counting the number of valid substrings plus the number of ways to split them into sequences. Like, for each valid substring, count the number of ways to split it into letters. For example, for a substring of length 3 that is valid, like \"111\", there are 4 ways to split it into letters. So the total count would be for all substrings T of S, the number of ways to split T into valid letters. So for the sample:\n\nFor each substring:\n\nLength 1: 3 substrings. Each can be split in 1 way. Total 3.\n\nLength 2: 2 substrings. Each can be split in 1 way. Total 2.\n\nLength 3: 1 substring. Can be split in 4 ways. Total 4.\n\nSum is 3+2+4=9. But the sample says 7. So this doesn't add up.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look at the sample input and output again.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nAfter three steps, the output is 7. According to the note, the sequences are 7. So what's the correct way to arrive at 7?\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any substring of S. For example, in the sample:\n\n- The substring \"1\" can be split into T.\n\n- The substring \"11\" can be split into M.\n\n- The substring \"111\" can be split into O, TM, MT, TTT.\n\nSo the distinct sequences are T, M, O, TM, MT, TTT. That's 6. But the note says 7. What's missing?\n\nAh, the \"TT\" sequence. How is that formed? Well, the substring \"11\" can be split into two Ts. So that's another sequence. So now the count is 7. Oh! So the problem is counting all distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse codes. So for example, the substring \"11\" can be split into M (one way) or into TT (another way). Wait, but how? How can a substring be split into multiple ways?\n\nWait, for the substring \"11\", the possible splits are:\n\n- As a single letter (M).\n\n- As two letters (T and T).\n\nSo the sequences are M and TT. So for this substring, there are two different sequences. Hence, the total count would include both M and TT.\n\nSo for the sample, the total distinct sequences would be:\n\nFrom substrings of length 1:\n\nT (1 way).\n\nFrom substrings of length 2:\n\nM (from the substring \"11\"), TT (from splitting into two Ts).\n\nFrom substrings of length 3:\n\nO, TM, MT, TTT.\n\nSo the distinct sequences are T, M, TT, O, TM, MT, TTT. That's 7 sequences. Which matches the sample's note.\n\nAh! So the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code letters. Each such sequence is counted once, regardless of how many substrings or splits lead to it.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nThis seems very challenging. Because for each new character added to S, we need to consider all new substrings that end at this position, and for each of them, find all possible splits into valid Morse code letters, and collect the sequences generated by those splits, adding them to a set of unique sequences.\n\nBut for m=3000, this would be O(m^2) possible substrings, and for each substring, we'd have to generate all possible splits. But generating all possible splits for each substring would be expensive. However, perhaps there's a dynamic programming approach to track the number of unique sequences.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires us to count the number of unique sequences, not the total number of splits. So for example, if a substring can be split in multiple ways leading to the same sequence, it's only counted once.\n\nBut how do we track that? For example, suppose there are two different substrings that can be split into the same sequence. We need to count it once.\n\nThis seems very difficult, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about unique sequences, but about the number of possible splits of all substrings. Because in the sample, the total number of splits is 3 (from length 1) + 2 (from length 2) + 4 (from length 3) = 9. But the sample output is 7. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is counting the number of possible ways to split the entire string S into valid Morse code letters. For example, for the sample S=111, the number of ways to split the entire string into valid letters is 4. But the sample output is 7. So this is not matching.\n\nI think I'm missing something here. Let's re-examine the problem statement's example explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, after appending three 1s, the answer is 7. The note lists the seven sequences as follows:\n\n- \"T\" (from any single '1')\n\n- \"M\" (from any '11')\n\n- \"O\" (from '111')\n\n- \"TT\" (from '11' split into two Ts)\n\n- \"TM\" (from '111' split into T and M)\n\n- \"MT\" (from '111' split into M and T)\n\n- \"TTT\" (from '111' split into three Ts)\n\nSo each of these is a distinct sequence. But how many times do they appear?\n\nEach of these sequences is counted once, regardless of how many substrings or splits produce them. So the total is 7. Hence, the problem is asking for the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code letters.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find all such sequences. How can we compute this efficiently?\n\nBut for m=3000, and for each step, the string grows by one character, and we need to process all new substrings ending at the current position.\n\nFor example, when we add a new character to S, the new substrings are those ending at the new position. For each of these substrings, we can generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting them into valid Morse code letters, and add them to a global set of sequences.\n\nBut for each new character, the number of new substrings is O(m). For each of these substrings, we need to find all possible ways to split them into valid Morse codes, and for each split, record the sequence of letters. Then, the total number of unique sequences is the size of the set.\n\nBut how to generate the sequences for each substring?\n\nThis seems computationally intensive. For example, for a substring of length 4, there could be many ways to split it. But for m=3000, this approach might be feasible if optimized properly.\n\nBut how to represent the sequences? Since the letters are mapped to Morse codes, but the actual letters are not important; what's important is the sequence of Morse codes. Wait, no. Because the sequence of letters depends on the Morse codes. For example, each valid Morse code corresponds to a unique letter. So the sequence of letters is uniquely determined by the sequence of Morse codes. Thus, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct sequences of Morse code strings (of lengths 1-4, except the four forbidden ones) that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code strings.\n\nSo instead of thinking about letters, we can think of the Morse code strings. Each valid Morse code string is a sequence of 0s and 1s of length 1-4, not in the forbidden list. Then, the problem becomes counting the number of distinct sequences of such Morse code strings that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code strings.\n\nSo for example, in the sample, the valid Morse codes are:\n\nFor the first sample, the substrings are:\n\n- '1' (valid, as it's not in the forbidden list).\n\n- '11' (valid).\n\n- '111' (valid).\n\n- '1111' (invalid, but not present here).\n\nSo for the substring '11', it can be split into ['1', '1'] or ['11']. These correspond to two different sequences of Morse codes: ['1', '1'] and ['11']. These are two distinct sequences, so they contribute two different entries to the set.\n\nThus, the total number of sequences is the number of distinct sequences of valid Morse codes that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse codes.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this number after each step.\n\nThe key insight here is that for each new character added to the string, we can process all new substrings ending at that position. For each such substring, we can find all possible ways to split it into valid Morse codes and add the corresponding sequences to a global set. However, this approach may not be efficient enough for m=3000, but perhaps with memoization and dynamic programming, it can be optimized.\n\nBut how to represent the sequences? Since the sequences can be long, storing them as strings would be memory-intensive. However, considering that each Morse code is up to 4 characters, and the maximum length of S is 3000, the maximum possible length of a sequence is 3000 (if each character is a single Morse code). But for 3000 steps, this could be very large.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use dynamic programming to track for each position i in the string, all possible sequences of Morse codes that end at i. But how?\n\nLet me think. For each position i in the string, we can keep track of all possible sequences of Morse codes that can be formed by splitting the substring ending at i. For example, for the current position i, we can look back up to 4 positions (since Morse codes are up to length 4). For each possible j from i-1 down to i-4 (but not less than 0), we check if the substring S[j+1..i] is a valid Morse code. If it is, then we can take all sequences from position j and append this Morse code to them, forming new sequences. Additionally, we can have a sequence consisting of just this Morse code.\n\nBy doing this for each position, we can build up all possible sequences of Morse codes that can be formed by splitting any substring ending at i. Then, we can collect all these sequences into a global set and count their total number.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's formalize this idea.\n\nLet's define dp[i] as the set of all sequences of valid Morse codes that can be formed by splitting the substring ending at position i (i.e., the substring S[0..i]). However, since the problem considers all substrings, not just the entire string up to i, this approach might not capture all possible substrings. Wait, no. Because for any substring ending at i, say from position k to i, the sequences formed by splitting that substring would be captured in the dp[i] if we consider all possible k's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each position i, we can track all sequences that end at i. For example, for each i, we look back up to 4 positions (since Morse codes are up to length 4). For each possible length l (1-4), if the substring ending at i of length l is a valid Morse code, then:\n\n- We can add this Morse code as a new sequence (if it hasn't been seen before).\n\n- Additionally, for each sequence in dp[i-l], we can append this Morse code to form a new sequence.\n\nSo, for example, if there's a sequence A in dp[i-l], then combining A with the current Morse code gives a new sequence A + [current_morse_code].\n\nThis way, dp[i] contains all sequences that can be formed by splitting any substring ending at i.\n\nThen, the global set is the union of all sequences in dp[0], dp[1], ..., dp[m-1], where m is the current length of S.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that for each i, the number of sequences in dp[i] could be exponential in i, which would be impossible for m=3000. However, since the problem asks for the number of distinct sequences, and not the sequences themselves, perhaps we can track the count of distinct sequences using a hash set.\n\nBut even so, for m=3000, and each step adding O(4) possibilities, this could be manageable with memoization and pruning.\n\nLet me think of the steps for the first sample:\n\nInitially, S is empty. After first step, S is '1'.\n\nFor i=0 (assuming 0-based index), we check l=1. The substring is '1', which is valid. So dp[0] contains the sequence ['1']. Add this to the global set. The total count is 1.\n\nAfter second step, S is '11'.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nCheck l=1: substring is '1' (valid). So add ['1'] to dp[1]. Also, check l=2: substring is '11' (valid). So add ['11'] to dp[1]. Also, for l=2, we can look back to i-2 = -1, which is invalid. So for l=2, the sequence is ['11'].\n\nAdditionally, for l=1, we can look back to i-1=0. dp[0] contains ['1'], so we can append '1' to get ['1', '1'].\n\nSo dp[1] contains ['1'], ['11'], ['1', '1'].\n\nThese sequences are added to the global set. The total count is 3 (from previous 1, plus two new sequences: ['11'] and ['1','1']).\n\nAfter third step, S is '111'.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nCheck l=1: substring is '1' (valid). Look back to i-1=1. dp[1] contains sequences ['1'], ['11'], ['1','1']. Appending '1' to each gives ['1', '1'], ['11', '1'], ['1', '1', '1']. Also, the new sequence ['1'].\n\nCheck l=2: substring is '11' (valid). Look back to i-2=0. dp[0] contains ['1']. Appending gives ['1', '11']. Also, the sequence ['11'].\n\nCheck l=3: substring is '111' (valid). Look back to i-3 = -1. So add ['111'].\n\nSo for i=2, the new sequences added are:\n\n['1'], ['11'], ['111'], ['1', '1'], ['11', '1'], ['1', '1', '1'], ['1', '11'].\n\nBut some of these may already be present in the global set. For example, ['1'] was already present. ['11'] was already present. ['1', '1'] was already present. So adding new sequences would be ['111'], ['11', '1'], ['1', '1', '1'], ['1', '11'].\n\nSo the total number of unique sequences increases by 4, making the total count 3 (previous) + 4 = 7, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. Now, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n- Maintain a global set of sequences. But storing sequences as tuples (since lists are not hashable) would be necessary for the set.\n\n- For each step, when appending a new character to S, process the new position i (current length - 1).\n\n- For each possible l in 1 to 4 (but ensuring that i - l + 1 >= 0):\n\n   - Check if the substring S[i-l+1 ... i] is a valid Morse code (i.e., not in the forbidden list).\n\n   - If it is valid:\n\n      - Create a new sequence consisting of this Morse code alone.\n\n      - Also, for each sequence in dp[i-l], append this Morse code to form new sequences.\n\n      - Add all these new sequences to the global set.\n\n- Maintain dp[i] as the set of sequences that end at position i. However, for efficiency, we can track for each i, the set of sequences that can be formed ending at i. But since we are only interested in the global set of all sequences, perhaps we can avoid storing dp[i] and instead, during processing, generate the new sequences and add them to the global set.\n\nBut this would require, for each new valid Morse code, to look back to previous positions and combine with existing sequences.\n\nHowever, for large m, this could be computationally intensive. But with m up to 3000 and for each i, checking up to 4 possible l's, and for each l, combining with sequences from dp[i-l], this might be manageable.\n\nBut how to represent the sequences in a way that allows us to track them efficiently. Since sequences can be long, but the number of unique sequences may not be too large, perhaps using tuples and a global set is feasible.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n- Precompute the forbidden Morse codes: {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}.\n\n- Maintain a global set called 'all_sequences' which stores tuples of Morse code strings.\n\n- Maintain a dynamic programming array, where dp[i] is a set of tuples representing sequences that end at position i.\n\n- For each step, append the new character to S, then for the current i (which is the new length minus 1), process possible l in 1 to 4:\n\n   - For each l, check if the substring of length l ending at i is valid.\n\n   - If valid, then:\n\n      - Take the current Morse code string (say, code).\n\n     ",

The solution involves efficiently tracking valid Morse code substrings and their possible sequences using dynamic programming and set operations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Forbidden Morse Codes**: Identify the four forbidden Morse code strings that do not correspond to any English letters.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP array where each entry keeps track of all valid sequences of Morse codes ending at that position.\n3. **Set Operations**: Maintain a global set to store all unique sequences of Morse codes encountered.

This helps in building sequences incrementally.\n4. **Processing Each Character**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible substrings ending at the current position. For each valid substring, generate new sequences by combining it with existing sequences from previous positions.\n5. **Global Set**: This set maintains all unique sequences encountered, ensuring each sequence is counted only once, even if it appears multiple times in different substrings.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences using dynamic programming and set operations, ensuring that we count all unique sequences of Morse codes that can be formed from the substrings of the dynamically growing string.
