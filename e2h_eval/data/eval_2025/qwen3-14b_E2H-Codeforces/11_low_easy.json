A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires per friend: nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters, so for one toast, each of the n friends needs that. So total for one toast is n * nl ml of drink. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And for salt, per toast, each friend needs np grams, so total n * np grams per toast.\n\nSo the total number of toasts possible is determined by the minimum of:\n\n- total_drink / (n * nl)\n- total_lime_slices / n\n- total_salt / (n * np)\n\nBut each of these calculations must be integer division, since you can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\nWait, but how do we calculate the total available for each resource?\n\nTotal drink is k * l. Total lime slices is c * d. Total salt is p.\n\nSo for each resource, compute how many toasts can be made with that resource, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nWait, but for example, the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nTotal drink is 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. For the first sample, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So total toasts possible from drink is 20 / 9 = 2.222..., which truncates to 2.\n\nThen the limes: total slices is 10 * 8 =80. Each toast requires n slices (since each friend needs a slice). So 3 slices per toast. 80 /3 is 26.666..., which truncates to 26. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait in the note, they say that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, there are n slices needed. So the total number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n. Because each toast uses n slices. So for the first sample, 80 slices divided by 3 per toast gives 26.666, which is 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that doesn't match. Wait what's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". Wait that seems to suggest that each toast requires one slice. But that's not possible because there are 3 friends. So each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow for 80 /3 = 26 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend has one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So total number of toasts possible from the limes is (c * d) // n. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the first example, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that (c*d) is 80, and n is 3.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - Total drink available is calculated as the product of the number of bottles and the milliliters per bottle.\n   - Total lime slices available is calculated as the product of the number of limes and the slices per lime.\n   - Salt available is given directly.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available drink. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available lime slices. Each toast requires `n` slices.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available salt. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value of the constraints calculated from the available resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    inputs = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the values\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = inputs\n    \n    # Calculate total resources\n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum possible toasts for each resource\n    toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    toasts_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of these three\n    print(min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers representing the problem parameters.\n- **Resource Calculation**: The total available resources (drink, lime slices, salt) are computed based on the given inputs.\n- **Toast Constraints**: For each resource, the number of toasts that can be made is calculated using integer division, considering the requirements per toast for all friends.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value of the three constraints, ensuring that all resources are sufficient for the number of toasts calculated.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging integer division and ensures that all constraints are respected, providing the correct maximum number of toasts each friend can make.",
