A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs and what each part contributes.\n\nThe inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, first, calculate how much total drink they have. That's k * l milliliters. Each toast requires each friend to have nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends uses nl for their toast. So the total number of toasts possible based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Wait, but since each toast is per friend, maybe I need to think differently. Wait, no. For each toast, each friend has one portion. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So the total number of toasts possible from the drink is total_drink = (k*l) divided by (n * nl), integer division.\n\nThen, the lime slices. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Total slices available is c * d. So the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt, each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, total salt needed is n * np. The total available is p grams. So the number of toasts possible from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources must be sufficient. So the maximum possible toasts per friend is the minimum of the three computed values.\n\nWait, but let me check the example given. Let's take the first sample input:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4 *5 =20 ml. Each toast requires 3 *3 =9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. So for the first sample, nl is 3. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. Total drink is 20. 20 /9 is 2.222..., so integer division gives 2. Which matches the note's explanation.\n\nThe limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each. 10*8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (since n=3). So 80 /3 is 26.666..., integer division is 26. But wait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check the note again.\n\nIn the first sample note: the limes are enough for 10 *8=80 toasts. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So per toast, each friend has one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So total number of toasts possible from the lime slices is (c*d) divided by n. So in the first sample, 10*8=80 slices. Divided by 3 friends per toast. 80 /3 is 26.666, which would be 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to my calculation, it's 80 /3 = 26.666. So why does the note say 80?\n\nAh, wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. Therefore, for one toast, you need n slices. So for t toasts, you need t * n slices. So the maximum t is (c*d) // (n). So in the first",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Drink Available**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle to get the total amount of drink.\n2. **Determine Toasts Based on Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink.\n3. **Calculate Total Lime Slices Available**: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime to get the total number of slices.\n4. **Determine Toasts Based on Limes**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total lime slices available. Each toast requires `n` slices.\n5. **Determine Toasts Based on Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt.\n6. **Find Minimum Value**: The answer is the minimum value among the three calculated values from the drink, limes, and salt.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    inputs = list(map(int, line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the parameters\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = inputs\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available (k * l)\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Number of toasts possible from drink: total_drink // (n * nl)\n    toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available (c * d)\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Number of toasts possible from limes: total_lime_slices // n\n    toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    \n    # Calculate salt available (p)\n    # Number of toasts possible from salt: p // (n * np)\n    toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of these three\n    result = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles (`k`) by the milliliters per bottle (`l`). This total is then divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends (`n * nl`) to determine how many toasts can be made based on drink availability.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is determined by multiplying the number of limes (`c`) by the number of slices per lime (`d`). This total is then divided by the number of friends (`n`) to determine how many toasts can be made based on the available lime slices.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available (`p`) is divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends (`n * np`) to determine how many toasts can be made based on salt availability.\n- **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum value of the three calculated values, as each resource limits the number of toasts that can be made. This ensures that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource constraints.",
