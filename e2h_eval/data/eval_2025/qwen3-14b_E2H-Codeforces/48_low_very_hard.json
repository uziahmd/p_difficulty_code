            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b can be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, handling the case when b is 'R' which means Roman numerals.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps required:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has a and b (or R), second line has the number c in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n3. Then, convert that decimal integer to base b. If b is R, then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as usual, using letters for digits above 9 (like A for 10, etc.)\n\nSo the main steps are converting from base a to decimal, then converting from decimal to base b or Roman.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, if a is 10 and c is '001', that's 1 in decimal. But since the input can be up to 10^3 characters long, we need to handle large numbers. However, since in the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000 in decimal. Otherwise, it's up to 1e15. So for converting to decimal, we need to process the string correctly.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion from base a to decimal? Well, for each character in the string, we can compute its value, then multiply by a^position and sum. But since the string can be up to 10^3 characters, for a base up to 25, the decimal number could be very large. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not a problem.\n\nWait, but for cases where the input is converted to decimal, and then converted to another base. For example, if a is 2 and c is a very long string of 1's, then converting to decimal would be a huge number, but when converting to base b (say 10), it's manageable as Python handles big integers.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the input string c into a decimal integer.\n\nSo for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, then that's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo for converting the string c to decimal, each character in the string represents a digit in base a. So for each character, we need to get its value. For example, if the character is 'A', it's 10, 'B' is 11, etc. But the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. So the code needs to process each character in the string, converting it to its numeric value.\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal would be something like:\n\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor char in c:\n    digit_value = int(char) if char.isdigit() else ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n    decimal_value = decimal_value * a + digit_value\n\nWait, but the input c is in base a, so each digit must be between 0 and a-1. So the problem says that the input is valid. So the code can assume that each character in c is a valid digit for base a.\n\nBut how to handle the case when the input is '0'? Well, the note says that if Roman is involved, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the input can be zero. For example, if the input is '0' in base 10, then converting to base 2 would be '0'. However, the problem says that the input c may have leading zeros, but the output must omit leading zeros. So for the output, if the converted value is zero, then output '0'.\n\nNow, after converting c to decimal, the next step is to convert it to base b, which could be a number or 'R'.\n\nSo, for the case where b is not 'R', we need to convert the decimal number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for digits >=10. Also, the output must not have leading zeros. For example, if the decimal value is 0, output '0'.\n\nFor the case where b is 'R', we need to convert the decimal number to Roman numerals. But according to the problem statement, the input will ensure that if Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000 and not zero.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Parse the input a and b (with possible R).\n- Parse the input c as a string in base a, convert it to decimal.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, where `b` can be either a numerical base or Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer, and then converting that decimal integer to the target base `b`.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Convert from Base `a` to Decimal**: \n   - Parse the input string `c` which is in base `a` and convert it to a decimal integer. This involves processing each character of the string, converting it to its corresponding value, and accumulating the result using the base `a`.\n\n2. **Convert from Decimal to Target Base `b`**:\n   - If `b` is a numerical base (not 'R'), convert the decimal integer to the specified base using standard base conversion techniques. This involves repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders, which are then converted to the appropriate characters (digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases greater than 10).\n   - If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman symbols and applying the subtractive principle where necessary.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef from_decimal(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        parts = line.strip().split('\\n')\n        a_b_part = parts[0].split()\n        a = int(a_b_part[0])\n        b = a_b_part[1]\n        c = parts[1]\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c, a)\n        \n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = to_roman(decimal_val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            result = from_decimal(decimal_val, base)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input string `c`, converting it to its corresponding value in base `a` and accumulating the result into a decimal integer.\n\n2. **Conversion from Decimal to Base `b`**: The function `from_decimal` handles the conversion of a decimal integer to a specified base. It uses repeated division and modulus operations to determine each digit in the target base, converting digits greater than 9 to their corresponding letters.\n\n3. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The function `to_roman` converts a decimal integer to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, applying the subtractive principle where necessary (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including large numbers and the special case of Roman numeral conversion.",
