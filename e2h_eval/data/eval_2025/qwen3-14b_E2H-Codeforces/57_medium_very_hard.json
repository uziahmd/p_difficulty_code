His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher has the first and second tour points, but not the names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each participant has exactly one a and one b, right? Wait no, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, there's a first tour score and a second tour score, but the lists are given in arbitrary order. Oh wait, no. Wait the input is: the second line is a1...an, which are the first tour points of the participants. Third line is b1...bn, the second tour points. But the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for example, the first participant's first tour score is a1, but their second tour score could be any of the b's. Wait no, no. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each participant has a first tour and second tour score. But the lists are given in arbitrary order. So for example, the first list is a1...an, which are the first tour scores of all participants, but the second list is the second tour scores of all participants, but they are not necessarily in the same order. So for example, participant 1 has a1 in first tour and some b_j in the second tour. But the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i pairs with which b_j. But Vasya is one of the participants, and his total is at least x. So the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings of a_i and b_j such that there exists at least one pairing where some a_i + b_j >=x (but the problem says it's guaranteed that such a pairing exists).\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because the actual pairing of a's and b's determines the total points for each participant. The problem is that the teacher has to assign each a_i to a unique b_j, so that each participant has exactly one a and one b. Then, for each such possible assignment, we can compute the total points for each participant, then determine Vasya's rank (assuming that he has a total of at least x). However, since the teacher doesn't know which a and b belong to Vasya, we need to consider all possible possibilities where there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, and then find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in that scenario.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nThe key is that for the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he can be as high as possible), and for the worst possible rank, minimize his total (so that others can have higher totals, pushing him down).\n\nWait, but no. Because the best possible rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. Wait, but how to model that.\n\nLet me think again. For the best possible rank, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. But how?\n\nActually, the best possible rank for Vasya is when he has the maximum possible total (so that he can be first), and others are arranged in a way that as many as possible have lower totals than him. Similarly, the worst possible rank is when his total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and others are arranged to have higher totals than him as much as possible.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nFirst, for the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to select a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, arrange the rest of the pairings such that as few people as possible have a higher total than Vasya.\n\nBut since the rest of the pairings can be arranged in any way, the best case for Vasya's rank is when his total is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. So the best possible rank is 1 if there's a way for Vasya to have the maximum possible total.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is determined by the number of participants who can have a total strictly greater than Vasya's total. So, if we can choose Vasya's total as high as possible, then the number of people with higher totals would be minimized.\n\nSo for the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, count how many other participants can have a total higher than this value. But since the rest of the pairings can be arranged in any way, how do we find the minimal possible number of people with higher totals?\n\nWait, but the rest of the pairings can be arranged such that as few as possible people have higher totals than Vasya's total. For example, if Vasya's total is S, then the number of people that can have a higher total is the number of pairs (a_k, b_l) (where k and l are not used in Vasya's pair) that can sum to more than S. But since we can arrange the pairings, perhaps we can pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that minimizes the number of people with higher totals than S.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's total is as high as possible. Let's say we pick the maximum possible S = a_i + b_j where a_i and b_j are from the two lists. Then, the best possible rank is 1 if there are no other participants that can have a total higher than S. But since the other participants' totals depend on how we pair the remaining a's and b's, perhaps we can arrange them so that none of them have a higher total than S.\n\nWait, but how? For example, if there's another pair (a_k, b_l) that sums to more than S, then even if you pair them, that person would have a higher total than Vasya. But if we can avoid that, but how?\n\nWait, but if we have chosen Vasya's pair as the maximum possible, then any other pair can't have a higher sum. Because if there is a pair (a_k, b_l) that sums to more than S, then that would contradict the fact that S was the maximum possible. Therefore, if we take the maximum possible S for Vasya, then there are no other pairs that can have a higher sum than S. Therefore, in that case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but how can we ensure that? Because when we pair the other a's and b's, maybe some of them can have higher sums. But if we have already selected the maximum possible S for Vasya, then the maximum possible sum of any other pair is less than or equal to S. Wait, no. Suppose we have two a's and two b's. For example, a = [3, 1], b = [3, 1]. The maximum possible sum for Vasya is 3+3=6. But if you pair the remaining a (1) with the remaining b (1), then that's 2. So no other participant has a higher sum. But if you have a = [3, 2], b = [3, 2]. Then the maximum sum is 3+3=6. But if you pair the remaining a (2) with the remaining b (2), that gives 4. So no one else has higher than 6.\n\nWait, but if you have a = [5, 3], b = [4, 3]. Then the maximum sum is 5+4=9. If you pair the remaining a (3) with remaining b (3) gives 6. So no one else has higher than 9. So yes, if we choose for Vasya the maximum possible sum, then there's no other participant that can have a higher sum than that. Because any other possible pair would have a sum less than or equal to that maximum.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because the maximum possible sum is the maximum of all a_i + b_j. So if you have that as Vasya's sum, then any other pair (a_i, b_j) cannot have a higher sum than that. Because that's the maximum. Therefore, if we can assign Vasya's pair as the maximum possible sum, then the best possible rank is 1. Because there's no one else with a higher sum.\n\nBut then, the best possible rank is 1. Unless there are other people with the same sum as Vasya. But in that case, the jury can assign the rank as 1. Because the problem says that if there are ties, the jury can assign the places as they like. So for best possible rank, Vasya can be placed first even if others have same sum.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1. But wait, what if there are multiple pairs that sum to the same maximum? For example, if there are multiple pairs that sum to the same maximum, then Vasya can be placed first. So regardless of how many others have the same sum, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is always 1? But that's not possible. Let me check the sample input.\n\nIn the first sample input, all participants have 1 in a and 1 in b. So each participant's total is 2. So Vasya's best possible rank is 1, and worst is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo in this case, the best possible is 1, which aligns with the idea that choosing maximum sum (which is 2) and then the jury can place him first.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1 if there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) that sums to at least x. But the problem says that it is guaranteed that such a pair exists.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the actual pairing is unknown. So for the best possible rank, the teacher can choose the pairing where Vasya has the maximum possible sum (so that he can be first).\n\nBut then why in the second sample, the best possible is 1? Let's check the second sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n6 7\n4 3 5 6 4 4\n8 6 0 4 3 4\n\nSo the a array is [4,3,5,6,4,4], and b array is [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nThe maximum possible sum for Vasya would be 6 + 8 = 14? Or maybe 4 + 8 = 12? Wait, let's see. The maximum possible sum is the maximum a_i plus maximum b_j. Let's see:\n\nThe a array has elements 4,3,5,6,4,4. The maximum is 6.\n\nThe b array has elements 8,6,0,4,3,4. The maximum is 8. So 6+8=14. But is there a pair that gives that sum? Yes, if a_i is 6 (the fourth element) and b_j is 8 (the first element). So Vasya could have 14 points. Then, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output where the best is 1.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1, provided that there's a way for Vasya to have the maximum possible sum. Which is always possible, as per the problem's note that it's guaranteed that there's a pair with sum >=x. So, for the best possible rank, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a case where even though there is a pair with sum >=x, but when you assign that pair to Vasya, there are other participants with higher sums. But how?\n\nNo. Because the maximum possible sum is achieved by that pair. So if you assign that pair to Vasya, then no other participant can have a higher sum than that. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is always 1. Unless there is a case where even the maximum possible sum is not enough. But the problem says that it's guaranteed that there is at least one pair with sum >=x. So for the best case, the answer is 1. So the first part of the output is always 1.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the sample input. Wait no, the sample input outputs 1 for best in both cases. So maybe that's correct.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1. So the first part of the output is always 1. But why?\n\nBut wait, suppose there's a scenario where Vasya's sum is the maximum, but there are other people with the same sum. Then the jury can assign him first place. So yes, the best possible is 1.\n\nSo that's the best possible rank. Therefore, the first part of the output is always 1.\n\nNow, the second part is the worst possible rank. That's more complex.\n\nTo find the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of participants that can have a total greater than or equal to Vasya's total. But since Vasya's total must be at least x, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other pairings so that as many as possible participants have a higher total than Vasya.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nLet me think. For the worst case, we need to select a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, and then arrange the rest of the pairings in a way that as many as possible participants have a sum greater than or equal to Vasya's sum.\n\nBut since the jury can arrange the ranks in any way for ties, the worst possible rank would be the number of participants that have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1. But to maximize this number, we need to minimize Vasya's sum (as low as possible, but >=x) and arrange the other pairings to have as many as possible participants with sum >= Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, but how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nFor the worst possible rank:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible value of S (Vasya's total) that is >=x, and then find the maximum number of participants that can have a total >= S. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1 (if there are k participants with total > S, then Vasya's rank is k+1; but if there are m participants with total >= S, then depending on the jury's choice, he could be placed as low as m-th place).\n\nWait, but the problem says that when there are ties, the jury can assign the places as they like. So for the worst possible rank, we need to assume that all participants with a sum >= S are placed before Vasya. So the worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have a sum >= S, plus 1 (if there are m participants with sum >= S, then Vasya could be placed m+1-th).\n\nBut how to find the minimal S (>=x) such that there exists a pairing where Vasya has S, and the rest of the pairings are arranged to maximize the number of participants with sum >= S.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, for the worst possible rank, we can think of the following approach:\n\nFind the minimal possible S (>=x) that Vasya can have. Then, calculate how many participants can have a sum >= S. The worst possible rank would be that count + 1 (if all those participants are placed above Vasya).\n\nBut how to find the minimal S.\n\nWait, but S can be as low as x. So perhaps the worst case is when Vasya has exactly x, and as many others as possible have a sum >=x.\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=x, given that there's a pairing where Vasya has sum >=x.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be rephrased as follows: For the worst case, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a total sum >= some S (where S is >=x), and S is the minimal possible value for Vasya's sum.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother approach: To find the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut to maximize this number, we need to choose Vasya's sum as low as possible (but >=x), and arrange the other pairings such that as many as possible participants have a sum higher than that.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nFind the minimal S (>=x) such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j = S, and then compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum > S, given that the rest of the pairs are arranged optimally.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible S for Vasya. Since S must be >=x, the minimal S is x. But is there a pairing where Vasya has exactly x? Well, the problem says that there is at least one pair with sum >=x. So if there's a pair with sum exactly x, then that's possible. Otherwise, the minimal S would be the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nBut perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (i.e., the minimal possible value that is >=x). Once we have that value, we need to compute how many participants can have a sum higher than that. Then the worst rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed for the worst case:\n\nStep 1: Find the minimal possible S that Vasya can have, such that S >=x. Let's call this S_min.\n\nStep 2: For this S_min, find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum > S_min. Then, the worst possible rank is (number of participants with sum > S_min) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute S_min and the maximum number of participants with sum > S_min.\n\nBut how to find S_min. Well, S_min is the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. But since we can choose any pair for Vasya, S_min would be the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nBut how to find that. Well, we can sort the a and b arrays, and find the minimal sum >=x. For example, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x, and then take the minimal among all those.\n\nBut that's O(n^2) in the worst case, which is not feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to find the minimal possible S >=x.\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case scenario, we can choose S to be x. But if there is no pair that sums to exactly x, then perhaps the minimal possible S is the smallest sum >=x.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, the minimal possible S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Let's find that sum, and then compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum > S.\n\nSo, how to find the minimal S >=x.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the minimal sum >=x between a_i and b_j.\n\nBut since the a and b arrays are unsorted, perhaps we can sort one array and use binary search on the other.\n\nFor example, sort the a array. For each element in the b array, find the minimal a_i such that a_i + b_j >=x. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, sort the a array, and for each element in the b array, find the minimal a_i that when added to it is >=x. Then take the minimal of all such combinations.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, this would be O(n log n) time.\n\nLet me think. Sort a in ascending order. Then, for each b_j, find the minimal a_i such that a_i >= (x - b_j). Since a is sorted, we can perform a binary search for each b_j. For each b_j, the minimal a_i that can be paired with it to reach x is the first a_i >= (x - b_j). Then, the sum would be a_i + b_j. We can collect all these possible sums and take the minimal one.\n\nBut since we need to find the minimal possible S >=x, this approach would work.\n\nOnce we find S_min, then the next step is to find how many participants can have a sum > S_min, given that we have to pair the a and b arrays such that one of the pairs is (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = S_min.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S_min.\n\nBut how to model this. Because after choosing one pair (for Vasya) with sum S_min, we need to pair the remaining a's and b's in such a way that as many as possible of the other pairs have sum > S_min.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nThis seems like a problem of matching the remaining a and b arrays to maximize the number of pairs with sum > S_min.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of maximum matching where we want to pair elements from two arrays such that as many pairs as possible have sum > K. Here, K is S_min.\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of such pairs.\n\nThis is a classic problem. The approach is to sort one array in ascending order and the other in descending order, then greedily pair them.\n\nFor example, sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i and b_j, pair them and check if their sum exceeds K. This is a standard greedy approach for maximum matching.\n\nWait, here's the idea: To maximize the number of pairs with sum > K, we can sort the a array in ascending order and the b array in descending order. Then, for each i, pair a[i] with b[i], and check if their sum is > K. The number of such pairs is the maximum possible.\n\nBut how to confirm this approach.\n\nYes, this is a known greedy algorithm for the problem of maximum number of pairs with sum greater than a certain value. For example, in the problem where you have two arrays and you want to pair elements such that as many as possible pairs have sum > K.\n\nSo, for example, if you sort a in ascending and b in descending, then for each i, you pair the smallest available a with the largest available b. If their sum is > K, then you can take this pair, and proceed. Otherwise, you can't take any pair with this a, because even the largest available b can't make it.\n\nThis approach gives the maximum possible number of pairs.\n\nSo, for our case, once we have S_min, we need to compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > S_min. Then, since one of these pairs is Vasya's (which is exactly S_min), the maximum number of participants with sum > S_min is the number of pairs found by the above method minus 0 (since Vasya's pair is not counted here, because his sum is S_min and not > S_min). Wait, no. Because when we compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min, that includes all participants except Vasya. But since we have to reserve one pair (for Vasya) with sum S_min, we need to adjust the calculation accordingly.\n\nWait, here's the problem. Suppose that in the original problem, we have n participants. We need to pair all a and b elements. One of the pairs is Vasya's (with sum S_min). The rest of the pairs are other participants. So, the maximum number of participants with sum > S_min is equal to the maximum number of pairs (excluding Vasya's pair) that can have sum > S_min. But how to compute that.\n\nBut how to account for the fact that one pair (Vasya's) is fixed to have sum S_min, and the rest can be arranged optimally.\n\nBut this complicates things. How to model this.\n\nAlternative approach: For the worst case, we can imagine that Vasya's pair is chosen such that his sum is S_min (the minimal possible sum >=x), and then the rest of the pairs are arranged to maximize the number of participants with sum > S_min.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nBut perhaps, the maximum number of participants with sum > S_min is equal to the maximum number of pairs (from all n pairs) that can have sum > S_min, minus 0 or 1, depending on whether the pair that contributes to that maximum includes Vasya's pair.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's find the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > S_min. Let's call this M. Then, since Vasya's pair is sum S_min, which is not > S_min, then the maximum number of participants with sum > S_min is M. Because all those M pairs are from other participants. Hence, the worst possible rank for Vasya would be M + 1.\n\nBut how to compute M.\n\nBut how to compute M, given that we have to pair all a and b arrays into n pairs. Because the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min is M, but we need to ensure that there's at least one pair (Vasya's) with sum >=x (which is S_min). But since S_min is >=x, and the problem guarantees that there exists such a pair, then it's possible.\n\nBut how to compute M. Let's think of it as follows: the maximum possible number of pairs with sum > S_min, regardless of how we pair the a and b arrays.\n\nOnce we find that number M, then the worst possible rank for Vasya is M + 1 (since there are M participants with higher sum than him, and he is placed after them).\n\nBut how to compute M.\n\nAs discussed earlier, we can use the greedy approach of sorting a in ascending order and b in descending order, and then counting how many pairs have sum > S_min.\n\nBut this is only possible if we can pair the a and b arrays in such a way that M pairs have sum > S_min. However, we also need to ensure that there exists at least one pair (for Vasya) with sum >=x (which is S_min). But since S_min is chosen as the minimal possible sum >=x, and the problem says that there exists such a pair, this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to proceed:\n\nOnce we have S_min, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the maximum number of pairs (M) that can be formed between a and b such that their sum is > S_min.\n\nThen, the worst possible rank is M + 1.\n\nBut how to compute M.\n\nSo, the steps for the worst case are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible S_min >=x that can be formed by any pair (a_i, b_j).\n\n2. Compute M, the maximum number of pairs (from all possible pairings) that can have sum > S_min.\n\nThen, the worst possible rank is M + 1.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find S_min.\n\nLet me think about how to compute S_min.\n\nTo find the minimal possible sum >=x that can be formed by a_i + b_j.\n\nWe can do this by sorting the a array, and for each element in the b array, find the minimal a_i such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, take the minimal of all these possible a_i + b_j.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can sort both arrays and use a two-pointer approach.\n\nFor example, sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x, and track the minimal sum.\n\nAlternatively, sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j (using binary search) such that b_j >= (x - a_i). The sum would be a_i + b_j. The minimal sum across all such possibilities is S_min.\n\nYes, that's a possible approach.\n\nLet me outline the code steps for finding S_min:\n\nSort a and b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize S_min to a very large value.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   target = x - a_i\n\n   find the smallest b_j >= target (using binary search in the sorted b array)\n\n   if such a b_j exists:\n\n       current_sum = a_i + b_j\n\n       if current_sum < S_min:\n\n           S_min = current_sum\n\nSo, after checking all a_i, S_min will be the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut what if there are multiple b_j for a given a_i? We take the minimal one, which gives the minimal sum for that a_i.\n\nThis approach would give us the minimal possible S_min.\n\nOnce S_min is found, then compute M, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min.\n\nTo compute M, we can use the greedy approach:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then, for each i from 0 to n-1, check if a[i] + b[i] > S_min. Count how many such pairs.\n\nBut wait, why this approach?\n\nBecause by pairing the smallest a with the largest b, we can maximize the chances of getting a sum > S_min. For example, if we have a_i sorted ascending and b_j sorted descending, then for each a_i, we try to pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet. This is a standard approach for maximizing the number of pairs with sum > K.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose a is [1, 2, 3], b is [4, 5, 6], and K is 5. So, we want pairs with sum >5. The maximum number is 2: (1+6=7), (2+5=7), (3+4=7). All three pairs. But using the approach of sorting a ascending and b descending, we pair 1 with 6, 2 with 5, 3 with 4. All three pairs have sum >5. So the count is 3.\n\nAnother example: a is [1, 1, 1], b is [1, 1, 1], K is 1. Then, all pairs have sum 2>1. So count is 3.\n\nAnother example: a is [1, 2], b is [3, 4], K is 4. Then, possible pairs: (1+4=5>4) and (2+3=5>4) → count 2. Using the approach, a sorted ascending [1,2], b sorted descending [4,3]. Pair 1+4>4, 2+3>4 → count 2.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nSo, the steps to compute M are:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order.\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nFor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   if a[i] + b[i] > S_min:\n\n       count +=1\n\nSo, this gives the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > S_min.\n\nOnce we have count, then the worst possible rank is count + 1.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, let's test this approach.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nS_min is 2 (since each a_i + b_j is 2).\n\nCompute M: sort a ascending (same as before), sort b descending (same as before). For each i, a[i] + b[i] = 2. Which is not > S_min (2). So count is 0. Thus, worst rank is 0 +1 =1. But according to the sample, the worst possible rank is 5. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, this indicates a problem with the approach.\n\nWait, what's happening here. In the first sample input, S_min is 2. Then, when trying to compute M (the maximum number of pairs with sum > 2), since all pairs sum to exactly 2, M is zero. Hence, worst rank is 0 + 1 = 1. But according to the sample, the worst possible rank is 5. So clearly, this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo there's a flaw in my reasoning. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, because in the first sample, all pairs have sum exactly 2. So S_min is 2. Now, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min (2) is zero. Hence, the worst possible rank is 0 + 1 = 1. But the sample output says 5. So clearly, my reasoning is wrong.\n\nWhat's the mistake here?\n\nAh, because the worst possible rank depends on how many participants have sum >= Vasya's sum. Because when there are ties, the jury can arrange the ranks. So, for the worst possible rank, we need to count the number of participants that have sum >= S_min, and then the worst possible rank is that number.\n\nBut in the first sample, all participants have sum exactly 2 (S_min is 2). So the number of participants with sum >= S_min is 5. Hence, the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nSo the previous approach was incorrect. It considered only participants with sum > S_min, but in reality, the worst possible rank depends on the number of participants with sum >= S_min.\n\nSo the correct approach for the worst case is:\n\nOnce we have S_min, the worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min, plus 1 if there are participants with sum strictly greater than S_min.\n\nWait, no. Because the worst possible rank is when as many as possible participants have sum >= S_min, and Vasya is placed last among them. So, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >= S_min.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nIn the first sample, all participants have sum >= S_min (which is 2), so the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nIn the second sample, let's think. Suppose S_min is 7. Let's say that the worst case scenario is when Vasya has sum 7, and others have as many as possible sum >=7.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min. Then, the worst possible rank is that number.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min, given that we have to pair all a and b arrays into n pairs, and one of the pairs is Vasya's with sum S_min.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of pairs (from all possible pairings) that can have sum >= S_min. Then, since Vasya's pair is one of them, the maximum number is that count. Hence, the worst possible rank is that count.\n\nBut how to compute that count.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min (2) is 5. Hence, the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nIn the second sample, let's think. Suppose S_min is 7. How many pairs can have sum >=7?\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nThis is a new problem: given two arrays a and b, find the maximum number of pairs (after pairing all elements) such that each pair has sum >= K.\n\nThis is similar to the previous problem, but now the condition is sum >= K instead of sum > K.\n\nHow to solve this.\n\nAgain, the approach is to sort one array and use a greedy method. For example, sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then pair them and count how many pairs have sum >= K.\n\nLet me test this approach on the first sample. a is [1,1,1,1,1], sorted ascending. b is [1,1,1,1,1], sorted descending. Each pair is 1+1=2 >=2. So count is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose a = [1, 2], b = [3, 4], K = 3. The maximum number of pairs with sum >=3 is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1, 2], b = [1, 2], K = 3. The pairs can be (1+2=3) and (2+1=3), so count is 2.\n\nIf K is 4, then the maximum number of pairs is 1 (e.g., 2+2=4).\n\nSo, the approach for counting the maximum number of pairs with sum >= K is to sort a ascending and b descending, then pair each a[i] with b[i], and count how many pairs have sum >= K.\n\nThus, for the worst case scenario, the steps are:\n\nOnce S_min is found, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min. Let's call this C. Then, the worst possible rank is C.\n\nBut why? Because in this case, there are C participants with sum",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total score from two tours. The solution involves efficiently calculating these ranks using sorting and greedy strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: \n   - The best possible rank is always 1 because Vasya can be assigned the highest possible total score from any combination of the first and second tour scores. This ensures he is at the top of the rankings.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**:\n   - To determine the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimum possible total score (S_min) that Vasya can achieve while still meeting the minimum score requirement (x). This is done by finding the smallest sum of pairs from the first and second tour scores that is at least x.\n   - Once S_min is determined, we then calculate the maximum number of participants who can have a total score greater than or equal to S_min. This is achieved using a greedy approach where we sort one array in ascending order and the other in descending order, then pair elements to maximize the count of valid sums.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    idx += n\n\n    # Best possible rank is always 1\n    best = 1\n\n    # Find S_min\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    S_min = float('inf')\n\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = x - ai\n        # Find the first b_j >= target\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, target)\n        if pos < len(b_sorted):\n            current_sum = ai + b_sorted[pos]\n            if current_sum < S_min:\n                S_min = current_sum\n    # Now compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min\n    # Sort a in ascending, b in descending\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a_asc[i] + b_desc[i] >= S_min:\n            count += 1\n    worst = count\n\n    print(f\"{best} {worst}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants, the minimum score requirement, and the scores from the two tours.\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: The best possible rank is always 1 as Vasya can be assigned the highest possible score.\n- **Finding Minimum Valid Score (S_min)**: Using binary search, we determine the smallest valid score (S_min) that meets the minimum requirement.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: By sorting one array in ascending order and the other in descending order, we use a greedy approach to count how many participants can have a score greater than or equal to S_min, which gives the worst possible rank.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation even for large input sizes, leveraging sorting and binary search for optimal performance.",
