He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine for each given string whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The input gives me all the improper prefixes and suffixes of s, but I don't know which is which. My task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible s that fits.\n\nHmm. The key here is to find a way to determine which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. But how?\n\nLet me think about the properties. For the original string s, the prefixes are all the first k characters for k from 1 to n-1. Similarly, the suffixes are the last k characters for k from 1 to n-1. Now, the given list contains exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1. But each of those two is either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nThe main idea is that for each possible candidate string s, we can check if all the given strings are its prefixes or suffixes. However, since the original s is not given, we need to find a way to reconstruct it based on the given data.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, the original s must have the property that for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings in the input: one which is a prefix of s (of length l) and one which is a suffix of s (of length l). Wait, no. Because for each length l, there's exactly two strings given. One of them is a prefix of s (since there's exactly one prefix of each length l), and the other is a suffix of s (exactly one suffix per length l). So, for each l, exactly one of the two strings of length l is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, for each length l, among the two strings of that length, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. Therefore, for the correct assignment, for each l, exactly one of the two strings of length l is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how do I find which one is which?\n\nAnother observation: The full string s must be such that the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) are present in the input. Also, the original string s must be such that the prefix of length n-1 is the original string minus the last character, and the suffix of length n-1 is the original string minus the first character.\n\nWait, but the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes. So for example, the original s has a prefix of length n-1, which is s[0...n-2], and a suffix of length n-1, which is s[1...n-1]. These two must be present in the input. So, perhaps the original string can be determined by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. Let me think: For example, if the original string is s, then the longest prefix (length n-1) is P, and the longest suffix (length n-1) is S. Then, the original string must be P + last character of S, or S + first character of P? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nSuppose the original string is s of length n. The longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix (length n-1) is s[1..n-1]. So, the original s is equal to the longest prefix plus the last character of the longest suffix. Because the longest suffix ends with the last character of s. Alternatively, the original s can be found by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. For example, the longest prefix is P, the longest suffix is S. Then, the original s must be P concatenated with the last character of S. Because the longest suffix S is s[1..n-1], so its last character is s[n-1], which is the last character of s. So the original s is P + S[-1].\n\nAlternatively, the original s could also be the first character of the longest prefix (since the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], so its first character is s[0]) plus the longest suffix S. Wait, no. The original s is s[0..n-1]. The longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, combining these two, the original s can be formed by taking the longest prefix (length n-1) and adding the last character of the longest suffix (which is s[n-1]). Or, the original s can be formed by taking the longest suffix (length n-1) and adding the first character of the longest prefix (s[0]).\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is not specified. Our task is to assign 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) to each input string such that there exists at least one valid string `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix and suffix of `s` (each of length `n-1`) must be present in the input. These two strings can help reconstruct the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct Original String**: Using the longest prefix and suffix, we can determine the original string `s` by combining the longest prefix with the last character of the longest suffix.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each string in the input, check if it matches any prefix or suffix of the reconstructed string `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Group strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    length_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        length_map[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find the longest prefix and suffix (length n-1)\n    candidates = length_map[n-1]\n    # Try both possibilities for the longest prefix and suffix\n    possible_s = []\n    for p in candidates:\n        for s in candidates:\n            if p != s:\n                # Reconstruct possible s\n                candidate_s = p + s[-1]\n                possible_s.append(candidate_s)\n                # Also try the other way: s + p[-1]\n                candidate_s2 = s + p[-1]\n                possible_s.append(candidate_s2)\n    \n    # Remove duplicates\n    possible_s = list(set(possible_s))\n    \n    # Now, for each possible s, check if all input strings are its prefixes or suffixes\n    for candidate in possible_s:\n        # For each length l, check the two strings\n        assignment = []\n        valid = True\n        for l in range(1, n):\n            # Get the two strings of length l\n            current_strings = length_map[l]\n            # Check which of them is a prefix and which is a suffix\n            prefix = candidate[:l]\n            suffix = candidate[-l:]\n            # Find which of the current_strings matches prefix and suffix\n            count_p = 0\n            count_s = 0\n            for s_str in current_strings:\n                if s_str == prefix:\n                    assignment.append('P')\n                    count_p += 1\n                elif s_str == suffix:\n                    assignment.append('S')\n                    count_s += 1\n                else:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            # Now, check for the two strings of length n-1\n            # The longest prefix and suffix\n            l = n-1\n            current_strings = length_map[l]\n            prefix_long = candidate[:l]\n            suffix_long = candidate[-l:]\n            for s_str in current_strings:\n                if s_str == prefix_long:\n                    assignment.append('P')\n                else:\n                    assignment.append('S')\n            # Now check if the assignment has exactly n-1 P and S\n            # Because for each length from 1 to n-1, there are two strings, so total 2*(n-1) entries\n            # The assignment should have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's\n            # But since for each length, one is P and one is S, the total counts will be correct\n            print(''.join(assignment))\n            return\n    \n    # If no candidate found (shouldn't happen as per problem statement)\n    print(''.join(['P' if i % 2 == 0 else 'S' for i in range(2 * (n - 1))]))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n` of the original string, followed by the list of prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to facilitate checking prefixes and suffixes of specific lengths.\n3. **Reconstructing Original String**: By considering the longest prefixes and suffixes, we attempt to reconstruct possible original strings `s`.\n4. **Validation and Assignment**: For each candidate string `s`, we validate if all input strings can be classified as either a prefix or suffix. If valid, we output the corresponding assignment of 'P' and 'S'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct classification of each input string as a prefix or suffix of the original string `s`.",
