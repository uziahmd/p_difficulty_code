He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's indicating for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix. And there might be multiple valid answers, but I just need to output any one that's correct.\n\nHmm. The key here is to find a way to assign each of the given strings as either a prefix or suffix such that there exists a string s that has all the assigned prefixes and suffixes. But how do I find that?\n\nFirst, let's think about what the possible candidates for the full string s could be. Since the given strings include all improper prefixes and suffixes, the actual string s must have all of them as prefixes or suffixes. Wait, no. The problem says that the given list contains all the improper prefixes and suffixes. So for example, for a string of length 5, there are 4 prefixes (lengths 1-4) and 4 suffixes (lengths 1-4), making 8 strings total. But the input gives exactly these 8 strings, but in arbitrary order, and we don't know which is which.\n\nSo, the approach is to find a way to assign each of these strings to be either a prefix or a suffix such that there exists a string s of length n that satisfies all assignments.\n\nBut how do I find such an assignment?\n\nLet me think. For the correct string s, the prefixes are s[0...i] for i from 0 to n-1 (assuming 0-based indices). Similarly, suffixes are s[i...n-1] for i from 1 to n-1. So, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0...n-2], and the longest suffix (length n-1) is s[1...n-1]. Also, the full string s is not part of the input, since the input only includes improper prefixes and suffixes.\n\nNow, considering that the input includes all prefixes and suffixes of s. So, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be present in the input. But since the input has two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, there's exactly two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the longest prefix, and the other must be the longest suffix. Wait, no. Because for a string of length n, the longest proper prefix is of length n-1, and the longest proper suffix is also of length n-1. So those two are different unless the first n-1 characters are the same as the last n-1 characters. For example, if s is \"aaaaa\", then the longest prefix is \"aaaa\" and the longest suffix is \"aaaa\", so they are the same. So in that case, the input would have two copies of \"aaaa\" for length n-1.\n\nBut the input says that the given strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes, so for each length, there are exactly two strings. So, for the case where the longest prefix and longest suffix are the same, the input will have two copies of that string.\n\nBut how can I use this information to reconstruct the possible s?\n\nOne idea is that the correct string s must be such that the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) are present in the input. Moreover, the correct s can be determined by combining these two. For example, the correct s would be the longest prefix plus the last character of the longest suffix. Wait, no. Let me think: the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So if we have both, then combining them, the full string s would be the longest prefix's first n-1 characters, and then the last character of the longest suffix. But since the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1], the full string s is s[0..n-2] + s[n-1]. But s[1..n-1] is the longest suffix, so s[n-1] is the last character of that. Therefore, the full string s can be constructed as the longest prefix plus the last character of the longest suffix. However, this is only possible if the longest prefix and the longest suffix share the overlapping part. For example, the longest prefix is P = s[0..n-2], the longest suffix is S = s[1..n-1]. Then, the first n-2 characters of S must be equal to the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is arbitrary. Our task is to assign each string as either a prefix or a suffix such that there exists a valid string `s` that satisfies these assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix of `s` (each of length `n-1`) must be present in the input. These two strings can be used to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: Using the longest prefix and the longest suffix, we can determine the original string `s` by combining the longest prefix with the last character of the longest suffix.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each candidate string derived from the longest prefix and suffix, verify if all other given strings are valid prefixes or suffixes of this reconstructed string.\n4. **Assign Labels**: Once a valid string `s` is found, assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n -
