His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order.

Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The key here is that the teacher has the first and second tour scores but not the names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each participant has one a and one b, right?), but since the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order, we need to pair them in such a way that when combined with Vasya's possible score (which is at least x), we can find the best and worst possible ranks.\n\nWait, no. Wait. Wait, Vasya is one of the participants. So the problem is that the teacher has the list of a's and b's, but doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to the same participant. But Vasya's total is at least x. So, for the purposes of finding the best and worst possible ranks, we need to imagine that Vasya's a and b are some pair (a_i, b_j) such that their sum is >=x. But since the other participants have their a and b values, but how are they paired? Oh, right. The other participants must have their own pairs. But the problem says that each participant has both tours. So, the original data is that there are n participants. Each has a first tour score (a_i) and a second tour score (b_i). However, the a's and b's are given in arbitrary order. So, for example, the first list is all a's, but they are not necessarily in the same order as the b's. So, the actual pairing of a's and b's is unknown. But the teacher has to consider all possible pairings of a's and b's, and for each possible pairing, determine what Vasya's rank could be, given that there exists some pairing where Vasya's total is at least x.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because for the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he's as high as possible), and for the worst possible rank, we want to minimize his total (so that he's as low as possible). But wait, no. Because the best possible rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible, so that he is placed as high as possible. But the worst possible rank is when his total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and then arranged in a way that as many others have higher totals.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So, for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and arrange the other participants' totals in a way that allows him to have the best rank. For the worst possible rank, we assume that Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange others' totals to make his rank as bad as possible.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that for the best possible rank, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible (but at least x). Then, in that scenario, we can arrange the other participants' pairs such that as few as possible have a higher total than Vasya. But since the other participants' pairs can be arranged in any way, perhaps the best rank for Vasya is determined by how many people can have a total higher than his maximum possible value.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For the best possible rank, we need to choose the best possible pairing for Vasya (i.e., the highest possible sum that is at least x) and then arrange the other participants' pairings in a way that as few as possible have a higher sum than Vasya's. But since the other participants can be paired in any way, perhaps the best possible rank for Vasya is 1 if there's a possible pairing where his sum is the maximum possible. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is determined by the number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum. But since we can choose Vasya's sum to be as high as possible, then for the best case, we can take the maximum possible sum that is at least x, and then count how many other participants can have a sum higher than that. But how?\n\nWait, but the other participants' pairings are not fixed. So for the best case scenario, we can choose Vasya's sum to be as high as possible (so that he has the maximum possible total), and then arrange the other participants' pairings such that as few as possible have a higher total than him. But how to find the minimal number of people that can have a higher total than Vasya's maximum possible sum.\n\nWait, but the other participants can be paired in any way. So, for the best possible rank, we can choose Vasya's sum to be the maximum possible (a_i + b_j) that is >=x. Then, for the other participants, we can pair them in a way that minimizes the number of people with a higher total than Vasya. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank for Vasya is 1 if there exists a pairing where his total is the maximum possible. But how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible sum Vasya can have (call it S_max), and then the number of people who can have a sum greater than S_max. But how to compute that.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. Since the teacher can pair a_i and b_j in any way, but Vasya's sum is a_i + b_j >=x. So, the maximum possible sum for Vasya would be the maximum a_i + b_j, but considering that the rest of the participants can be paired in a way that doesn't conflict with that. Wait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, assuming that there exists some possible pairing where Vasya's total is at least x.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's total is the maximum possible sum (since that would allow him to be ranked as high as possible). How to compute that maximum possible sum? Well, the maximum sum possible is the maximum a_i + b_j. But since the a's and b's are given, but not paired. So the maximum sum possible is the maximum a_i plus maximum b_j. Because you can pair the maximum a with maximum b. But wait, but that may not be possible if you have to pair all the a's with b's. But for the purpose of Vasya's sum, since we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) as long as there exists some pairing of all participants. But the problem states that Vasya is present in the Olympiad, which means that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. However, when considering the best possible scenario for Vasya, we can choose his pair to be the maximum possible sum, and then arrange the rest of the pairs in a way that doesn't affect that. But how to find how many people can have a higher sum than Vasya's maximum sum. Well, since Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, no one else can have a higher sum than that. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but that's only if there exists a way to pair all participants such that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. But how can that be ensured? Because if you pair Vasya's a_i with the maximum b_j, and then pair the other a's with other b's. But the problem says that the other participants can be paired in any way. So for the best possible scenario, we can choose Vasya's pair to be the maximum possible sum, and arrange the rest of the pairs in any way. Since in that case, no other participant can have a higher sum than Vasya. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily true. Suppose there are two participants, and their a's are [5, 0], and b's are [5, 0]. Then the maximum possible sum for Vasya is 5+5=10. But the other participant would have 0+0=0. So in that case, Vasya is first. But if x is 10, then yes. But what if the maximum sum is 10, but there's another participant whose a and b can be paired to get 10? Like, suppose a is [5,5], b is [5,5]. Then, the maximum sum is 10. But if Vasya is one of the participants, then there are other participants with sum 10. So, in that case, the best possible rank is 1 (if the jury chooses to put Vasya first), but the worst possible rank would be 2 (if there's someone else with same sum and the jury puts him after).\n\nBut in the problem statement, the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can assign the same sums in any order. So for the best case, the answer is 1.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1 if there exists a possible pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Which is always possible if there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x. Which is guaranteed by the problem's input constraints.\n\nWait, but how to confirm that? Well, the problem says that it is guaranteed that there are two integers i,j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum a_i + b_j, which is at least x. And for that case, the best possible rank is 1, because even if other participants have the same sum, the jury can assign him the first place.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. But wait, looking at the sample input. In the first example, all participants have sum 2. So the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5. Which matches the sample output. So yes, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo the first part of the answer is always 1. But why? Because the teacher can choose to pair Vasya's a_i and b_j in a way that gives him the maximum possible sum, and then arrange the other participants' pairs in such a way that no one else has a higher sum. So, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but what if the maximum sum is achieved by multiple pairs. For example, if there are 5 participants, all with a_i = 1 and b_i = 1. Then, the maximum sum is 2. So, Vasya's sum is 2, and all others also have 2. But the jury can assign him first place. Hence, best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is always 1. That's easy. So the first part of the output is 1.\n\nNow for the worst possible rank. How to compute that?\n\nThe worst possible rank occurs when Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and the other participants are arranged in a way that as many as possible have higher totals than him. So, we need to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya (s_min), such that s_min >=x, and then count how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than s_min. Then, the worst possible rank would be that count + 1. But how to find s_min and the count?\n\nWait, but how to find s_min. Since Vasya's sum can be any value >=x. But to make his rank as bad as possible, we need to choose the minimal possible sum that is >=x, and then arrange the other participants' pairs to maximize the number of people with higher sum than him.\n\nBut how to find that minimal sum. Well, the minimal possible sum for Vasya is x, but it's possible that there's no way to pair a_i and b_j to get exactly x. But since the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x, but the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have is the minimal possible value that is >=x, and can be achieved by some pair.\n\nBut how to find that? Well, for the worst case scenario, we need to choose the minimal possible sum (s_min) that is >=x. Then, for that s_min, we need to calculate how many participants can have a sum higher than s_min. Then, the worst rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to find s_min? Well, s_min is the minimal value such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j = s_min, and s_min >=x. However, since we can choose any pair for Vasya, but the other participants must have their pairs. So, for the worst case, we need to find the minimal s_min (>=x) that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j), and then arrange the other participants in such a way that as many as possible have a sum higher than s_min.\n\nBut how to find this s_min? Well, the minimal possible s_min is x. But perhaps there's no pair with sum exactly x. So, we need to find the minimal possible s_min that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair.\n\nBut perhaps the way to approach this is to find the minimal possible s_min (>=x) that is achievable. Then, for that s_min, compute how many other participants can have a sum higher than s_min. However, how to compute that?\n\nBut here's the thing: the other participants can be paired in any way. So, for the worst case, we need to maximize the number of participants that can have a sum higher than s_min. How can we do that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose Vasya's sum is s_min. To maximize the number of participants with a sum higher than s_min, we need to pair the a's and b's in a way that as many as possible pairs have a sum > s_min. But how to compute that maximum number?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to find, for a given s_min, the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed such that a_i + b_j > s_min. But since each a and b can be used once, this is similar to a matching problem.\n\nBut how to compute that? Let's think about the following approach:\n\nFor a given s_min, we can sort the a array in ascending order and the b array in descending order. Then, for each a_i, we try to pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been paired yet and such that a_i + b_j > s_min. This way, we can maximize the number of pairs with sum > s_min.\n\nWait, that's similar to the greedy approach used in the problem of maximum matching between two arrays. For example, the problem where you have two arrays and you want to find the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j > k. The standard approach is to sort one array in ascending order and the other in descending order, then greedily pair them.\n\nYes. So for a given s_min, the maximum number of pairs with sum > s_min is the maximum possible. Therefore, for the worst case scenario, the number of participants that can have a sum higher than s_min is this maximum number. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how do we find s_min?\n\ns_min is the minimal possible value that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). However, since we can choose any pair for Vasya, but the other participants' pairs are chosen in a way that maximizes the number of people with higher sum than s_min. So, for the worst case, we need to choose s_min as small as possible (but >=x) to maximize the number of people with higher sum.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible s_min that is >=x. Let's call this value s.\n\nBut how to find this s? Well, s can be any value >=x such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j = s. However, since we want the minimal possible s, perhaps we can find the minimal possible s >=x that is achievable by any pair.\n\nBut how? Well, the minimal s is max(x, the minimal possible sum of a_i + b_j that is >=x). Wait, but the minimal s is the minimal possible sum that is >=x, and can be achieved by some pair. So, for example, if x is 3, and there are pairs with sum 3, then s is 3. If there are no pairs with sum 3, but there are pairs with sum 4, then s is 4.\n\nSo, to find the minimal s_min >=x that exists in the possible pairs, we can generate all possible a_i + b_j and find the minimal one that is >=x. However, for n up to 1e5, this is impossible because the number of pairs is O(n^2), which is 1e10, which is way too big.\n\nTherefore, we need a smarter approach.\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible s_min >=x that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j)?\n\nWell, perhaps the minimal s_min is the minimal value >=x such that there exists a_i and b_j with a_i + b_j >=x. But how to find that?\n\nBut since we need to find the minimal s_min >=x, which is the minimal possible value that can be achieved by some pair. So, the minimal possible s_min is the minimal between all possible a_i + b_j that are >=x. But again, how to compute that?\n\nBut perhaps the minimal s_min is x, if there exists a pair with sum exactly x. Otherwise, it's the minimal sum that is larger than x. But again, how to find this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the minimal possible sum that is >=x, and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). Let's think of this as follows:\n\nWe can sort the a array and the b array. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, among all these pairs, find the minimal sum.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, we can sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, we can find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. For example, for a_i, the minimal b_j is the first element in b that is >= (x - a_i). Then, the sum a_i + b_j would be the minimal sum for this a_i that is >=x. Then, among all these possibilities, we can find the minimal sum overall.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nYes. Let's proceed with this approach. Here's the plan:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. For each a_i in a, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. For that a_i, the minimal possible b_j is the first element in b that is >= (x - a_i). Once we find that, the sum would be a_i + b_j. We can track the minimal such sum across all a_i and their corresponding b_j.\n\nBut wait, this would give us the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Because for each a_i, we find the minimal b_j that can be paired with it to reach x. Then, the overall minimal sum is the minimum of all these a_i + b_j.\n\nBut what if there is no such b_j for a particular a_i? For example, if a_i is very large and all b_j are small, such that a_i + b_j <x. However, the problem statement says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >=x, so for some a_i, there will be a corresponding b_j.\n\nOnce we find the minimal s_min (the minimal sum >=x), then we can proceed to compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum > s_min. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s_min?\n\nAs discussed earlier, this is a classic problem. For a given s_min, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then greedily pair them to maximize the number of pairs with sum > s_min.\n\nLet me think about that. For example, if a is sorted in ascending order and b is sorted in descending order. Then, for each a_i, we check if a_i + b_j > s_min. Since we want to maximize the number of pairs, we can pair the smallest a with the largest possible b that allows the sum to exceed s_min. Let's see:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then, for each a_i in a, try to pair it with the first b_j in the sorted b that hasn't been used yet and such that a_i + b_j > s_min. If possible, count it. This is similar to the two pointers approach.\n\nWait, here's a standard approach for maximum number of pairs with sum > K:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Initialize two pointers, i starting at 0 (beginning of a), j starting at 0 (beginning of b). For each a[i], check if a[i] + b[j] > K. If yes, then we can pair them, increment count, and move both pointers. If not, then we need to take a larger b, so increment j. Wait, no. Wait, since b is sorted in descending order, the first elements are the largest. So for a[i], the largest possible b is b[0]. If a[i] + b[0] > K, then we can pair them. Then, for the next a[i+1], we can take the next largest available b.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to use a two-pointer approach where we sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order, and then for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j > s_min, and then count the number of pairs.\n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach. Sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, for the maximum number of pairs with sum > s_min, we can use a two-pointer approach where we start from the end of a and the end of b.\n\nLet me think. Suppose a is sorted ascending, b is sorted ascending. Let's have i = n-1 (last element of a), j = n-1 (last element of b). For each step, if a[i] + b[j] > s_min, then we can pair them. So count +=1, and decrement both i and j. Else, we need to take a smaller a or a larger b. But since a[i] is the largest a, and b[j] is the largest b. If a[i] + b[j] is not greater than s_min, then even the largest a and largest b can't form a pair. So, we can't form any more pairs. So, the count is zero. Wait, no. Maybe a[i] is too small, but other combinations can be found.\n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach. Sort a in ascending order, and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i in a, we can pair it with the first available b_j in the sorted b that is large enough to make a_i + b_j > s_min.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose a is [1, 2, 3], sorted ascending. b is [5, 4, 3], sorted descending. s_min is 5. We want to count how many pairs can be made with sum >5. For a[0]=1, the minimal b_j that can be paired is 5 (1+5=6>5). So pair them. Then for a[1]=2, the next available b_j is 4 (2+4=6>5). Pair them. For a[2]=3, next available is 3 (3+3=6>5). So total 3 pairs. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a is [1, 1, 1], b is [1,1,1], s_min is 2. Then, each pair is 2, which is not greater than s_min. So the count is 0. So the worst possible rank is 0+1=1. But if Vasya's sum is 2, then the worst possible rank is 1 (since all others have sum 2, but the jury can put him last). Wait, but according to the problem statement, if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can assign the places as they like. So in this case, the worst possible rank would be n (number of participants), since all have the same sum and the jury can assign Vasya to be last.\n\nBut according to the calculation above, the count of participants with sum > s_min is zero, so the rank is zero +1 = 1. Which contradicts the expected result. So there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nAh, here's the problem. The approach I was thinking of counts the number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than s_min. But in reality, for the worst case, Vasya's sum is s_min. Other participants can have sum equal to s_min, and those can be considered as being in the same rank as Vasya. But the problem says that the jury can assign the places as they like. So, if there are k participants with sum > s_min, then Vasya's rank can be k+1 (if all those k are before him), but if there are m participants with sum equal to s_min, then the worst possible rank is k + m + 1? Or is it k + 1?\n\nWait, the problem says that the participants are sorted by the sum of points. If two or more have the same sum, the jury can assign the places as they like. So, for the worst possible rank, we want as many people as possible to have sum >= Vasya's sum. But how does that affect the rank?\n\nSuppose Vasya's sum is s_min. Let's say there are k people with sum > s_min. Then, regardless of how many people have sum equal to s_min, the worst possible rank for Vasya is k+1. Because the jury can arrange all the people with sum equal to s_min to be placed after Vasya. Wait, no. If there are m people with sum equal to s_min, then the jury can arrange them in any order. So, if there are k people with higher sum, and m people with equal sum, then the worst possible rank is k+1 (if the jury puts all the m people after Vasya). So, the worst possible rank is k+1. Because even if there are m people with same sum, they can be placed after him. So, the rank is k+1.\n\nBut how to compute k? k is the number of people that can have sum strictly greater than s_min. So, the previous approach of counting the maximum number of pairs with sum > s_min is correct.\n\nSo in the example where all pairs sum to exactly s_min, then k is zero, so the worst possible rank is 0+1 = 1. But that's wrong, because in that case, all participants have sum equal to s_min. So, the worst possible rank is n (since the jury can put Vasya last). But according to the calculation, it's 1. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nAh! So my previous reasoning is incorrect. Because the calculation of k is the number of participants that can have sum strictly greater than s_min. But if there are m participants with sum equal to s_min (including Vasya), then the worst possible rank is k + m. Because the jury can arrange the m participants (including Vasya) to be placed after the k participants. But since the jury can choose the order among the m participants, the worst possible rank for Vasya would be k + m.\n\nWait, but how many participants have sum equal to s_min?\n\nIn the case where all participants have sum equal to s_min, then k is zero (no one has sum > s_min). The number of participants with sum equal to s_min is n. So, the worst possible rank for Vasya is 1 + (n-1) = n? Or is it k + 1?\n\nNo, because the rank depends on how many people are strictly ahead of him. For example, if there are k people with higher sum, and m people with same sum (including Vasya), then the worst possible rank is k + 1. Because the jury can arrange all the m people to be after the k people, and Vasya can be placed last among them. So, his rank is k + 1. But in that case, the number of people with sum equal to s_min is m, and the rank is k + 1. So, in the example where all have sum equal to s_min, then k is zero. So, the rank is 0 + 1 = 1. But that's not correct. Because in reality, Vasya can be placed last among n participants, which would be rank n.\n\nSo there's a flaw in the reasoning here. What is the correct way to compute the worst possible rank?\n\nLet me think again. The total number of participants is n. Vasya is one of them. When considering the worst possible rank, we want to maximize the number of participants that are either strictly better than him, or tied with him but placed after him.\n\nThe worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of people who have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum (let's call this count 'k') plus the number of people who have the same sum as Vasya (let's call this count 'm'), but since Vasya is part of that m, the worst possible rank is k + 1 (because the jury can arrange all the m people to be placed after the k people, and Vasya can be the last among them). So, the worst possible rank is k + 1.\n\nBut in the example where all participants have sum s_min, then k is zero. So, the worst possible rank is 0 + 1 = 1. Which contradicts the example given in the problem statement. For example, the first sample input has all participants with sum 2. The worst possible rank is 5. But according to this approach, it would be 0 + 1 = 1. Which is clearly wrong.\n\nSo there's a mistake in the approach. Where is the error?\n\nAh, the problem is that when we compute k, we are counting the maximum number of participants that can have sum strictly greater than s_min. However, in the case where all participants have sum equal to s_min, then k is zero. But the number of participants with sum equal to s_min is n. So, the worst possible rank for Vasya is n, since the jury can put him last. But according to the formula k + 1, it would be 1.\n\nSo the previous approach is wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink how to calculate the worst possible rank.\n\nAlternative approach: The worst possible rank for Vasya is the number of participants that can have sum strictly greater than his sum (call this count 'k') plus 1, but also taking into account the number of participants that have sum equal to his sum. However, since the jury can arrange the participants with equal sum in any order, the worst possible rank is k + 1 (if there are any participants with equal sum), or k + 1 if there are none.\n\nWait, no. If there are m participants with sum equal to s_min (including Vasya), then the worst possible rank is k + m. Because the jury can arrange all the m participants to be placed after the k participants, and then Vasya can be placed last among them. So, the rank is k + m. But since m is the number of participants with sum equal to s_min, including Vasya, then the rank is k + m. However, since the total participants is n, then k + m = n (since all participants are either in k or in m). Therefore, the rank would be n, which is correct in the first sample case.\n\nBut how to compute m? Because m is the number of participants that can be paired to have sum equal to s_min. But how to compute that?\n\nBut this seems complicated. How to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= s_min, and then the worst rank would be that number. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is determined by the number of participants that can have sum strictly greater than s_min plus the number of participants that can have sum equal to s_min. But how to compute that?\n\nBut how can we compute the number of participants that can have sum equal to s_min? It depends on how the pairs are made. For example, if s_min is the minimal possible sum (say, x), then the number of participants that can have sum equal to s_min is the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that sum to exactly s_min, but ensuring that each a and b is used once. However, this seems complex.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach of counting the maximum number of participants with sum > s_min is insufficient. We need to also account for the number of participants that can have sum equal to s_min. But how?\n\nThis seems very challenging. Perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think again about the problem. For the worst possible rank, we want to maximize the number of participants that are either strictly better than Vasya, or tied with him. But since the jury can arrange the tied participants in any order, the worst possible rank for Vasya is the number of participants with sum strictly greater than his sum plus 1. Because even if there are many participants with the same sum, the jury can place them after him, but in that case, he would be first among them. But that's not the worst case. Wait, no. To get the worst possible rank, we want to have as many participants as possible placed before him. So, for participants with sum equal to his sum, the jury can choose to place them before him, but that would not increase his rank. Alternatively, to make his rank as bad as possible, the jury would place all participants with higher sum before him, and then place all participants with equal sum after him. So, his rank is (number of higher sum participants) + 1. Because he is placed after all the higher ones, and before the equal ones. But if there are m participants with equal sum (including himself), then the worst possible rank is k + 1, where k is the number of higher sum participants. But in the first sample case, k is zero, so the rank is 1, but the correct answer is 5. So something is wrong here.\n\nAh! Oh wait, no. In the first sample case, all participants have sum equal to s_min (which is 2). So, the number of higher sum participants is zero. The number of participants with equal sum is 5. The worst possible rank is 5, which is when Vasya is placed last among all 5 participants. But according to the formula k + 1, it would be 0 + 1 = 1. So clearly, this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is that when there are m participants with sum equal to s_min, the worst possible rank is k + m, where k is the number of participants with sum strictly greater than s_min. Because in that case, the jury can arrange all the k participants to be before Vasya, and all m participants (including Vasya) to be after. But wait, that's not possible. If there are k participants with higher sum, and m participants with equal sum, then Vasya's rank is k + 1, because all the m participants can be placed after him. Or can they be placed before him? No, because if they have the same sum, the jury can choose their order. So, the worst possible scenario is when Vasya is placed last among all participants with equal sum. So, the number of participants with higher sum is k, and the number of participants with equal sum is m. So, the worst possible rank is k + m.\n\nBut how to compute m?\n\nBut m is the number of participants that can be paired to have sum equal to s_min, plus Vasya himself. Wait, but Vasya is one of the participants. So, the total number of participants with sum equal to s_min is m, which includes Vasya. So, the worst possible rank is k + m. But how to compute m?\n\nBut how can we compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum equal to s_min, given that Vasya's sum is s_min?\n\nThis seems very complex. Perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet's think differently. For the worst possible rank, we want to maximize the number of participants who have a sum >= s_min. Because then, Vasya's rank could be as high as that number.\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >= s_min?\n\nBut again, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by the total number of participants that can have sum >= s_min, because the jury can arrange them to be placed before Vasya. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have sum >= s_min, including Vasya. Because the worst possible rank would be when all of them are placed before Vasya. But since Vasya is part of that group, this",
