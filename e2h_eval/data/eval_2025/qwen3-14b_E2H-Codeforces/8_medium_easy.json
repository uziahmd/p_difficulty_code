Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to assign directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The main points are that the flow must be a maximum flow, and the directed graph must not have cycles. Also, the source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges, and all other vertices except the sink (vertex n) must have equal incoming and outgoing flow sums.\n\nHmm. So the problem is not about computing the max flow itself but assigning directions to edges given the flow values. The key here is to model this as a directed graph with certain constraints.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For each vertex except source and sink, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. Also, the directed graph should be acyclic. Oh right, and the source has no incoming edges. So the direction of edges must form a DAG, which is a directed acyclic graph.\n\nWait, how can I model this? Well, maybe I can think of the problem as building a DAG where the flow conservation holds for internal nodes.\n\nAnother thought: since the graph is connected and we need to assign directions without cycles, perhaps we can arrange the edges in a way that forms a directed tree or something similar. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow is a valid maximum flow, the residual graph must have no augmenting paths. But maybe that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the given flows are already the maximum flow. So the flow values are fixed. We just need to assign directions so that the flow is valid and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node except source and sink, the total incoming flow equals the total outgoing flow. Which implies that the net flow at each such node is zero. But since the edges are directed, each edge contributes either +ci (if it's outgoing) or -ci (if incoming) to the node's balance.\n\nSo for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of ci for edges directed away from v minus sum of ci for edges directed towards v must be zero. Which means that the sum of all ci for edges incident to v must be even? No, because for each edge, the flow is assigned to one direction. For example, if a node has two edges, each with ci=5, then one could be incoming and the other outgoing, leading to net zero. So the sum of all ci's for edges incident to v must be even? No, because for any node, the sum of flows into it must equal the sum of flows out of it. So the total sum of all flows for edges incident to v is (sum_incoming + sum_outgoing) = sum_incoming + sum_incoming (since sum_incoming = sum_outgoing). Wait, no. For each edge, it's either incoming or outgoing. So sum_incoming = sum_outgoing. Therefore, the sum of all flows for edges incident to v is sum_incoming + sum_outgoing = 2*sum_incoming. Which implies that the sum of all flows on edges incident to v must be even. But that's not necessarily given. However, the problem says that a solution exists, so the input must satisfy this condition. So maybe I don't have to worry about that.\n\nBut how do I assign the directions?\n\nAnother approach: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, direct it from the node that comes earlier in the topological order to the one that comes later. But how to choose this order such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nWait, but the flow conservation depends on the directions. So perhaps we can model this as a directed graph with certain constraints and find a topological order that satisfies the flow conditions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has in-flow equal to out-flow. This is similar to an Eulerian trail, but for a graph. However, since the graph is undirected, but we are directing edges, perhaps we can model this as an Eulerian circuit problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the flow conservation for internal nodes requires that the sum of the flows on edges incident to the node must be even. Because each edge contributes to either in or out, and the total is sum_in = sum_out, so sum_in + sum_out = 2 sum_in. Which implies that the total sum of flows on edges incident to the node must be even. Which is true, since the original flow is a valid maximum flow. So the problem ensures that.\n\nBut how to assign directions?\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of building a directed graph with the given flow values, and ensuring that the flow is conserved. Then, the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nAnother idea: The directed graph must be a DAG. So, perhaps we can construct a DAG where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds. How?\n\nMaybe we can perform a topological sort. Suppose we arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge between u and v, if u is before v in the order, we direct it u→v. Otherwise, v→u. But how to choose the topological order so that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nBut the problem is that the flow conservation depends on the direction of edges. So the topological order would have to be chosen in a way that balances the flows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled as finding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with flow conservation for internal nodes, and source only has outgoing edges, sink only has incoming edges.\n\nWait, but how can I model this? Let's think of the flow conservation. For each node except source and sink, the sum of flows going out equals the sum of flows coming in. So, for each node, the total flow entering is equal to the total leaving. Which implies that the net flow for the node is zero.\n\nBut how to model this as a graph?\n\nAnother approach: Let's model this as a directed graph where for each node except the source and sink, the net flow is zero. Then, the problem reduces to directing the edges such that this is true, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to find such a direction?\n\nLet me think about the flow as a circulation. Except that the source and sink have net flows. The source has a net outflow equal to the total flow value (the max flow), and the sink has a net inflow equal to that same value. All other nodes have net zero.\n\nBut how to direct edges to achieve this?\n\nWait, but the problem gives us the flow values for each edge. So, for each edge, we have to assign a direction, and the flow is fixed. So the direction determines whether the edge contributes to the outflow of its starting node and inflow of the ending node.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to choosing directions for edges such that:\n\nFor each node v (not source or sink):\n\nsum_{edges directed away from v} ci = sum_{edges directed towards v} ci.\n\nAdditionally, the directed graph must be acyclic, and the source has no incoming edges.\n\nHmm. How to model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a system of equations. For each node v (excluding source and sink), the sum of flows directed out of v equals the sum directed into v. However, solving this system directly is computationally impossible for large n and m.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, there exists a topological order. Let's say we have a topological order where the source is first, and the sink is last. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from earlier nodes to later nodes. But how does this ensure flow conservation?\n\nWait, but in this case, the flow conservation would require that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges coming into it from earlier nodes equals the sum of flows on edges going out to later nodes. But how can that be ensured?\n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes in a topological order. For each node, the sum of flows on edges going out to later nodes must equal the sum of flows on edges coming in from earlier nodes. Because the node's inflow (from earlier nodes) must equal outflow (to later nodes).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nThis seems like a possible approach. Let's imagine that we arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each node, the inflow from earlier nodes must be balanced by the outflow to later nodes. However, how to determine this order?\n\nBut how can we find such an order?\n\nAnother thought: The problem requires that the directed graph is acyclic. So, perhaps we can build a DAG where the edges are directed in a way that allows for flow conservation.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed such that the flow is a valid flow. The key is that the flow conservation is satisfied for internal nodes. How can this be achieved?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal inflow and outflow. So, for each node, the total of all flows on edges incident to it is 2 * outflow (since inflow = outflow). So, the total is even.\n\nBut again, how to assign directions?\n\nAnother idea: Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, maybe we can construct a directed spanning tree rooted at the source. Then, direct all edges in the tree away from the root, and for other edges, direct them in a way that doesn't create cycles.\n\nBut how to handle the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow network. The given flows are the actual flows in the maximum flow. Now, the direction of each edge corresponds to the direction of flow in the residual graph. However, since the residual graph may have cycles, but the directed graph we are creating must be acyclic.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the directed graph must not have cycles. So perhaps we can find a way to orient the edges such that the resulting graph is a DAG, and the flow conservation holds.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Assign directions to edges such that the graph is a DAG with a topological order where the source is the first node and the sink is the last node. Then, for each node in the topological order, except the source and sink, the sum of flows from incoming edges (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on outgoing edges (to later nodes).\n\nBut how to find such a topological order?\n\nThis feels like a dynamic programming problem. Suppose we process the nodes in topological order. For each node, we can calculate the required outflow based on the inflow. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the difference between the inflow and outflow must be zero. But since the graph is directed, the inflow is the sum of flows on edges directed into the node, and the outflow is the sum of flows on edges directed out of the node.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's consider that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into it must equal the sum of flows directed out of it. Which implies that the total sum of flows on edges incident to v is even, as before.\n\nBut how to assign directions?\n\nAnother idea: For each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even. Let's think of this as a problem of finding an Eulerian trail. But since the graph is undirected, but we need to direct the edges such that each node has equal in-degree and out-degree. But that's not exactly the case here, because the flow values are not 1 per edge but arbitrary ci.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as an Eulerian trail problem, but with weights. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even, which is already given. Then, we can split each edge into two directed edges (but that's not helpful here).\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow network where each edge is directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds. So, for each node, the sum of flows going out minus the sum of flows coming in equals the net flow. For the source, this is equal to the total flow value (say, F), for the sink it's -F, and for others it's zero.\n\nBut how to find such a direction?\n\nWait, the problem is that the flow is already fixed. Each edge has a fixed flow value, and we have to assign directions so that the net flow for each node is correct.\n\nBut the problem says that the flow is a maximum flow. So the given flows are part of the maximum flow. So, the sum of flows going out from the source is the maximum flow value, and similarly for the sink.\n\nBut how to use that information?\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen, and the flow conservation holds. The question is how to find such a direction, and also ensure that the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has in-flow equal to out-flow. Then, the graph can be considered as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with these properties.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Find a topological order of the nodes. For example, the source is first, the sink is last. Then, for each node in between, process them in order.\n\n2. For each node in the topological order, we can decide the direction of edges connected to it. For example, for each edge between this node and a node that comes later in the topological order, we can direct it from the current node to the later node. For edges connected to nodes that come before, we can direct them from the previous node to the current node. However, this might not satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to adjust the directions so that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, for each node in the topological order, after processing all previous nodes, we can determine the required outflow. For example, the inflow from the previous nodes is known, and the outflow must be equal to that. Then, the edges connected to this node and later nodes can be directed accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have a node v in the topological order. All edges from v to nodes processed before it are directed into v (since they are processed earlier). The edges from v to nodes processed after are directed out of v. The sum of the flows of edges directed into v is the inflow. The sum of flows directed out of v is the outflow. For the flow conservation, inflow must equal outflow. But how to ensure that?\n\nWait, but this approach may not work unless the inflow is already known. For example, when processing node v, the inflow from previous nodes is known. Then, the outflow must be equal to this inflow. However, the outflow is determined by the edges from v to nodes that are processed after. How can we adjust the direction of those edges to make the outflow equal to the inflow?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved greedily. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we have a topological order where the source is first, and the sink is last. Let's process the nodes in this order. For each node v (except the source and sink), the inflow is the sum of flows from edges directed into v from previously processed nodes. The outflow is the sum of flows from edges directed out of v to nodes processed after. The sum of inflow must equal the sum of outflow.\n\nBut how to compute the outflow?\n\nThe sum of all flows on edges incident to v is S. The sum of flows on edges directed into v is In, and the sum of flows directed out of v is Out. For flow conservation, In = Out. Also, In + Out = S. Therefore, In = Out = S/2.\n\nSo for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to v is S, which must be even. And the inflow (from previous nodes) plus the outflow (to later nodes) must equal S. But since In = Out, that implies that In = Out = S/2. Therefore, during processing of the node v, the inflow from previous nodes must be equal to S/2 minus the sum of flows on edges directed out of v to nodes processed after. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, during processing of the node v, the inflow from previous nodes is known. Let's call this value 'current_in'. Then, the sum of flows on edges from v to nodes not yet processed is some value. Let's call this 'available_out'. The required outflow for v is 'required_out' = current_in. Therefore, the available_out must be >= required_out. But how to ensure that?\n\nWait, but the sum of available_out is the sum of flows on edges between v and nodes processed after. Let's say this sum is 'total_available'. Then, the required_out is current_in. But since the total_available is fixed, and the required_out is current_in, how can this be adjusted?\n\nThis suggests that during the processing of the nodes, we need to select the direction of edges such that the outflow from v is exactly current_in.\n\nBut how can this be done?\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For each node v (not source or sink), after processing all previous nodes, the inflow from previous nodes is known. Let's denote this as 'inflow_v'. The sum of all flows on edges incident to v is S. Since the flow conservation requires that the inflow from previous nodes plus the inflow from edges directed into v from later nodes equals the outflow to previous nodes (which is zero, since those are already processed) plus the outflow to later nodes. Wait, this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, for node v, the inflow from previous nodes is 'inflow_prev', and the inflow from edges directed into v from later nodes is 'inflow_later'. Similarly, the outflow to later nodes is 'outflow_later'. But since the nodes after v haven't been processed yet, we can't know their inflow. So this seems challenging.\n\nMaybe another approach is needed. Let's think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge is directed from a parent to a child in a tree structure. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can build a DAG where each node has a parent in the DAG. Then, for each node, the flow conservation can be handled by directing the edges appropriately. However, this seems too vague.\n\nAnother thought: The problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles. So, it's a DAG. Therefore, there's a topological order. Let's pick any topological order. For example, we can assign the nodes a topological order where the source is first, and the sink is last. Then, for each edge, we direct it from the node that appears earlier in the order to the one that appears later. But how does this ensure flow conservation?\n\nWell, it might not. For example, if the sum of flows on edges incident to a node is not even, but the problem says that the input guarantees that a solution exists, so the sum is even. But even with that, directing edges according to a topological order may not satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nBut perhaps we can construct the topological order in a way that ensures that the flow conservation is satisfied. How?\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Start with the source node. For each node, we can process it in a certain order. For each node, we compute the required outflow based on the inflow from previously processed nodes. Then, we direct the edges to unprocessed nodes in such a way that the outflow meets the required amount.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a node v. We have already processed all nodes that come before v in the topological order. The inflow into v is the sum of flows on edges from those nodes to v. The outflow from v to nodes processed after must be equal to this inflow. So, we need to choose directions for edges between v and unprocessed nodes such that the sum of flows directed out of v is equal to the inflow.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of this as a problem of selecting which edges to direct away from v to meet the required outflow.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the inflow into v is X. The sum of flows on edges between v and unprocessed nodes is Y. We need to select a subset of these edges to direct away from v such that the sum of their flows is X. Because then, the outflow from v will be X, matching the inflow.\n\nBut how to find such a subset?\n\nThis sounds like a subset sum problem, which is NP-hard. However, given the problem constraints, there must be a way to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, but the problem says that a solution always exists. So, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges between v and unprocessed nodes must be at least X, and there exists a subset of these edges whose sum is exactly X. How can this be ensured?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of flows on edges between v and unprocessed nodes is exactly X. Because, considering that the total sum of flows incident to v is S. The inflow from processed nodes is X, and the sum of flows between v and unprocessed nodes is Y. Then, the sum of flows on edges incident to v is X + (inflow from unprocessed nodes) + (outflow to unprocessed nodes). Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, for node v, the total sum of flows on edges incident to it is S. The inflow from processed nodes is X. The inflow from unprocessed nodes is Z. The outflow to unprocessed nodes is W. But since the processed nodes are earlier in the topological order, the edges between v and them are directed into v. The edges between v and unprocessed nodes can be directed either way. However, the flow conservation for v requires that X + Z = W + ... ?\n\nNo, the flow conservation for v requires that the total inflow equals the total outflow. The inflow is the sum of flows from processed nodes (X) plus the sum of flows from unprocessed nodes that are directed into v (let's say A). The outflow is the sum of flows directed from v to processed nodes (but since processed nodes are earlier in the topological order, this is zero) plus the sum of flows directed from v to unprocessed nodes (B). Thus, X + A = B.\n\nBut since the processed nodes are already processed, the edges between v and them are directed into v, contributing A = 0? No, no. Wait, the edges between v and processed nodes are directed from the processed node to v, since the processed node comes earlier in the topological order. So, the inflow from processed nodes is the sum of flows on those edges. The edges between v and unprocessed nodes can be directed either way. So, for those edges, we have to decide whether to direct them from v to unprocessed node (contributing to B) or from unprocessed node to v (contributing to A). \n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nX + A = B.\n\nBut since the sum of flows on edges between v and unprocessed nodes is (sum of flows on those edges) = B + A. Let's call this sum T. Then, X + A = B => X = B - A. Also, T = A + B. Solving for B:\n\nFrom X = B - A and T = A + B.\n\nAdding both equations:\n\nX + T = 2B → B = (X + T)/2.\n\nSimilarly, A = (T - X)/2.\n\nSince T is the sum of flows between v and unprocessed nodes, and X is the inflow from processed nodes, the values of B and A must be integers. But since the problem says that a solution exists, this should be possible.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nOnce we have B = (X + T)/2, we need to select a subset of edges between v and unprocessed nodes whose sum is B. Then, we direct those edges away from v, and the rest towards v.\n\nBut how to find such a subset efficiently?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a subset of edges with sum B, which can be done greedily if we can find a way to select edges. However, this might not be straightforward.\n\nBut wait, since the problem guarantees that a solution exists, we can assume that such a subset exists. So, perhaps we can process the edges in some order and greedily choose directions to reach the desired sum.\n\nSo here's an outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Choose a topological order of the nodes. The source is first, the sink is last. The rest can be ordered in any way, but during the processing, we need to ensure that for each node, we can find the required subset of edges.\n\n2. For each node v in the topological order:\n\n   a. Compute X, the inflow from previously processed nodes (i.e., the sum of flows on edges between v and processed nodes, which are directed into v).\n\n   b. Compute T, the sum of flows on edges between v and unprocessed nodes.\n\n   c. Compute B = (X + T)/2. This is the required outflow from v to unprocessed nodes.\n\n   d. Select a subset of edges between v and unprocessed nodes whose total flow is B, and direct them away from v. The remaining edges are directed towards v.\n\n   e. Update the inflow for the unprocessed nodes accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement step 2d efficiently?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps we can use a greedy approach. For example, process the edges in arbitrary order and add them to the subset until the sum reaches B.\n\nBut how to ensure that this is possible?\n\nAlternatively, since the sum of flows is B, and the sum of all edges is T, which is equal to A + B, and B = (X + T)/2, which implies that T - X must be even, but since X is the inflow from processed nodes and T is the sum of flows between v and unprocessed nodes, and the total sum of flows for v is S = X + (A + B) = X + T. Also, since flow conservation requires that for v, the total inflow equals total outflow. Which for v (not source or sink) is S = 2 * (X + A) (since inflow is X + A, outflow is B = X + A). Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, for node v, the total inflow is X + A, and the total outflow is B. According to flow conservation, they must be equal. So X + A = B. And since T = A + B = (X + A) + A = X + 2A. But from earlier, B = (X + T)/2. Substituting T = X + 2A, we get B = (X + X + 2A)/2 = X + A. Which matches the equation X + A = B. So this is consistent.\n\nBut how to find A and B? Well, B is (X + T)/2, and T is the sum of flows between v and unprocessed nodes.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting a subset of edges between v and unprocessed nodes with sum B. Once this is done, those edges are directed away from v, and the rest are directed towards v.\n\nNow, how to find this subset?\n\nAssuming that the solution exists, perhaps we can do this by processing edges in some order and adding them to the subset until we reach the desired sum.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose T = 20, X = 5. Then B = (5 + 20)/2 = 12.5. Wait, but this can't happen since the flows are integers. Oh, but the problem states that a solution exists, which implies that T - X must be even. Let me check.\n\nSince S = sum of flows on edges incident to v. For node v, which is not source or sink, S must be even. Also, X is the sum of flows from processed nodes to v. The sum of flows between v and unprocessed nodes is T. So, S = X + T. Since S is even, X + T must be even. Therefore, (X + T) is even, so B = (X + T)/2 is integer.\n\nSo yes, B is an integer. So we can proceed.\n\nNow, how to find a subset of edges between v and unprocessed nodes whose sum is B. One way is to iterate through each edge and greedily add it if it doesn't exceed B.\n\nFor example, start with a sum of 0. For each edge in the list of edges between v and unprocessed nodes:\n\n- if adding the edge's flow to the current sum doesn't exceed B, add it and mark it as directed away from v. Else, leave it for later.\n\nThis is a greedy approach and may not work in all cases. But given that the problem says that a solution exists, perhaps this approach will work.\n\nBut why would it work? Because the sum of all edges is T, and B is (X + T)/2. Since T is the sum of all edges between v and unprocessed nodes, and B is the required sum, and the solution exists, there must be a subset that adds up to B. However, the greedy approach may not find it. For example, if there are edges with large values that can't be used.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model this as a graph traversal and find such a subset.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are undirected and the graph is connected, perhaps we can model this as a spanning tree and use that to determine the directions.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's think of another way.\n\nLet's think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal inflow and outflow. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can assign directions based on a topological order. To find the topological order, perhaps we can use a modified BFS or DFS approach.\n\nBut how to ensure the flow conservation during this process?\n\nMaybe the following approach can work:\n\n- Assign a topological order to the nodes. The source is first, the sink is last. For the rest of the nodes, assign them in any order, but during the assignment, ensure that for each node, the required outflow can be achieved.\n\nBut again, how to assign the topological order.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph with the following properties:\n\n- The directed graph is a DAG.\n\n- For each node except source and sink, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nTo achieve this, we can model the problem as a directed graph where each node has a potential (like in a DAG with levels). The direction of edges is determined by the potential difference.\n\nWait, this is similar to the idea of a directed graph with potentials, where edges go from higher potential to lower. This ensures that the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to assign potentials such that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nLet me think of the following. For each node v, assign a potential value p[v]. For each edge between u and v, we direct it from u to v if p[u] > p[v], and vice versa. This ensures the graph is acyclic if the potentials are unique and ordered.\n\nBut how to assign the potentials so that flow conservation holds.\n\nThe flow conservation for node v requires that the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. Which can be written as:\n\nsum_{edges directed into v} ci = sum_{edges directed out of v} ci.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{edges incident to v} ci * (direction) = 0,\n\nwhere direction is +1 if the edge is directed out of v, -1 if directed into v.\n\nBut how to relate this to the potentials.\n\nIf we assume that for each edge between u and v, the direction is determined by the potential difference, then for each edge, the contribution to the flow conservation is ci * (sign(p[u] - p[v])).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the potential as a value that represents the \"level\" of the node in the DAG. For example, the source is at level 0, and the sink is at level k. Other nodes are assigned levels between 0 and k. Edges are directed from lower levels to higher levels. This ensures that the graph is acyclic.\n\nThen, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed into v (from lower levels) must equal the sum of flows directed out of v (to higher levels).\n\nBut how to assign the levels and determine the directions.\n\nThis seems similar to the earlier problem of finding a topological order and determining the required outflow.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can assign levels to the nodes in such a way that for each node v, the sum of flows on edges to nodes with higher levels is equal to the sum of flows on edges from nodes with lower levels. This would ensure that the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nIt's unclear. Perhaps this is too abstract.\n\nLet me return to the earlier idea of processing nodes in a topological order and greedily directing edges to satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nLet's try to simulate this process.\n\nSuppose we have a topological order. Let's say the source is first, then some nodes, then the sink.\n\nFor each node v in the topological order:\n\n- We have already processed all nodes before v in the order.\n\n- For each edge between v and a previously processed node, it's directed from the processed node to v (since processed nodes are earlier in the order). These contribute to the inflow of v.\n\n- For each edge between v and a node that hasn't been processed yet, we can choose the direction.\n\nLet's denote:\n\ninflow_v = sum of flows on edges from processed nodes to v.\n\ntotal_unprocessed_flows = sum of flows on edges between v and unprocessed nodes.\n\nrequired_outflow = inflow_v.\n\nWe need to select a subset of these unprocessed edges to direct away from v, such that their total flow is required_outflow.\n\nOnce this is done, the remaining edges are directed towards v.\n\nBut how to select this subset?\n\nLet's think of the unprocessed edges as forming a set. We need to select a subset with sum equal to required_outflow.\n\nThis is the subset sum problem, but since the problem guarantees that a solution exists, we can find such a subset.\n\nBut how to find it efficiently?\n\nOne way is to process the edges in some order, adding them to the selected subset if it doesn't exceed the required_outflow.\n\nFor example, initialize a variable current_sum = 0. For each edge in the unprocessed edges:\n\n   if current_sum + ci <= required_outflow:\n\n       direct this edge away from v, add ci to current_sum\n\n   else:\n\n       direct it towards v.\n\nAt the end, current_sum should equal required_outflow. But why would this work?\n\nWell, suppose that the sum of all unprocessed flows is total_unprocessed_flows = T. We need to select a subset with sum B = (inflow_v + T)/2.\n\nBut since B = (inflow_v + T)/2, and T = sum of unprocessed flows, and inflow_v is the sum of flows from processed nodes to v.\n\nBut why would the greedy approach work?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose required_outflow is 10, and the unprocessed flows are [5, 6, 5]. Total T is 16. B = (inflow_v + T)/2. Let's say inflow_v is 6. Then B = (6 + 16)/2 = 11. So required_outflow is 11. The total of the edges is 16. So we need to select a subset of these edges with sum 11. The greedy approach would take 5, then 6 (sum 11), leaving 5. That works.\n\nAnother example: required_outflow is 7, and unprocessed flows are [3, 5, 4]. Total is 12. B = (inflow_v + 12)/2 = 7. So inflow_v must be 2. So required_outflow is 7. Greedy takes 3 (sum 3), then 5 (sum 8 exceeds 7), so skip. Then take 4 (sum 3+4=7). Done.\n\nThis seems to work. Another case: required_outflow is 7, and edges are [5, 4, 4]. Greedy takes 5 (sum 5), then 4 (sum 9 > 7, skip), then 4 (sum 5+4=9 > 7). So it fails. But there's a subset: 4 + 4 = 8, which is more than 7. Wait, but in this case, required_outflow is 7. But the total T is 5+4+4 = 13. B = (inflow_v + 13)/2 = 7. So inflow_v = 1. So required_outflow is 7. But the sum of the edges is 13, and B is 7. But the edges are 5,4,4. Can we find a subset that sums to 7? Yes: 5 + 4 is 9, no. 4 + 4 is 8, no. 5 + 4 - 2? No. It seems impossible. But according to the problem statement, a solution exists. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh, this indicates that my earlier assumption is incorrect. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to have a solution. So why is this case not possible?\n\nLet me recheck the math. For node v, the sum of flows on edges incident to it is S = inflow_v + T. For v not being source or sink, S must be even. In this case, S = 1 (inflow_v) + 13 = 14, which is even. B = (1 + 13)/2 = 7. So required",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies the maximum flow conditions and is acyclic.
