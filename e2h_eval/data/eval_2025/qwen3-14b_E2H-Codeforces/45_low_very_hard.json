There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a perfect binary tree. But here, the structure is different because of the rule. The rule probably restricts how the matches can be arranged, so we need to find the maximum possible games for the winner under these constraints.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=2, the answer is 1. That's straightforward. For n=3, the answer is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: first, the winner plays against one player (say, player 2), then the winner plays against player 3. But according to the rule, when the winner plays their second game, the opponent (player 3) has played zero games. The winner has played one game. The difference is one, which is allowed. So that's okay. \n\nFor n=4, the answer is 2. Wait, why isn't it 3? Because in a normal knockout, with 4 players, the winner plays 2 games. Oh right, because the tournament is structured as two rounds. But maybe there's a way to have more games? But according to the sample, the answer is 2. So the rule here must prevent the winner from having more games. \n\nSo how do we model this? Let's think recursively. Let's say the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). How can we find f(n)?\n\nLet's think about the structure of the tournament. The winner has to play against someone in each round. But each time, the opponent must have a number of games that's within one of the winner's current count. \n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the Fibonacci sequence. Because, perhaps, the maximum number of games is related to the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to n. Wait, let's think about it. \n\nSuppose the winner plays k games. Then, in order to reach that, the winner must have defeated k opponents. But each of those opponents must have been in a situation where they could play against the winner. Let's think recursively. For the winner to play their first game, they need an opponent. That's one game. For the second game, the opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. But if the winner is going to play their second game, that opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. Let's imagine that the winner's path requires that each time, the opponent comes from a subtree where they have a certain number of games.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a tree where each node represents a player. The winner's path is such that each match they play requires that their opponent's path is as long as possible but not differing by more than one. \n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, if the maximum number of games is k, then the minimum number of players required to achieve that is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Wait, let's think:\n\nFor example, if the winner plays 1 game, that requires 2 players. Which is Fib(3) = 2. For 2 games, the minimum players is 3 (Fib(4)=3). For 3 games, it would require Fib(5)=5 players. For 4 games, Fib(6)=8. For 5 games, Fib(7)=13, etc. \n\nWait, let's check the examples. For n=3, the answer is 2. Which would be Fib(4) = 3. So the maximum k where Fib(k+2) ≤ n is the answer. Wait, for n=3, Fib(4) is 3. So k is 2. Which matches the sample. For n=4, Fib(5)=5 is larger than 4. So the maximum Fib(k+2) ≤4 is Fib(4)=3, which gives k=2. Which matches the sample. For n=10, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13. So 8 is ≤10. So k is 4 (since Fib(6) is 8, k+2=6 →k=4). Which matches the sample where output is 4. \n\nYes! So the problem reduces to finding the largest k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n. Then the answer is k. \n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's think about the reasoning. \n\nLet's suppose that to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves understanding the relationship between the number of players and the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rule**: The key rule is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This constraint affects how matches are structured and limits the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Thus, we need to find the largest `k` such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the given number of players `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef max_games(n):\n    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n\n    fib = [0, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_fib > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_fib)\n    \n    # Find the largest k such that fib[k+2] <= n\n    # Since fib starts with 0, 1, then fib[2] is 1, fib[3] is 2, etc.\n    # For example, to get k=1, we need fib[3] = 2 <= n\n    # So the index in fib is k+2, so k = index - 2\n    # We need to find the maximum index where fib[index] <= n\n    # Then k = index - 2\n    # However, the initial fib list is [0, 1], which is index 0 and 1\n    # So let's adjust the indices correctly\n    for i in range(len(fib)-1, 1, -1):\n        if fib[i] <= n:\n            return i - 2\n    return 0  # If n is 1, but n >= 2 per input constraints\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: The code generates Fibonacci numbers up to the point where the next number exceeds the given number of players `n`.\n2. **Finding Maximum Games**: By iterating through the generated Fibonacci numbers, the code determines the largest index `i` such that the Fibonacci number at index `i` is less than or equal to `n`. The corresponding maximum number of games the winner can play is calculated as `i - 2`, derived from the relationship between Fibonacci indices and the number of games.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
