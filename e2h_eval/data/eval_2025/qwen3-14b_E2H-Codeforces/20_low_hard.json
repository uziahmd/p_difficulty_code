For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to compute this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the example given, a beautiful multiset is a collection of binary strings of length exactly n where, for every possible prefix s (of any length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix does not exceed c_s. The maximum possible size of such a multiset depends on how we choose the c_s values. Our goal is to find the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s constraints?\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For any string s of length l (from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix can't exceed c_s. However, the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. So for a given s (say of length l), each string in the multiset that starts with s contributes to the count for s. But also, for longer prefixes, like s followed by some bits, they will also be counted.\n\nThis seems similar to a trie structure. Each node in the trie represents a binary string (prefix). The constraints are that for each node, the number of strings in the multiset that pass through it (i.e., have it as a prefix) is at most c_s.\n\nBut how do we maximize the size of the multiset under these constraints?\n\nThe maximum possible size would be determined by the constraints on the prefixes. For example, if we have a constraint c_s for a certain prefix s, then the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix can't exceed c_s. However, since each string of length n has many prefixes (all its prefixes up to length n), the constraints must be compatible.\n\nWait, but when choosing the c_s values, we want to find the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. Then, the problem requires that for our chosen c_s's, this maximum is exactly f.\n\nSo the question becomes: how do we compute, for each possible set of c_s's, what is the maximum size of a beautiful multiset, and then count the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut considering that there are 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2 possible c_s's (since for each length from 1 to n, there are 2^l binary strings), this seems computationally infeasible directly. However, n is up to 15, which gives 2^16 - 2 = 65534 possible c_s's. Wait, no. Wait, sum_{l=1}^n 2^l = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16 - 2 = 65534. So for each of these 65534 variables, the c_s can be between 0 and k. But even with n=15, that's way too big to handle directly.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the maximum size of the beautiful multiset. How is this determined?\n\nThe maximum size of the multiset is equivalent to the maximum number of strings of length n that can be chosen such that for every prefix s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis problem resembles a flow network or a problem where we have constraints on the number of elements passing through certain nodes. Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to a tree where each node has a capacity, and we need to find the maximum number of paths from root to leaves, such that no node is exceeded.\n\nWait, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is equivalent to the maximum number of paths (each path being a string of length n) such that for every node (prefix), the number of paths passing through it is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum? It's similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of paths in a trie where each node has a capacity, and each path goes from the root to a leaf (length n). The maximum number of such paths is determined by the minimum capacities along the paths. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem of choosing for each node (prefix) a value c_s, and then the maximum number",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values $ c_s $ for all binary strings $ s $ of lengths from 1 to $ n $ such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $. The solution involves dynamic programming and combinatorial counting with modular arithmetic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string $ s $ of length from 1 to $ n $ has a constraint $ c_s $ which limits the number of strings in the multiset that can have $ s $ as a prefix.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to assign values to all binary strings of length up to $ i $ such that the maximum number of strings in the multiset is exactly $ j $.\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each length $ i $, we consider all possible values of $ c_s $ and update the DP table accordingly, ensuring the constraints are respected.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo $ 998244353 $ for all operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n        idx += 3\n    \n    for case in cases:\n        n, k, f = case\n        \n        # Precompute powers of 2\n        max_len = n\n        total_nodes = (1 << (n + 1)) - 2  # 2^1 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1)-2\n        # But for our DP, we need to process each level from 1 to n\n        \n        # dp[i][j] = number of ways to assign c_s for strings up to length i, with max size j\n        # However, since n is up to 15, and f up to 2e5, we need a way to compute it efficiently\n        \n        # Let's think recursively.

So the maximum number of strings in the multiset is min(c_s * 2^{n-l}) for all s.\n        \n        # Wait, this seems promising! Because for any node s of length l, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. Each such string can be extended in 2^{n-l} ways. So the maximum number of strings that can be chosen without violating any constraint is the minimum of c_s * 2^{n-l} over all s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum over all prefixes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # Our task is to count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that this minimum is exactly f.\n        \n        # So the problem reduces to: count the number of ways to assign c_s for all s (of length 1..n) with 0 <= c_s <=k, such that min_{s} (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) = f.\n        \n        # Now, how to compute this?\n        \n        # Let's think about all s.
