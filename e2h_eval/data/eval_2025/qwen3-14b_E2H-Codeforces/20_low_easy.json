For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, the task is to compute the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. Let's break down the problem. First, what defines a beautiful multiset? For every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of exactly n-length binary strings. The maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. Our goal is to count the number of c_s assignments that make this true.\n\nWait, but the problem says that for each possible assignment of c_s, we need to ensure that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, for each such assignment, there exists some beautiful multiset with size f, and no larger one exists.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems complicated. Let's think about how to find the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s values. Then, we need to count the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about the maximum size. How is it determined?\n\nThe maximum size would be the minimal constraints imposed by all prefixes. For example, consider that each string in the multiset contributes to the counts of all its prefixes. So, for the entire multiset, the counts for each prefix must be <= their respective c_s.\n\nThis feels similar to a problem where you have constraints on the number of elements that can be chosen, based on their prefixes. The maximum size of the multiset would be the minimum over certain values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined by the constraints in a hierarchical way. For example, if you have a tree structure where each node represents a binary string, and each node has children (appending 0 or 1). Then, the constraints on the nodes (c_s) must be respected. The maximum number of elements in the multiset is the sum over all leaves (n-length strings) of some variables, but subject to the constraints that for each node, the sum of the counts of its descendants (including itself) does not exceed c_s.\n\nWait, but the multiset consists of exactly n-length strings. Each such string contributes to the count of all its prefixes. For example, the string '01' contributes to the count of '0', '01', and also to the count of the empty string? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the strings in the multiset are of length exactly n. So for a string s of length m (from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. For example, if the multiset contains the string '010' (n=3), then the prefixes are '0', '01', '010'. So for each of these prefixes, the count increases by 1.\n\nSo, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints on all prefixes. The maximum possible size is the largest number of n-length strings that can be selected such that for every prefix s (of any length up to n), the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the number of c_s assignments (each c_s is between 0 and k, inclusive) such that the maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this maximum possible size? It seems like this is equivalent to the minimal value of (sum over some constraints). Wait, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the constraints in a way similar to the inclusion-exclusion principle. For example, if you think of the constraints as a tree, then for each node, the number of elements in its subtree can't exceed c_s. But since each element is in the subtree of all its prefixes, the constraints must be compatible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is equal to the minimum of the sum of c_s for the root (the empty string?), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the maximum possible size is determined by the constraints on the prefixes. For example, for each node (binary string), the number of elements in the multiset that have this string as a prefix is limited by c_s. However, each element contributes to all of its prefixes. So the problem resembles a flow problem where the constraints are on the capacities of the prefixes.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of choosing a multiset of n-length strings such that for each prefix s, the number of strings in the multiset that start with s is at most c_s. The maximum size",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign values to each binary string prefix such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. The solution involves understanding constraints on prefixes and efficiently computing valid configurations using dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string of length up to `n` has a constraint `c_s` (ranging from 0 to `k`). A beautiful multiset must respect these constraints for all prefixes.\n2. **Tree Structure**: Binary strings can be visualized as a tree where each node represents a prefix, and edges represent appending '0' or '1'.\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use DP to compute the number of valid configurations for each node in the tree. This helps in efficiently calculating constraints and their implications on the maximum multiset size.\n4. **Combinatorial Counting**: Use modular arithmetic to count valid configurations while ensuring the result fits within the constraints of large numbers and modulo operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    cases = []\n    for i in range(0, len(data), 3):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        k = int(data[i+1])\n        f = int(data[i+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, k, f in cases:\n        if f > k * (1 << n):\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to (1 << n)\n        max_len = 1 << n\n        fact = [1] * (max_len + 1)\n        for i in range(1, max_len + 1):\n            fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n        \n        inv_fact = [1] * (max_len + 1)\n        inv_fact[max_len] = pow(fact[max_len], MOD-2, MOD)\n        for i in range(max_len-1, -1, -1):\n            inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n        \n        # dp[i]: number of ways to assign c_s for all strings of length <= i\n        # such that the maximum possible size is exactly f\n        # We need to compute for all levels from 1 to n\n        # But how?\n        # Let's think recursively.
