He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a string is formed in a specific way. Let me break down the steps:\n\nFirst, A has a string with some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's to the end, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, maybe the count of 'c's equals both. \n\nSo, given a string S, I have to check if it could have been formed in this way.\n\nLet me think about the conditions that the string must satisfy.\n\nFirst, the string must consist of a sequence of a's followed by b's followed by c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So any valid string must have all a's before any b's, and all b's before any c's. If there's a 'c' followed by an 'a' or 'b', that's invalid. Similarly, if there's a 'b' after a 'c', that's invalid.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So the characters must be grouped in that order.\n\nSo first step: check that the string is composed of a's, then b's, then c's. For example, 'aaabccc' is okay. But 'abbaacc' would not be okay because after the first b, there's another a.\n\nSo how to check this? Well, we can iterate through the string and ensure that once a 'b' is encountered, there are no more 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there are no more 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into three parts: the a part, the b part, and the c part. For example, the string should be something like 'a...ab...bc...c'.\n\nSo first, check the order. If the order is wrong, return NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then we need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts. Let's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\nAfter A and B's steps, the string has some a's followed by some b's. Then C adds c's equal to either the count of a's (original count) or the count of b's (original count). But wait, when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's is the same as in the string before adding the c's. Because C appends the c's. So the count of c's in the final string is equal to either count_a (original) or count_b (original). But in the final string, the count of a's and b's is the same as before adding the c's. Because adding c's doesn't change the a and b counts.\n\nSo, the count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). But in the final string, the count of a's is the original count, same for b's. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the original count of a's is count_a, and original count of b's is count_b. Because the c's are added after. So in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. So the condition is that count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, there's the condition that after B appends the b's, there's at least one a and one b. So the original string (before adding c's) must have at least one a and one b. Which implies that in the final string, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. Because adding c's doesn't affect a and b counts. So in the final string, count_a and count_b must be at least 1. Also, since the original string (after A and B) must have at least one a and one b. So in the final string, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nSo putting it all together, the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is in the form a*b*c* (i.e., all a's first, then all b's, then all c's).\n\n2. The count of c's is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\n3. count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nSo let's think about the steps to check these conditions.\n\nFirst, check the order. How?\n\nWe can check that the string is composed of a's, then b's, then c's. So for example, the string can be split into three parts. Let's think of the positions where the transitions happen.\n\nFor example, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all a's. Similarly, the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all b's.\n\nSo, for the string S:\n\nCheck that all a's are before any b's and all b's are before any c's.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nWe can check that:\n\n- All characters in the string up to the first 'b' are 'a's.\n\n- All characters from the first 'b' to the first 'c' are 'b's.\n\n- All characters after the first 'c' are 'c's.\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is in the form a*b*c*.\n\nAnother approach is to check that the string does not contain any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b's after a 'c'.\n\nSo, for example, once we see a 'b', the rest of the string can't have 'a's. Once we see a 'c', the rest can't have 'a's or 'b's.\n\nSo, here's a possible way to check the order:\n\nInitialize variables for the allowed characters. Initially, allowed is 'a'. Once a 'b' is encountered, allowed becomes 'b' and 'c'. Once a 'c' is encountered, allowed becomes 'c'.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nWe can iterate through the string, and track the current allowed characters.\n\nInitially, allowed is 'a'.\n\nWhen we encounter a 'b', then allowed becomes 'b' and 'c' (since after the first 'b', we can have more 'b's and then 'c's). Wait, but after the first 'b', we can't have any more 'a's. So once the first 'b' is found, the allowed characters are 'b' and 'c'.\n\nSimilarly, once a 'c' is found, the allowed characters are only 'c'.\n\nSo, here's a way to check:\n\ncurrent_state = 'a'\n\nfor each char in S:\n\n    if current_state is 'a':\n\n        if char is 'a': continue\n\n        elif char is 'b': current_state becomes 'b'\n\n        elif char is 'c': current_state becomes 'c'\n\n    elif current_state is 'b':\n\n        if char is 'b': continue\n\n        elif char is 'c': current_state becomes 'c'\n\n        else: invalid (because 'a' is not allowed after 'b')\n\n    elif current_state is 'c':\n\n        if char is 'c': continue\n\n        else: invalid (any other character)\n\nSo, if during iteration, any invalid character is found, the order is invalid.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So, the string can be divided into three parts: the first part is all a's, the second part is all b's, the third part is all c's. So, the string can be split into three parts. For example, the first part is a's, then b's, then c's. So, for the entire string, the characters must be in this order.\n\nAnother approach is to check that the string is made of a's, then b's, then c's. So, the string can be split into three parts. For example, the first part is all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be split into three parts. Let's find the index where the a's end and b's start. Then find where the b's end and c's start.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can check that the string has no 'a's after the first occurrence of 'b' or 'c'.\n\nSimilarly, no 'b's after the first occurrence of 'c'.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nCheck that the string has no 'a's after the first 'b' or 'c'.\n\nCheck that the string has no 'b's after the first 'c'.\n\nSo, for example, in Python:\n\ns = input string.\n\nif any of the following is true:\n\n- there exists an 'a' after a 'b' or 'c' in the string.\n\n- there exists a 'b' after a 'c' in the string.\n\nThen it's invalid.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nWe can check:\n\nCheck that all the 'a's are before all the 'b's and 'c's. So, the first occurrence of 'b' or 'c' must be after all 'a's.\n\nSimilarly, all 'b's must be before all 'c's.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nthe first occurrence of 'b' is after all 'a's. And the first occurrence of 'c' is after all 'b's.\n\nAlternatively, the first occurrence of 'b' is at position i, and all characters before i are 'a's. Then, the first occurrence of 'c' is at position j, and all characters between i and j are 'b's. Then, all characters after j are 'c's.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nPerhaps, the following steps:\n\nCheck that the string has no 'a's after the first 'b' or 'c'.\n\nCheck that the string has no 'b's after the first 'c'.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nhas_b = False\n\nhas_c = False\n\nfor char in s:\n\n    if char == 'a':\n\n        if has_b or has_c:\n\n            return False\n\n    elif char == 'b':\n\n        if has_c:\n\n            return False\n\n        has_b = True\n\n    elif char == 'c':\n\n        has_c = True\n\nSo, this code would check that once a 'b' is encountered, no 'a's can come after. Once a 'c' is encountered, no 'a's or 'b's can come after.\n\nThis seems correct. Because:\n\n- When we see an 'a', we check if we have already seen a 'b' or 'c' (which would mean that this 'a' is appearing after a 'b' or 'c', which is invalid).\n\n- When we see a 'b', we check if we have already seen a 'c' (if yes, then invalid, since 'b' can't come after 'c'). Then mark that we have seen a 'b'.\n\n- When we see a 'c', mark that we have seen a 'c' (but no checks except that we can't have 'b's after that).\n\nThis seems to correctly check the order. So that's the first condition.\n\nOnce that is satisfied, then proceed to check the counts.\n\nNow, the counts:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nWe need to check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nAlso, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nBecause, the original string after A and B has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Since the original string is the a's and b's part, and then the c's are added. So the count of a and b in the final string is same as in the original string. So count_a and count_b must be at least 1.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\nif (count_a >=1 and count_b >=1) and (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b):\n\nthen return YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is all a's and c's? For example, if there are no b's? Then the count_b is zero. Which would fail the count_b >=1 condition.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCheck the order (as above) → if invalid, return NO.\n\nElse, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nCheck that count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nCheck that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these are true, return YES, else NO.\n\nSo let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → count_a is 3, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So count_c equals count_a (3), and count_a and count_b are >=1. So YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the order is b, then a, which is invalid. Because after a 'b' is encountered, there's an 'a' later. So the order check would fail. So output is NO. Which matches the example.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 1. So count_c equals count_b (1). And count_a and count_b are >=1. So YES.\n\nAnother example: 'ab' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=0. Then count_c is 0. So it's not equal to count_a or count_b. So output is NO. But according to the problem statement, the original string after A and B must have at least one a and one b, and then C appends some c's. So in this case, the string is 'ab' which has no c's. So according to the problem, the C appends some number of c's. So the original string (after A and B) is 'ab' (count_a=1, count_b=1). Then C appends c's. But in this case, the string has no c's. Which implies that C appended zero c's. But according to the problem statement, C appends some number of letters 'c' (so zero is not allowed?), but looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nC appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. \n\nWait, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. So the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string (before adding the c's). So, the count_c in the final string is equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). But in the case of the string 'ab', the count_c is zero. So that would imply that C added zero c's. But the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' (so at least one?), but the problem statement says \"some number\" which can be zero? Or is it required that C appends at least one?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\nBut the original string (after A and B) has at least one a and one b. So, the count of a and count of b are at least one. So, C appends either count_a or count_b letters. Which would be at least one. Therefore, the final string must have at least one c. Because C appends some number of c's (which is either count_a or count_b, which are >=1). Therefore, in the final string, the count_c must be >=1.\n\nBut in our previous example of 'ab', the count_c is zero. Which would not satisfy that. Therefore, the problem requires that the final string has at least one c.\n\nWait, but the problem says that C appends some number of letters. So the number of c's added is equal to count_a or count_b. Which is at least one. Therefore, the final string must have count_c >=1. So, in our code, we need to check that count_c is at least one. Because if the string has no c's, then it's invalid.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, in the third example, the input is 'aabc', which has one c. So that's valid.\n\nSo, the conditions for the string are:\n\n- The order is correct (a's, then b's, then c's).\n\n- count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n- count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo, in the example of 'ab', the count_c is zero. So the code would return NO.\n\nBut what if the string is 'ab' with no c's? Then the code would check the order (correct), count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=0. Then, count_c is zero. Which is not equal to count_a or count_b. So returns NO. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about a string like 'abc'? Let's see. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_a (1) and count_b (1). So that's valid. So returns YES.\n\nSo, in code, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. Also, count_c must be >=1, because C appends some number of c's. So, the code needs to check that count_c is at least 1.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the count_c is the number of c's in the string. Which is exactly the number of c's added by C. Because the original string (before C added c's) had zero c's. Because A's string was all a's, then B added b's. So the original string before C added c's had no c's. So the number of c's in the final string is exactly the number added by C, which is equal to count_a or count_b (original counts). Which are at least 1. Therefore, the count_c must be at least 1.\n\nTherefore, in the code, the count_c must be >=1.\n\nSo, in code, after checking the order, we need to check:\n\ncount_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nAnd count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b <1 or count_c <1:\n\n    return NO\n\nelse:\n\n    check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo, putting all together.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck the order (a's followed by b's followed by c's). If invalid, return NO.\n\nElse, compute counts.\n\nCheck if count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nCheck if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all conditions are met, return YES, else NO.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. So count_c equals both a and b. So valid. Output YES.\n\nTest case 2: 'aabbcc' → count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2. So count_c equals count_a and count_b. Valid. YES.\n\nTest case 3: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c is not equal to either. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_a. So valid. YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → count_a=4, count_b=4, count_c=4. So count_c equals count_a and count_b. Valid. YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=2. count_c equals count_a. Valid. YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a=2, count_b=2. So count_c is not equal to either. So invalid. Output NO.\n\nWhat about a string with only a's and c's, but no b's? For example, 'aacc' → order is a then c. But in this case, the order is correct (a's followed by c's). But count_b is 0. So the check count_b >=1 will fail. So output is NO.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=0, count_c=1. So count_b is 0 → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'aacc' → order is correct. count_b is zero → invalid.\n\nNow, what about the string 'abcc'? Order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=2. count_c is 2. Which is not equal to count_a (1) or count_b (1). So invalid. Output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abbcc' → count_a=1, count_b=2, count_c=2. count_c equals count_b → valid. YES.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is all a's and b's, but no c's. For example, 'aabbaa' → order is a then b then a → invalid. So the order check would fail. So output NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abba' → order is invalid, since after the first 'b', there's an 'a' again. So order check fails. Output NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing the order check.\n\nIn Python, for the order check, perhaps:\n\ndef is_valid_order(s):\n\n    has_b = False\n\n    has_c = False\n\n    for char in s:\n\n        if char == 'a':\n\n            if has_b or has_c:\n\n                return False\n\n        elif char == 'b':\n\n            if has_c:\n\n                return False\n\n            has_b = True\n\n        elif char == 'c':\n\n            has_c = True\n\n    return True\n\nYes, this function returns True if the order is correct.\n\nNow, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen check:\n\nif not is_valid_order(s):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 and count_c >=1:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'abccc'? count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=3. So count_c is not equal to count_a or count_b. So output NO.\n\nBut what if the string is 'abcc'? count_c is 2. count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So 2 is not equal to either. So output NO.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3. So count_c equals count_a → YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order is invalid. Because after 'b's, there is an 'a' (the third character is 'a' in 'bbacc')? Let's see the string 'bbacc' → the first two are 'b's. Then 'a' comes. So during the loop, when processing the third character (a), has_b is True, so returns False. So the order check returns False. Hence output is NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is a's then b's then c's. So valid. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. count_c equals count_b → YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → valid. counts are 1,1,1. So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → order is valid. counts are 1,1,0. So the count_c is 0 → invalid. Output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → order is valid. count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1. So count_c is not equal to either. Output NO.\n\nSo code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'a' → order is valid, but count_b is 0. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → order is valid. count_b is 0 → output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → counts are 2,2,2 → YES.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabcc' → count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c equals count_a. So output YES.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'abbbc' → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_a → YES.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 2. So yes.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nImplement the order check.\n\nThen check the counts.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code for the order check can be written as follows.\n\nBut the code needs to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Wait, the input is a single string. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: the first and only line consists of a string S. So the code reads a single string, and outputs YES or NO.\n\nWait, the sample input shows a list of inputs and outputs, but that's probably for the example. The actual input is a single string.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The first and only line consists of a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 5000). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo the code reads a single string. So the sample input given in the problem is probably for multiple test cases, but the actual code needs to process a single string. Wait, no, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nBut that's probably for the purpose of the example. But in reality, the code is supposed to read a single string from standard input. Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line. So for example, the user would input a single string. But the sample input shows a list of strings. But perhaps that's just for the example. So the actual code is supposed to process one string per test case. So for example, in the code submission, the code reads one string from stdin, and outputs YES or NO.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the code is given a list of strings. But that's probably not the case. The problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one string. So in the sample input, perhaps the user input is, for example, 'aaabccc', and the output is 'YES'.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of strings. That's probably for the purpose of the example. For example, the sample input may be a list of test cases, but the code is supposed to process one string per run. So in the code submission, the code should read one line from stdin.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases? No. The problem says that the input is a single string. So the code is supposed to process that.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nCheck the order.\n\nThen check the counts.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing that.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead S from input.\n\nCheck the order.\n\nThen check counts.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_valid_order(s):\n\n    has_b = False\n\n    has_c = False\n\n    for char in s:\n\n        if char == 'a':\n\n            if has_b or has_c:\n\n                return False\n\n        elif char == 'b':\n\n            if has_c:\n\n                return False\n\n            has_b = True\n\n        elif char == 'c':\n\n            has_c = True\n\n    return True\n\nif not is_valid_order(s):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a >= 1 and count_b >=1 and count_c >=1:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut let's test for the case where the string is 'abc' → returns YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → count_c is 2. count_a=1, count_b=1. So 2 is not equal to either → output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → count_c is 1, count_a=1, count_b=3. So count_c equals count_a → YES.\n\nNow, let's think about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2. So count_c equals both. So YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a=2, count_b=2. So no. Output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → count_c=2, count_a=2 → YES.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1. So count_c is not equal to either. So output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aaaabbbbcccc' → count_a=4, count_b=4, count_c=4. So count_c equals both → YES.\n\nNow, what about a string with only 'c's? Like 'ccc' → order check: the first character is 'c'. Then, the code proceeds. But count_a is zero, count_b is zero. So the code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=0 → returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aacc' → order is correct. count_b=0 → returns NO.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3 → YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → during order check, the third character is 'a', but has_b is True. So returns False → output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1 → count_c equals count_b → YES.\n\nSo sample outputs are correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → order is correct, but count_c is 0 → returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → returns YES.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'bacc'? The order check would be:\n\nFirst character is 'b' → has_b becomes True. Then 'a' comes. So during the loop, when processing 'a', has_b is True → returns False. So order is invalid → output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abba' → during processing, after 'b', there is 'a' → returns False.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → order is correct. counts are 2,2,2 → YES.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by following specific rules involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular sequence. The string must be formed by first having some number of 'a's, followed by some number of 'b's, and then some number of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Order Check**: The string must be composed of all 'a's followed by all 'b's and then all 'c's. This ensures that the sequence of characters is maintained as per the problem constraints.\n2. **Count Check**: After verifying the order, we check the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The counts of 'a' and 'b' must be at least 1 (since both are required in the initial steps), and the count of 'c' must be equal to either the count of 'a' or 'b'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_valid_order(s):\n    has_b = False\n    has_c = False\n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if has_b or has_c:\n                return False\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if has_c:\n                return False\n            has_b = True\n        elif char == 'c':\n            has_c = True\n    return True\n\nif not is_valid_order(s):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1 and count_c >= 1:\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The function `is_valid_order` iterates through the string to ensure that once a 'b' or 'c' is encountered, no previous 'a' or 'b' can appear later in the string. This ensures the correct sequence of characters.\n2. **Count Check**: After confirming the order, the code checks the counts of each character. If the counts of 'a' and 'b' are at least 1 and the count of 'c' matches either the count of 'a' or 'b', the string is valid.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural and numerical constraints of the problem, ensuring correctness and adherence to the given rules.",
