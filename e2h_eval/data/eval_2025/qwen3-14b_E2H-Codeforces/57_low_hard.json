His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on the given points from two tours. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. We have n participants. Each has a score in the first tour (array a) and second tour (array b). But the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to the same participant. However, Vasya's total points are at least x. So we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each a and b must be used exactly once, right? Because each participant has one first tour and one second tour score. Oh wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but they are given in arbitrary order. So the actual pairing between a_i and b_j is unknown. For example, for each participant, their first tour score is some a_i and second tour is some b_j, but the teacher doesn't know which a_i pairs with which b_j. However, it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. \n\nOur job is to find the best possible rank (minimum possible) and worst possible rank (maximum possible) that Vasya could have, considering all possible valid pairings of a and b. \n\nSo, for the best rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total points (so that he is as high as possible), and for the worst rank, we want to minimize his total points (so that he is as low as possible). But also, we need to consider how others' totals are arranged. \n\nWait, but how do we model this? Let's think.\n\nThe key idea here is that for the best possible rank, we need to assign Vasya's a_i and b_j such that his total is as high as possible. Then, arrange other participants' scores in such a way that as many as possible have lower totals than him. Conversely, for the worst possible rank, we need to assign Vasya's a_i and b_j such that his total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and arrange others' totals such that as many as possible have higher or equal totals.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's break it down.\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, count how many other participants can have a total >= that value. But since we can arrange the pairings for others, perhaps we can arrange others' totals to be as small as possible. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that when there are ties, the jury can assign places as they choose. So for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's total is the maximum possible, and then arrange that others have as few as possible totals equal or higher than him. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's total is the maximum possible. Then, the number of people who have a total strictly greater than that is zero. So his rank is 1. But maybe not. Because if others can have higher totals. Wait, but how can others have higher totals if we are trying to maximize Vasya's total?\n\nWait, no. Because the way the pairings are done for other participants can affect their totals. For example, suppose Vasya's best possible total is S. Then, for other participants, we can pair their a's and b's in a way that their total is as low as possible. Thus, making sure that as few as possible people have a total >= S. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the best rank, we need to select a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, the minimal possible rank is 1, because even if there are others with the same total, the jury can assign him first place. But if there are others with higher totals, then his rank would be worse. Wait, but how can there be others with higher totals if we've chosen the maximum possible for Vasya?\n\nAh, no. Because if Vasya's total is the maximum possible, then others cannot have a higher total. Because for any other participant, their a and b values are part of the arrays, so the maximum possible total for any participant would be the maximum a_i + b_j. So if Vasya's total is that maximum, then no one else can have a higher total. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1. But wait, what if there are multiple participants that can achieve that maximum total? For example, if there are two pairs (a_i, b_j) and (a_k,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours. The scores from each tour are given as separate lists, and we need to consider all possible pairings of these scores to find the optimal ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank for Vasya, we need to maximize his total score. This is done by pairing the highest scores from the first tour with the highest scores from the second tour. Once we have the maximum possible score for Vasya, we count how many other participants can achieve a score greater than or equal to this maximum. However, since the jury can assign ties arbitrarily, the best possible rank is always 1 if Vasya's score is the highest possible.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank for Vasya, we need to minimize his total score while still meeting the minimum requirement (at least `x`). This involves finding the smallest possible score that is at least `x` and then counting how many participants can achieve a score greater than or equal to this minimum score. The worst rank is determined by considering the maximum number of participants who could have higher scores than Vasya's minimum score.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx]:\n        n, x = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        cases.append((n, x, a, b))\n    \n    results = []\n    for case in cases:\n        n, x, a, b = case\n        a_sorted = sorted(a)\n        b_sorted = sorted(b)\n        \n        # Best possible place\n        best = 1\n        \n        # Worst possible place\n        # Find the minimal possible total for Vasya >= x\n        # To get the worst rank, we need to choose the minimal possible total for Vasya that is >=x\n        # Then, count how many people can have total >= that value\n        # To find the minimal possible total, we can use a greedy approach\n        \n        # Sort a in ascending order, b in descending order\n        a_asc = sorted(a)\n        b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n        # Find the minimal possible total for Vasya >=x\n        # We can try to find the minimal sum >=x by taking the smallest a and largest b\n        # But need to check all possible pairs that sum >=x\n        # However, to find the minimal sum >=x, we can use two pointers approach\n        # Let's find the minimal possible sum >=x\n        \n        min_vasya_sum = None\n        i = 0\n        j = n - 1\n        while i < n and j >= 0:\n            current = a[i] + b[j]\n            if current >= x:\n                if min_vasya_sum is None or current < min_vasya_sum:\n                    min_vasya_sum = current\n                j -= 1\n            else:\n                i += 1\n        \n        # Now, find how many people can have sum >= min_vasya_sum\n        # For this, we need to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have sum >= min_vasya_sum\n        # To find this, we can sort a and b, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j that when added to a_i gives >= target\n        # Then, count how many such pairs can be formed, but since we need to maximize the count of people with sum >= target, we can use a greedy approach\n        \n        # Sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order\n        a_asc = sorted(a)\n        b_asc = sorted(b)\n        target = min_vasya_sum\n        count = 0\n        # Use two pointers approach\n        i = 0\n        j = n - 1\n        while i < n and j >= 0:\n            if a_asc[i] + b_asc[j] >= target:\n                count += 1\n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n            else:\n                i += 1\n        \n        worst = count\n        \n        results.append(f\"{best} {worst}\")\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into multiple test cases.\n2. **Sorting**: The scores from both tours are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing.\n3. **Best Rank Calculation**: The best possible rank is always 1 because we can maximize Vasya's score to be the highest possible.\n4. **Worst Rank Calculation**: The worst possible rank is determined by finding the minimum score Vasya can achieve that meets the requirement and then counting how many participants can have scores greater than or equal to this minimum score using a two-pointer technique.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine both the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya by leveraging sorting and two-pointer techniques to handle large input sizes effectively.",
