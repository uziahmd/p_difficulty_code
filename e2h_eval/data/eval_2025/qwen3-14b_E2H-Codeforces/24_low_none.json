She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The browser has n tabs, and the cursor is at position pos. Each second, she can move left or right (but within the current open tabs' boundaries) or close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position. \n\nThe key here is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize time. Let's think about what needs to be done. \n\nThe tabs that need to stay open are those between l and r. So, any tabs outside this range need to be closed. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps required. For example, if the current position is such that she can close all tabs to the left and right in one move, that would be optimal. But maybe she needs to move the cursor first to the correct position to perform those closes.\n\nLet me consider the cases:\n\nCase 1: The current [l, r] is already the entire range. Then, no action is needed. So the answer is 0. Like the third example where input is 5 2 1 5. Output is 0.\n\nCase 2: The current position is such that closing left or right is possible. For example, in the second example, input is 6 3 1 3. So the desired range is 1-3. The cursor is at 3. Closing all tabs to the right (tabs 4-6) would take 1 second. Because when she's at 3, she can close all tabs to the right (since the current a is 1, b is 6. After closing right, the new b becomes 3. So that's one operation.\n\nSo the main idea is to determine the positions where she needs to close the left and right parts. Let's think about the necessary steps.\n\nThe tabs to the left of l must be closed. Similarly, tabs to the right of r must be closed. So, she needs to perform two operations: close left (if needed) and close right (if needed). However, each of these operations can be done once, but she needs to be at the correct position to do them.\n\nBut how to get to the correct positions?\n\nFor example, to close the tabs to the left of l, she needs to be at position l. Because then closing all tabs to the left (which are from a to l-1) would close them. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to be at position r. Then closing to the right would close all tabs from r+1 to b.\n\nWait, but what if l is 1? Then there's nothing to the left. So no need to close left. Similarly for r =n.\n\nSo first, we need to check whether l is 1 or not. If l is 1, then no need to close left. Otherwise, she needs to close the left part. Similarly for r.\n\nBut how to get to the positions where she can perform those closes?\n\nLet me think about the steps required:\n\nSuppose that we need to close the left part. So, the first step is to move the cursor to l. Then close left. Then, perhaps move to r and close right. Or maybe there's a more optimal path.\n\nBut moving to l and then to r could take some steps. Alternatively, maybe she can do some steps in a different order.\n\nBut what's the minimal steps?\n\nLet me think about the scenario where both left and right need to be closed.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So the desired range is 2-4. The initial position is 3. So, the left part is tabs 1, which need to be closed. The right part is tabs 5 and 6.\n\nTo close the left part, she needs to be at position 2. Then close left. Then, she needs to be at position 4 to close the right part. \n\nSo steps:\n\nMove from 3 to 2 (1 second). Close left (1 second). Now, the tabs are 2-4. Then, move from 2 to 4 (2 seconds). Close right (1 second). Total is 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5 seconds. Which matches the first example.\n\nBut wait, the movement steps and the closing steps are each counted as one second. So each movement is one second, each close is one second.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nEach move left or right takes one second. Each close takes one second. So, the total steps are the sum of the moves and the closes.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified range [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Required Actions**: Determine if tabs to the left of `l` or to the right of `r` need to be closed.\n2. **Cursor Movement**: Calculate the time required to move the cursor to the appropriate positions to perform the closing operations efficiently.\n3. **Closing Operations**: Each closing operation (left or right) takes one second, and movement to the required positions takes additional seconds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the current range is already [l, r], no action needed\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Determine whether we need to close left and/or right\n    close_left = l > 1\n    close_right = r < n\n\n    total_time = 0\n\n    # If we need to close left, move to l and close\n    if close_left:\n        # Time to move from pos to l\n        total_time += abs(pos - l)\n        # Close left\n        total_time += 1\n\n    # If we need to close right, move to r and close\n    if close_right:\n        # After closing left, the current position is l, then move to r\n        # Or if we didn't close left, the current position is pos\n        # So, after closing left, the position is l, else it's pos\n        current_pos = l if close_left else pos\n        total_time += abs(current_pos - r)\n        total_time += 1\n\n    print(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the desired range [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no operations are needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Closing Left Tabs**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, move the cursor to `l` and close the left tabs. This involves moving from the current position to `l` and then performing the close operation.\n3. **Closing Right Tabs**: If there are tabs to the right of `r`, move the cursor from the current position (after closing left tabs if needed) to `r` and close the right tabs. This involves moving from the current position to `r` and then performing the close operation.\n\nThis approach ensures that we minimize the number of movements and operations by directly targeting the necessary positions for closing tabs, thus optimizing the total time required.",
