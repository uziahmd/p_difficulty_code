He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Oh right, and the count of 'c's can be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the string must have a certain structure. Let me break down the conditions.\n\nFirst, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Because:\n\n- A's string has at least one 'a'.\n- B adds at least one 'b'.\n- C adds at least one 'c' (since the count of c's is equal to the number of a's or b's. But since after B's step, there are at least one a and one b, so the count of c's would be at least 1.)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that when C appends the 'c's, the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that time. So, for example, if after B's step, the string has 2 a's and 3 b's, then C can add 2 c's (matching a's) or 3 c's (matching b's). So the total c's in the final string would be either 2 or 3. So the final string must have at least one c. So the input string must have at least one of each a, b, c.\n\nSo first, check if the string contains at least one a, one b, and one c. If not, immediately return NO.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that B ensures that there's at least one a and one b. So the original string from A is all a's, then B adds some b's. So the string before C adds c's has at least one a and one b. Then C adds c's. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. So the input string must have all three characters. So if any of them is missing, output is NO.\n\nSo first step: check counts of a, b, c. Let's say count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nIf any of count_a, count_b, count_c is zero, return NO.\n\nThen, the next part is that the count of c's must be equal to count_a (original a's) or count_b (original b's) in the string before adding c's. Wait, no. Wait, the count of c's added by C is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string at that time. The string at that time is the string after B added the b's, but before adding the c's. So, the count of a's in that string is the original count of a's (since B didn't add any a's). Similarly, the count of b's is the original count of b's (since C hasn't added any c's yet). So, the count of c's added is equal to the original count of a's (count_a) or original count of b's (count_b). So the total count_c in the final string is equal to either count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but the count of c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string before adding c's. So, for example, suppose the string before adding c's has x a's and y b's. Then, the number of c's added is either x or y. So the final count_c is x or y.\n\nBut in the final string, the count of a's is x, count of b's is y, and count of c's is x or y.\n\nSo, for the given string S, we need to check whether count_c equals count_a or count_b. But wait, because the count_a and count_b in the final string are the same as those before adding c's. Because C only adds c's. So yes, the count_a in the final string is the original count from A, same for count_b. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but in the final string, count_c is equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). So, for example, if the original count of a's is 3, and original count of b's is 2, then the count_c must be 3 or 2.\n\nSo the condition is that count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. But also, the order of the characters must be correct. Because the string must consist of some a's, followed by some b's, followed by some c's. Because A's string is all a's, then B appends b's, then C appends c's. So the string must be in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo the string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b', etc.\n\nSo, the steps for checking are:\n\n1. Check that the string has at least one a, one b, one c. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. For example, the string can't have a 'b' before a's, or a 'c' before b's.\n\n3. Check that count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, return YES; else, NO.\n\nSo let's think about the examples.\n\nFirst example: aaabccc. Let's check:\n\ncount_a is 3, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So count_c equals count_a (3). Also, the string is aaa followed by b followed by ccc. So the order is correct. So YES.\n\nSecond example: bbacc. The string is bba... wait, the string is 'bbacc'. Let's see. The order is 'bbacc' — the first two are b's, then a, then c's. But this violates the order. Because the a comes after the b's. Which is not allowed. Because the original string was all a's, then B added b's. So the string should be all a's followed by all b's. So in the input string, the first occurrence of a must be before any b's. Wait, no. Wait, the original string is all a's. Then B appends some b's. So the string after B's step is all a's followed by all b's. Then C appends c's. So the entire string must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the string must be in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo the second example 'bbacc' has 'bb' followed by 'a', which is invalid. Hence, output is NO.\n\nThird example: aabc. The string is aab followed by c. So the order is correct. count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 1. So count_c equals count_b. So YES.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCheck the order. How to check that?\n\nWe can check that all a's come before any b's, and all b's come before any c's. So, for example, the string should not have any 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b' after a 'c'.\n\nSo, the way to check this is to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So, for example, the string can be divided into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's. So, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all b's.\n\nSo, how to check this? Let's think:\n\nWe can check that the string is composed of a sequence of a's, followed by a sequence of b's, followed by a sequence of c's. So, for example, the string can be split into three parts, and each part is made of only one character.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be checked by checking that:\n\n- All characters before the first 'b' are 'a's.\n\n- All characters before the first 'c' are 'a's or 'b's.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to check that the string does not have any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b's after a 'c'.\n\nAnother way: iterate through the string and check that the order is correct.\n\nLet me think of code for that. For example, the string can have three sections:\n\n- The first part is all 'a's.\n\n- Then, the next part is all 'b's.\n\n- Then, the next part is all 'c's.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be checked by checking that the first occurrence of 'b' is after all 'a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' is after all 'b's.\n\nAlternatively, the string can be split into three parts. Let's find the index where the first 'b' occurs. All characters before that must be 'a's. Then, find the index where the first 'c' occurs. All characters before that must be 'a's or 'b's. And after that, all characters must be 'c's.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check that the string is in the order a's, then b's, then c's. So, for example, the string can be checked by checking that:\n\n- There are no 'a's after the first occurrence of 'b'.\n\n- There are no 'b's after the first occurrence of 'c'.\n\nSo, let's think:\n\nOnce a 'b' is encountered, all following characters must be 'b's or 'c's. Once a 'c' is encountered, all following characters must be 'c's.\n\nAlternatively, the string can be checked by checking that the order of characters is non-decreasing according to their order in 'abc'. Because 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So, for example, the string must be such that each character is not less than the previous one. So, for example, the string can be checked by checking that each character is >= the previous one in the order a < b < c.\n\nYes! Because the string must be a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's. So, the characters must be non-decreasing. For example, 'aaabbbccc' is valid. 'aabbc' is valid. But 'abba' is invalid because after the 'b's, there's an 'a' again.\n\nSo, for the order check, we can iterate through the string and check that each character is not less than the previous one. For example, for each i from 1 to len(s)-1, check that s[i] >= s[i-1]. If this is true for all positions, then the order is correct.\n\nYes. That seems like a solid way to check the order.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Check that the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any is missing, return 'NO'.\n\n2. Check that the string is in non-decreasing order (each character is >= previous). If not, return 'NO'.\n\n3. Check that the count of 'c's is equal to count of 'a's or count of 'b's. If not, return 'NO'.\n\nElse, return 'YES'.\n\nWait, but let's think about the counts. For example, the count of 'c's must be equal to the count of 'a's (original) or the count of 'b's (original). Since the original count of a's is the count of a's in the entire string, and original count of b's is the count of b's in the entire string. Because the string is a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, the count of a's is the number of a's in the entire string, same for b's. So, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nYes. So for example, in the third example, aabc: count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 1. So count_c equals count_b. So that's okay.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nRead the string S.\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in S.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's in S.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's in S.\n\nif any of count_a, count_b, count_c is zero: return NO.\n\nCheck the order: for each i from 1 to len(S)-1, check that S[i] >= S[i-1]. If any violation, return NO.\n\nCheck if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b. If yes, return YES else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the count_c is equal to count_a and count_b? Like, if count_a = count_b = count_c. Then it's allowed, since the count_c equals either count_a or count_b.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test this against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts: a=3, b=1, c=3. Check order: a a a b c c c → each character is >= previous. So order is okay. count_c is 3, which equals count_a (3). So returns YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → counts: a=1, b=2, c=2. Check order: the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', ... → the third character is 'a' which is less than previous 'b', so order check fails. So returns NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → counts: a=2, b=1, c=1. Order is a a b c → okay. count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=2. Order is a b c c → okay. count_c is 2. Is 2 equal to a (1) or b (1)? No. So returns NO. So the answer is NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=1. Order is okay. count_c is 1, which equals count_a (1) and count_b (1). So returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. count_c is 1. Not equal to a (2) or b (2). So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. So no. But if the string is 'aabbc' → the order is okay. But count_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b counts. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So count_c is 2, which is equal to a and b. So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abbcc' → counts a=1, b=2, c=2. So count_c is 2, which is equal to count_b (2). So returns YES. Order is a followed by b's then c's. So yes.\n\nWhat about a string that has all a's and c's, but no b's? Then step 1 would fail. So returns NO.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nIn Python, read the input string S.\n\nThen, count_a = S.count('a'), count_b = S.count('b'), count_c = S.count('c').\n\nCheck if any of them is zero → return NO.\n\nThen, check the order. How to check the order? Iterate through the string and check that each character is not less than the previous one.\n\nFor example:\n\nprev_char = S[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    current_char = S[i]\n\n    if current_char < prev_char:\n\n        return NO\n\n    prev_char = current_char\n\nBut since the characters are 'a', 'b', 'c', comparing their ASCII values would work. So 'a' < 'b' < 'c'.\n\nSo that's the way to check the order.\n\nThen, check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all conditions are met, return YES else NO.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead S.\n\ncount_a = S.count('a')\n\ncount_b = S.count('b')\n\ncount_c = S.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # check order\n\n    valid_order = True\n\n    for i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n        if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n            valid_order = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not valid_order:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, let's test this code against the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts are 3,1,3. Order is correct. count_c is 3, which equals count_a. So YES.\n\nSample input 2: 'bbacc' → counts are 1,2,2. Order check: first character is 'b', then next is 'b' (ok), then 'a' which is less than 'b' → invalid. So returns NO.\n\nSample input 3: 'aabc' → counts 2,1,1. order is a a b c → ok. count_c is 1, which is equal to count_b (1). So YES.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → counts 1,1,1. order is ok. count_c is 1, which equals count_a and count_b. So returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcc' → counts 1,1,2. order is ok. count_c is 2. Not equal to 1 or 1. So returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → counts 2,2,1. order is ok. count_c is 1. Not equal to 2 or 2. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → same as above.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → counts 2,2,2. count_c is 2, which equals count_a and count_b. So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abbcc' → counts 1,2,2. count_c is 2, which equals count_b. So returns YES.\n\nSo, code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where the string is 'abc' → YES.\n\nCase where the string is 'aabbcc' → YES.\n\nCase where the string is 'aaabbbccc' → count_c is 3, which equals count_a (3) and count_b (3). So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → no, since no 'c's. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → no 'b's. returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'bc' → no 'a's. returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=4. So count_c is 4, which equals a and b. So returns YES.\n\nWhat about a string that has a's, then c's, then b's? For example, 'aaccbb' → order check would fail because after the c's, there are b's. So the code would detect that during the order check.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as a string S. The sample input shows something like ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'] but that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line consists of a string S. So, for example, in the sample input, perhaps the user provided multiple test cases, but the actual input is a single string. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line consists of a string S. So the sample input shows something like ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'] but that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Because in the sample input, perhaps it's three separate test cases. However, the code needs to read a single string from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo for example, the sample input is given as a list, but that's probably a formatting error. The actual input is a single string. For example, the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\naaabccc\n\nOutput:\n\nYES\n\nBut the sample shows input as ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'] and output as ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']. So perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. But the problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line consists of a string S.\n\nSo perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not correct. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. So the code should read one line from input, process it, and output YES or NO.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but that's probably a mistake. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, each on their own line. But according to the problem statement, each test case is a single string.\n\nBut the user's code needs to read from stdin. So for example, the code should read a single line, which is the string S.\n\nBut the sample input shows something like ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'] but that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Because in the problem statement, the input is a single string.\n\nSo, assuming that the input is a single string, the code should read that string, and output YES or NO.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input string from stdin. For example:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen perform the checks as discussed.\n\nBut in the sample input, the example shows that for input ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], the output is ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']. But that's probably because the problem is using a format where the input is a list of test cases, but the actual problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the problem statement's sample input is written incorrectly, and the actual code should process a single string.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a single string, the code should process a single string. So the code would read a single line, process it, and output YES or NO.\n\nTherefore, the code is as follows:\n\nRead the input string, check the conditions, and output accordingly.\n\nSo, the code in Python:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    valid_order = True\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            valid_order = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not valid_order:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, let's check for the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are 2, 2, 2. So count_c is 2, which equals count_a and count_b. So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abba' → order check would fail. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → order is ok. count_c is 2. count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So 2 != 1 or 1. So returns NO.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbc'? Then, the order is correct. count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So 1 is not equal to 2 or 2. So returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → code returns YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order is invalid. returns NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → returns YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The string must be formed by first having some number of 'a's, followed by some number of 'b's, and then some number of 'c's, with the count of 'c's being equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Presence of All Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must be in non-decreasing order of characters, i.e., all 'a's must come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. This ensures the correct sequence of operations.\n3. **Check Count of 'c'**: The count of 'c's must be equal to the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    valid_order = True\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            valid_order = False\n            break\n    if not valid_order:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Presence Check**: The code first checks if the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, it immediately prints \"NO\".\n2. **Order Check**: The code then verifies that the string is in non-decreasing order. This is done by iterating through the string and ensuring each character is not less than the previous one.\n3. **Count Check**: Finally, the code checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is met, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints of the problem are checked efficiently, leading to the correct determination of whether the string can be formed by the described operations.",
