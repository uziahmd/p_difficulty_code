A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires each friend to have nl milliliters. So for one toast, all n friends are drinking, so total drink per toast is n * nl. Because each of the n friends needs nl ml. Right.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. Because each of the n friends needs a slice. And for salt, each toast requires n * np grams. Because each friend needs np grams.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the total amount of drink available: k * l. Then, how many toasts can be made based on drink? Each toast uses n * nl ml. So total_drink_toasts = (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, if the division isn't exact, we take the floor.\n\nThen, the total lime slices available is c * d. Each toast needs n slices. So total_lime_toasts = (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt: total_salt_toasts = p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources are required for each toast. So the maximum number of toasts possible is the minimum of those three numbers.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend? Wait, no. Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. For example, in the first case, 3 friends, each needs 3 ml per toast. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So total drink is 20 ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the sample's explanation.\n\nYes. Then the sample says that the drink allows 6 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait in the note, they say that 20 / 3 = 6. Wait, why?\n\nOh wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me check the note again. The note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters. It is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why divided by 3? Because each toast requires 3 ml per friend, but for all friends?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express the problem. For each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl ml. So for the first example, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 ml would allow 20 // 9 = 2 toasts. But according to the note, they have 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait that seems conflicting. What's going on here?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But perhaps the note is considering something else. Let me check the first example.\n\nIn the first example, the input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n=3 friends. Each toast requires each friend to have 3 ml. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. Total drink is 4*5=20. 20 / 9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts that a group of friends can make given their available resources. Each toast requires specific amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt, and all friends must participate equally in each toast.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices available is obtained by multiplying the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n   - **Salt**: The total amount of salt available is given directly.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total lime slices available. Each toast requires `n` slices.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt.\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of toasts is determined by the minimum value among the constraints derived from drink, lime slices, and salt.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split the input into individual numbers\n    numbers = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the values\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = numbers\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available (ml)\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Each toast needs n * nl ml\n    drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Each toast needs n slices\n    lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n    \n    # Calculate total salt available (grams)\n    total_salt = p\n    # Each toast needs n * np grams\n    salt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles (`k`) by the volume per bottle (`l`). This total is then divided by the amount of drink needed per toast (`n * nl`) to determine how many full toasts can be made with the available drink.\n- **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is found by multiplying the number of limes (`c`) by the number of slices per lime (`d`). This total is divided by the number of slices needed per toast (`n`) to determine the number of possible toasts.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available (`p`) is divided by the amount of salt required per toast (`n * np`) to determine how many toasts can be made with the available salt.\n- **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum of the three values calculated from drink, lime slices, and salt, as each resource limits the number of possible toasts. This ensures that all friends can make the same number of toasts without any resource being exhausted prematurely.",
