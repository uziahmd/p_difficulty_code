A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs:\n\nThe input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of drink available. That's k * l ml. Then, each toast requires n * nl ml in total (since each of the n friends needs nl per toast). Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends has one toast. So for t toasts, total drink required is t * n * nl. But the total available is k*l. So the maximum possible t based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Wait, but maybe that's not the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink used is n * nl. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl. The total available is k * l. So the maximum t allowed by the drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But if that division isn't exact, we take the floor.\n\nSimilarly for the lime slices. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Total available is c * d. So maximum t based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, total is n * np. So maximum t based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values. Because all three constraints must be satisfied. So the maximum possible t is the minimum of the three computed values.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nTotal drink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3*3=9 ml (since per toast, each of 3 friends needs 3 ml). Wait, wait, the parameters are nl=3. So per toast per friend, 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So total drink can make 20 / 9 = 2.222..., which is 2 when floored. But the note says that the drink allows 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nOh wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait the note says: \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait why 20 / 3? Because per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. Wait that would be 20 / 9 = 2.222... toasts. But the note says 20 / 3 = 6. That suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait what's the correct way here. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So total drink required is t * n * nl. But the total available is k*l. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the first example, the note says that the drink allows 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Let's compute that. \n\nIn the first example, n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the maximum number of toasts possible based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Total Drink Calculation**: Calculate the total amount of drink available from the bottles. This is given by the product of the number of bottles (k) and the volume per bottle (l). Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink, where `n` is the number of friends and `nl` is the milliliters of drink per toast per friend.\n2. **Lime Slices Calculation**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available by multiplying the number of limes (c) by the number of slices per lime (d). Each toast requires `n` slices, one per friend.\n3. **Salt Calculation**: Calculate the total amount of salt available (p). Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt, where `np` is the grams of salt per toast per friend.\n4. **Determine Constraints**: For each resource, compute the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on that resource alone. The final answer is the minimum of these three values, as all resources must be sufficient for the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    inputs = list(map(int, line.split()))\n    \n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = inputs\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Maximum toasts based on drink: total_drink // (n * nl)\n    drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Maximum toasts based on limes: total_lime_slices // n\n    lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n    \n    # Calculate maximum toasts based on salt\n    salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three values\n    result = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total drink available is calculated as `k * l`. The maximum number of toasts based on this resource is determined by dividing the total drink by the amount needed per toast (`n * nl`).\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is `c * d`. The maximum number of toasts based on this resource is determined by dividing the total slices by the number of slices needed per toast (`n`).\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available is `p`. The maximum number of toasts based on this resource is determined by dividing the total salt by the amount needed per toast (`n * np`).\n- **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum of the three values calculated from the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring that all resources are sufficient for the same number of toasts. This ensures that each friend can make the same number of toasts without any resource being exhausted prematurely.",
