Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. The output for that case is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and see if they appear more than once. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, that might be feasible.\n\nLet me think: for each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once I find the maximum L where this is true, return it. If no such substring exists, return 0.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths L from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1. For each L, check all possible substrings of length L, and see if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\nBut how do I check if a substring occurs at least twice?\n\nFor each L, generate all substrings of length L, store them in a dictionary with their counts. Then check if any count is >=2. If yes, then return L as the answer.\n\nWait, but for overlapping occurrences, like in 'ababa' with L=3. The substrings are 'aba' starting at 0, then 'bab' at 1, then 'aba' at 2. So the same substring occurs twice. So the approach of checking all substrings of length L and their counts would work here.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the given string s, iterate L from len(s)-1 down to 1. Because the maximum possible substring that can appear twice is len(s)-1 (if the first and last characters are same, but that's a stretch). Wait, for example, for a string of length 5, the maximum possible L is 4. But for that, the substring would have to appear twice. But for a string of length 5, a substring of length 4 can only appear once, because the first occurrence starts at 0, the next would start at 1, but 0+4=4, which is the end. So for len(s) = n, the maximum possible L is floor(n/2). Wait, maybe not. Let's think. For example, in 'aaaaa', the substring of length 3 appears multiple times. So for n=5, L can be 3. But for L=4, the substring would be 'aaaa' (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So two occurrences. So for n=5, L can be 4. So the maximum possible L is n-1, but only if the first n-1 characters are same as the last n-1. But in general, for the problem, we need to check all possible L from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1. For each L, check if any substring of that length occurs at least twice.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n    create a set of all substrings of length L\n\n    if any substring occurs more than once, then return L as the answer.\n\nBut wait, how to check if any substring occurs more than once. For example, for each L, collect all substrings of length L, and check if there's duplicates. So for example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So the set would have 'aba' and 'bab', but 'aba' appears twice. So when we collect all substrings, if the number of unique substrings is less than the total number of substrings (which is len(s) - L + 1), then there's duplicates.\n\nWait, but for each L, the number of possible substrings is (n - L + 1). For example, for L=3 and n=5, there are 3 substrings. If any of them repeats, then the set of substrings will have size less than (n - L + 1). So for each L, we can check if the number of unique substrings is less than (n - L + 1). If so, then there is at least one duplicate. So for each L, we can check that.\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. Suppose there are multiple duplicates. For example, if there are three occurrences of the same substring. Then the set size would be smaller than the total number of substrings. So for each L, if the number of unique substrings is less than the total number of substrings (i.e., there's at least one duplicate), then return L as the answer.\n\nSo",
