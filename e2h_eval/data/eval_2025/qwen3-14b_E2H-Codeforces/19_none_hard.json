The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."
