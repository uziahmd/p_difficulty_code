A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per person such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the problem. \n\nFirst, let's understand the inputs. The input consists of several integers: n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, nl is the ml of drink needed per toast per friend. np is the grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n\nWait, per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, all n friends together need n * nl milliliters. Because each of the n friends uses nl for their toast. Similarly for the salt: each toast requires n * np grams of salt. And each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast.\n\nSo the total resources available:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml. \n\nTotal lime slices: c * d. \n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nNow, for each toast, the total required is:\n\nDrink: n * nl per toast. \n\nSalt: n * np per toast. \n\nLime slices: n per toast. \n\nSo the maximum number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute, and then take the minimum of those.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's say the maximum possible toasts is t. Then:\n\nt must satisfy:\n\nt * (n * nl) ≤ total_drink (k*l)\n\nt * (n * np) ≤ total_salt (p)\n\nt * n ≤ total_lime_slices (c*d)\n\nSo t can be at most the minimum of:\n\n(total_drink) // (n * nl), \n\n(total_salt) // (n * np), \n\n(total_lime_slices) // n \n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example, let's check:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo:\n\ntotal_drink = 4 *5 =20. \n\nn=3, nl=3. So per toast, total drink needed is 3*3=9. \n\nSo 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. \n\nSalt: p is 100. np is 1. So per toast, 3 *1 =3 grams. 100 /3 is 33.333, floor 33. \n\nLimes: c=10, d=8. So 10*8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 /3 is 26.666, floor 26. \n\nThen the min of 2, 33, 26 is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nYes. So the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate for each resource how many toasts can be made, then take the minimum of those.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input numbers. Then compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\ntoast_lime = total_lime_slices // n \n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_salt, toast_lime)\n\nThen output that result.\n\nBut wait, what if any of the denominators are zero? Well, the problem says that all input numbers are positive integers. So n, nl, np are at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. n * nl =3*3=9. 20//9=2.\n\ntoast_salt: p is 100. n * np is 3 *1=3. 100//3 is 33.\n\ntoast_lime: c*d=10*8=80. divided by n=3. 80//3 is 26. So min(2,33,26) is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input line: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10. total_drink is 100*10=1000. nl is 4. So per toast, 5*4=20. 1000//20=50.\n\nsalt: p=90. np=3. 5*3=15. 90//15=6.\n\nlime: c=1, d=19. total slices 1*19=19. divided by 5: 3 (since 19//5=3). So min(50,6,3) is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000. total drink is 1,000,000. nl=50. per toast, 10 *50 =500. 1e6 / 500 is 2000.\n\nsalt: p=1. np=1. 10 *1 =10. 1//10 is 0. So min(2000, 0, ...) is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input line, split into the numbers, compute the three values, take min, and output.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\ntoast_lime = total_lime // n\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_salt, toast_lime)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what if the division is not integer? For example, if the total_drink is exactly divisible by n * nl, then it's okay. But if not, the floor division is correct.\n\nYes. Because for example, if total_drink is 20 and n * nl is 9, then 20//9 is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nLet me test the third sample input:\n\nInput line: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000. total_drink = 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000.\n\nnl is 50. So per toast, 10 *50 =500. 1e6 /500 = 2000. So toast_drink is 2000.\n\nsalt: p=1, np=1. per toast, 10 *1=10. 1//10 is 0. So toast_salt is 0. So min is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when all resources are exactly enough. Like n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1. Then:\n\ntotal_drink = 1*1=1. n * nl is 1*1=1. toast_drink is 1.\n\nsalt: 1 // (1*1) =1.\n\nlime: 1*1=1 //1 =1. min is 1. So output 1.\n\nAnother case: when one of the resources is zero. But since inputs are positive integers, that's not possible. So no problem.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo the Python code is straightforward. Now, the code must read from stdin, process the input, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into the 8 integers.\n\nCompute the three values, take min, print.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_salt = p\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\ntoast_lime = total_lime // n\n\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_salt, toast_lime))\n\nWait, but what if n * nl is zero? But according to the problem statement, all input numbers are positive. So n is at least 1, nl is at least 1. So n * nl is at least 1. Same for np.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → outputs 2. Which matches.\n\nSecond sample input line: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → outputs 3.\n\nThird sample input line: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → outputs 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
