Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right. The other diagonal is top-right to bottom-left. All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same, and that they are not equal to 'd'.\n\nBut how do I check these?\n\nFirst, let's collect all the diagonal elements. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell in the grid, check if it's on either of these diagonals.\n\nSo, for all cells in the grid:\n\n- If it's on a diagonal, check that it's equal to the diagonal's character (which should be same for all diagonals).\n- Else, check that it's equal to the non-diagonal character, which must be different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how do I find what the diagonal character is? Well, the first diagonal element (0,0) is part of the diagonals. So the diagonal character is grid[0][0]. But wait, what if there's a mistake in the diagonals? Like, maybe some other cell in the diagonal has a different character. So, I need to check that all diagonal elements are equal to the first diagonal element.\n\nSimilarly for the non-diagonal elements. All non-diagonal elements must be equal to each other and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Iterate through all cells in the grid.\n- For each cell, determine if it's on a diagonal.\n- Collect all diagonal characters and check they are the same.\n- Collect all non-diagonal characters and check they are the same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nAlternatively, first check that all diagonal elements are the same. Let's take the first diagonal element as the reference. Then check that every other diagonal element is the same as this reference.\n\nThen, check that all non-diagonal elements are the same and different from the reference.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal elements? Well, since n is at least 3, for example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 elements each, but overlapping in the center. So the non-diagonal elements are the ones not on either diagonal. For n=3, the center is part of both diagonals. So for n=3, the non-diagonal elements are the four corners? No, wait, for n=3, the diagonals are positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) and (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the non-diagonal elements are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So four elements. So for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal elements. So in general, for n x n grid, the number of diagonal elements is 2n - 1 (since the two diagonals overlap at the center cell). So the number of non-diagonal elements is n^2 - (2n - 1) = (n-1)^2 - 0? Wait, n² - (2n -1) = n² -2n +1 = (n-1)^2. So for example, n=3, (3-1)^2 =4, which matches. So yes, the non-diagonal elements are (n-1)^2 in number.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Check all elements on diagonals are same as the first diagonal element (say, d).\n- Check all non-diagonal elements are same as each other and not equal to d.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, read the grid. Then:\n\nCheck for diagonals:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's a diagonal cell.\n\nElse: non-diagonal.\n\nSo for the first part, check that all diagonal cells are equal to the first diagonal cell (grid[0][0",
