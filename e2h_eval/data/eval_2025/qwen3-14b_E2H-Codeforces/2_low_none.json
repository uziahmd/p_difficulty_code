Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check if all the cells in both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check if all the non-diagonal cells are the same and not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal cells. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, check if it's on either of the two diagonals. For a cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if either of those conditions is true, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think:\n\nLoop through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it is on a diagonal. If yes, add to diagonal_chars. Else, add to other_chars.\n\nOnce I have these two lists, check:\n\n- All elements in diagonal_chars are the same.\n- All elements in other_chars are the same.\n- The two characters are different.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, since n is at least 3, for example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the center. So total diagonal cells are 2n - 1. For n=3, 5 cells. The total cells are 9, so other cells are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, for the case where n=1? Well, the problem says n is at least 3, so no need to handle that.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n, then n lines of n characters each.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first example is:\n\nInput is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is 5x5. Let's check the diagonals. The main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). The other diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). So the overlapping cell is (2,2). So for the diagonals, all cells must be same. Let's see in the first example: the first line is xooox. So (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x. Then (1,1) is o, (1,3) is o. Then (2,2) is x. (3,1) is o, (3,3) is o. (4,0) is x, (4,4) is x. So the diagonals have x, o, x, o, x. Wait, but the first diagonal is (0,0) x, (1,1) o, (2,2) x, (3,3) o, (4,4) x. So the diagonals have x, o, x, o, x. Which are not all same. So the first example's output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code needs to check that all the diagonal cells are same. So, collect all the diagonal cells, check if they are all same.\n\nThen collect the other cells, check if they are all same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\n",
