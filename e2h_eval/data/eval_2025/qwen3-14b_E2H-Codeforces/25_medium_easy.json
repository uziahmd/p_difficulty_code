При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an overlap. The overlap has to be such that the end of the first s overlaps with the start of the second s. And the overlapping part must be a positive number of characters, but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where one s is completely on top of the other) isn't considered an error. Similarly, just concatenating two s's without any overlap isn't considered an error either. So, the task is to check if there's a possible s such that t is formed by this overlapping merge.\n\nSo, for example, if t is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", then the output is YES with s being \"abrakadabra\". Because when two copies of s are merged with an overlap of one character (the 'a' at the end of the first and the start of the second), you get that t.\n\nThe input is a string t, and we need to output YES or NO, and if YES, provide a possible s.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the merged string t must be equal to s concatenated with s, but with some overlapping. Let's denote the length of s as len_s. Then, the length of t must be equal to 2*len_s - k, where k is the overlap length. Since k is between 1 and len_s-1 (because the overlap must be positive and less than len_s). \n\nBut since the original two s's are merged with an overlap of k characters, the total length of t would be len_s + (len_s - k) = 2*len_s -k. So for each possible k, we can check if there exists a len_s such that 2*len_s -k equals the length of t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about possible values of len_s. Let me think: For t to be formed by overlapping two s's, the length of t must be between len_s + 1 (if k is 1) and 2*len_s - 1 (if k is len_s-1). Wait, but len(t) = 2*len_s -k. Since k can be from 1 to len_s-1, then len(t) can range from 2*len_s - (len_s-1) = len_s +1 up to 2*len_s -1. \n\nBut len_s must be such that len(t) is in this range. So for example, len(t) must be greater than len_s. But len_s is unknown. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think of it another way. Let me denote the length of t as n. Then, for some possible len_s, we have that n = 2 * len_s - k, where 1 ≤ k < len_s. So rearranging, we can find possible len_s for each possible k. But perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since k is the overlap, the first s ends with some prefix of the second s. For example, the first s is s, and the second is s. When they are merged, the first s's last k characters must equal the second s's first k characters. So the merged string is s + s[k:], which is of length len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k.\n\nSo for the given t, we can try all possible possible len_s values. What's the possible range of len_s?\n\nWell, since len(t) = 2*len_s -k, and k is between 1 and len_s-1, then substituting k's maximum and minimum:\n\nFor k=1: len(t) = 2*len_s -1 → len_s = (len(t)+1)/2.\n\nFor k = len_s-1: len(t) = 2*len_s - (len_s-1) = len_s +1 → len_s = len(t) -1.\n\nSo len_s must be between (n+1)/2 and n-1. But since len_s must be an integer, perhaps we can iterate over possible len_s values in that range.\n\nWait, for example, if n is the length of t, then len_s can be from (n+1)/2 (rounded up?) to n-1. But since len_s must be an integer, let's think:\n\nFor example, n could be 5. Then possible len_s must satisfy len_s >= (5+1)/2 = 3, and len_s <= 5-1=4. So len_s can be 3 or 4.\n\nSo for each possible len_s in the range [ceil(n/2), n-1], we can check if there's a k such that 2*len_s -k = n. Which implies k = 2*len_s -n. But since k must be between 1 and len_s-1, we can compute for each len_s whether 2*len_s -n is in that range.\n\nLet me see. For each possible len_s, compute k = 2*len_s -n. Then check if k is between 1 and len_s-1. If yes, then proceed to check whether the first s (of length len_s) and the second s (of length len_s) can be merged with an overlap of k characters.\n\nWait, but how do we check that? Well, the first part of the merged string is s, and the second part is s. The merged string is s + s[k:]. So the entire string t should be equal to s + s[k:]. Therefore, the first len_s characters of t must be s, and the next (len_s -k) characters must be s[k:].\n\nBut since the entire t is s + s[k:], then the entire t must be of length len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k = n. Which is already satisfied because we computed k based on len_s and n.\n\nSo for each possible len_s in the range [ceil(n/2), n-1], we can compute k = 2*len_s -n. Then check if k is between 1 and len_s-1. If so, then check if the first len_s characters of t is s, and the next part (from position len_s -k) is s[k:].\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Let's suppose that the merged string is s + s[k:]. So the merged string's length is len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k = n. So the first len_s characters of t must be s. Then, the remaining part is s[k:]. But how can I check that?\n\nSo the entire t should be equal to s concatenated with s[k:]. Which means that the first len_s characters are s, and the next part (from index len_s -k onwards?) No, wait. Let me think: the first s is of length len_s. Then the second part is s[k:] which is of length len_s -k. So the entire t is s followed by s[k:]. So the first len_s characters are s, then the next len_s -k characters are s[k:]. Therefore, the entire t is s concatenated with s[k:], which is of length len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k = n.\n\nBut how can I check that the t is indeed equal to this concatenation?\n\nSo, for the given len_s, the first part is s = t[0 : len_s]. Then, the second part is s[k:], which is t[len_s : len_s + (len_s -k)] = t[len_s : 2*len_s -k] = t[len_s : n]. But since 2*len_s -k is n, that's correct.\n\nBut also, the s[k:] must be equal to the part of t after the first len_s characters. So, the part after the first len_s characters is t[len_s : ] which must be equal to s[k:]. But s is t[0 : len_s], so s[k:] is t[k : len_s].\n\nSo, the t[len_s : ] must be equal to t[k : len_s].\n\nTherefore, for a given len_s, compute k = 2*len_s -n. Check if k is between 1 and len_s-1. If yes, then check if t[len_s : ] == t[k : len_s]. If this is true, then the answer is YES and s is t[0 : len_s].\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For the input string t, compute n = len(t).\n\n2. Iterate over possible len_s in the range from (n+1)//2 to n-1 (since for len_s to be in the range where k is valid).\n\n   Wait, why (n+1)//2? Because for k to be at least 1, 2*len_s -n ≥ 1 → len_s ≥ (n+1)/2. Since len_s must be an integer, the minimal possible len_s is ceil(n/2). For example, if n is even, say 6, then (n+1)/2 = 3.5, so len_s starts at 4? Wait no, let me re-calculate:\n\nk = 2*len_s - n ≥ 1 → 2*len_s ≥ n +1 → len_s ≥ (n+1)/2. Since len_s must be integer, len_s starts from ceil( (n+1)/2 ) ?\n\nWait, for example, if n=5, then (n+1)/2 is 3. So len_s can be 3, which is integer. So for len_s in the range from ceil( (n+1)/2 ) to n-1.\n\nWait, but (n+1)/2 could be a fraction. So len_s must be ≥ (n+1)/2. So for example, if n is even, say n=6. Then (n+1)/2 is 3.5. So len_s must be ≥ 4. So possible len_s starts from 4, up to n-1=5.\n\nBut for len_s to be in the range where k is between 1 and len_s-1. So for each possible len_s in that range, compute k = 2*len_s -n, and check if k is between 1 and len_s-1.\n\nSo for example, len_s can be from (n+1)/2 up to n-1. But since len_s must be integer, we can loop through all possible len_s in the range from (n+1)//2 to n-1, inclusive.\n\nWait, for example, n=5. (n+1)/2 is 3. So len_s can be 3,4. For len_s=3, k=2*3 -5 = 1. Which is between 1 and 2 (since len_s-1=2). So yes. For len_s=4, k= 8-5=3. len_s-1 is 3. So k is 3, which is allowed. So yes.\n\nSo for each possible len_s in that range, compute k and check if it's valid. Then check if the substring t[len_s:] is equal to t[k: len_s].\n\nIf any of these conditions hold, then return YES and the s is t[0: len_s].\n\nOtherwise, after checking all possible len_s, return NO.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over len_s from (n+1)//2 to n-1 (inclusive). For each len_s:\n\n   compute k = 2 * len_s - n.\n\n   if k is between 1 and len_s -1:\n\n       check if t[len_s:] == t[k: len_s]\n\n       if yes, then return YES and s is t[0: len_s]\n\nIf none of the len_s in that range satisfy the condition, then output NO.\n\nBut what about cases where there are multiple possible len_s? For example, in the sample input 'acacacaca' (which is the second example), the output is 'acaca'.\n\nLet me see. The input is 'acacacaca', which has length 9. So n=9.\n\nPossible len_s ranges from (9+1)/2=5 up to 8.\n\nSo len_s can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor len_s=5:\n\nk = 2*5 -9 = 1. Check if 1 is between 1 and 4 (yes). Now check if t[5:] == t[1:5].\n\nt[5:] is 'cacaca' (positions 5 to 8, since len is 9, 9-5=4? Wait, t is 9 characters. len_s is 5. t[len_s:] is from index 5 to end. So t[5:] is 'cacaca'? Let me check:\n\nOriginal string: a c a c a c a c a (indices 0-8)\n\nt[5:] is from index 5: 'c a c a' (positions 5,6,7,8). Wait, length of t is 9. len_s=5, so t[5:] is 4 characters. t[k: len_s] is t[1:5], which is positions 1-4 (indices 1,2,3,4): c a c a. So t[5:] is 'c a c a' (same as t[1:5]). So yes. So in this case, the condition holds. So s is t[0:5] = 'acaca'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output. So this would be a valid solution.\n\nAnother possible len_s could be 6. Let's see. For len_s=6, k= 2*6 -9= 3. Check if 3 is between 1 and 5 (yes). Then check if t[6:] (which is 'ac a') is equal to t[3:6] (positions 3-5: c a c). Wait, t[6:] is 'aca' (indices 6,7,8). t[3:6] is indices 3,4,5: c a c. So 'aca' vs 'cac'? Not equal. So no. So for len_s=6, no.\n\nSimilarly for len_s=7, k= 2*7 -9=5. Check if 5 is between 1 and 6 (yes). Check t[7:] is 'ca' and t[5:7] is 'ca'. So yes. So t[7:] is 'ca' and t[5:7] is 'ca'. So this would also be valid. Then s is t[0:7] which is 'acacaca'. Which is another possible answer. So the sample says that 'acaca' is a correct answer, but 'acacaca' is also acceptable. So our code can return any of them.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is 'acaca' which is the first possible len_s. So the code can return the first valid len_s found.\n\nSo the algorithm would work.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nCompute n = len(t).\n\nIf n is less than 2, then it's impossible. Because for two messages, each of length len_s, the merged string would have length 2*len_s -k. For len_s >=1, and k >=1. So for example, if n=1, then no possible len_s. So output NO.\n\nElse, loop len_s from (n+1)//2 to n-1:\n\n   for each len_s in this range:\n\n       compute k = 2*len_s -n\n\n       if k is between 1 and len_s-1:\n\n           check if t[len_s:] == t[k: len_s]\n\n           if yes, then output YES and s = t[:len_s]\n\nOnce found, return.\n\nIf after checking all possibilities no such len_s is found, output NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the entire string is s + s, i.e., no overlap? For example, t is 'abcabc' (as in the sample). In that case, the code would check for len_s in (6+1)//2 = 3.5 → 4? Let's see:\n\nn=6.\n\nlen_s ranges from (6+1)//2 = 3.5 → integer division would be 3.5? Wait in Python, (n+1)//2 for n=6 is (7)//2 = 3. So len_s starts from 3 up to 5.\n\nSo len_s=3: k = 2*3 -6 = 0. Which is not between 1 and 2. So invalid.\n\nlen_s=4: k= 8-6=2. Check if 2 is between 1 and 3 (yes). Check if t[4:] is equal to t[2:4]. t[4:] is 'c' (since t is 'abcabc' of length 6. t[4:] is 'bc'? Wait no, len_s=4. t[4:] is from index 4 to end. So 'abcabc' indexes 0-5. t[4:] is 'bc' (indices 4 and 5). t[k: len_s] is t[2:4], which is 'ca'. So 'bc' vs 'ca'? No. So no.\n\nlen_s=5: k= 10-6=4. Check if 4 is between 1 and 4 (since len_s-1 is 4). So yes. Check t[5:] is 'c', and t[4:5] is 'c'. So yes. So the code would return s = t[:5] = 'abcab'. But according to the sample input, 'abcabc' is considered as no error. Because the problem says that the case where two messages are concatenated without any overlap (i.e., k=0) is not considered an error. However, in this case, the code would find that len_s=5 and k=4. Which is allowed. But why?\n\nBecause when len_s=5, and k=4, then the merged string would be s + s[4:]. So s is 'abcab', s[4:] is 'b'. So merged string is 'abcab' + 'b' → 'abcabb' which is not equal to the input 'abcabc'. Wait, but according to the code's check, t[5:] is 'c', and t[k: len_s] is t[4:5] which is 'b'. So in this case, the check would fail. So the code would not return this as a valid case. So the code would not trigger for len_s=5. Hence, the sample input 'abcabc' would return NO, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that case correctly.\n\nAnother example: the sample input 'abababab' (fourth example) outputs YES with 'ababab'.\n\nLet me see. The input is 'abababab', length 8. So possible len_s ranges from (8+1)//2 = 4.5 → 4.5 is 4.5, but integer division in Python (using //) would be 4. So len_s starts from 4 to 7.\n\nCheck for len_s=5:\n\nk = 2*5 -8 = 2. Check if 2 is between 1 and 4. Yes. Then check if t[5:] equals t[2:5].\n\nt is 'abababab' (indices 0-7). len_s=5, t[5:] is 'abab' (indices 5-7? No, len_s is 5, t[5:] is from index 5 to end: 'abab' (indices 5,6,7? Wait, 8-5=3 characters. So indices 5,6,7: 'abab'? Wait, original string is 8 letters: a b a b a b a b. So t[5:] is 'abab'? Wait index 5 is 'a', 6 is 'b', 7 is 'a', 8 is beyond. So t[5:] is 'ab' (indices 5 and 6?), no. Wait len(t) is 8. So t[5:] is from index 5 to 7 (inclusive), which is 'ab a'? Wait, indexes 5: a, 6: b, 7: a. So the substring is 'aba'.\n\nt[k: len_s] is t[2:5]. len_s is 5. So t[2:5] is from index 2 to 4 (exclusive of 5?), which is indices 2,3,4: a, b, a → 'aba'. So t[5:] is 'aba' and t[2:5] is 'aba' → equal. So yes. So the code would return s as t[:5] which is 'ababa'?\n\nWait, but the sample output for that case is 'ababab' (length 6). Let me check.\n\nWait, len_s=6. Let's compute for len_s=6.\n\nk = 2*6 -8 = 4. Check if 4 is between 1 and 5 (yes). Then check t[6:] is 'ab', and t[4:6] is 'ab'. So yes. So the code would find this and return s as t[:6] = 'ababab', which is the sample output. So in this case, the code would find len_s=6 first? Or depends on the order of checking.\n\nIn the code, len_s starts from (n+1)//2. For n=8, (n+1)//2 is (8+1)//2=4.5 → 4 in integer division? Wait, in Python, (n+1)//2 for n=8 is (9)//2 = 4. So len_s starts from 4 to 7.\n\nSo for len_s=4:\n\nk = 2*4 -8 = 0 → invalid.\n\nlen_s=5: k=2 → check as before, which is valid. So the code would check len_s=5 first. But in that case, the check would pass. So why does the sample output have len_s=6?\n\nAh, but maybe there are multiple possible answers, and the code returns the first one found. So perhaps in the sample input 'abababab', the code would find len_s=5 first and return that. However, according to the sample output, the correct answer is 'ababab' (len_s=6). So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe the code for len_s=5 is not valid. Let me recheck.\n\nFor len_s=5, k=2. So the code checks whether t[5:] equals t[2:5].\n\nt is 'abababab' (indices 0-7):\n\nt[5:] is 'abab'? Wait len_s=5, so t[5:] is from index 5 to end (length 3 characters: indices 5,6,7 → 'aba').\n\nt[k: len_s] is t[2:5], which is indices 2,3,4 → 'aba'.\n\nYes, they are equal. So the code would return s = t[:5] = 'ababa' (indices 0-4: a b a b a). Then the merged string would be s + s[2:] → 'ababa' + 'aba' → 'ababaaba', which is length 5 + 3 = 8. Which is the input. But the input is 'abababab' (which is 'abababab'). Wait, that doesn't match. So there's a mistake here. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, the code's logic is that the merged string is s + s[k:]. So for len_s=5, s is 'ababa', and s[k:] is s[2:] which is 'aba'. So the merged string is 'ababa' + 'aba' → 'ababaaba', which is length 5 + 3 = 8. But the input is 'abababab' (which is 'abababab'). So the code would think that this is a valid case, but the actual string is different. So why is this happening?\n\nAh, this indicates a flaw in my reasoning. Where is the error?\n\nLet me re-express the check. The code checks if t[len_s:] == t[k: len_s]. But for the merged string to be s + s[k:], the entire t must be equal to that. So the first part is s (t[0: len_s]), and the second part is s[k:]. So the entire string is s + s[k:].\n\nWhich is of length len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k = n. So the code checks that the part after len_s is equal to s[k:]. But s[k:] is t[k: len_s], because s is t[0: len_s]. So the code checks that t[len_s:] == t[k: len_s]. But for the example above, when len_s=5, k=2, the code checks that t[5:] (which is 'aba') is equal to t[2:5] (which is 'aba'), which is true. So according to the code, the merged string would be s + s[k:] = 'ababa' + 'aba' → 'ababaaba', but the input is 'abababab'.\n\nWait, but the input is 'abababab' which is 8 characters. Let me write the input as a list of characters:\n\nIndices 0: a, 1: b, 2: a, 3: b, 4: a, 5: b, 6: a, 7: b.\n\nSo the input is a b a b a b a b.\n\nBut according to the code's logic for len_s=5, the merged string would be 'ababa' + 'aba' → a b a b a a b a → which is a b a b a a b a. But the input is a b a b a b a b. Which is different. So why is the code's check passing?\n\nBecause the code checks that t[len_s:] (which is from index 5 to end: 'b a b')? Wait, no. Wait len_s=5, so t[len_s:] is t[5:8], which is indices 5,6,7: 'b', 'a', 'b' → 'bab'.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 'aba', but that was incorrect. Oh! I made a mistake in the indices. Let me re-calculate:\n\nOriginal input: 'abababab' → indexes 0-7:\n\n0:a, 1:b, 2:a, 3:b, 4:a, 5:b, 6:a, 7:b.\n\nFor len_s=5, t[:5] is 'ababa' (indices 0-4). Then, t[len_s:] is t[5:] which is from index 5 to end: 'bab' (indices 5,6,7: 'b','a','b').\n\nt[k: len_s] is t[2:5], which is indices 2,3,4 → 'a','b','a' → 'aba'.\n\nSo comparing 'bab' (t[len_s:]) with 'aba' (t[k: len_s]) → not equal. So the code would not accept this case. So why did I think earlier that they were equal? Because I had made a mistake in the indices.\n\nSo the code's check would not pass for len_s=5. Then why?\n\nAh, this shows that my previous analysis was wrong, but the code would correctly check for this. So in this case, the code would not accept len_s=5. Let's check len_s=6.\n\nFor len_s=6, k= 2*6 -8 = 4. Check if 4 is between 1 and 5 (yes). Then check if t[6:] == t[4:6].\n\nt[6:] is indices 6 and 7: 'ab'.\n\nt[4:6] is indices 4 and 5: 'ab'. So yes. So the code would return s as t[:6] = 'ababab', which is the sample output. So this is correct.\n\nSo the code works correctly in this case.\n\nSo the mistake in my earlier analysis was due to incorrect calculation of the indices. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- For each possible len_s in the range (n+1)//2 to n-1:\n\n   compute k = 2*len_s -n\n\n   if k is between 1 and len_s-1:\n\n      check if t[len_s:] == t[k: len_s]\n\n      if yes, return YES and s = t[:len_s]\n\nThus, the code can be implemented in Python.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nFirst, read the input string. Then, n = len(t). If n < 2, output NO.\n\nElse, loop len_s from (n+1)//2 to n-1 inclusive.\n\nFor each len_s in that range:\n\n   k = 2 * len_s - n\n\n   if 1 <= k <= len_s -1:\n\n      if t[len_s:] == t[k: len_s]:\n\n          print YES and s.\n\n          exit.\n\nIf no such len_s found, print NO.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase 1: t is 'aa' (n=2). Possible len_s is (2+1)//2 = 1.5 → 1. So len_s starts from 1 to 1 (since n-1 is 1). So len_s=1. Then k = 2*1 -2 = 0. Which is not between 1 and 0 (since len_s-1=0). So invalid. So output NO. Which is correct, since two 'a's merged with 0 overlap is not considered an error.\n\nCase 2: t is 'aaa' (n=3). len_s ranges from (3+1)//2 = 2 to 2 (n-1=2). len_s=2. k = 2*2 -3 = 1. Check if 1 is between 1 and 1 (yes). Then check t[2:] is 'a', and t[1:2] is 'a'. So yes. So output YES and s is 'aa'.\n\nBut when two 'aa's are merged with overlap 1, the result is 'aa' + 'a' → 'aaa' which matches. So correct.\n\nAnother example: t is 'aaaaa', n=5. len_s ranges from (5+1)//2 = 3 to 4.\n\nFor len_s=3:\n\nk = 2*3 -5 = 1. Check 1 <= 2 (yes). Check t[3:] is 'aa', and t[1:3] is 'aa' → yes. So s is 'aaa'.\n\nSo the code would return YES and 'aaa'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t from input. Then:\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor len_s in range( (n+1)//2, n ):\n\n   k = 2*len_s - n\n\n   if 1 <= k <= len_s -1:\n\n       if t[len_s:] == t[k: len_s]:\n\n           print(\"YES\")\n\n           print(t[:len_s])\n\n           exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, range(a, b) includes a, a+1,..., b-1. So to loop len_s from (n+1)//2 to n-1 inclusive, the code should be:\n\nfor len_s in range( (n+1)//2, n ):\n\n   ... \n\nBecause n-1 is the upper limit. For example, if n is 5, then range(3,5) gives 3 and 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor len_s in range( (n + 1) // 2, n ):\n\n    k = 2 * len_s - n\n\n    if 1 <= k <= len_s - 1:\n\n        if t[len_s:] == t[k: len_s]:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n            print(t[:len_s])\n\n            exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about when len_s is (n+1)//2 and the upper limit is n-1?\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → output YES abrakadabra.\n\nLet's see. The input length is len('abrakadabrabrakadabra') → let me count. Well, the sample says that the output is 'abrakadabra', which is 11 letters. The input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. So n=21.\n\nlen_s ranges from (21+1)//2 = 11 to 20.\n\nSo len_s=11. k= 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. Check 1<=1 <= 10 → yes.\n\nCheck t[11:] == t[1:11].\n\nt[:11] is 'abrakadabra' (the s). Then t[11:] is 'abrakadabra' (the rest of the string). t[1:11] is 'brakadabra'?\n\nWait, the original input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → the first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra', then the next letters are 'abrakadabra' (assuming that the input is the concatenation of two s's with overlap 1). So t[11:] would be 'abrakadabra' (length 11?), but len(t) is 21. len_s=11, so t[11:] is 10 characters. Wait 2*len_s -k = 2*11 -1 = 21 → correct. So len(t) is 21. So t[11:] is 10 characters. And t[k: len_s] is t[1:11], which is 10 characters. So for the sample input, this would be true. So code returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input: 'acacacaca' (n=9). len_s ranges from (9+1)//2=5 to 8.\n\nFor len_s=5, k= 10-9=1. Check t[5:] is 'caca' (indices 5-8: positions 5,6,7,8: 'c a c a'). t[k: len_s] is t[1:5] → positions 1-4: 'c a c a' → same as t[5:]. So code returns YES and 'acaca'.\n\nSample input 'abcabc' (n=6). len_s ranges from (6+1)//2 = 3.5 → 3 (since integer division in Python (6+1)//2 is 3.5? Wait no, in Python 3, (6+1)//2 is 3 (since 7//2 is 3). So len_s ranges from 3 to 5.\n\nlen_s=3: k=6-6=0 → invalid.\n\nlen_s=4: k=8-6=2. Check 1<=2 <=3 → yes. Check t[4:] is 'c' (indices 4-5: 'c' and 'b'? Wait original string is 'abcabc', indices 0-5:\n\n0:a, 1:b, 2:c, 3:a, 4:b, 5:c.\n\nt[4:] is 'bc'. t[k: len_s] is t[2:4] → indices 2 and 3: 'c a' → 'ca'. 'bc' != 'ca' → no.\n\nlen_s=5: k=10-6=4. Check 1<=4 <=4 (yes). t[5:] is 'c', t[4:5] is 'b' → no. So code returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 'abababab' (n=8). len_s ranges from (8+1)//2 = 4.5 → 4 (since integer division 9//2 is 4). So len_s from 4 to 7.\n\nFor len_s=4: k=8-8=0 → invalid.\n\nlen_s=5: k=10-8=2. Check 1<=2 <=4 → yes. t[5:] is 'abab'? No. For n=8, len_s=5, t[5:] is indices 5-7 → 'ab' (since 8-5=3 characters? Wait len(t) is 8. t[5:] is from index 5 to end: indices 5,6,7 → 3 characters. Original string is 'abababab' → indices 5 is 'a', 6 is 'b', 7 is 'a' → 'aba'. t[k: len_s] is t[2:5] → indices 2,3,4 → 'aba' → 'aba' == 'aba' → yes. So code would return YES and s is t[:5] = 'ababa'.\n\nBut according to the sample, the correct answer is 'ababab' (len_s=6). Why is this?\n\nBecause the code returns the first valid len_s found. In this case, len_s=5 would be checked first. But according to the sample",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an overlap. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second message, and the overlap length must be a positive number less than the length of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Overlap**: When two identical strings `s` are merged with an overlap of `k` characters, the resulting string `t` will have a length of `2 * len(s) - k`. This gives us a way to determine possible lengths of `s` based on the length of `t`.\n2. **Range of Possible Lengths for `s`**: For a given string `t` of length `n`, the possible lengths of `s` (denoted as `len_s`) range from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n - 1`. This is derived from the equation `n = 2 * len_s - k` where `k` is the overlap length.\n3. **Check Validity of Overlap**: For each possible `len_s`, calculate the overlap length `k` and check if it is valid (i.e., between 1 and `len_s - 1`). If valid, verify if the substring of `t` starting at `len_s` matches the substring starting at `k` of length `len_s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\n\nfor len_s in range((n + 1) // 2, n):\n    k = 2 * len_s - n\n    if 1 <= k <= len_s - 1:\n        if t[len_s:] == t[k:len_s]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(t[:len_s])\n            exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Iterating Over Possible Lengths**: The loop iterates over possible lengths of `s` from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n - 1`. This range ensures we consider all feasible lengths for `s` that could result in the overlap condition.\n3. **Calculating Overlap Length**: For each possible length `len_s`, compute the overlap length `k` using the formula `k = 2 * len_s - n`.\n4. **Checking Validity of Overlap**: If `k` is within the valid range (1 to `len_s - 1`), check if the substring starting at `len_s` in `t` matches the substring starting at `k` of length `len_s`. If they match, print \"YES\" followed by the possible `s`.\n5. **Output Result**: If no valid `s` is found after checking all possible lengths, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid overlaps and ensures correctness by leveraging string slicing and comparison operations.",
