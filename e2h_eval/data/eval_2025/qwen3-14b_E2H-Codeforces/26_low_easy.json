Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain inequalities. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the main condition we need to check is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order x ≤ y ≤ z, the sum of the two smaller sides (x + y) must be greater than the largest side (z). Otherwise, it's degenerate.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate through all possible x, y, z values within their ranges and count those that satisfy x + y > z. However, given that the ranges can be up to 5e5, a brute-force approach would be way too slow. We need an efficient way to calculate this.\n\nLet me think about how to break this down. The variables are constrained as follows:\n\nx ranges from A to B (inclusive)\ny ranges from B to C (inclusive)\nz ranges from C to D (inclusive)\nBut also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, so x ≤ B ≤ y. So for each x and y, z has to be between max(C, ... )? Wait, the original condition says that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Wait, no. The problem statement says that the inequalities are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So for example, x can be up to B, y starts at B (since B ≤ y) but also y can't exceed C, because y ≤ C. Then z starts at C and goes up to D.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nx ∈ [A, B]\ny ∈ [B, C]\nz ∈ [C, D]\n\nBut also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, and y ≤ C ≤ z, so x ≤ y ≤ z. Because x ≤ B ≤ y, and y ≤ C ≤ z. So x ≤ y and y ≤ z. Therefore, x ≤ y ≤ z. So the triangle condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where x is in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D], and x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For each possible x and y, find the number of z's that are in [C, D] and less than x + y. Because z must be >= C and <= D, and also z < x + y. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. But since z must be at least C, if x + y - 1 < C, then there are zero such z's. Otherwise, the count is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C.\n\nBut how do we compute this for all x and y?\n\nThe problem is that x ranges up to B (which could be 5e5), and y up to C (also up to 5e5). So the total number of (x, y) pairs is O(B*C), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow for Python. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible z, find the number of (x, y) pairs such that x + y > z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C], and y >= B, x <= B, etc.\n\nBut again, z ranges up to D (5e5). For each z, compute the number of (x,y) pairs where x + y > z. Then sum over all z in [C, D].\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each z, the valid (x,y) pairs must satisfy x + y > z. Also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, and y ≤ C. Let me think about the possible range for x and y.\n\nLet me think about the possible x and y. Since x is between A and B, and y between B and C. For each z, the condition x + y > z can be rewritten as y > z - x. But since y is at least B, and x is up to B, perhaps we can find for each z, the number of pairs (x,y) where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], and y > z - x.\n\nBut even this seems challenging. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me note that for a fixed z, the minimal value of",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides $ x, y, z $ such that $ A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D $. The key insight is that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.
