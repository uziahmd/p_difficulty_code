    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, or adjacent 1s and 2s. But you can't swap 0 and 2 directly. So, what's the approach here?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the allowed swaps. Since we can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, but not 0 and 2. So, the key here is that the 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s, but 0s can't move past 2s. Wait, but maybe through some steps? Like, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, can the 0 move past the 2? No, because the 0 can only swap with 1s. So the 0 can move left or right through 1s, but not through 2s. Similarly, 2s can move through 1s but not through 0s. \n\nSo the idea is that the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because 0s can't pass through 2s. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose I have a 0 and a 2. If there's a 1 between them, then maybe they can move around? For example, 0 1 2. Then, the 0 can move to the right past the 1, and the 2 can move left past the 1. But they can't cross each other. So the 0 can't get past the 2. So the original order of 0s and 2s in the string is fixed. Because any 0 can't move past a 2, and vice versa. Because they can't swap. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s in the original string are fixed. Only the 1s can move between them. \n\nWait, that's a crucial insight. So the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. Similarly, if there's a 2 followed by a 0 in the original string, then in the final string, the 2 must come before the 0. Because they can't swap. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s are fixed. \n\nBut the 1s can move around. Because 1s can swap with 0s and 2s. Wait, no. Wait, the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So, 1s can move through 0s and 2s. So, for example, a 1 can move left through 0s (since they can swap) and right through 2s. So, the 1s can be rearranged freely among the 0s and 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't move past each other. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: arrange the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, and then arrange the 1s in between them in such a way that the overall string is lex smallest. \n\nWait, but how? Let me think. Let's suppose that the original string has some 0s and 2s. For example, the original string could be something like 0...0...2...2. The 0s can't move past the 2s. So the positions of 0s and 2s in the final string are the same as their original order. But the 1s can be placed anywhere between them. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- First, collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Let's call this the \"fixed\" part. Then, the 1s can be inserted in between them, but how?\n\nWait, no. Because the 1s can be moved around. For example, suppose the original string is 0 2. Then, the 0 and 2 can't swap. So the final string must be 0 2. But if there are 1s, like in 0 1 2, then the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0 (if possible?), but wait, no. Because the 1 can swap with 0. So, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. For example, 0 1 can be swapped to 1 0. So in that case, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. But the 0 and 2 can't cross. So in the original string, the 0 comes before the 2. But the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0, but the 2 can't be moved to the left of the 0. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that the 0s and 2s in the original string can't change their relative order. However, the 1s can be placed in any positions between the 0s and 2s, but also possibly before the first 0, between 0s and 2s, and after the last 2. \n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Split the original string into groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s. Wait, no. Wait, the fixed part is the positions of 0s and 2s. The 1s can be arranged in between. \n\nBut how do we arrange the 1s? Let's think. For example, the original string may have some 1s. But since 1s can be moved freely between 0s and 2s, perhaps the minimal lex string is achieved by placing as many 1s as possible to the left. But that's not correct. Because 1s can be placed anywhere. Let me think.\n\nThe lex smallest string is achieved by having as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. However, the problem is that the 0s and 2s can't change their relative positions. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then the 0 must come before the 2. But in the minimal string, we can have all the 0s first, then 1s, then 2s. But if the original string's 0s and 2s are interleaved, then we can't change their order. \n\nSo the key is to arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s. For example, suppose the original string is '0 2 1 0 2'. Then, the relative order of 0s and 2s is 0, 2, 0, 2. So in the final string, the order must be 0, 2, 0, 2. But the 1s can be placed in between. So the minimal string would be 0 0 1 2 2. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the original string is '0 2 1 0 2'. The 0s and 2s are in the order 0, 2, 0, 2. So the fixed parts are 0, 2, 0, 2. Then, the 1s can be placed between them. So the minimal lex would be to place the 1s as early as possible. So between the first 0 and 2, we can insert the 1. So the string becomes 0 1 2 0 2. But that's not possible. Wait, but how can the 1 be moved between the 0 and 2? Because the original string is 0 2 1 0 2. The 1 is after the 2. How can it be moved to between the 0 and 2?\n\nWait, the original string is 0 2 1 0 2. The 1 is between the 2 and the next 0. But since the 1 can be swapped with the 2 (because they are adjacent), so the 1 can move left through the 2. So, for example, the 1 can be swapped with the 2 to get 0 1 2 0 2. Then, the 1 can be moved further left. But wait, the 1 can be swapped with the 2, but the 1 can't be swapped with the 0. Wait, no. Wait, the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So, once the 1 is to the left of the 2, can it move left past the 0?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the string is 0 1 2. The 1 can be swapped with the 0, so the 1 can move to the left. So, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. Wait, no. Wait, the original string is 0 1 2. The 1 is after the 0. So the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So the string can become 1 0 2. Then the 1 is before the 0. So in that case, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. But the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. \n\nSo in the example where the original string is 0 2 1 0 2. The 1 is after the 2. So, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 2. Let me see:\n\nOriginal is 0 2 1 0 2. Let's move the 1 left through the 2. So, 0 1 2 0 2. Then, the 1 can be moved left through the 0? Because the 1 and 0 are adjacent. So, yes. So the 1 can be swapped with the 0. So the string becomes 1 0 2 0 2. But that's worse for lex order. But perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, but our goal is to get the lex smallest string. So, the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s. But how? Maybe the optimal way is to collect all the 1s and insert them in between the 0s and 2s in such a way that the 1s are as left as possible.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the positions of 0s and 2s are fixed. Let's collect all the 0s and 2s in the original order. Then, the 1s can be inserted in between them. But also, the 1s can be placed before the first 0, between the 0s and 2s, and after the last 2.\n\nBut how to arrange them optimally?\n\nFor example, if there are 0s and 2s in the order [0, 2, 0, 2], then the 1s can be placed in the following regions:\n\n- Before the first 0.\n\n- Between the first 0 and the 2.\n\n- Between the 2 and the next 0.\n\n- Between the next 0 and the 2.\n\n- After the last 2.\n\nBut the minimal lex string would want as many 1s as possible to be placed in the earliest positions. But wait, 1 is bigger than 0, but smaller than 2. So, inserting a 1 between 0 and 2 would make the string lex smaller than if we leave it as 0 2 ... ?\n\nWait, for example, between a 0 and a 2, inserting a 1 gives 0 1 2, which is better than 0 2 1. Because 0 1 2 is lex smaller than 0 2 1. So inserting 1s between 0 and 2 is good.\n\nBut the problem is that the 1s can be placed in all the possible regions. So the minimal lex string would be achieved by putting all the 1s as far left as possible. However, since the 1s can be placed anywhere, including before the first 0, but that would be worse than putting them after the 0s.\n\nWait, no. For example, if there are 1s before the first 0, then the string starts with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So we want to avoid that. Therefore, the optimal approach is to place the 1s between the 0s and 2s in such a way that they are as left as possible, but not before the first 0. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Split the original string into two parts: the fixed characters (0s and 2s) and the 1s. Then, arrange the 1s in between the fixed characters, in such a way that the 1s are placed in the earliest possible positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the fixed characters as a list. For example, if the original string is '100210', then the fixed characters are [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]. Wait, no. Wait, the fixed characters are 0s and 2s. The 1s can be moved. So in the original string '100210', the 0s and 2s are 1, 0, 0, 2, 0? Wait, no. Wait, the 1s are not fixed. The fixed part is the 0s and 2s in their original order. So in the input '100210', the original string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'. The 0s and 2s are 0,0,2,0. The 1s are the first character and the fifth character. \n\nSo the fixed list is [0,0,2,0], and the 1s are [1,1]. Then, the problem is to insert the 1s into the fixed list in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to insert them?\n\nThe idea is that between the fixed elements, we can insert the 1s. Also, before the first fixed element and after the last fixed element. However, inserting 1s before the first fixed element would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. Similarly, inserting 1s after the last fixed element would be better than inserting them before 2s. \n\nSo the optimal approach is to insert all the 1s in the earliest possible positions. However, the earliest possible positions are between the fixed elements where inserting them would not require moving them past a 0 or 2. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the fixed list as a sequence of blocks. For example, the fixed list is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The possible insertion points for 1s are:\n\n- Before the first 0.\n\n- Between the first 0 and the second 0.\n\n- Between the second 0 and the 2.\n\n- Between the 2 and the 0.\n\n- After the last 0.\n\nBut inserting 1s before the first 0 would lead to a string starting with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So we want to avoid that. \n\nSimilarly, inserting 1s between the 0 and 2 would be better than inserting them between the 2 and 0. Because 0 is smaller than 2. So inserting 1s in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed without causing a larger lex order.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nLet me think about the insertion points. For the fixed list, the insertion points are between the elements, and before the first element, and after the last element. But we need to choose which insertion points to use to insert the 1s.\n\nThe 1s can be placed in any of these positions. But to get the lex smallest string, we need to arrange the 1s in the earliest possible positions. However, inserting 1s in between 0s and 2s may be better than inserting them after 2s.\n\nFor example, inserting a 1 between two 0s is better than inserting it after a 2. Because 0 < 1 < 2. So, the 1s should be placed as left as possible.\n\nBut how to model this. For example, the fixed list is [0,0,2,0]. The insertion points are:\n\npositions 0 (before first 0), 1 (between 0 and 0), 2 (between 0 and 2), 3 (between 2 and 0), 4 (after last 0).\n\nWe need to insert all 1s into these positions, but in a way that the resulting string is lex smallest. \n\nSince the 1s are all the same, the optimal way is to insert as many as possible into the earliest possible insertion points. \n\nBut which insertion points are better?\n\nThe earliest insertion point is position 0, but inserting 1s there would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So we don't want that. So the earliest possible insertion point that is safe is the first insertion point that is between 0 and 0, or between 0 and 2, etc.\n\nSo, for the fixed list, the insertion points can be considered as follows. For each insertion point, we can decide whether inserting a 1 there would be better than inserting it elsewhere. \n\nBut since the 1s are all the same, the optimal strategy is to insert all 1s into the earliest possible insertion points where inserting them doesn't cause the string to be lex larger. \n\nBut how to find those insertion points.\n\nAnother way to think: the 1s can be placed in any of the insertion points. To get the lex smallest string, we need to arrange the 1s in such a way that they are placed as early as possible. However, inserting them in the earliest insertion points that are not before the first 0. \n\nSo, for example, the insertion points can be ordered as follows:\n\nInsertion points in order of priority (from best to worst):\n\n- Between 0 and 0 (so between two 0s) → inserting 1s here would be better than inserting after the 0s, because the 1s would be between 0s, leading to more 0s earlier.\n\n- Between 0 and 2 → inserting 1s here would make the 0 followed by 1 followed by 2, which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1.\n\n- Between 2 and 0 → inserting 1s here would be worse than inserting between 0 and 2, because the 2 is larger than 1, so inserting before the 2 would be better than inserting after it.\n\nWait, but inserting 1s between 0 and 2 is better than inserting them between 2 and 0. So the insertion points should be ordered based on the positions where inserting 1s will make the string as small as possible.\n\nSo, for the fixed list, the insertion points are between elements. Let's consider the possible insertion points. For each insertion point between two elements, the value of the left element and the right element. \n\nFor example, inserting between left and right elements. The 1 can be inserted here. What's the impact on the lex order?\n\nIf the left element is 0 and the right is 2, inserting 1 here makes the sequence 0 1 2, which is better than 0 2 1 (which would be the case if the 1 is inserted after the 2). So inserting between 0 and 2 is better.\n\nIf the left is 2 and the right is 0, inserting 1 here would give 2 1 0, which is worse than inserting before the 2 (but that's not possible because inserting before the 2 would be between 0 and 2). So inserting between 2 and 0 is worse than inserting between 0 and 2.\n\nSo the insertion points can be prioritized based on the left and right elements. The best insertion points are those where inserting 1s would be between 0 and 2, or between 0 and 0, etc.\n\nBut how to model this. Perhaps, the best way is to collect all the insertion points, and for each, determine where inserting a 1 would be the most beneficial. But since the 1s can be placed in any insertion points, the optimal way is to place them in the earliest possible insertion points that are not before the first 0.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the 1s can be placed in between the fixed elements, and the fixed elements are 0s and 2s, the minimal lex string would be achieved by grouping all the 1s into the earliest possible positions between the fixed elements. \n\nLet me think of the fixed list as a sequence of 0s and 2s. Then, the 1s can be placed in between them. For example, between any two consecutive elements in the fixed list, we can insert some number of 1s. Also, before the first element and after the last element. But the optimal way is to insert as many 1s as possible in the earliest possible insertion points that are not before the first element. \n\nBut how to find these insertion points. \n\nLet me think of the fixed list as follows. Suppose the fixed list is F = [f1, f2, ..., fn], where each fi is 0 or 2. Then, the insertion points are between f1 and f2, between f2 and f3, etc., and also before f1 and after fn. \n\nNow, the 1s can be inserted into any of these positions. To minimize the lex order, we want to insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible insertion points. However, inserting before f1 would be bad if f1 is 0, because inserting 1s there would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Collect all the 0s and 2s in the original order. Let's call this list F.\n\n2. Collect all the 1s in a separate list, say ones = [1] * count_ones.\n\n3. Now, we need to insert the ones into the F list, in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe key is that inserting a 1 between two elements of F can be done in a way that the 1s are placed as early as possible. But the insertion points between F elements can be ordered based on their potential to contribute to a smaller lex order.\n\nFor example, inserting between two 0s (so 0 and 0) would allow the 1s to be placed between them, which would be better than inserting after the 0s. Because inserting between two 0s gives 0 1 0, which is better than 0 0 1. Wait, no. Wait, inserting 1 between 0 and 0 would result in 0 1 0. Whereas inserting after the 0s would be 0 0 1. Which one is lex smaller? Well, comparing the two options:\n\nOption 1: 0 1 0\n\nOption 2: 0 0 1\n\nCompare the first position where they differ. Both start with 0. Then, the second character is 1 vs 0. So option 2 is better. So inserting the 1s between 0 and 0 is worse than inserting them after the 0s. \n\nWait, this suggests that inserting 1s after the 0s is better than inserting them between 0 and 0. So my previous reasoning was wrong. \n\nThis complicates things. How to decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nSo the problem is that inserting a 1 between two 0s is worse than inserting it after the 0s. Because inserting after the 0s would have the 1s come after more 0s. So, for example, between two 0s, inserting a 1 gives 0 1 0, but inserting after the 0s gives 0 0 1. The latter is better. \n\nSo, the insertion points should be ordered based on the position where inserting the 1 would give the lex smallest result. \n\nSo, for each possible insertion point, we can evaluate where inserting the 1 would be better.\n\nBut how to model this for all possible insertion points.\n\nAlternative approach: the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible positions where inserting them does not create a larger lex order. \n\nLet me think of the insertion points as follows. The insertion points are ordered from left to right. For each insertion point, we can decide whether to insert as many 1s as possible there, based on the current state.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the insertion points as the possible places where 1s can be inserted. For each insertion point, inserting a 1 there would be better than inserting it later. But how?\n\nFor example, the insertion points are:\n\n- Before F[0]\n\n- Between F[0] and F[1]\n\n- Between F[1] and F[2]\n\n...\n\n- After F[-1]\n\nFor each insertion point, inserting a 1 there would be better than inserting it in a later insertion point. However, inserting before F[0] is worse than inserting in any other insertion point (except if F[0] is 1, but in our case F contains only 0 and 2). \n\nSo, the idea is to process the insertion points in order from left to right, inserting as many 1s as possible into each insertion point. However, inserting into an insertion point may be better than inserting into later ones. \n\nBut why? For example, inserting a 1 between F[i] and F[i+1] is better than inserting it into the insertion point after F[i+1], because the 1 is placed earlier.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nInitialize a list of insertion points. For each insertion point, insert as many 1s as possible into it, starting from the earliest insertion points (excluding the one before F[0]).\n\nBut how to determine which insertion points are better than others.\n\nLet me think of the insertion points in order. For example, the insertion points are:\n\ninsertion_points = [before F[0], between F[0] and F[1], between F[1] and F[2], ..., after F[-1]]\n\nWe can iterate through the insertion points from left to right. For each insertion point, we decide how many 1s to insert here.\n\nBut we need to avoid inserting before F[0], unless F[0] is 1 (but it can't be, since F is made of 0s and 2s). So, the first insertion point to consider is between F[0] and F[1], but wait, no. The first insertion point is before F[0], which is not desired. So, we can skip that. The next insertion points are between F[0] and F[1], between F[1] and F[2], etc., and after F[-1].\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nLet me think of the following example: F = [0, 2, 0], and ones = [1, 1].\n\nThe insertion points are:\n\nbefore 0 (bad)\n\nbetween 0 and 2\n\nbetween 2 and 0\n\nafter 0.\n\nWe can insert the 1s in the earliest possible insertion points. So, between 0 and 2, and then between 2 and 0, and after 0. But inserting the 1s between 0 and 2 would be better than inserting them between 2 and 0. Because inserting between 0 and 2 gives 0 1 2, which is better than inserting between 2 and 0 (which would be 2 1 0). \n\nSo, in this case, the best is to insert all the 1s between 0 and 2. \n\nAnother example: F = [0, 0, 2], ones = [1,1]. Insertion points between 0 and 0, between 0 and 2, and after 2.\n\nInserting between 0 and 0 would give 0 1 0 2. But inserting between the first 0 and the second 0 would be worse than inserting after the 0s. Because inserting after the 0s would be 0 0 1 2. Which is better than 0 1 0 2. Because the first two characters are 0 and 0 in the latter case, versus 0 and 1 in the former. So inserting between 0 and 0 is worse. \n\nThus, the best insertion points are those where inserting the 1s would not disrupt the 0s as much as possible. So, the insertion points between 0 and 2 are better than between 0 and 0, which are better than between 2 and 0, which are better than after the 2.\n\nBut how to prioritize the insertion points.\n\nThe idea is that inserting a 1 in an insertion point between two elements (a, b) is better than inserting it in a later insertion point. However, the insertion point between a and b may be better or worse than another insertion point depending on the values of a and b.\n\nFor example, inserting between 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 2 and 0. Inserting between 0 and 0 is worse than inserting between 0 and 2. \n\nSo, perhaps the insertion points can be ordered based on the following criteria: \n\nFor each insertion point between a and b (where a is F[i], b is F[i+1]), the priority is determined by the pair (a, b). We want to insert the 1s into the earliest possible insertion points that have the highest priority. \n\nWhat is the priority of an insertion point? \n\nThe priority is such that inserting a 1 here is better than inserting it in a later insertion point. \n\nFor example, inserting between a and b where a is 0 and b is 2 is better than inserting between 0 and 0. \n\nSo, the priority for insertion points can be determined by comparing the pairs (a, b). \n\nBut how to compare two insertion points.\n\nLet me think of the possible pairs:\n\nCase 1: a is 0 and b is 0. Inserting here would give 0 1 0. \n\nCase 2: a is 0 and b is 2. Inserting here gives 0 1 2. \n\nCase 3: a is 2 and b is 0. Inserting here gives 2 1 0. \n\nCase 4: a is 2 and b is 2. Inserting here gives 2 1 2. \n\nWhich insertion points are better? \n\nComparing case 2 and case 1: inserting between 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 0 and 0. \n\nComparing case 2 and case 4: inserting between 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 2 and 2. \n\nComparing case 2 and case 3: inserting between 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 2 and 0. \n\nSo, the best insertion points are those between 0 and 2. Then, insertion points between 0 and 0, then between 2 and 2, then between 2 and 0. \n\nThus, the priority of insertion points can be determined based on the following:\n\nFor an insertion point between a and b, the priority is determined by the pair (a, b). \n\nThe priority order is:\n\n- Between 0 and 2 (highest priority)\n\n- Between 0 and 0\n\n- Between 2 and 2\n\n- Between 2 and 0 (lowest priority)\n\nSo, when considering insertion points, we should process them in the order of their priority. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nThe idea is to generate all the insertion points, and for each, assign a priority. Then, we sort the insertion points based on their priority, and insert the 1s into the insertion points in that order. \n\nBut how to assign the priority.\n\nAlternatively, we can think that inserting a 1 between a and b is better than inserting it in another insertion point if the insertion point between a and b allows for a smaller lex order. \n\nBut how to compare two insertion points. \n\nAlternatively, for each insertion point, we can think of the best possible scenario when inserting a 1 there. For example, inserting between 0 and 2 gives a 0 followed by 1 followed by 2, which is better than inserting between 0 and 0, which would give 0 followed by 1 followed by 0. \n\nSo, the insertion points can be processed in the order of their potential to improve the lex order. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nPerhaps, for all insertion points, we can generate a list of insertion points, and for each, compute a key that determines the order in which we should process them. \n\nFor example, the key for an insertion point between a and b can be (a, b). \n\nThe priority for processing insertion points is such that insertion points with (a, b) = (0, 2) are processed first. Then, insertion points with (a, b) = (0, 0), then (2, 2), then (2, 0). \n\nBut also, insertion points that are between a and b where a is 0 and b is 2 are better than others. \n\nBut how to generate the order of insertion points. \n\nAnother idea: the insertion points can be processed in the order of the original positions, but for each insertion point, we decide whether inserting a 1 there is better than inserting it elsewhere. \n\nBut this seems complicated. \n\nAlternative approach: think of the fixed list F. We need to insert the 1s into F. The optimal way is to arrange the 1s in the positions where they are as left as possible, but not before the first 0. \n\nBut how to find those positions. \n\nLet me think of the entire string as consisting of the fixed elements and the 1s. The 1s can be placed in between the fixed elements. \n\nTo get the lex smallest string, we want as many 0s as possible at the beginning, followed by as many 1s as possible, followed by as many 2s as possible. However, the fixed elements may not allow this. \n\nFor example, if the fixed elements are [0, 2, 0], then the 1s can be inserted between 0 and 2, which would give 0 1 2 0. Or between the 2 and 0, giving 0 2 1 0, or after the 0, giving 0 2 0 1. The best is to insert between 0 and 2. \n\nSo, the optimal way is to insert the 1s between the 0 and 2. \n\nAnother example: fixed elements are [0, 0, 2, 0]. The insertion points are between 0 and 0, between 0 and 2, between 2 and 0. \n\nInserting the 1s between 0 and 2 gives the best result. \n\nBut if there are multiple insertion points with higher priority, like between 0 and 2, we should fill those first. \n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n- Generate all the insertion points (before F[0], between F[i] and F[i+1], after F[-1])\n\n- For each insertion point, calculate its priority based on the pair (a, b) as described earlier.\n\n- Sort the insertion points in the order of priority (highest first).\n\n- For each insertion point in this sorted order, insert as many 1s as possible into it.\n\nBut how to sort the insertion points. \n\nLet me think of the priority for each insertion point as follows:\n\nFor an insertion point between a and b:\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 2: high priority (we want to insert 1s here first)\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 0: medium priority\n\n- If a is 2 and b is 2: medium priority\n\n- If a is 2 and b is 0: low priority\n\n- For insertion points before F[0] (which is a 0 or 2): very low priority (we don't want to insert here)\n\n- For insertion points after F[-1]: medium priority (inserting after 2s is better than inserting between 2 and 0, but worse than inserting between 0 and 2)\n\nWait, inserting after F[-1] (which is a 0 or 2) would be adding 1s after the fixed elements. For example, if F ends with 0, then inserting after it gives 0 1. Which is better than inserting between 2 and 0 (which would be 2 1 0). \n\nSo, the priority for insertion points after F[-1] is higher than insertion points between 2 and 0, but lower than insertion points between 0 and 2. \n\nSo, the priority order for insertion points is:\n\n1. Between 0 and 2 (highest)\n\n2. Between 0 and 0\n\n3. Between 2 and 2\n\n4. After F[-1] (if F[-1] is 0 or 2)\n\n5. Between 2 and 0 (lowest)\n\nBut how to represent this. \n\nPerhaps, for each insertion point, we can assign a numerical priority value. For example:\n\n- Insertion between 0 and 2: priority 0\n\n- Insertion between 0 and 0: priority 1\n\n- Insertion between 2 and 2: priority 1\n\n- Insertion after F[-1] (if F[-1] is 0): priority 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. The key insight is that '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly, so their relative order must remain unchanged. However, '1's can be freely moved between '0's and '2's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Fixed Elements**: Extract all '0's and '2's from the input string while maintaining their original order. These elements are fixed in their relative positions.\n2. **Collect 1s**: Collect all '1's from the input string as they can be rearranged freely.\n3. **Determine Insertion Points**: Determine the positions where '1's can be inserted between the fixed elements. These insertion points include before the first fixed element, between each pair of consecutive fixed elements, and after the last fixed element.\n4. **Prioritize Insertion Points**: Insert '1's into the earliest possible positions that yield the smallest lexicographical result. This involves prioritizing insertion points between '0' and '2', followed by other valid positions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    # Split the string into fixed characters (0 and 2) and collect 1s\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '0' or c == '2':\n            fixed.append(c)\n        else:\n            ones.append(c)\n    \n    # If there are no fixed characters, return the ones (all 1s)\n    if not fixed:\n        return ''.join(ones)\n    \n    # Generate insertion points with their priority\n    insertion_points = []\n    # Before the first element (we'll skip this later)\n    insertion_points.append(('before', None, None))\n    # Between elements\n    for i in range(len(fixed) - 1):\n        a = fixed[i]\n        b = fixed[i + 1]\n        insertion_points.append(('between', a, b))\n    # After the last element\n    insertion_points.append(('after', None, fixed[-1]))\n    \n    # Sort insertion points based on priority\n    # Priority: between 0 and 2 first, then between 0 and 0, 2 and 2, after, then between 2 and 0\n    def get_priority(point):\n        if point[0] == 'between':\n            a, b = point[1], point[2]\n            if a == '0' and b == '2':\n                return 0\n            elif a == '0' and b == '0':\n                return 1\n            elif a == '2' and b == '2':\n                return 1\n            elif a == '2' and b == '0':\n                return 3\n            else:\n                return 2  # for other cases like between 0 and 2 (already covered)\n        elif point[0] == 'after':\n            # after 0 is better than after 2\n            if fixed[-1] == '0':\n                return 1\n            else:\n                return 2\n        else:  # before\n            return 4\n    \n    # Sort the insertion points based on priority\n    insertion_points.sort(key=get_priority)\n    \n    # Now, insert the 1s into the insertion points in order of priority\n    result = []\n    # We need to process the insertion points in sorted order\n    # But we should skip the 'before' insertion point unless it's necessary (which it isn't)\n    for point in insertion_points:\n        if point[0] == 'before':\n            continue\n        elif point[0] == 'between':\n            a, b = point[1], point[2]\n            # Insert all remaining 1s here\n            if len(ones) > 0:\n                result.append(''.join(ones))\n                ones = []\n        elif point[0] == 'after':\n            if len(ones) > 0:\n                result.append(''.join(ones))\n                ones = []\n        # else: handle other cases if needed\n    \n    # Now, build the final string by inserting the 1s into the fixed list\n    # Wait, the above approach might have been incorrect.
