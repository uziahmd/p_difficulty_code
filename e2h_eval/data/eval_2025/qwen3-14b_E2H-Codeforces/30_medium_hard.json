Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about Homer and Marge taking digits from a number A, each taking exactly n digits (since the total length is 2n). The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of moves (H for Homer, M for Marge) that achieves this maximum sum. And if there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. The challenge here is to choose, at each step, whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit, such that the total sum is maximized. But since both players take exactly n digits, we have to make sure that in the end, each has exactly n moves.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of steps is 36. But trying all possibilities would be O(2^36), which is way too big. That's impossible for a brute-force approach.\n\nSo we need a dynamic programming approach. Let's think about the state. At any point, the state depends on how many digits have been taken by Homer and Marge. For example, suppose after some steps, Homer has taken h digits, and Marge has taken m digits. Since each step is either H or M, and the total steps so far is h + m. The total steps must be 2n, and h and m can't exceed n.\n\nBut the key is that for each state (h, m), we can track the maximum possible sum we can get from that state onward. Then, we can make decisions at each step based on which choice (H or M) gives the higher sum.\n\nWait, but how do we model the digits that are left? Because the digits are taken from the front of A. So the current state depends on how many digits have been taken already. For example, if we have taken k digits already, then the next digit is the (k+1)th digit of A. So the state can be represented by the number of digits taken so far (k = h + m), and the counts of h and m. Wait, but since h + m = k, and h can be determined as h = k - m, but perhaps it's better to track h and m.\n\nBut since each player can take up to n steps, for the state, we can represent it with h and m, where h is the number of digits Homer has taken, m is the number of digits Marge has taken. Then, the next move can be H (if h < n) or M (if m < n). The current position in the string A is determined by h + m. Because each step removes the leftmost digit. So the first digit is taken at step 0, then the next at step 1, etc. So the current digit to take is at index (h + m) in the original A.\n\nSo the DP state can be (h, m), and the value stored is the maximum total sum achievable from that state onwards.\n\nThe recurrence would be: for each state (h, m), if it's Homer's turn (but wait, no, the decision is whether to take H or M next. So for each state (h, m), we can choose to take H if h < n, and take M if m < n. Then, the next state will be (h+1, m) or (h, m+1).\n\nSo the DP function would look like this:\n\ndp[h][m] = max(\n   (current digit value added to Homer's sum) + dp[h+1][m], \n   (current digit value added to Marge's sum) + dp[h][m+1]\n)\n\nBut wait, how do we track the sum? Because the sum depends on the digits that each player has collected. However, since the digits are added to their numbers in the order they are taken, the actual value of the number depends on the digits taken. For example, if Homer takes a digit d, then that digit is the first digit of his number. Then, when he takes another digit, it becomes the second, etc. So the value of his number is the sum of d_i * 10^{n - i} for each digit he takes. But when building the DP, how do we track the current sum of Homer and Marge?\n\nWait, but the problem requires maximizing the total sum of S1 + S2. So each digit taken contributes to either S1 or S2, and the value of that digit depends on its position in their respective numbers. For example, if Homer takes a digit d at step i (when he has already taken h digits before), then this digit will be the (h+1)th digit of his number. Since the number is formed by appending digits, the first digit is the most significant. So the value of this digit is d * 10^{n - (h+1)} }, because the total length of the number is n digits. Wait, but the position in the number depends on when he took it. For instance, if Homer takes a digit in his first move, that's the first digit of his number, which is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, then the next digit is multiplied by 10^{n-2}, and so on until the last digit, which is multiplied by 10^0.\n\nTherefore, when considering a choice to take the current digit as part of Homer's number, the contribution to the total sum is digit * 10^{n - h - 1}, since h is the number of digits he has already taken. Similarly for Marge's case.\n\nSo the DP needs to track not only the counts of h and m but also the accumulated sum. However, with n up to 18, the number of states is (n+1) * (n+1) = 19*19=361. For each state, the maximum value is up to 18 digits, each 9, multiplied by 1e18, which is a very big number, but Python can handle big integers.\n\nWait, but the DP can be memoized with the state (h, m) and returns the maximum total sum possible from that state. Because the current digit is determined by h + m (the number of digits taken so far). So the current digit is A[k], where k = h + m.\n\nSo, for each state (h, m), we can compute the maximum sum possible from that state onward. The base case is when h == n and m == n, which returns 0. Otherwise, we can choose to take H or M, if possible.\n\nFor example, if h < n, then we can take the current digit as Homer's next digit. The contribution to the total sum is digit * 10^{n - h - 1} (since Homer has taken h digits so far, and this is his (h+1)th digit). Then, we add the result of the DP for the next state (h+1, m). Similarly for Marge's case.\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\nif h == n and m == n:\n    return 0\nelse:\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n    max_sum = 0\n    if h < n:\n        contribution = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - h - 1))\n        sum_homer = contribution + dp(h+1, m)\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, sum_homer)\n    if m < n:\n        contribution = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - m - 1))\n        sum_marge = contribution + dp(h, m+1)\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, sum_marge)\n    return max_sum\n\nWait, but this is not quite right. Because the current digit is added to either Homer's or Marge's sum. So when choosing to take the current digit as Homer's, the contribution to the total sum (S1 + S2) is the value of that digit in Homer's number. Similarly for Marge. So the DP returns the maximum total sum possible from the current state onward.\n\nSo the DP function for state (h, m) returns the maximum total sum from that state onwards. Therefore, the recurrence is correct.\n\nBut how do we compute this DP? Since the maximum n is 18, the number of possible states is (n+1) * (n+1) = 19*19 = 361. For each state, we can compute the value once and store it. This seems feasible with memoization.\n\nBut then, how do we reconstruct the path (the sequence of H and M) that leads to the maximum sum? Because the DP function gives us the maximum sum, but to find the actual choices made, we need to track for each state which choice (H or M) was taken to reach the maximum sum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the DP table with memoization, which for each (h, m) returns the maximum total sum possible.\n\n2. Once the DP is filled, reconstruct the path by checking, for each state (h, m), whether choosing H or M gives the maximum sum. If both options are possible, pick the one that leads to the maximum sum (and in case of tie, any of them is acceptable).\n\nBut for the DP memoization, since n can be up to 18, and the state is (h, m), which is manageable, we can use memoization via recursion with memo, or use iterative DP.\n\nLet me think about the memoization approach. Let's use memoization with a cache. For each state (h, m), we compute the maximum sum. Then, for the reconstruction, we can have another memoization table that records which choice (H or M) was taken for each state.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, we can track for each (h, m) the best choice (H or M) that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, the input is given as n and A. For example, in the sample input, n is 2 and A is '1234'.\n\nLet me think about the sample. For the first sample input, the output is 'HHMM'. Let's see:\n\nThe digits are taken in order. The first two digits are taken by Homer, then the next two by Marge.\n\nHomer's number is 12, Marge's is 34. Sum is 12 + 34 = 46. Alternatively, if the sequence is HMHM, Homer takes 1 and 3, Marge takes 2 and 4. Homer's number is 13, Marge's is 24. Sum is 37. Which is worse. So the optimal is to take the first two digits for Homer, then Marge takes the next two.\n\nBut why? Because the digits are 1, 2, 3, 4. For the first step, choosing H gives Homer 1*10^(2-0-1) = 1*10^1 = 10. Then next step, Homer again takes 2, which is 2*10^0 = 2. Then Marge takes 3 and 4, contributing 3*10^1 and 4*10^0. So total sum is 10 + 2 + 30 +4 = 46.\n\nIf the first choice is M, then Marge takes 1, which is 1*10^1 (since she has taken 0 digits before). Then Homer takes 2 (10^1?), but wait, n is 2. So for Marge's first digit, she has m=0, so the contribution is 1 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 1 * 10^1 = 10. Then, next step, Homer takes 2, which is his first digit. Contribution is 2 * 10^(2-0-1) = 2 *10^1=20. Then Marge takes 3 (her second digit, 3 *10^0=3), and Homer takes 4 (his second digit, 4 *10^0=4). Sum is 10 + 20 +3 +4 = 37. So the first option is better.\n\nThus, the DP approach should correctly capture this.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the DP, and then reconstruct the path.\n\nSo, for the DP, I can use memoization. Let's think of memoizing with a 2D array for h and m.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, using lru_cache with recursion is possible. However, since n is up to 18, the maximum h and m are 18, so the recursion depth is manageable.\n\nBut for the DP, the function will be something like:\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    if h + m == 2n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if memo has (h, m):\n\n        return memo[(h, m)]\n\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        val = int(current_digit) * 10 ** (n - h - 1)\n\n        res = val + dp(h+1, m)\n\n        if res > max_val:\n\n            max_val = res\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        val = int(current_digit) * 10 ** (n - m - 1)\n\n        res = val + dp(h, m+1)\n\n        if res > max_val:\n\n            max_val = res\n\n    memo[(h, m)] = max_val\n\n    return max_val\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for each state (h, m), the choice between H and M depends on which gives the higher sum. But when there's a tie, we can choose either. However, the problem says that any of the possible correct sequences is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem requires not only the maximum sum but also the sequence of moves. So, the DP approach for the sum is necessary, but then we need to backtrack the choices.\n\nSo, during the DP computation, we can also keep track of which choice (H or M) was taken for each state. For example, a separate memoization table that stores for each (h, m) the choice (H or M) that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to implement this? Well, perhaps during the DP computation, after computing the maximum value for (h, m), we can also record which option (H or M) was chosen. Then, during backtracking, starting from (0, 0), we can check for each state what choice was made and build the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, during the backtracking phase, for each (h, m), we can check which choice (H or M) gives the maximum sum, and proceed accordingly.\n\nBut since the DP function returns the maximum sum, during backtracking, for each state (h, m), we can check whether choosing H gives the same value as the DP value, or if choosing M does. So for example, in the backtracking process, for the current (h, m), we can check:\n\ncurrent_digit = A[h + m]\n\nif h < n:\n\n    val_h = int(current_digit) * ... + dp(h+1, m)\n\nif m < n:\n\n    val_m = ... \n\nThen compare val_h and val_m. If val_h is larger, choose H, else choose M. If equal, choose either.\n\nBut for this, we need to compute the DP values first, and then during backtracking, for each state, we can compute the possible options and choose the best.\n\nBut how to compute the DP values? Well, the DP can be memoized, and for each state (h, m), we can compute it recursively.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the DP table for all (h, m) pairs, storing the maximum sum possible from that state.\n\n2. Reconstruct the path by starting from (0, 0), and for each step, decide whether to take H or M based on which choice gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and A. Then, precompute the DP.\n\nBut for memoization, recursion may be easier. However, for n up to 18, the maximum number of states is 19 * 19 = 361, which is manageable.\n\nBut for the DP, the function can be memoized with functools.lru_cache. However, since the function parameters are h and m, which are integers, it's possible.\n\nBut in Python, the recursion stack for h and m up to 18 is manageable.\n\nSo, here's the plan for the code:\n\nRead n and A. Then, precompute the DP with memoization. Then, reconstruct the path.\n\nBut for the DP, the code could be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the sample input, it's given as:\n\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\nWait, but the actual input is read from stdin. So in the code, the input is read as two lines: first line is n, second line is A.\n\nOnce that is done, the code proceeds.\n\nNow, the DP function. Let's think of it as a memoized function.\n\nBut in the DP function, for each (h, m), we need to compute the maximum sum. Let's write that.\n\nBut note that the maximum sum is the sum of the digits chosen for Homer and Marge. So for each step, when choosing to take the digit as Homer's, we add the value of that digit multiplied by 10^{n - h - 1} to the total sum. Similarly for Marge.\n\nBut for the DP function, the code can be written as follows:\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h + m == 2 * n:\n        return 0\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n    max_sum = 0\n    # Try Homer's move if possible\n    if h < n:\n        contribution = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - h - 1))\n        sum_h = contribution + dp(h + 1, m)\n        if sum_h > max_sum:\n            max_sum = sum_h\n    # Try Marge's move if possible\n    if m < n:\n        contribution = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - m - 1))\n        sum_m = contribution + dp(h, m + 1)\n        if sum_m > max_sum:\n            max_sum = sum_m\n    return max_sum\n\nBut wait, the function returns the maximum sum possible from state (h, m). So, the base case is when h + m == 2n, which is when all digits have been taken. Then, return 0.\n\nBut for the code, the function is called with h and m, which are the counts of digits taken by Homer and Marge. So the code is correct.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, the next step is to reconstruct the path.\n\nTo reconstruct the path, we can start with h = 0, m = 0, and at each step, decide whether to take H or M, based on which choice gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to do that? For each state (h, m), we can check:\n\ncurrent_digit = A[h + m]\n\nif h < n and m < n:\n\n   check which option (H or M) gives the higher sum.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for each option? Well, we can compute the value of choosing H, which is contribution_h + dp(h+1, m), and the value of choosing M, which is contribution_m + dp(h, m+1). Then compare these two.\n\nBut since the dp function is already memoized, we can compute those values.\n\nSo, during the path reconstruction, for each (h, m), we check if taking H is possible (h < n) and compute the value, and similarly for M. Then, choose the option with the higher value. If they are equal, choose either (the problem allows any of them).\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think of writing a function to generate the path.\n\nInitialize h = 0, m = 0, and a list to store the moves.\n\nWhile h + m < 2n:\n\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n\n    if h < n and m < n:\n\n        val_h = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n\n        val_m = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\n        if val_h >= val_m:\n\n            append 'H'\n\n            h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            append 'M'\n\n            m += 1\n\n    elif h < n:\n\n        append 'H'\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        append 'M'\n\n        m += 1\n\nBut this would work, but in the case where h < n and m < n, but the choice between H and M is not unique, but the code chooses H in case of equality.\n\nBut the problem allows any of the possible options. So this is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, the code above uses the dp function to compute the value of the options. However, during the path reconstruction, the dp function is already computed, so this is feasible.\n\nBut this approach would require recomputing the values for each state during the path reconstruction, which is redundant. However, since the dp function is memoized, it's just a lookup.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nBut let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn = 2, A = '1234'\n\nSo, the DP function for (0,0) would compute the maximum between taking H or M.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAt (0,0), current digit is '1'.\n\nOption H: contribution is 1 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 1 * 10^1 = 10. Then dp(1, 0).\n\nOption M: contribution is 1 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 10. Then dp(0, 1).\n\nSo the code would compare the sum of 10 + dp(1,0) and 10 + dp(0,1).\n\nWhich one is larger?\n\nWe need to compute dp(1,0) and dp(0,1).\n\nLet's compute dp(1, 0):\n\nh = 1, m = 0. Current digit is A[1 + 0] = A[1] = '2'.\n\nPossible options: h < 2 (yes), m < 2 (yes).\n\nOption H: contribution is 2 * 10^(2 -1 -1) = 2 * 10^0 = 2. Then dp(2, 0).\n\nOption M: contribution is 2 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 2 * 10^1 = 20. Then dp(1, 1).\n\ndp(2, 0): h = 2, m = 0. Now, h + m = 2, which is less than 4. But h is already 2 (equal to n=2). So next steps can only be M.\n\nAt dp(2, 0), current digit is A[2] = '3'.\n\nOnly option is M. Contribution is 3 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then dp(2, 1).\n\ndp(2, 1): current digit is A[3] = '4'. Only option is M. Contribution is 4 * 10^(2 - 1 -1) = 4 * 10^0 = 4. Then dp(2, 2) which is 0. So total for dp(2, 1) is 4.\n\nSo dp(2, 0) is 30 + 4 = 34. Thus, option H for dp(1, 0) gives 2 + 34 = 36.\n\nNow, for option M in dp(1,0): contribution is 20 + dp(1, 1).\n\ndp(1,1): current digit is A[2] = '3'.\n\nh=1, m=1. Both can take.\n\nOption H: contribution is 3 * 10^(2-1-1) = 3 * 1 = 3. Then dp(2, 1) which we know is 4. Total 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nOption M: contribution is 3 * 10^(2-1-1) = 3 * 1 = 3. Then dp(1, 2). For dp(1,2), current digit is A[3] = '4'. Only option is H (since m=2 is already n=2). So contribution is 4 * 10^(2 -1 -1) = 4 * 1 = 4. Then dp(2, 2) which is 0. So total 4. Thus, option M gives 3 + 4 = 7. So dp(1,1) is 7. So for dp(1,0) option M: 20 + 7 = 27. So comparing 36 vs 27, the maximum is 36. Thus, dp(1,0) returns 36.\n\nNow, back to dp(0,0) option H gives 10 + 36 = 46. Now, what about option M for dp(0,0)?\n\nOption M: contribution is 10 (same as before) plus dp(0,1).\n\nLet's compute dp(0,1):\n\nh=0, m=1. current digit is A[1] = '2'.\n\nOptions are H and M.\n\nOption H: contribution is 2 * 10^(2-0-1) = 2 * 10^1 = 20. Then dp(1, 1) which is 7. Total 20 +7=27.\n\nOption M: contribution is 2 * 10^(2-1-1) = 2 * 10^0 = 2. Then dp(0,2). For dp(0,2), current digit is A[2] = '3'. Only option is H. Contribution is 3 * 10^(2-0-1) = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then dp(1,2) which is 4. Total 30 +4 =34. So option M gives 2 + 34 = 36. So dp(0,1) returns max(27, 36) = 36. Thus, option M for dp(0,0) is 10 + 36 = 46. So both options give same value. Thus, in the path reconstruction, the code would choose H or M. But according to the sample input, the correct answer is HHMM. So during reconstruction, if the code chooses H first, then it would proceed.\n\nThus, the code's path reconstruction would have to choose between H and M when the values are equal. In this case, the code would choose H, since in the code's condition, val_h >= val_m would be true (since they are equal), and thus append 'H'.\n\nSo the code would generate 'H' first, then proceed.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nNow, the code for path reconstruction would be:\n\npath = []\nh, m = 0, 0\nwhile h + m < 2 * n:\n    current = A[h + m]\n    if h < n and m < n:\n        # compute both options\n        val_h = int(current) * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h+1, m)\n        val_m = int(current) * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m+1)\n        if val_h >= val_m:\n            path.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            path.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    elif h < n:\n        path.append('H')\n        h += 1\n    else:\n        path.append('M')\n        m += 1\n\nBut this code requires that the dp function is already computed. So the code would first compute the dp function, then run this loop.\n\nBut in Python, the lru_cache is used for memoization, and the dp function is called recursively. However, during the path reconstruction, the dp function is already computed, so the calls during path reconstruction would just retrieve the stored values.\n\nBut how to handle the exponents? For example, 10 ** (n - h - 1) can be precomputed for all possible h and m? Well, in Python, exponentiation is manageable, even for n up to 18.\n\nBut for n=18, the exponents can be up to 10^17, which is a very big number, but Python can handle big integers.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the problem is that for the DP function, the code uses the A string. However, in Python, the function dp is inside the code, and the A is a global variable. However, in the code, the A is read from stdin, and the function dp uses it. But when using memoization with lru_cache, the function must be pure, i.e., not depend on any external variables. Wait, but in the code, the function dp is using the variable A, which is read from the input. However, in Python, the function dp is nested inside the code that reads A, so it's possible.\n\nBut in the code, the function dp is written as a separate function, and A is a global variable. However, in the code, during the processing of different test cases (but in this problem, there is only one test case per run), the code reads the input once, and then processes it.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the code is supposed to read from stdin and output to stdout. So, the code would read the input once, and then compute the DP and path.\n\nBut in Python, functions decorated with lru_cache can't have mutable parameters, but here, the parameters are h and m, which are integers. So the code should work.\n\nBut in the code, the function dp uses the variable A, which is read from the input. However, the function dp is defined in the same scope as A. So this should be okay.\n\nBut let's think about the code structure. For example:\n\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h + m == 2 * n:\n        return 0\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n    max_sum = 0\n    if h < n:\n        contribution = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - h - 1))\n        sum_h = contribution + dp(h + 1, m)\n        if sum_h > max_sum:\n            max_sum = sum_h\n    if m < n:\n        contribution = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - m - 1))\n        sum_m = contribution + dp(h, m + 1)\n        if sum_m > max_sum:\n            max_sum = sum_m\n    return max_sum\n\nBut this code would work as long as the function dp is called after A is defined. Which it is.\n\nBut what about the case when the same code is run for multiple test cases? Well, in this problem, the code is supposed to process one test case. So for each run, the code reads the input once, and processes it.\n\nNow, the code for the path reconstruction.\n\nOnce the dp is computed, the code can generate the path as discussed.\n\nBut the code may have an issue with the order of the digits. Let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: n=2, A=1234.\n\nThe code would generate the path as follows:\n\nInitially h=0, m=0.\n\ncurrent_digit is 1.\n\nval_h = 1 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 1 * 10^1 = 10 + dp(1, 0) = 10 + 36 = 46.\n\nval_m = 1 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 10 + dp(0, 1) = 10 + 36 = 46.\n\nSo val_h >= val_m is True, so append 'H', h becomes 1.\n\nNow, h=1, m=0.\n\ncurrent_digit is A[1] = 2.\n\nh < 2 and m < 2.\n\nval_h: 2 * 10^(2 -1 -1) = 2 * 10^0 = 2 + dp(2, 0) = 2 + 34 = 36.\n\nval_m: 2 * 10^(2 -0 -1) = 2 * 10^1 = 20 + dp(1, 1) = 20 + 7 = 27.\n\nSo choose H, append 'H', h becomes 2.\n\nNow, h=2, m=0. Next, since h is already n=2, only M can be chosen.\n\ncurrent_digit is A[2] = 3.\n\nAppend 'M', m becomes 1.\n\nNow, h=2, m=1. current_digit is A[3] = 4.\n\nAppend 'M', m becomes 2. Done.\n\nResult is 'HHMM', which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nn=2, A=9911.\n\nOutput is 'HMHM'.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe digits are 9,9,1,1.\n\nThe optimal sequence is HMHM.\n\nLet's see:\n\nH takes 9 (first digit) → contributes 9 * 10^1 = 90.\n\nThen M takes 9 → contributes 9 * 10^1 = 90.\n\nThen H takes 1 → contributes 1 * 10^0 = 1.\n\nThen M takes 1 → contributes 1 * 10^0 = 1.\n\nTotal sum is 90 +90 +1 +1 = 182.\n\nAlternative sequences:\n\nIf the sequence is HHHM (invalid, since H can take only 2 steps). So the correct sequence is HMHM.\n\nBut how does the code choose this?\n\nLet me think.\n\nAt (0,0), current digit is 9.\n\nval_h = 9 * 10^(2-0-1) = 9 *10^1=90 + dp(1,0).\n\nval_m = 9 * 10^(2-0-1)=90 + dp(0,1).\n\nWhich is better?\n\nWe need to compute dp(1,0) and dp(0,1).\n\nBut perhaps in this case, choosing H first gives a better overall sum.\n\nBut during the code's path reconstruction, if the options are equal, the code would choose H.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps choosing H first gives a better sum.\n\nBut regardless, the code should find the maximum sum.\n\nBut regardless, the code would generate the correct path.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, handling the input and output correctly.\n\nBut there's one thing to note: in the code, the function dp is called recursively, and the memoization is handled via lru_cache. However, in Python, the lru_cache decorator may not work properly if the function is inside another function, but in this case, the code is written as a script.\n\nBut in the code, the function dp is defined after reading the input, which is okay.\n\nNow, the code for the path reconstruction.\n\nOnce the path is generated, we can join the list into a string and print it.\n\nBut there's one thing: the code for the path reconstruction must be written after the dp function is computed. So the code would be:\n\nOnce the dp is computed, generate the path.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\npath = []\nh, m = 0, 0\nwhile h + m < 2 * n:\n    current_pos = h + m\n    current_digit = A[current_pos]\n    if h < n and m < n:\n        val_h = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n        val_m = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n        if val_h >= val_m:\n            path.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            path.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    elif h < n:\n        path.append('H')\n        h += 1\n    else:\n        path.append('M')\n        m += 1\n\nprint(''.join(path))\n\nBut this code would work.\n\nBut what about the case when h and m are such that one of them is already n?\n\nYes, the code handles that.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, A='12' → possible sequences are HM or MH.\n\nWhich gives sum 1 + 2 = 3 (HM) or 2 + 1 = 3 (MH). Both are same. So the code can choose either. The code would choose H first since val_h >= val_m. Let's see:\n\nAt (0,0), current digit is 1.\n\nval_h = 1 * 10^(1-0-1) = 1 * 10^0 = 1 + dp(1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. Each player takes exactly `n` digits from a given number `A` of length `2n`, and the goal is to find the sequence of moves (either 'H' for Homer or 'M' for Marge) that results in the highest possible sum of their respective numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a recursive DP approach with memoization to efficiently compute the maximum possible sum from each state. The state is defined by the number of digits each player has taken so far (Homer's count `h` and Marge's count `m`).\n\n2. **Recursive State Transition**: For each state `(h, m)`, we consider both possible moves (Homer taking the next digit or Marge taking the next digit) and recursively compute the maximum sum achievable from those subsequent states.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves by comparing the potential sums from each possible move at each step and choosing the one that leads to the maximum total sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n        current_digit = A[h + m]\n        max_sum = 0\n        if h < n:\n            contribution = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - h - 1))\n            sum_h = contribution + dp(h + 1, m)\n            if sum_h > max_sum:\n                max_sum = sum_h\n        if m < n:\n            contribution = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - m - 1))\n            sum_m = contribution + dp(h, m + 1)\n            if sum_m > max_sum:\n                max_sum = sum_m\n        return max_sum\n\n    path = []\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = A[current_pos]\n        if h < n and m < n:\n            val_h = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n            val_m = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n            if val_h >= val_m:\n                path.append('H')\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                path.append('M')\n                m += 1\n        elif h < n:\n            path.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            path.append('M')\n            m += 1\n\n    print(''.join(path))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of length `2n`. These are read from standard input.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function uses memoization to store results of subproblems. It calculates the maximum possible sum from the current state `(h, m)` by considering both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit).\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the path by iterating through each possible move, comparing the potential sums from each move, and selecting the one that contributes to the maximum total sum. This ensures that we get the optimal sequence of moves.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal sequence using dynamic programming and memoization, ensuring that we handle up to the maximum constraints effectively.",
