He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, Polycarp has n problems, each with a difficulty. He wants to practice for exactly k days. Each day he solves some consecutive problems starting from the beginning. So, the first day he solves some number of problems, then the next day starts where the previous left off, and so on until all are done. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The total profit is the sum of these daily profits. My task is to find the maximum possible total profit and the way to split the problems into days to achieve that.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the constraints: n and k can be up to 2000. So O(n^2) algorithms might be acceptable, but anything higher like O(n^3) would probably not work.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Because the problem requires splitting the array into k segments, and each segment contributes its maximum value. So the problem is similar to partitioning the array into k parts, each part being a contiguous segment, and the sum of maxima of each part is maximized.\n\nDynamic programming seems promising here. Let's think about the state.\n\nLet dp[i][j] be the maximum total profit for the first i problems divided into j days. Then, the transition would be: for each possible m < i, we can split the first m problems into j-1 days, and then take the max of the problems from m+1 to i as the j-th day's profit. So:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) ) for all m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently? For each i and j, and for each possible m, we need to calculate the max between m+1 and i. If we compute this naively, it would be O(n^3), which for n=2000 is 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a way to compute these maxima quickly. Maybe precompute a 2D array max_range where max_range[i][j] is the maximum of a[i...j]. Then, for any m and i, the max from m+1 to i can be retrieved in O(1) time.\n\nYes, precomputing max_range would help. How to precompute it? For each i, we can compute the maximums for all j >= i. For example, for each i, iterate j from i to n-1, and keep track of the current maximum. That would take O(n^2) time and space, which is acceptable since n is 2000. 2000^2 is 4 million, manageable.\n\nOnce we have that, the DP transitions can be done in O(n^2) time. Let's see:\n\nThe DP table is of size (n+1) x (k+1). For each i from 1 to n, and for each j from 1 to k. For each j, we need to look back at all possible m (from j-1 to i-1) and compute dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i].\n\nBut even with that, for n=2000 and k=2000, the total operations would be O(n^2 *k). Wait, no. For each i and j, the inner loop is O(i) steps. So overall, the time complexity would be O(n^2 * k). But if n and k are both 2000, that would be 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. Which is way too big. That's impossible to compute in time.\n\nWait, but the constraints say that k can be up to n. So for n=2000, this approach is not feasible. So there must be a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP transitions. Let's think again.\n\nAnother observation: since the days are in order, and each day must take a consecutive block starting from the previous end. So for the DP state, when considering the j-th day, the split points are determined by previous splits.\n\nBut even with that, the O(n^2k) time is too slow. So what can be done?\n\nWait, but maybe for the given constraints, even O(n^2k) is acceptable? Let's check. For n=2000 and k=2000, 2000^3 is 8e10 operations. That's way beyond what can be handled in Python in reasonable time. So we need a better idea.\n\nAlternative approach: since the problem requires splitting into exactly k days, and each day must take at least one problem, perhaps the optimal strategy is to split the array into k parts, each of which contributes their maximum. Since the maximums are additive, perhaps we can find a way to select k-1 split points such that the sum of maxima is maximized.\n\nBut how to find those splits?\n\nAnother thought: the maximum sum will include the maximum elements of the array. For example, in the sample input, the maximum elements are 9 and 6 and 5. But in the optimal split, the maximums are 5,6,9. So the 5 is included as the first day's max, which is the first three elements. But the maximum of the entire array is 9, which is taken as the third day's max. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to take the largest elements as separate days, but how?\n\nBut how to model that. It's unclear.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach. Let's think about the constraints again. For example, if k is small, like 1, then the answer is the maximum of the entire array. For k= n, each day has exactly one problem, so the sum is the sum of all elements.\n\nBut for the general case, perhaps we can find a way to optimize the DP transitions.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence again. For dp[i][j], the maximum sum for the first i elements split into j days. To compute this, we can consider that the j-th day ends at i, and starts at some position m+1, where m ranges from j-1 to i-1 (since each day must have at least one problem). So for each j, the transitions for dp[i][j] depend on the previous dp[m][j-1] plus the max from m+1 to i.\n\nNow, the question is, can we compute this more efficiently than O(n^2k)?\n\nAnother idea: for each j, when computing dp[i][j], we can keep track of the maximum value of dp[m][j-1] + max(m+1, i) for varying m. But how?\n\nBut the max(m+1, i) is the maximum of the subarray from m+1 to i. So for a fixed i and j, and varying m, how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the max_range. Suppose I precompute the max_range as before. Then for each i and j, for each possible m, the term is dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m+1][i].\n\nBut how can I find the maximum of these terms quickly?\n\nAnother idea: for each j, when processing i, can we find for each m, the best way to split?\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed j and i, when we want to compute dp[i][j], we can think of it as taking the maximum over m in [j-1, i-1] of (dp[m][j-1] + max from m+1 to i).\n\nBut for each i and j, the max from m+1 to i can be computed as follows: as m decreases from i-1 to j-1, the max_range[m+1][i] can be maintained incrementally.\n\nWait, for example, when m is i-1, the range is [i] (since m+1 is i), which is a[i]. When m decreases to i-2, the range is [i-1, i], and the max is max(a[i-1], a[i]). And so on. So, for a fixed i and j, when m ranges from (i-1) down to (j-1), the max_range[m+1][i] can be tracked as we move m from right to left.\n\nSo, perhaps for each i and j, we can compute the max_range[m+1][i] as we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, and keep track of the current maximum. Then, for each m, we can compute the value dp[m][j-1] + current_max, and track the maximum of these values.\n\nThis way, for each i and j, the inner loop (for m) can be done in O(n) time, and the max_range can be computed incrementally. Let's think:\n\nFor example, when processing dp[i][j], for each possible m (the end of the j-1-th day), we can compute the max from m+1 to i. Let's process m from i-1 down to j-1. For each step, the range [m+1, i] is extended to the left by one element (since m decreases by 1). So, the current maximum can be updated as the max between a[m+1] and the previous maximum. Wait, no. Because when m decreases by 1, the new range is [m+1, i] = [ (m_prev - 1) +1, i ] = [m_prev, i]. So the previous range was [m_prev + 1, i], and now adding a[m_prev] to the left. So the new maximum is max( a[m_prev], previous_max ). So, yes, we can track this.\n\nSo for each i and j, we can do:\n\ncurrent_max = 0\n\nfor m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n\n    current_max = max(current_max, a[m])\n\n    dp[i][j] = max( dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max )\n\nWait, but the current_max is the max from m+1 to i? Or from m to i?\n\nWait, let's think. When m is i-1, the range is m+1 to i is i to i, which is a[i]. So current_max is a[i]. Then, when m decreases by 1, the new m is i-2. Now, the range is m+1 to i = i-1 to i. The max is max( a[i-1], current_max (which was a[i]) ). So yes, the current_max is updated as the maximum between the new element (a[m+1] ?) and the previous current_max.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when m is i-1, the range is m+1 to i is i to i. So the new element is a[i].\n\nThen, when m decreases by 1 (to m = i-2), the range is m+1 to i is i-1 to i. So the new element added to the left is a[i-1]. So the current_max becomes max( a[i-1], previous current_max (a[i]) )\n\nSo, the current_max is the max of the elements from (m+1) to i. As m decreases, the range expands to the left by one element. So for each m, the current_max is the max of a[m+1 ... i].\n\nTherefore, during the iteration, for each m, we can compute current_max as the maximum of a[m+1 ... i], and then compute dp[m][j-1] + current_max. Then, dp[i][j] is the maximum of these values across all m.\n\nThis way, for each i and j, the inner loop runs O(n) times, but the max is computed incrementally. This reduces the time complexity.\n\nSo, the overall time complexity would be O(n^2 *k) in the worst case. But with the optimization of tracking the current_max, each inner loop is O(n) instead of O(n) with O(1) per step. So same time complexity, but with a lower constant factor.\n\nBut for n=2000 and k=2000, this would be 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow for Python. So this approach is not feasible for the worst case.\n\nBut perhaps the constraints are not that tight. Let's think again. What is the maximum possible value for k? Since k can be up to n. But for example, when k is equal to n, the answer is the sum of all elements. So for that case, the DP approach would be O(n^2 *n) = O(n^3), which is 8e9 for n=2000. That's way too slow.\n\nSo there must be another approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative idea: since the problem requires splitting into exactly k days, and each day must take at least one problem, perhaps the optimal way is to split the array into k segments where each segment's maximum is as large as possible. However, how to balance between taking larger maxima and the number of splits.\n\nAnother thought: since the sum is the sum of maxima of the segments, and each segment is a consecutive part of the array. The maximum of a segment is at least as large as the maximum of any of its subsegments. Therefore, if we have two segments, combining them into one segment would replace their maxima with the maximum of the combined segment. If that maximum is larger than the sum of the two individual maxima, then it's worse. Otherwise, it's better. But since we have to split into exactly k segments, perhaps the optimal way is to split the array in such a way that we have as many high-value maxima as possible.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each day, the profit is the maximum of that day's segment. So, if we have to split into k days, the maximum possible sum is the sum of the k largest elements in the array, but only if they can be arranged as separate segments. But that's not necessarily true because the elements may not be in positions that allow them to be in separate segments. For example, if the array is [5, 1, 5], and k=2, the maximum sum is 5 +5 =10, which is achieved by splitting [5,1] and [5], or [5] and [1,5]. But if the array is [5, 1, 5, 1, 5], and k=3, the maximum sum would be 5+5+5=15.\n\nBut in general, the problem is to select k-1 split points such that the sum of the maxima of the k segments is maximized.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be modeled as selecting k-1 split points, and for each split, the sum is the sum of the maxima of each segment. But how to compute that optimally.\n\nBut how to model that. Maybe the DP approach is still the way to go, but with optimizations.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach. Let's try to find the time complexity for the DP approach with the optimized inner loop.\n\nFor each j from 1 to k:\n\n   for each i from j to n:\n\n       compute dp[i][j] as the maximum over m from j-1 to i-1 of dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])\n\nSo, for j=1, the only possible split is the entire array. So dp[i][1] = max(a[1..i]).\n\nFor j=2, we have to split into two parts. For each i, we can split at m, where m ranges from 1 to i-1. Then dp[i][2] = max( dp[m][1] + max(a[m+1..i] )).\n\nBut with the optimized inner loop, for each i and j, the inner loop for m is O(i) steps, but with the incremental max calculation.\n\nSo the total time is O(n^2 *k). But for n=2000 and k=2000, that's 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, for the given constraints, the code can be optimized enough. Let's think about the actual values of n and k. For example, if k is small, like up to 100, then O(n^2 *k) is 2000^2 * 100 = 4e8 * 100 = 4e10? No, 2000^2 is 4 million, multiplied by 100 gives 400 million operations. Which is manageable in C++ but perhaps not in Python. But for Python, even 1e8 operations can be too slow.\n\nSo this suggests that for the worst case, the DP approach may not be feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: find that for j, the number of days, the optimal way to split is to take the maximum of the first i elements, and then split the rest. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: since each day's profit is the maximum of the segment, the optimal way to split into k days would be to take the k-1 largest elements and split the array such that each of them is in a separate segment. However, this is not always possible. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 2, 4], and k=2. The two largest elements are 4 and 3. But if you split into [1,3] and [2,4], the sum is 3+4=7. If you split into [1,3,2] and [4], sum is 3+4=7. Alternatively, [1], [3,2,4], sum is 1+4=5. So the best is 7. So in this case, the two largest elements are in different segments. So the idea is that the sum of the top k elements may be the maximum possible, but only if they can be placed in separate segments. However, how to ensure that.\n\nBut how to find the maximum sum in that case. Maybe this suggests that we should take the k-1 largest elements and split the array so that each of them is in their own segment. But how to do that.\n\nBut perhaps this line of thinking isn't leading me anywhere.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach. Perhaps for the given problem, the constraints are manageable. Let's think about the maximum possible time.\n\nIf n is 2000 and k is 2000, then for j from 1 to k, and for each i from j to n, the inner loop for m is O(i) steps. So for j=2000, i can be 2000, and m ranges from 1999 to 1999 (since j-1 is 1999, i-1 is 1999). So that's one step. For j=2000, all the i's are 2000. So the total steps for j=2000 is O(1).\n\nBut for j=1, i ranges from 1 to 2000. For each i, the inner loop runs from 0 to i-1. Wait, for j=1, the m ranges from 0 to i-1. But since j=1, the previous j-1 is 0. But for dp[m][0], which is invalid. Wait, the initial conditions for the DP are important.\n\nLet me think again about the DP definition. The DP[i][j] represents the maximum profit for the first i problems split into j days. So for j=1, the only way is to take all i problems as one day. So dp[i][1] = max(a[0..i-1]).\n\nFor j=2, the first day can be split into m problems (m ranges from 1 to i-1), and the second day takes the remaining i -m problems. So dp[i][2] = max over m in 1..i-1 of (dp[m][1] + max(a[m..i-1])).\n\nSo for the DP initialization, dp[0][0] = 0? Maybe. Let's adjust indices to make it easier. Let me think of the array as 0-based.\n\nLet me redefine the DP as follows:\n\ndp[i][j] = maximum profit for the first i problems (a[0..i-1]) divided into j days.\n\nThen, for the base case:\n\ndp[0][0] = 0.\n\nFor j=1, dp[i][1] = max of a[0..i-1].\n\nFor j>1, dp[i][j] = max over m from j-1 to i-1 of dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m..i-1]).\n\nBecause for j days, the first j-1 days must cover m problems, and the j-th day covers i -m problems. Since each day must have at least one problem, m must be >= j-1 (because j-1 days require at least j-1 problems), and i -m >= 1 → m <= i-1.\n\nSo for each i and j, the m ranges from j-1 to i-1.\n\nSo, for the DP, the initial state is dp[0][0] = 0. Then for j=1, we can compute dp[i][1] for all i from 1 to n.\n\nNow, the key is to compute this DP efficiently.\n\nNow, the problem is that for n=2000 and k=2000, the time is O(n^2k). Which is O(2000^3) = 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nSo, how can we optimize this further?\n\nAlternative idea: since the maximum value of k is n, but for j > i, dp[i][j] is impossible. So for j > i, we can ignore those states. So for each j, we process i >= j.\n\nBut that doesn't change the time complexity.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each j, the value of dp[i][j] depends on dp[m][j-1], which for j-1 is already computed. So, for j from 1 to k:\n\n   for i from j to n:\n\n      compute dp[i][j] based on previous values.\n\nBut again, this is the same as before.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each j, when computing dp[i][j], the max_range[m][i] can be precomputed. But that's already considered.\n\nAlternative Idea: Notice that when j increases, the number of splits increases. But perhaps there's a way to find that for certain j's, the transitions can be optimized.\n\nAnother Idea: Since for each j, the maximum for dp[i][j] is determined by the best split into j-1 days and then one more day. Maybe we can find that for certain ranges, the best split is to take the last day as a single element. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For each day, the profit is the maximum of that day's segment. So, for the first day, the maximum is the maximum of the first segment, and so on. The total sum is the sum of these maxima.\n\nBut since the segments are contiguous and non-overlapping, and cover the entire array, the problem is similar to selecting k-1 split points to maximize the sum of maxima of the resulting segments.\n\nNow, here's an observation: For any split into k segments, the sum of the maxima is at least the maximum of the entire array. Because the maximum of the entire array is included in one of the segments. But how does that help?\n\nAnother observation: The maximum sum is achieved when we have as many of the largest elements as possible as separate segments. For example, if there are k elements in the array that are larger than all others, then the optimal is to split so that each of them is in its own segment. But how to find such splits.\n\nBut again, how to translate this into an algorithm.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem as selecting k-1 positions to split the array into k parts. Each split adds the maximum of the current segment. So, the problem is similar to choosing k-1 splits to maximize the sum of the maxima of the resulting segments.\n\nNow, for the first split, suppose we choose to split after m elements. Then, the first segment's max is max(a[0..m-1]), and the rest of the array is split into k-1 segments. But this seems recursive, which brings us back to the DP approach.\n\nSo, the DP approach seems unavoidable. But how to make it efficient enough for Python.\n\nLet me think about the actual numbers. For n=2000 and k=2000, the DP approach would have O(k*n) = O(2000*2000) = 4 million states. For each state, the inner loop is O(i) steps. But for j=2000, i can be 2000, and m ranges from j-1 = 1999 to i-1=1999. So only 1 step. For j=2000, the total steps are O(n) steps. For j=1, the steps are O(n^2) steps. For j=2, O(n^2) steps. So the total number of operations is O(n^2 *k) = O(2000^2 *2000) = 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nBut perhaps the problem has some constraints that allow for a smarter approach. For example, when k is large, like close to n, the optimal solution is to split into individual elements, except for some cases where combining two adjacent elements gives a higher sum. But for example, when k =n, the answer is the sum of all elements, since each day has one problem. So for k=n, the answer is sum(a).\n\nSimilarly, for k =n-1, the answer is sum(a) - min(a) + max(a). Wait, no. Because for k =n-1, we have to split into n-1 days. That means exactly one day has two problems, and the rest have one. The maximum for that day is the maximum of the two elements. So the total profit is sum of all elements except the two elements, plus the maximum of those two. Which is sum(a) - (a_i + a_j) + max(a_i, a_j) = sum(a) - min(a_i, a_j). To maximize this, we need to choose the two elements with the smallest min. Which would be the two smallest elements. So the total profit is sum(a) - min(a_i, a_j) = sum(a) - min_element.\n\nBut this is just for k =n-1. But how to generalize this.\n\nBut this suggests that for larger k, the optimal solution is to take as many of the largest elements as possible as individual segments. So, for example, if we have k=3, and the array contains three elements with very high values, we can split the array such that each of them is in its own segment.\n\nBut how to find this in code.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the maximum sum is the sum of the top k elements in the array, provided that they can be separated into different segments. Otherwise, it's less. But how to determine that.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nLet me think of the sample input. The array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]. The top 3 elements are 9,6,5. And indeed, the optimal solution uses those as the maxima. So the sum is 9+6+5=20. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: the third sample input is [1,2000,2000,2], with k=2. The top two elements are 2000 and 2000. The optimal split is [1,2000] and [2000,2], giving sum 2000 + 2000 = 4000.\n\nSo the idea is that the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements, provided that they can be placed in separate segments. But how to verify that.\n\nBut how to find the k largest elements and ensure that they are in separate segments. For example, if the array is [5, 1, 5, 1, 5], and k=3. The top three elements are 5,5,5. They can be placed in separate segments. So the optimal sum is 5+5+5=15.\n\nBut if the array is [5, 5, 5], and k=3, then the sum is 5+5+5=15. Which is correct.\n\nBut if the array is [5, 5, 5, 1], and k=3. We need to split into three segments. The best way is to split into [5], [5], [5,1], giving sum 5+5+5=15. Or [5,5], [5], [1], sum 5+5+1=11. So the best is to have the three 5s as separate segments.\n\nSo this supports the idea that the sum of the k largest elements is the maximum possible.\n\nBut what if the array is [3, 1, 2, 4], and k=2. The top two elements are 4 and 3. Can they be split into separate segments? Yes: [3,1,2], [4] → sum 3 +4=7. Or [3], [1,2,4] → sum 3 +4=7. Or [3,1], [2,4] → sum 3+4=7. So the sum is 7, which is the sum of the two largest elements.\n\nAnother example: array [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], k=3. The top three elements are 5,4,3. Can we split into three segments? Yes: [3], [1,4], [1,5]. Sum is 3 +4 +5=12. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and k=3. The top three elements are 5,4,3. Can they be in separate segments? Yes: [5], [4], [3,2,1]. Sum is 5+4+3=12.\n\nSo in all these examples, the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements.\n\nBut is this always true? Let's think of a counterexample.\n\nSuppose the array is [5, 1, 1, 1, 5], and k=2. The two largest elements are 5 and 5. Split into [5,1,1,1,5] (sum 5) or [5], [1,1,1,5] (sum 5+5=10), or [5,1,1,1], [5] (sum 5+5=10). So the maximum sum is 10, which is the sum of the two largest elements.\n\nAnother example: [5, 3, 4, 2, 5], k=2. The two largest elements are 5 and 5. Split into [5,3,4,2,5] → sum 5. Or [5], [3,4,2,5] → sum 5+5=10. Or [5,3,4], [2,5] → sum 5+5=10. So again, the sum of the two largest elements.\n\nAnother example: [5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 5], k=2. The two largest elements are 6 and 5. But if we split into [5,6,3,4,2], [5], sum is 6+5=11. Or [5,6], [3,4,2,5] → sum 6+5=11. Or [5,6,3,4,2,5] → sum 6. So the maximum is 11, which is the sum of the two largest elements.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6], k=2. The two largest elements are 6 and 5. If we split into [5,4,3,2,1,6], sum is 6. Or [5,4,3,2,1], [6] → sum 5+6=11. Which is the sum of the two largest elements.\n\nSo this seems to hold. But why?\n\nBecause whenever we can split the array into k segments, each containing one of the k largest elements, then the sum will be the sum of those elements. And since any other split would have at least one segment whose maximum is not among the top k elements, which would be smaller than the sum of the top k elements.\n\nBut how to prove this.\n\nAssume that there exists a way to split into k segments, each containing one of the top k elements. Then the sum of their maxima would be the sum of the top k elements. Any other split would have at least one segment with a maximum that is not among the top k elements. Hence, the sum would be less than or equal to the sum of the top k elements.\n\nBut how to ensure that such a split exists. Well, the top k elements can be in the array in any positions. However, since the segments are contiguous and must be in order, it's possible that some of the top k elements are adjacent, making it impossible to split them into separate segments. For example, if the array is [5, 5, 5], and k=2. The top two elements are 5 and 5. We can split into [5], [5,5], sum 5+5=10. Or [5,5], [5], sum 5+5=10. So it works. Another example: [5, 5, 1, 5], k=3. The top three elements are 5,5,5. Split into [5], [5], [1,5] → sum 5+5+5=15. So it's possible.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 1, 5, 1, 5], and k=3. We can split into [5], [1,5], [1,5] → sum 5+5+5=15. So it's possible.\n\nSo, it seems that no matter how the top k elements are distributed, we can split the array into k segments such that each of the top k elements is in a separate segment. Hence, the maximum sum is the sum of the top k elements.\n\nWait, but this is not always the case. Let's think of a scenario where the top k elements are not in positions that allow them to be split into separate segments.\n\nExample: array [5, 4, 5, 4, 5], k=3. The top 3 elements are 5,5,5. We can split into [5], [4,5], [4,5] → sum 5+5+5=15. So it works.\n\nAnother example: array [5, 5, 5], k=3. Split into [5], [5], [5] → sum 15.\n\nWhat about array [5, 5, 5, 5], k=3. Split into [5], [5], [5,5] → sum 5+5+5=15.\n\nAnother example: array [5, 5, 5, 1], k=3. Split into [5], [5], [5,1] → sum 5+5+5=15.\n\nSo it seems that regardless of the positions of the top k elements, it is possible to split the array into k segments such that each segment contains at least one of the top k elements. Thus, the sum of the maxima would be the sum of the top k elements.\n\nBut how to prove this. Well, the top k elements are in the array. Let's assume that the array has at least k elements. Since we have to split into k segments, each of which must contain at least one element. We can choose to split the array such that each segment contains one of the top k elements. For example, for each of the top k elements, we can ensure that it is in its own segment. This can be done by placing the split points between the top elements. For example, if the top elements are in positions i_1, i_2, ..., i_k, then we can split the array such that each segment contains one of these elements.\n\nBut how to ensure that this is possible. For example, if the top elements are all in the first few positions. Like array [5,5,5,1,1,1], and k=3. Split into [5], [5], [5,1,1,1]. Sum is 5+5+5=15.\n\nBut what if the top elements are not in the first positions. For example, array [1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5], k=3. Split into [1,5], [1,5], [1,5]. Sum is 5+5+5=15.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that the maximum possible total profit is the sum of the k largest elements in the array. And the way to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving problems over exactly `k` days. Each day, he solves a contiguous sequence of problems starting from the beginning of the list. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day, and the total profit is the sum of these daily profits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Preprocessing**: \n   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum profit achievable for the first `i` problems divided into `j` days.\n   - Precompute the maximum values for all subarrays to efficiently calculate the profit for any segment during the DP transitions.\n   - Optimize the DP transitions by maintaining a running maximum as we iterate through possible splits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute max_range[i][j] = max(a[i..j])\n    max_range = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_max = a[i]\n        max_range[i][i] = current_max\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            current_max = max(current_max, a[j])\n            max_range[i][j] = current_max\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    # Also, we need to track the split points for reconstructing the answer\n    prev = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    # Base case: j=1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][1] = max_range[0][i-1]\n    \n    for j in range(2, k+1):\n        for i in range(j, n+1):\n            current_max = 0\n            # m ranges from j-1 to i-1 (in terms of number of problems)\n            # which corresponds to indices from m = j-1 to i-1\n            # So in terms of array indices, m+1 is the start of the j-th day\n            # So for m from i-1 down to j-1\n            for m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n                current_max = max(current_max, a[m])\n                if dp[m][j-1] + current_max > dp[i][j]:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[m][j-1] + current_max\n                    prev[i][j] = m\n    \n    # Now reconstruct the answer\n    result = []\n    current_i = n\n    current_j = k\n    while current_j > 1:\n        m = prev[current_i][current_j]\n        result.append(current_i - m)\n        current_i = m\n        current_j -= 1\n    result.append(current_i)  # the first day's length\n    result.reverse()\n    \n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximum Values**: We use a 2D array `max_range` to store the maximum value for every subarray. This allows us to quickly determine the maximum difficulty of any segment during the DP transitions.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: The DP table `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum profit for the first `i` problems split into `j` days. We initialize the base case where `j=1` (only one day) by taking the maximum of the entire subarray.\n3. **DP Transitions**: For each possible number of days `j` from 2 to `k`, and each possible number of problems `i` from `j` to `n`, we compute the optimal way to split the problems by considering all possible previous splits and using the precomputed maximum values.\n4. **Reconstructing the Answer**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact split points, which are stored in the `prev` array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible profit while adhering to the constraints of contiguous problem solving over exactly `k` days.",
