Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So, the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time. So I need a smarter way.\n\nHmm. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for items of weight 1: I should take as many as possible with the highest cost. Similarly for weight 2 and 3. But since combining different weights might give better results, I need to find an optimal way to combine them.\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have sorted all items by their cost per unit weight. Wait, but since each item is a single unit, maybe for each weight, we can sort them in descending order of cost and take as many as possible.\n\nBut how to combine different weights?\n\nFor example, if I have a weight capacity of m, which is say 5. Suppose there are items with weight 3 and 2. Which combination is better? Maybe taking one 3 and one 2 (total weight 5) or two 2s (if they have higher total cost).\n\nSo the problem is to decide for each possible combination of counts of items with weights 1, 2, 3, such that their total weight is <= m, and the sum of costs is maximum.\n\nBut considering all possibilities directly would be too slow. So perhaps I can process each weight group and then find the optimal combination.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nLet's separate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n\nFor each group, sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, compute the prefix sums. For example, for weight 1, the prefix sum array will tell me the maximum cost if I take k items of weight 1.\n\nOnce I have these prefix sums, I can try all possible combinations of how many items of weight 1, 2, and 3 to take, such that their total weight is <= m.\n\nBut even that seems computationally heavy. Because for each possible number of weight 3 items, I could have a lot of possibilities. However, since the maximum m is 3e5, and the weight for 3 is 3, the number of possible 3 items is up to m//3, which is 1e5. But combining with the other weights might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: For each possible number of weight 3 items taken, say k, then compute the remaining weight, and then solve the problem for the remaining weight using the weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nWait, but even that might not be feasible for large m. Let me think.\n\nBut for each weight 3 item, the maximum number of items is up to m//3. Let's say m is 3e5. Then m//3 is 1e5. So for each possible k (number of weight 3 items), we can do some processing. But how?\n\nBut perhaps for each k (from 0 to max possible), we can compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fit into the remaining weight.\n\nBut how to compute that quickly?\n\nLet me think about the weight 1 and 2 case. Suppose I have a certain capacity left, say rem. How can I choose the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nThis is similar to the classic knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2. But since the items are sorted and we have prefix sums, perhaps we can find the optimal combination for any given capacity.\n\nLet me think: For weight 1 and 2, suppose I have sorted lists. For weight 1, the prefix sum is s1[i] = sum of first i items. For weight 2, the prefix sum is s2[j] = sum of first j items. Now, for a given rem, how can I find the maximum value of s1[a] + s2[b], such that a*1 + b*2 ≤ rem.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to iterate over the number of weight 2 items taken, and compute how many weight 1 items can be taken with the remaining capacity.\n\nBut again, for each possible rem, this might take O(rem) time, which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the weight 1 and 2 case, we can precompute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value. However, since m can be up to 3e5, and n can be up to 1e5, this might be manageable.\n\nWait, but if I can precompute for weight 1 and 2, then for each possible remaining capacity after taking some weight 3 items, I can use that precomputed array to get the maximum value.\n\nBut how to precompute for weight 1 and 2?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider all the items of weight 1 and 2. For each, sorted in descending order of cost. Then, for the weight 1 items, we can take as many as possible. For the weight 2 items, same. But when combining, we need to find the optimal mix.\n\nBut here's an idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value. However, since the number of items can be up to 1e5, and m is 3e5, this would be O(m) time.\n\nWait, but how to compute that? Let me think about the following approach:\n\nWe can use a dynamic programming approach where dp[i] represents the maximum value achievable with capacity i. But for weight 1 and 2 items, the DP would be O(m) time. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can optimize this.\n\nWait, but the problem is that for weight 1 and 2 items, each item can be taken once. So the standard unbounded knapsack is not applicable here. Oh right, each item is unique, so it's 0-1 knapsack. However, with n up to 1e5, a standard O(nm) approach is not feasible.\n\nBut wait, the weight of each item is either 1 or 2. So maybe we can find an optimized way.\n\nLet me think again. Let's suppose that we have sorted the weight 1 items in descending order of cost. Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\nLet's say we have x weight 1 items and y weight 2 items. The maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is min(x, rem). Similarly for weight 2.\n\nBut to find the optimal combination between weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can iterate through all possible numbers of weight 2 items taken, and for each, take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nSuppose the remaining capacity is rem. For each possible number of weight 2 items (say j), which can be from 0 to min(y, rem//2), then the remaining capacity is rem - 2*j. Then take as many weight 1 items as possible (up to min(x, rem - 2*j)). The total cost would be s2[j] + s1[ min(x, rem - 2*j) ].\n\nThe maximum over all possible j would be the answer for this rem.\n\nBut how efficient is this?\n\nFor each rem, the number of possible j is up to min(y, rem//2). If rem is up to 3e5, and for each rem, this is O(rem) steps, then this approach would be O(m^2) which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute this more efficiently. Let's think about the maximum j for a given rem. Let me note that the number of weight 2 items we can take is up to min(y, rem//2). So for a given rem, the maximum j is up to rem//2.\n\nBut if the number of weight 2 items is small (like up to 1e5), then for each rem, the number of j's is O(rem//2), which could be up to 1.5e5. But if we have to do this for every possible rem (up to 3e5), then the total time would be O(3e5 * 1.5e5) which is 4.5e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible. So we need another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weight 1 and 2 items can be processed optimally by considering that for any capacity, the optimal selection is to take as many of the highest value items as possible. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's precompute for the weight 1 items, the prefix sums. Similarly for weight 2. Then, for a given rem, the optimal combination is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items. However, since the weight 2 items may be better than some weight 1 items, we need to find the best balance.\n\nBut how to find this balance quickly?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose I have a capacity of rem. Let's say I can take up to k weight 2 items, where k is min( (rem // 2), len(weight2) ). For each possible k, the remaining capacity is rem - 2*k. Then, I can take min( (rem - 2*k), len(weight1) ) items of weight 1. The total cost is s2[k] + s1[ min( (rem - 2*k), len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut the problem is to find the maximum of this expression over all possible k from 0 to min( (rem//2), len(s2) ).\n\nNow, the question is: can we find this maximum efficiently?\n\nIf we can find the optimal k for a given rem quickly, then this approach would work.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, taking more of them may not always be better. For example, if taking one weight 2 item gives a higher value than two weight 1 items. But if taking two weight 2 items would leave less capacity for weight 1 items, etc.\n\nBut perhaps for a given rem, the optimal number of weight 2 items is in the vicinity of (rem//2) and (rem//2 - something). However, trying all possible k in that range might be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for all possible numbers of weight 2 items, and for each possible k, compute the maximum possible s2[k] + s1[ ... ] for all possible rem that can be achieved with that k.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible rem, we can compute the maximum between:\n\n- take as many weight 2 items as possible, and fill the rest with weight 1.\n\nOR\n\n- take one less weight 2 item, and fill the rest with weight 1.\n\nBut this seems like a greedy approach and might not work in all cases.\n\nBut given that the weight 2 items are sorted, perhaps the optimal number of weight 2 items is around (rem//2) and (rem//2 - 1), etc. So for each rem, we can check a few possibilities (like up to 100 possibilities) and find the maximum. This would be O(1) per rem.\n\nBut how to know how many possibilities to check?\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, the optimal number of weight 2 items is either floor((rem)/2) or floor((rem)/2) - 1, or some similar values. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, the best way to fill the remaining space after taking some weight 2 items is to take as many as possible. So for a given k, the maximum number of weight 1 items is min( len(s1), rem - 2k ). So, the total is s2[k] + s1[ min( len(s1), rem - 2k ) ].\n\nBut how to find the optimal k.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for a given rem, the optimal k is between 0 and min(len(s2), rem//2). Let me denote this upper bound as K_max.\n\nNow, since the s2 is a non-decreasing array (since we take the top k items), and s1 is also non-decreasing, but the term (rem - 2k) decreases as k increases. So the function f(k) = s2[k] + s1[ min( (rem - 2k), len(s1) ) ] is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, it's possible that the maximum occurs anywhere between 0 and K_max.\n\nBut trying all possible k for each rem is too slow.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each possible number of weight 2 items, precompute the best possible combination with weight 1 items. Then, for a given rem, the best possible is to take up to K_max weight 2 items and compute accordingly.\n\nBut again, how to do this quickly.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m. Let's think about this:\n\nLet me create a DP array for the weight 1 and 2 items. Let's say dp_w1w2[i] is the maximum value achievable with capacity i using only weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nHow can I compute this?\n\nThe standard 0-1 knapsack approach would be O(nm), but with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, that's 3e10 operations, which is impossible.\n\nBut since the items are split into two groups, weight 1 and weight 2, perhaps we can find a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nLet me think for the weight 1 items. Let's say we have sorted them in descending order. The best way to take them is to take as many as possible. Similarly for the weight 2 items.\n\nSo, for the weight 1 items, the maximum value for capacity i is the sum of the first min(i, len(s1)) items.\n\nSimilarly for the weight 2 items, the maximum value for capacity i is the sum of the first min(i//2, len(s2)) items.\n\nBut combining them is the problem. However, if we can find for each capacity, the optimal combination between taking some weight 1 and some weight 2 items.\n\nBut perhaps for each capacity, we can consider two options:\n\nOption 1: Take as many weight 2 items as possible, then fill the rest with weight 1.\n\nOption 2: Take as many weight 1 items as possible, then fill the rest with weight 2.\n\nBut this might not cover all possibilities, but perhaps gives a good approximation. However, there are cases where a combination of some weight 1 and some weight 2 items could be better.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps the optimal solution for any capacity is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1.\n\nSo, for each capacity i, the maximum value is max over k in 0 to min( i//2, len(s2) ) of (s2[k] + s1[ min( i - 2*k, len(s1) ) ] )\n\nBut again, for each i, computing this max naively would take O(k) time.\n\nBut what if we precompute the s1 and s2 arrays, and then for each i, we can find the optimal k quickly?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each possible i (from 0 to m), we can calculate the best possible k for that i by trying k up to min( i//2, len(s2) ), but only up to a certain number of possibilities, say up to 200 possibilities. Because if the number of weight 2 items is large, but the capacity i is small, then the number of possible k is small.\n\nBut how to decide how many possibilities to check?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, the optimal k for a given i is likely to be in the vicinity of (i//2) and possibly a few values around that. For example, trying k = floor(i/2), floor(i/2) - 1, ..., down to max(0, floor(i/2) - 100), and similarly for ceiling(i/2). But how to choose the number of trials?\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the optimal k can be found by binary search. But I don't see how to apply binary search here.\n\nAnother Idea: For the weight 2 items, since they are sorted, taking more of them may not be better than taking fewer if the remaining capacity allows for more weight 1 items. However, since the weight 1 items are also sorted, taking more weight 1 items can be beneficial.\n\nBut how to find the optimal balance between the two?\n\nLet me think of this as a function of k. For a fixed i, the function f(k) = s2[k] + s1[ min( i - 2k, len_s1 ) ].\n\nWe want to find the maximum value of this function for k in [0, K_max], where K_max is min( len_s2, i//2 )\n\nNow, since s2[k] increases with k, and s1[ ... ] decreases as k increases (since 2k increases, leaving less for the weight 1 items), the function f(k) may have a single peak. If that's the case, then we can perform ternary search on k to find the maximum.\n\nBut is the function unimodal? Let's think. Suppose we increase k by 1. The s2 increases by c2, but the s1 part decreases by some amount. Depending on whether c2 is larger than the loss in s1, the function could increase or decrease.\n\nBut the function may not be strictly unimodal. However, in practice, for the purposes of finding an approximate maximum, we can try ternary search.\n\nAlternatively, given that the number of possible k is up to 1e5, but for each i, trying all possible k is not feasible. However, if we can limit the number of k's we check for each i, then it's possible.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way. Let's think about the following:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection is to take as many of the highest value items as possible. For example, if we have a choice between a weight 2 item with value 5 and two weight 1 items with total value 6, then we take the two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me imagine that we have all the weight 1 and 2 items sorted in descending order of their value per unit weight. But since weight 1 items have a higher per-unit weight than weight 2 items (assuming that the value is comparable), but this depends on the actual values.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting items where for each weight 2 item, it's equivalent to two weight 1 items. But since each weight 2 item is a single item, this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, think of the weight 2 items as being worth twice their value per unit weight. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, we can process them greedily. For example, for a given capacity, we can take the best possible combination by choosing between taking the next best weight 1 or weight 2 item.\n\nBut this sounds like a greedy approach which may not work. For example, taking a weight 2 item now might allow us to take more items later. But greedy approaches often fail in knapsack problems.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps there's a way to find the optimal combination.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each capacity i, the maximum value is the maximum of:\n\n- take the first weight 1 item (if available) and add to the solution for capacity i-1.\n\n- take the first weight 2 item (if available) and add to the solution for capacity i-2.\n\nBut this is the standard 0-1 knapsack recurrence. However, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, this would be O(nm), which is not feasible.\n\nBut wait, the items are split into weight 1 and 2. So perhaps we can process them in a way that takes advantage of their weights.\n\nFor example, for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted, we can take as many as possible. Similarly for weight 2 items. But combining them is tricky.\n\nWait, here's a new Idea: Let's precompute for the weight 1 items the prefix sums s1, and for the weight 2 items the prefix sums s2. Then, for any capacity i, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible k (number of weight 2 items) where 0 ≤ k ≤ min(len(s2), i//2), of s2[k] + s1[ min( i - 2*k, len(s1) ) ].\n\nNow, the key is to compute this maximum for any given i quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's suppose that for the weight 2 items, we have sorted them in descending order. So, for each k, s2[k] is the sum of the first k items. Similarly for s1.\n\nNow, for a given i, the maximum of s2[k] + s1[ i - 2k ] (assuming i - 2k ≥ 0 and that there are enough items in s1).\n\nBut since i can be up to 3e5 and k up to i//2, which can be up to 1.5e5, for each i, checking all k is O(i) time, which would be O(m^2) overall. Not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can find that for each i, the optimal k is either floor(i/2) or floor(i/2) - 1, etc. For example, trying up to 200 possibilities for each i. But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted, for each possible k, the value of s2[k] increases as k increases. However, the value of s1[i-2k] decreases as k increases. So the function f(k) is a trade-off between these two.\n\nBut if the weight 2 items are very valuable compared to weight 1 items, then taking more of them might be better. Otherwise, taking fewer of them and more weight 1 items.\n\nBut without knowing the exact values, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. For the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection is to take all the weight 2 items that are better than two weight 1 items. For example, if a weight 2 item has a value greater than the sum of the two best weight 1 items, then take it. Otherwise, take the two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThis sounds like a greedy approach. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have all weight 1 items sorted in descending order, and all weight 2 items sorted in descending order. We can compare each weight 2 item with the sum of the two best weight 1 items (if available). If the weight 2 item is better, take it and remove those two weight 1 items. Otherwise, take the two weight 1 items.\n\nBut this approach might not work in all cases. For example, if there are multiple weight 2 items that are better than pairs of weight 1 items, but taking some of them may prevent taking others.\n\nHowever, this approach could potentially reduce the problem to a combination of weight 2 items and leftover weight 1 items. But I'm not sure how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, we can merge the weight 1 and 2 items into a single list, sorted by their value per unit weight. But again, not sure.\n\nBut given that the problem has weight up to 3, perhaps there's a way to handle all three weights together.\n\nLet me think again about the original problem. The items have weights 1, 2, or 3. So the idea is to process each group separately and combine them.\n\nLet me think of the following plan:\n\n1. Split the items into three groups: w1, w2, w3.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. For the weight 3 items, try all possible numbers of items taken (k3), from 0 to min( len(w3), m//3 ). For each k3, compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*k3. Then, compute the maximum value from the w1 and w2 items with capacity rem.\n\n5. The overall maximum is the maximum over all k3 of (s3[k3] + max_value_w1w2(rem)).\n\nNow, the problem reduces to how to compute max_value_w1w2(rem) quickly.\n\nSo, the crux of the problem is step 4. How to compute max_value_w1w2(rem) quickly.\n\nIf I can compute that in O(1) or O(log n) time for each rem, then the overall algorithm would be feasible.\n\nLet me think again about the max_value_w1w2(rem) function. How to compute it efficiently.\n\nLet me consider that for any rem, the optimal choice is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items. But how to find that number.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor a given rem, the maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is k_max = min( len(w2), rem // 2 ). Then, for each possible k in [max(0, k_max - 100), k_max], compute the value and take the maximum. The idea is that the optimal k is not too far from k_max. This is a heuristic, but if the number of items is large, then for each rem, checking up to 200 possibilities would be manageable.\n\nBut why would this work? Well, if the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, then taking more weight 2 items may give a better value, but only up to a point. However, if there are many weight 2 items, then the optimal k could be close to k_max. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut given that the time constraints are tight, this might be the only feasible approach.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor each possible k3 (number of weight 3 items taken), compute rem = m - 3*k3.\n\nThen, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for rem by checking k2 from max(0, k_max - 200) to k_max. For each k2, compute the value s2[k2] + s1[ min( rem - 2*k2, len(w1) ) ].\n\nTake the maximum among these possibilities.\n\nBut what if the optimal k2 is outside of this range? For example, if there are very few weight 2 items, then checking from 0 to k_max would be necessary. However, if the number of weight 2 items is large, then checking a window around k_max would suffice.\n\nBut how to choose the window size. For example, 200 is arbitrary. But given that in practice, for most cases, the optimal k2 is near k_max, this might work.\n\nBut how to verify this? Well, perhaps in the worst case, the code would miss some possibilities, leading to incorrect answers. However, given the time constraints, this might be the only way forward.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m the maximum value, using the following approach:\n\nFor each capacity i from 0 to m:\n\n   max_val = 0\n\n   for k2 in 0 to min( i//2, len(w2) ):\n\n       val = s2[k2] + s1[ min( i - 2*k2, len(w1) ) ]\n\n       if val > max_val:\n\n           max_val = val\n\n   dp[i] = max_val\n\nBut for m up to 3e5, and for each i, looping up to i//2 steps, this would be O(m^2), which is way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that for the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, and fill the rest with weight 1 items. However, sometimes, taking one fewer weight 2 item and adding more weight 1 items might yield a better result. So, for each rem, we can check k2 = floor(rem / 2), and k2 - 1, and possibly a few more nearby values.\n\nFor example, check k2 from max(0, floor(rem/2) - 100) to floor(rem/2).\n\nThis way, for each rem, we check up to 200 possibilities, which would be O(200 * m) operations. Since m is up to 3e5, this would be 6e7 operations, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nLet me think about this. For example, if rem is 1e5, then checking 200 values around k_max would be manageable.\n\nSo, this seems like a feasible approach.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items:\n\n- Precompute prefix sums s1 and s2.\n\nFor a given rem:\n\n   max_k2 = min( len(s2), rem // 2 )\n\n   start = max( 0, max_k2 - 200 )\n\n   for k2 in range(start, max_k2 + 1):\n\n       available_weight = rem - 2*k2\n\n       num_s1 = min( len(s1), available_weight )\n\n       current_val = s2[k2] + s1[num_s1]\n\n       update the maximum.\n\nThus, the maximum of these current_vals is the value for this rem.\n\nBut why 200? Well, 200 is a number chosen to balance between accuracy and performance. Perhaps 200 is sufficient for the problem's test cases.\n\nBut how to choose this number? Well, for example, if there are 1e5 weight 2 items, then the optimal k2 could be up to 1e5. However, for a given rem, the max_k2 is rem//2. So, if rem is 3e5, then max_k2 is 1.5e5. Checking from 1.5e5 - 200 to 1.5e5 would take 200 steps. This seems manageable.\n\nBut what if the optimal k2 is much lower than max_k2? For example, if the weight 2 items are not as valuable as the weight 1 items. In that case, the optimal k2 could be zero. However, if we only check up to 200 steps below max_k2, then we might miss it. But in this case, the code would not find the optimal value.\n\nBut this is a problem. How can we ensure that we are checking all possible candidates?\n\nAlternative Idea: For the weight 2 items, the prefix sum s2 is non-decreasing. For the available_weight, the s1 is also non-decreasing. However, available_weight = rem - 2*k2. As k2 increases, available_weight decreases. Thus, the function f(k2) = s2[k2] + s1[ min( available_weight, len(s1) ) ] is not necessarily monotonic. However, for a given rem, the optimal k2 is somewhere in the range of 0 to max_k2.\n\nBut how to find it quickly.\n\nAnother Idea: For a given rem, the best k2 is either the one that maximizes s2[k2] + s1[ ... ] or the one that takes as many weight 1 items as possible. So, for each rem, we can try both possibilities.\n\nBut again, this is not guaranteed to work.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for the weight 2 items and weight 1 items, and for each possible rem, try taking all possible weight 2 items up to the maximum possible, and also take the possibility of taking no weight 2 items.\n\nBut again, this is not sufficient.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think of the weight 1 items as having a value per unit weight. For example, each weight 1 item contributes c_i per 1 unit. The weight 2 items contribute c_j per 2 units. So, for comparing between a weight 2 item and two weight 1 items, we can compare their total value.\n\nIf the weight 2 item's value is greater than the sum of two best weight 1 items, then take it. Otherwise, take the two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to apply this globally.\n\nThis seems similar to the greedy approach of merging the items into a priority queue, where at each step, you take the best available item (either a weight 1 or a weight 2 item). However, this is only applicable for unbounded knapsack, but since each item is taken once, it's not straightforward.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps we can simulate this process.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm for combining weight 1 and 2 items:\n\nInitialize two pointers, i for weight 1 items (starting at 0), j for weight 2 items (starting at 0).\n\nWhile there is capacity left:\n\n   compare the next available weight 1 item (if any) and the next available weight 2 item (if any).\n\n   take the one with higher value.\n\n   subtract the weight from the capacity.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach and may not work for all cases. For example, if taking a weight 2 item now prevents taking two weight 1 items later, which together have higher value.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted in descending order, this approach may work. For example, if the next weight 2 item has higher value than the sum of the next two weight 1 items, then take it. Otherwise, take the two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose weight 1 items are [5, 4, 3], weight 2 items are [9]. Capacity is 3.\n\nThe best option is to take the weight 1 item 5 and 4 (total weight 2, value 9) or take the weight 2 item (value 9, weight 2). But capacity is 3. So we can take the weight 2 item (weight 2) and then take one weight 1 item (5) for total value 14. Alternatively, take all three weight 1 items (sum 5+4+3=12). So the greedy approach would choose the weight 2 item first, then the weight 1 item, giving total 14, which is better.\n\nSo the greedy approach would work in this case.\n\nBut what about a scenario where the best choice is to take two weight 1 items instead of one weight 2 item, but the weight 2 item has higher value than one weight 1 item, but less than two.\n\nFor example: weight 1 items are [3, 3], weight 2 items are [5]. Capacity is 2.\n\nThe best choice is to take two weight 1 items (total 6) instead of the weight 2 item (5). The greedy approach would compare the weight 2 item (5) with the first weight 1 item (3). It would take the weight 2 item, but that leaves no room for the second weight 1 item. So the total is 5, which is worse than 6. Hence, the greedy approach fails here.\n\nSo this shows that the greedy approach is not correct.\n\nThus, this approach is not reliable.\n\nBack to the original Idea of checking a limited number of k2 values around max_k2.\n\nIn the previous example, rem=2, max_k2=1 (for weight 2 items). So checking k2=1 and k2=0 would find that for k2=0, we can take two weight 1 items (3+3=6), and for k2=1, we take 5. So the maximum is 6.\n\nSo, if we check all k2 from 0 to max_k2, then we would get the correct result. But for larger ranges, this could be expensive.\n\nBut in this case, max_k2 is 1, and checking all k2 from 0 to 1 is trivial.\n\nThus, if the number of k2 to check is limited to, say, 200, then for cases where the optimal k2 is within that range, it would work. But for cases where the optimal k2 is further away, it would fail.\n\nBut how likely is that? For example, if the weight 2 items are all very low value, then the optimal k2 would be 0. So, if the code checks up to 200 values around max_k2, but max_k2 is say 1e5, then the code would miss the optimal k2=0.\n\nBut this is a problem. How can we ensure that the code checks all possible k2 values that could be optimal?\n\nPerhaps the solution is to also check the k2 that corresponds to taking as many weight 1 items as possible. For example, in addition to checking around max_k2, also check k2=0.\n\nBut how to decide which ones to check.\n\nAnother Idea: For each rem, the optimal k2 is either:\n\n- 0 (take no weight 2 items)\n\n- max_k2 (take as many as possible)\n\n- or some value in between that can be determined by comparing the marginal gain of adding a weight 2 item and removing weight 1 items.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, check all possible k2 up to a certain number of steps",
